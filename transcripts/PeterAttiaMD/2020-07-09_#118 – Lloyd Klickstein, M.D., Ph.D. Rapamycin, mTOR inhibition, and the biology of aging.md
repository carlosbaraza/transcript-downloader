## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the podcast episode with Lloyd Klickstein:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focused on mTOR inhibition, rapamycin, and their potential role in aging and immune function. Lloyd Klickstein, CSO of resTORbio, discussed groundbreaking research on using rapalogs (rapamycin analogs) to enhance immune function in elderly populations. The conversation centered around two key studies from 2014 and 2018 that demonstrated improved vaccine response and reduced respiratory tract infections in elderly subjects using different dosing strategies of mTOR inhibitors.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- mTOR is the master integrator of nutrient sensing and growth signals in cells [00:45:00]
- Rapamycin binds to FKBP proteins before binding to mTOR complex 1 [01:15:00]
- Different doses and timing of mTOR inhibition produce different effects on immunity [01:30:00]
- Older animals lose ability to suppress mTOR during fasting compared to young animals [01:45:00]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Intermittent dosing of mTOR inhibitors may be more beneficial than continuous dosing [01:20:00]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Lower doses of rapalogs may be more beneficial for immune function than higher doses [01:25:00]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- RAD001 (everolimus) at 0.5mg daily or 5mg weekly showed benefits [00:55:00]
- RTB101 (experimental compound) at 10mg daily showed promise [02:00:00]
- Rapamycin dosing considerations discussed [01:10:00]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"Everything in me in my world comes down to just anthropomorphizing the immune system" - Peter Attia [01:35:00]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What is the optimal cycling period for rapamycin/rapalogs?
2. How do tissue-specific effects of mTOR inhibition differ?
3. What is the relationship between fasting and mTOR inhibition in humans?
4. How do different rapalogs compare in terms of selective mTOR complex 1 inhibition?

The episode provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of mTOR inhibition and its potential therapeutic applications in aging and immune function. The discussion highlights both the progress made in understanding these pathways and the many questions that remain to be answered.

[00:00:01] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia this podcast my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness full stop and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level at the end of this episode i'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to peteratiamd.com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode [Music] i guess this week is lloyd clicksteen lloyd's the chief scientific officer at restore piyo so that's little r e s big t o r little b i o get it tor tor restore bio is a clinical stage bio farm company that develops meds that are primarily aimed at targeting tor target of rapamycin we'll talk a lot about that throughout this episode so prior to joining restore bio lloyd was the global head of translational medicine for the new indication discovery unit at novartis and prior to that he was an academic physician at the brigham and women's hospital which is one of the flagship programs at harvard lloyd received his bachelor's from tufts and an md phd from harvard he's got more accolades than you could shake a stick at so accolades aside the reason i wanted to speak with lloyd was because he is really one of the few people on this planet that has a really nuanced understanding of the clinical application of rapamycin and rapid logs and we talk a lot about one of them in particular called avarolamus lloyd was the senior author on a paper that i have spoken about many times on this podcast which we'll go into in great detail here a december 2014 paper john manick was the lead author on that paper and that was the study that was basically the turning point in my personal evolution or thinking when it came to the use of rapamycin for the purpose of longevity prior to that there had been a lot of studies that had certainly suggested in animal models that rapamycin could be a true longevity agent but it was the manic clickstein paper of december 2014 that was the real turning point in my thinking and that's really where we're going in this discussion along with talking about all that's been done since then it is important before we start this interview that i mentioned of course that lloyd is an employee of restore bio restore bio is a for-profit company that is working on mtor inhibition so please caveat everything that we discuss through that lens before this podcast begins i want to note that we recorded this interview in september 2019 now in the interview we discussed an upcoming phase 3 trial from restore bio since that time the results have been published and the study did not meet its primary endpoint now i frankly left the option to lloyd as to whether or not he wanted to still have the podcast there and he felt that that would be fine to do and so we're going to go ahead with it and eventually i'm going to be interviewing his colleague joan manik along with near barzel i'm going to have the two of them back on an episode where we're going to discuss a whole bunch of things that'll be quite interesting and this gets more complicated because i think i have a pretty clear understanding of why that study failed and what it does and doesn't say about selective inhibition of agents like it nevertheless i think the most logical thing to do is to go ahead and proceed with this interview which is one of my favorite interviews on this subject matter and just know that they're going to be a number of things that are left as open-ended questions from this discussion that we're going to pick back up with joan manik when we do that interview which i'm scheduled to do a few weeks from now and hopefully we'll try to get that one out at a much quicker turnaround there were a number of issues that delayed the release of this not the least of which being some of the coveted stuff but i can promise you that there will be a shorter gap between when you are hearing this and you will hear the follow-up to this than there was between the recording of this and when you're hearing it and without further delay please enjoy my conversation with lloyd clicksteen [Music] lloyd thank you so much for making the trip up to san francisco today i know you didn't come here specifically to see me but i appreciate you carving out a little extra time to meet today i'm happy to be here and looking forward to our talk i hope the view is enticing enough here it's lovely when the weather is nice in san francisco there are a few things that compare to it and when it's not it's like mark twain said right the worst winter he ever had was a summer in san francisco or something in that effect you're from boston so you laugh at that right now this is the weather we all wish we had in boston yeah so tim wright one of your colleagues offered to make this introduction over dinner one night and there's probably never been in the history of an introduction from the moment the intro was offered until i was sitting down talking to someone on a podcast that was quicker than this one in other words i'm sorry to hear that actually well it was just meaning i was so excited when we sat there and it was so is with tim and with d.a wallach who some folks listening will know because i've interviewed d.a on the podcast as well and we were having this dinner and as it's always the case when i'm talking with dorky science friends rapamycin comes up and one thing led to another and then i'm embarrassed to say this but the 2014 paper that i talk about constantly i always refer to as the manic paper because she's of course the first author but you're sort of the lead author you're the final author you're the senior author on that paper and so i was embarrassed to say this i didn't even when they mentioned your name i didn't put two and two together and i didn't know you were at restore bio at the time either so anyway they connected us we communicated over email the rest is history we're sitting here today and i am beyond excited and this is a topic that i just know listeners are dying to hear about because it's been over a year since i've had a podcast on this topic so very early in this podcast which is about a year and a half ago we had discussions with david sabatini and with matt caberland who were both amazing folks and legends in this area as well so i'm going to discipline myself for a moment before getting right into the rapa stuff to give a little bit of background you've got a pretty interesting background i want to hear a little bit about it when did you realize this is what you wanted to do which was be basically physician scientist and then ultimately now move into industry well i guess i can begin by stating that science and medicine is the family business so it wasn't much of a stretch for me to be here doing what i'm doing now doing what i've done before on both sides of my family both sides of my kids family all of my kids are scientists doctors or both so did you do a combined md phd or did you do them separately i did the combined one my wife did them separately actually the long and expensive way yeah exactly at least when you do them together they pay for each other yeah when did you decide you wanted to focus on immunology rheumatology i mean that there's no shortage of things one can specialize in one of at least my challenges and i know the challenge of many physicians and many scientists is that so many things are interesting how do you focus and like many things in life it was about the people not the science that led me into immunology rheumatology and where i am when i had left college and wasn't sure where i was going to go next i spent a couple of years working in a laboratory at brigham and women's hospital i had such an incredible time and met such wonderful people that ultimately my decision was to stay there and work with them learn from them what years were you at the brigham i worked in a technical capacity from 79 to 81 started medical school in 81 and finished both degrees by 1989 and then stayed there through all of my training and then left in 2006 to join actually tim wright's department at novartis institutes what prompted that decision and is that a one-way street for most people there are people who go back and forth but i think we have to be realistic that it's more challenging to go back to academia if you don't have extant grants and external funding it has to come from somewhere in most places in terms of what drove the decision i'm a physician scientist for me it's important to do both science and medicine and it's harder and harder and harder to do that now in an academic environment at least i'll get in trouble for saying this but at least a primitive academic environment like harvard where you eat what you kill and you have to at the same time see patients be at the top of not just your game but the world's game in seeing patients and administrative and teaching responsibilities and so forth well i mean let harvard get upset at you for saying that but i mean there's no denying what you're saying is the case every i interview so many people who are straddling that and i'm constantly amazed in fact i was interviewing someone recently a very remarkable scientist and academic and i couldn't believe how much clinical obligation he had and yet how prolific he was it's sort of amazing to me that some folks can actually straddle that it's certainly not optimal i guess is the point no and it was much more challenging than i had seen in the late 70s and early 80s what changed is the reduction in grant the competitiveness of the grant environment or no it wasn't so much the grant environment it was more the regulation and the paperwork that was imposed mostly on the clinical side i need to be fair and say i was both running from something and running to something as a physician scientist the goal is to have each of them contribute to the other and translational medicine which was a new concept around the turn of the millennium was growing and was perfect for somebody like me novartis institutes was created by mark fishman in the early 2000s as a new concept in a new approach to drug development thinking about pathway biology and they were building translational medicine departments and tim recruited me to lead the musculoskeletal one so maybe explain to folks the difference between basic science clinical science for clinical research and translational research which as you said the latter there being a relatively recent phenomenon lots of examples of basic science one that's pretty exciting and has led to nobel prizes is the study of restriction enzymes who thought that studying obscure bacteria and how they limit their infection by viruses might have led to the concept of restriction enzymes which was required for the development of modern molecular biology another one of basic science you've probably talked about crispr technology here we haven't had a dedicated podcast to it and i'd love to get jennifer on to do so but please continue yeah that's a great example i'll give you a one minute summary it is another critical element of the bacterial immune system it's simple it's elegant it's powerful and there were scientists in europe studying fermentation for yogurt and cheese and they discovered crispr jennifer doudna and colleagues here mit and the broad institute and they were studying basic science they were studying bacterial biology and it became so exciting when somebody translated the biochemistry if you will in the bacteria to see would it work in humans who would have thought that would work bacterial chromatin in the dna is so different it's super coiled in a bacterial cell whereas human dna is organized into chromatin and methylated but it did so the point here is basic science isn't necessarily in pursuit of anything beyond knowledge but it doesn't come with the caveat of this needs to have a clinical application with respect to the species of interest exactly right clinical medicine i think everybody knows it's getting your flu shot in the fall it's being told the diet and exercise and take your antihypertensives if they've been prescribed right does taking this medication lower your risk of a stroke does taking this vaccine lower your risk of getting the flu exactly and translational medicine there's a big gap between those two isn't there yes and that's what translational medicine does people had been doing this for a long time but never in an organized and conceptually holistic way if i could say that it's how do you take a basic science observation and make something useful for human health out of it and prove it which is surprisingly challenging so you're saying that basically up until roughly 20 years ago this hasn't been particularly well organized and now pharma companies among others are saying we'd like to own some of this risk i think everybody has bought into the concept of translational medicine now probably all big pharma companies and many small ones do it many academic institutions have organizations to do translational medicine it's in part our responsibility it's in part a way to do it more efficiently by providing appropriate training and experience to younger scientists we always have to think back to who's funding our basic science especially in academia ultimately it's the people most heavily taxpayer-funded yes it's most heavily taxpayer-funded and the reason they're doing it is to make their lives better or the lives of their family and friends better and we need to be better at that and i think this is taking a step in that direction so what was the first translational problem then you began to work on when you join of artists in the what would have been i guess the 90s right it was in the early 2000s so i joined a musculoskeletal program at the time novartis was working on it was a regenerative medicine concept and musculoskeletal biology to increase bone density and increase muscle strength and so we had to put together some programs that would translate some basic biology observations from human genetics remember translation can go both ways and in fact to skip ahead a little bit we actually did that from that 2014 paper we took what we learned there and went back into the mouse and there were a few projects the one that has been successful is a drug called zoledronic acid to increase bone density and what was the state of assets that you came into did novartis already have a basic program that had shown some new insight with respect to biology that could then be extrapolated into a compound did they already have the compound what was the actual program you were creating at that time novartis worked very much like most other pharmaceutical companies did there was a basic science department led by phd scientists there was a clinical development organization led by clinical developers including mds and there was a throw it over the wall mentality the scientists make something that they like and they throw it over to the clinical scientists and they have to figure out what to do with it this is pre-ind yes okay we should explain what an indian i suppose is yeah do you want to tell folks about that sure so an ind is stands for investigational new drug and this is the application that sponsors make to the fda to get permission to begin clinical trials and there are a whole raft of requirements that are necessary in terms of quality manufacturing clinical plans risks and benefits experiments and so forth so that we can make it as safe as possible to test something new in people but in any event that's the way novartis worked as they separated research from clinical development other companies did it a little differently they had the initial testing and healthy volunteers or the initial testing in patients depending on the risk benefit argument as part of the research organization but in principle it's the same thing you had scientists making medicines and then clinicians testing them the goal of translational medicine is to provide clinical input right at the very beginning of the process even when you're thinking about what to do and it really helps to focus the drug development process on the patients and the clinical need right from the beginning so that ultimately the drug that's made is the drug that's needed not let's make something and figure out what we can do with it let's figure out what we need and then make it is there evidence by the way this is a bit of a tangent but that that transition has rendered pharma more efficient at yielding capital this is studied in an anonymized fashion by an industry organization it varies by company i see so let's fast forward a little bit to the first time you became involved in a molecule that would be involved in a nutrient sensing pathway what was your foray into that there's a step before that and that is how did i get from musculoskeletal disease to something new we have to credit again mark fishman who was the founder of the novartis institutes for this because he challenged me and a few others to put together an organization within the company and answer the question what aren't we doing that we should be doing and then start some projects and again it's all about medical need and of course scientific tractability so we started that project we called it the new indication discovery unit what year is this roughly mid-2000 this would have been about 2008 or 9. we basically applied those principles a real medical need a problem that's scientifically tractable and that novartis wasn't working on an ideally that nobody was working on and we ended up with a few very interesting areas joan manik who was the first author on that 2014 paper brought the idea forward well maybe the biology of aging is tractable but how do we actually make a medicine and develop it that was joan at novartis at this time yes she joined our group in part to do this her real innovation beyond just the ideas that she figured out a way to test a medicine that could alter the biology of aging in humans and find an endpoint that's measurable and modifiable in a reasonable time frame which really is the achilles heel of aging research which is the ultimate outcome is virtually unmeasurable in the species of interest yes so our approach is not necessarily what you might read in the popular press about making medicines for aging our approach is to address serious aging associated diseases and if we're successful the side effect will be longevity yeah so keep going then now joan floats this idea which is here's a really good proxy for aging that can be measured out in the time course that's clinically tractable and also frankly amenable to the type of research that we can do in humans and so what was your aha moment this is interesting as in this is interesting to lloyd i needed and beyond interesting to lloyd we then as a team had to persuade the rest of the organization hey let's try this idea and again we always come back to the medical need scientific tractability and in proposing a project what's the evidence that it's going to be successful and you know as well as anybody there's substantial scientific data that mtor inhibition will extend health span in many preclinical species certainly all the ones that have been tested now that was not obvious in 2008 i mean 2009 people had been speculating of course there was a major publication that came out in 2009 i have to correct the time frame we started our new indication discovery unit in 2008 or 9. i think jones started the project in 2010. got it so you already had a very important study behind you yes as a catalyst for that let's take a step back now and explain because it's been a while and there's going to be people listening who don't recall all the details of our discussion with david sabatini and with matt caberland let's talk about what is mtor sure well i can't add anything to david sabatini about what mtars nobody can but let's assume people have not heard what david has to say sure in a nutshell mtor is the master integrator of external availability of nutrients and growth factors and then is the master regulator of the outputs of that integration deciding whether cells are going to make proteins make lipids make nucleic acids grow or are we going to circle the wagons conserve resources recycle and wait during times of little for hopefully future times of plenty so that's the role of mtor so it takes a bunch of signals which are external to the cell ultimately become internal to the cell because mtor is in the cell not out of the cell it assimilates and integrates across that signal and makes decisions that lead to as you said at the risk of oversimplifying grow or don't grow yes i think that's exactly right the signals it takes are amino acids glucose cellular energy growth factors from other parts of the organism as probably the major ones and then decides are there sufficient resources that the cell should grow or not and between this is just a little history lesson for the listener sort of between 1991 when hall first identified what was not called at the time tor but what would go on to become tor in yeast and 94 when sabatini identifies it in mammals you basically had some of the just the heaviest hitters in biology all sort of converging on this idea which is this is a really ubiquitous thing that has been preserved across about a billion years of evolution with very little change you don't see that every day in biology why is that relevant the simplest argument is that things that have been conserved from single cell organisms to us are probably important there's some interesting comparative zoology that's relevant to mtor here if you think about where in the cell mtor lives it's active on something called a lysosome and that is a structure in the cells that's responsible for breaking down either cellular material or material that's been acquired from outside the cell into its component elements that then could be recycled like amino acids and sugars and so forth very early in development well in evolutionary biology when there were single-celled organisms and then the early multiple cellular organisms the way that the organism ate was by creating a vacuole from whatever was on the outside and then creating a lysosome so we can sort of picture this endocytotic process as the the cell membrane or wall depending on what if it's eukaryotic or prokaryotic sort of sucks in a little bit which creates basically a space and then the outer parts of that wall reach up reach around it and can actually seal and now you've created like a vacuole that you pull into the cell yes and in the early multicellular organisms there were specialized cells for doing this and they were called phagocytes for eating cells later on it was learned that phagocytes could also serve an immunologic role in other words that they could eat pathogens as well as nutrients this happened in the late 1800s when higher quality microscopes were available a russian scientist named ilya mechnikov did a lot of the pioneering work on this he was working in paris and he described he was an embryologist and comparative zoologist and he described by looking at small animals that were completely transparent so he could see all the cells inside and what they were doing he actually imaged them while they were alive and he could watch them eat and he could watch them fight bacterial infections and he was a major champion of something called cellular immunity at the same time some german scientists notably paul ehrlich were working on what we now understand is antibodies and they said no it's humoral or immunity or soluble immunity in your blood and they had the cellular immunologists in paris and we had the humeral immunologists in germany eventually they figured out they were both right and they both got the nobel prize in 1908 but this is why mtor is probably on a lysosomal vacuole because in the context of evolutionary development it was on these vacuoles that very simplest organisms used to ingest food and nutrients and so you want to have it close to because it's there to sense those things you want to have it very close to where they enter the cell yes exactly so if we take a given eukaryotic cell today take one of our cells how many mtor complexes would exist in a cell what order of magnitude i'd turf that question to david sabatini i don't think i've ever asked david that question i don't know i would guess it would be on the order of thousands not millions not tens so one of the other things that david's done is not just recognizing this in mammals but also recognizing that mtor which again it's one of those things that's funny when you start to explain it to people because you can't explain what mtor is without somewhere explaining what rapamycin is given the name mtor stands for mechanistic target of rapamycin but david also played the fundamental role in elucidating that mtor can be organized in a couple of different ways and sort of two main different ways it can be organized known as complex one and complex two explain a little bit about what those two mean how do they organize differently and perhaps more importantly is there a functional difference between those sure so in yeast there are two separate tor proteins one and two and in i think all other species there's just one mtor protein and it can be assembled into two different complexes one of them or called torque one for target of rapamycin complex one regulates many of the things we've been talking about so protein synthesis lipid biosynthesis protein translation and so forth the other complex torque 2 regulates cytoskeletal so in other words the skeleton of the cells organization and growth decisions so different now this is sort of interesting so let's talk about rapamycin now how does rapamycin interact with tor its target that's an excellent question because you think about tor being the target of rapamycin it's not exactly the target of rapamycin is an immunofillin called fk binding proteins or fkbp and there's several of these there's three different classes of immunophyllans the complex of rapamycin bound to fkbp then binds to the torq1 complex and inhibits it and it inhibits it in different ways for different downstream targets the one that's most commonly measured is something called phosphos6 kinase which name's not important it's just this is the protein translation pathway and it's very efficient at inhibiting that a little less so for another target called 4ebp 1 and even less so for a target called ulk1 which is involved in activating the cells recycling machinery called autophagy in other words let's go through that again so rapamycin binds and how tightly does it bind by the way pretty tightly so binds pretty tightly to this binding protein this binding protein then moves towards tor and in the case of did we explain raptor and richter yet we haven't explained those guys do you want to spend maybe just a minute so that they can see the difference between complex one and complex two so mtor is present in both torque 1 and torque 2 complex but there are proteins that are unique to each complex so as you were saying the yeast have two different tor everything else has the same tor but it's another binding protein it's another protein bound to it that creates the distinction between complex one and two correct exactly and we should qualify every organism we've looked at as only one m tour i'm sure we haven't looked at all of them so raptor and richter again discovered in david sabatini's group raptor is unique to torque one complex and richter is unique to the torque ii complex and they're covalently bound to tor i don't think it's covalent okay so it's some sort of conformational configuration but not necessarily well it's a multi-subunit complex but i think they bind on the basis of having a fairly large surface of interaction not covalent and then the complex to get back to the fkbp of fkbp plus rapamycin then binds to the torq1 complex and inhibits it but again it inhibits it very well for some of the downstream pathways and not so well for some of the others and let's review again those three so the first one that binds really well the serine phosphate is which one there's the binding interaction of the rapamyce and fkbp to torque one yes and then that alters the torque one downstream activity it inhibits quite effectively phosphorylation of s6 kinase s6 is a critical protein in the ribosome required for protein translation it works a little less well for a protein called 4ebp1 which is an inhibitor of protein translation so you inhibit the inhibitor and you activate protein translation and it's less effective at phosphorylating ulk1 which is an early step in the activation of the cell recycling machinery called autophagy the interpretation of that is as following rapamycin is a strong inhibitor of making new protein and a modest activator of autophagy exactly is that a fair statement yeah i think that's a fair statement we're talking about these pathways as specific examples remember torque one does other things too particularly in terms of regulation of lipid synthesis pyrimidine synthesis pyrimidines are part of dna what about m torque 2 so how does rappa and fkbp bind to mtor complex 2 i don't think it does directly because there's no immediate effect of the complex on torque 2 activity if you look at the downstream targets they're not affected in the short term there's a longer term feedback inhibition of torque 2. and is that more due to the failure to re-synthesize enough tor is there a shortfall of tor because so much of the tor is bound to the rapa fkbp complex that you now run out of enough tor to make mtor complex two you could imagine that is one possibility but i don't think that's the case i think it's more there's a feedback signaling pathway that down regulates torque too what you said is very important and we're going to come back to it in great detail but there's something temporal about this isn't there yes do we know how much exposure to rapamycin or arapalog is necessary constitutive exposure before you start to see this dual prong of inhibition are we talking about a day two days three days a month i know you had david sinclair on recently yeah and i listened to your talk with him he talks about mouse experiments my bias is to talk about people experiments given my role in humans after a week to a month you can start to see consequences of torque 2 inhibition with arapalog alone and it's reflected in hyperglycemia and hypertroglyceridemia so biomarkers in the peripheral blood you can measure why is it that inhibition of mtorq 2 leads to that phenotype you just described i don't think we know exactly does it confirm that that phenotype exists in healthy volunteers in other words we see this for sure in patients who take rapamycin or its analogs in the context of organ transplantation but if we took non-diabetic non-immuno-compromised quote-unquote as normal as possible subjects do we have evidence that those things happen we do mtor inhibitors well wrapalog specifically have been tested in non-transplant non-malignant disease patients some specific examples include the wrapalog rad001 was tested in patients with polycystic kidney disease these people are basically well except for that renal disease and even in those patients there were a substantial fraction who saw these biochemical changes in their blood now not everybody gets it we don't understand that either do we know what the dose equivalence was of rad001 versus rapamycin in other words they were getting it daily do you recall at what dose did you start to see this consequence that was a phase three study it's published so you could look it up if i recall the dose was 10 milligrams a day and i think they had an opportunity to decrease the dose to five milligrams if it wasn't tolerated is rad001 identical to rapamycin and dosing what's the dose equivalence no again it's hard to do an exact dose equivalence because the biochemistry of how exactly the complex works with the mtor complex is a little different but if your rapamycin dose is somewhere between two and eight milligrams a day roughly at the immunosuppression level of dosing which is what we're talking about that's comparable to five to ten milligrams of red zero zero one got it so they're pretty similar but not identical yes so let's put a bow on this particular question and then take a step backwards is it safe to say that most of the inhibition of mtor complex 2 seems to produce things that are not really desirable at all whereas the output of an mtor complex one inhibition pathway seems quite desirable at least sometime yes and in fact most genetic experiments have supported that conclusion let's talk a little bit about those experiments so if you genetically knock out raptor so that you no longer have complex one but you still have mtor and richter so therefore you have complex two what does that animal look like depends on how you do it if you imagine making a mouse that doesn't have raptor one which means it doesn't have torque complex one from conception i assume it has muscular dystrophy or something like that if they're embryonic lethal yeah okay you need torque one for development so if you just turn it down by some amount 50 reduction not much of a phenotype of that but the way the experiments have been done is you can conditionally knock out a target in a mouse experiment so you can create an experiment where the mouse is normal and is born and develops normally and then when the mouse is a young adult you can knock out raptor or knock out torque 1. so once they're out of the development window and they've reached adult size then it's better tolerated yeah and again david sabatini has done a lot of these experiments his group published a nice paper not that long ago where they knocked out several components of the torque 1 complex inhibition of torque 1 extends life span and health span and rodents if you do that to torque 2 it accelerates death such an interesting concept i mean because what it basically suggests is at least with the tool that we currently have to block tor which is like rapamycin or rapidlog giving intermittent dosing may be beneficial giving constant dosing may cancel out the benefit i don't it's hard to know because when you give it constantly you and you're getting the quote unquote good inhibition and the bad inhibition you don't know what the net effect is right if you're using a wrapalog with continuous administration yes you'll eventually down regulate torque 2 as well and as far as we know that's not favorable there are some other ways to do this and joan manic's second paper from 2018 was the first time we've explored that in humans i want to come back to the 2018 paper but i want to build up to the 2014 paper in 2009 this mouse study comes out it was the first of what would become a series of very interesting highly reproduced itps funded by nih that sort of did something we didn't typically see which is consistently across multiple labs and across different strains show the same result a lot of times in biology you just don't get that you get the one hit wonder and it doesn't work in any other model or in any other lab and that's not because people were nefarious it's just there's some very very particular niche sort of circumstances that are being exploited that we don't even understand that didn't seem to be the case in rapamycin on a personal level by 2009 i am now very interested in this compound but i don't know what to make of it because i remember being a resident at the hospital giving lots of ceromas a rap immune to transplant patients along with their prednisone and their other immunosuppressive drugs and there didn't seem to be anything about that that seemed to be longevity producing it didn't make sense that you could suppress the immune system and somehow reduce death seem counterintuitive i mean in the transplant patient it made sense because of course their greatest risk is by far organ rejection but these animal studies were not replicating that so i remember being incredibly confused for about the next five years how did you guys start thinking about that problem inside novartis joan proposed the idea and again the real innovation was being able to recognize that i'm doing air quotes for the listeners age of the immune system is something that's measurable and potentially modifiable in a reasonable time frame and we had that paper from chen in science cell signaling that showed a short course of arapalog could alter the biology of lymphocytes and you're saying that in a favorable way not a disfavorable yes because the earliest observations of syren seagal were that lymphocytes being highly proliferative were heavily targeted by rapamycin it's all about the dose yeah so let's talk about those doses as you alluded to earlier a transplant patient might be taking five milligrams a day of rapamycin day in and day out what types of doses were you seeing that were producing this counterintuitive phenotype well if we get back to the mouse paper yeah yeah exactly like lower or higher i guess is what i'm saying relative to that it's hard to compare is you have to look at exposures so the doses on a weight basis or a body cell they're much higher much higher in a rodent experiment but the exposures can be comparable they were actually fairly high in his paper they were at least equal to what we what we use in transplant obviously we couldn't do that in healthy volunteers especially healthy elderly volunteers there was some additional information that gave us some confidence we could use much lower doses than what was used in transplant patients yielding much lower exposures and for the listeners exposures means how much of the drug is actually in your body over time so let's use cialis as an example of this i don't know why but it's just i was talking to a patient about this the other day cialis is typically given as either 5 milligrams or 20 milligrams and patients typically have a choice if they want to take 20 milligrams quote unquote on demand so you're heading into the weekend you're going away with your wife it's friday you take the 20 milligrams of cialis and erectile dysfunction is ameliorated friday through sunday conversely another way to take cialis is to take five milligrams every single day whether or not you're going to be sexually active or not but now all of a sudden any time you want to be sexually active you're functionally like that person who just took 20. use the lingo of exposure to explain how those two things are comparable i don't know why this is somehow the first example came to my mind but probably just because it was a discussion i had two days ago it's actually a good example because when you take the medicine doesn't always reflect if the medicine is in your body or not and medicines that work have to be in your body to work so the five milligram dose of cialis taken once might be in your body for a day a 20 milligram dose of cyalis taken once is in your body for two to three days so it's why the higher dose taken once can last over the even long weekend perhaps because it's still there this we call in in drug development a half-life of the drug so the half-life of cialis is long enough that it can do that that is not the case for viagra for example that's right now there's another interesting thing here which will also be another we'll have a parallel to the rapa story which is generally patients will tolerate 5 milligrams daily of cialis more than 20 milligrams on demand because of the side effects you have fewer side effects because you don't have the same peak levels so 5 milligrams daily will produce a very consistent and narrow gap between peak and trough which is therapeutic whereas 20 will overshoot you'll get a very high peak level which may increase the side effects light-headedness changes in vision things like that and then you have a long enough way down before you hit trough and it's during that entire window that you have the availability of the effect of the drug now that's true for the class of drugs the phosphodiesterase inhibitor yeah e5 inhibitors it's not true for other drugs two specific examples uh rapamycin where if you remember when you were treating your transplant patients you measured trough we measured yet daily i mean we were constantly doing this but you measured the trough levels that's right because the side effects are driven by the trough levels as well as the efficacy and i think that's also true with gentamicin and a lot of the negative the antibiotics that have the same toxicities on the trough right yes so genomicin years ago we used to dose three times a day on modern times we dose it once a day and we get better efficacy and far fewer side effects so why is that the case that a drug like gentamicin or rapamycin is producing toxicity by its nader not its peak every drug is different and it depends on the specific mechanism for gentamicin and aminoglycosides in general remember these work on the bacterial ribosome and there's some congruency between mitochondrial ribosomes and bacterial ribosomes and with sustained inhibition that can cause toxicity particularly in the kidney and the tubular epithelial cells also in inner ear hair cells and some other places so having some drug free time seems to allow the organelles to recover at least that's the hypothesis i heard in medical school we all know that half of what we learned in medical school is wrong and they just weren't sure which half you had a better medical school than me i think 90 of what i learned in medical school is wrong but you went to harvard i only went to stanford so i think that's the west coast east coast difference no i think that's i mean to me that is the most logical argument which is drugs that have trough toxicity are drugs where you must have a break from the drug and the higher the trough the lower the probability of a break peak drugs aren't about time away it's literally too much of this thing eventually hits a trigger that's probably an oversimplification but it's a useful conceptual framework so let's now taking that model back the first glimmer of hope that this drug had wasn't uniformly immune suppressing was well what if we dose this lower basically and not from the standpoint of side effects because that's a common reason you'd go lower but actually change the profile of inhibition was it known at the time that that's what they were trying to do like did they have enough insight into how rapamycin bound to the two different complexes to test this hypothesis proactively or was this more empirical an observation that after the fact the mechanism became elucidated we had some information up front one bit of information that the mechanism could be favorable for immune function not solely immunosuppressive was looking again in your transplant patients and those who were on a calcineurin inhibitor versus those who were on a wrapalog and there was a significant trend that those on rapologs had fewer cytomegalovirus infections than those on calcineurin inhibitors all of the things being equal an observational study not as well controlled as ideally we would like but it was intriguing do you remember the order of magnitude on that difference so you're basically talking about fk 506 versus cyclosporine yeah yeah well it was rapamycin versus cyclosporine or fk right maybe i don't remember we'd have to go back and look so that was item one item two is we had done exposure response experiments in cellular systems looking at how much drug is required to inhibit the downstream targets of torque one and it was much much lower than the exposures that are observed in the usual dosing framework of rapamycin at least for transplant and immunosuppression if we were going to be treating healthy people with arapalog and test whether their immune function was better we couldn't be giving them a typical rapalog side effect and this is again a critical element of the translational medicine that joan did in order to make this proposal is what doses and what schedule would be required to keep the trough levels actually less than assay which would be as safe as we could get it plus nonetheless achieve adequate exposures to at least partially or temporarily fully inhibit torque one that would let us ask the question let's now pause for a moment to explain we've switched back and forth between the term rapamycin and wrap a log so again a little bit of a history lesson but rapamycin is the name given by syren seagal to the compound identified on easter island that went through two companies before being eventually absorbed by pfizer through wyeth and that was a drug named rapamune or serolimus and that was fda approved in 1999 for transplantation what was the first rapa log to come along arguably it's rapamycin the next drug yeah sorry semantics aside yeah after yeah yeah after rap immune rapamycin serolamis we're talking about the experiment that we're about to discuss in detail is using a different molecule it's using a different molecule we called it rad001 in the paper the generic name is everolimus it was the second one temp cerelimus is another one how does it differ from rapamune or ceromas there's small structural changes and it was synthesized to be different versus discovered in nature or was it deliberately modified presumably yes again to improve the properties of the compound has that borne out i mean obviously there's an ip reason one would do that obviously but in terms of clinical efficacy are there differences i'm not aware of any comparative studies in vitro potency seems to be a little greater i can tell you from firsthand experience looking at the cost of these drugs there certainly is a difference good lord yes it's generic versus brand i think at this point still but even rap immune branded compared to but anyway i am not somebody who can talk about drug costs yeah yeah well it's one of the most comical things i've ever seen actually so let's now talk about this experiment i'll tell you from my vantage point the day i'll never forget which is i remember getting an embargoed copy on the day before christmas so it's wednesday december 24th it's probably noon it's funny i was in my office which is dumb why was i in my office at noon on wednesday the day before christmas i certainly shouldn't have been but i remember being in my office and i remember how sunny it was i remember what a beautiful day it was and i remember someone from the new york times emailing me the embargoed copy and it's embargoed yeah i was embargoed for another couple of hours the person at the times who sent it to me knew how interested i was in the subject matter and i'm reading this thing and i'm like this is unbelievable i just couldn't believe what i was reading and i have a background in immunology so of course i can understand what these figures are showing give people a sense of how long it takes to get there so if the public is first seeing this in december of 2014 when did the experiment start and i didn't mean that conceptually like i don't just mean you're enrolling patients like this is a about a four or five year journey right that's right about 2010 we started so what was the hypothesis that you wanted to test and that you joan and the team wanted to test there was some pre-work before we could ask the question the pre-work was one we reviewed the existing literature we especially that paper from chen and we then looked at some other work that had looked at drug levels in cellular systems necessary to partially or fully inhibit the target and we had to look at a lot of different cells because torque ones biology while in the big pictures the same in different cells the sensitivity of the complex to the drug is different in different cells and we have some hypotheses now for why that is and we then did some modeling to understand whether the low doses and we looked at internal data that the company had to see could we come up with a low dose and a schedule that would yield exposures in people that would partially or fully inhibit torque 1 yet give less than assay trough levels to help ensure safety in the healthy volunteers now lloyd was this mostly because at the time you wanted to see if it even made sense to pursue a new molecule entirely that would inhibit complex one or so-called selective inhibition but the idea is why go down that path of doing that without a proof of concept that says it works or did you think at that point in time if we can get this to work you would never need a selective m torque 1 inhibitor you're asking really for novartis thinking that's probably still confidential but the big picture is we want to know if something works we want to figure out if we can make it better again ultimately novartis we at restore bio and hopefully everybody at a pharmaceutical company is thinking about how can we make patients lives better and then everything else is important but secondary to that and then what do we measure what dose do we use how frequently do we give it how long do we treat people how do we answer the question clearly what do we measure all of those questions had to be answered and they had to be answered before joan brought the program to the decision board of the company to say give us a lot of money to do this experiment each of these clinical experiments cost millions of dollars and at the time rad001 was fda approved for another indication or no yes it was already approved in cancer or in i think it was in renal cell rcc yeah yeah okay so that only raises the stakes of what you're asking because you're taking a drug that's already gone through phase three and you're gonna spend a lot of money on it that you technically don't need to spend is that a common thing to do inside of a company as large as novartis to take a drug that basically you're trying to make the case for a totally different use yes i'd suspect most companies do things like this where when a drug is registered in one indication if you can find others it's a good thing so i mean for the sake of time i will just i mean basically say that you guys did something kind of amazing which is with so little human data you did a great job of identifying the right patient population identifying the right primary outcome identifying a correct power analysis so you wouldn't miss the signal so in other words you didn't know how to power the study which means you had to have a sense of how much the benefit was going to be knowing how long to pulse how to dose i mean this could have gone sideways six other ways it could have we had some additional help too at the time novartis had a vaccines group and they had commercialized a flu vaccine so we knew a lot about flu vaccination and responses required for making a clinical difference and so forth so let's walk people through the study design you've got what about 300 people aged 60 plus morals i think it was 218 in that 214 paper everybody was over 65 no unstable medical conditions and were these subjects all in australia was there something about this that was australian well because this was a flu vaccination so let's just skip ahead the end point of the study the primary endpoint by which we were going to decide did the study work or not work was the response to a flu vaccination the seasonal flu now because it's a seasonal vaccine we had to do the study when we were ready wherever in the world people were about to get their flu vaccines in that paper we were ready for the southern hemisphere because our summer is there winter right and since the cvs in the antarctica ran out of vaccine that year australia made the most sense australia and new zealand yeah so there are four arms in this study there's a placebo arm that gets just obviously a placebo there's three treatment arms one that gets .5 milligrams of rad001 daily so everolimus there's a group that's getting five milligrams once a week and there's a group that's getting 20 milligrams once a week so it's a clever design because the five and the twenty that are both getting it once a week gives you a great you get to answer both efficacy and toxicity questions as they pertain to that dose the 0.5 daily versus the five weekly is your closest aggregate dose where you get to see is there a difference in trough so overall a lot of interesting stuff what was your personal null hypothesis not necessarily the same but do you recall what your null hypothesis was going into that experiment i mean obviously the null hypothesis is that there's no drug effect yeah sorry what was your first alternative hypothesis i guess is a better way to say it this was a little bit less hypothesis testing the way that academic investigators work than it was asking questions and the question was and there were several but at a high level it's can we see an improved vaccine response at an acceptable level of toxicity that would have this drug make sense and that's the high level question and you went through the doses and schedules we used and we tested three different ones because each of those doses did a different thing to torque 1 inhibition the 0.5 milligram dose partially inhibited in a sustained fashion the 5 milligram once a week fully inhibited torque 1 for a couple days out of the week and the 20 milligrams we modeled would fully inhibit torque 1 over the dosing interval i didn't realize that actually 20 is so high that it gave you functionally non-stop inhibition of m torque 1 until your next dose did any of these have m torque 2 inhibition i would have expected the 20 milligram would have i don't remember that anyone had to discontinue the drug for that reason but it's been a couple years since i read that paper well let's look at the toxicity table so table one of this paper which is again such an interesting paper i was surprised obviously was the first thing i looked at usually table one is inclusion criteria or something like that but you guys just skipped the foreplay and went right to it table one incidence of treatment related adverse effects i wish i could honestly say i remember how i read this the very first time because i've looked at it a number of times since but what's interesting is i certainly remember seeing that the placebo group had 21 adverse events so that's important to always keep in mind when you look at clinical studies is there's just a baseline level of adverse effects that have no bearing on the drug whatsoever so it's almost like you could subtract 21 out of all of the others to get a sense of what the noise is so the group that got .5 daily had 35 adverse effects and each of the treatment groups had about the same number so i mean there were 53 groups in each of the three arms 59 in the placebo so the 21 you might discount that slightly but it basically went from 35 to 46 to 109. so at this point obviously this means each patient is having more than one adverse effect likely but here's what i found interesting the next line in the table tells you how many people actually had adverse effects so not just the total adverse effects and this was surprisingly constant so in the placebo group it's 12 in arm 1 it's 22 in arm 2 it's 20 and arm 3 is 27. so looks like point five daily versus five weekly no real difference in adverse effects and by the way i'm not gonna don't worry i won't read you guys the whole table here we're gonna link to this paper in the show notes the other thing that really stood out to me though in terms of side effects was mouth ulceration now that's the side effect i remembered the most from residency was the patients getting aptos ulcers with their daily dose of rapamycin and most of them were getting more than 0.5 daily so most of the patients that i wrote my recollection was that two to four milligrams was a very common daily dose for rap immune and again this is rad001 so it's a different vehicle but it's comparable and so 0.5 daily would definitely be lower than what i was used to seeing people get and yet 11 and a half percent of these folks had mouth ulcerations whereas the people getting 0.5 daily were at 0.5 once a week was about 4 percent and 20 once a week was about 17 so that's really interesting i mean that tells a very interesting story about the kinetics of this drug was there any other toxicity that surprised you in the study well as you pointed out mouth ulcers are one of the more common and fairly specific side effects for rapid logs should we spend one moment explaining why i think we could certainly speculate why i don't think anybody knows why there are some hypotheses but and it isn't just wrapalog associated mouth ulcers we don't know what causes the ordinary spontaneous aphthous ulcerations that people get they've been a fair amount of work on it but nobody knows there are a lot of mysteries in medicine and that's just another one of them anecdotally through five years of residency i don't think i went more than two weeks without an apathy ulcer they can be stress related i'm sure they are and it was to the point where they would drive me so bananas i couldn't even get relief from those sort of topical lidocaine gels the only thing that could give me real relief was if i could inject bupivacaine directly into it because it was such a long acting agent lidocaine only lasts an hour or two that was not going to do me justice on a call night and it got to the point where i would sit there and inject bupivacaine into my tongue or into my mouth and i remember once somebody walking in the call room while i'm sitting there holding my gums out jamming bupivacaine in and i'm they must have thought i had some drug problem but two weeks after leaving residency i never had an aptis ulcer again i hope you never have another one there well i very painful they're unbelievable but then of course i did get them once i started rapamycin so we'll come back to that but i certainly went many many years without them again my hypothesis was some combination of stress and sleep deprivation might have played a role it doesn't help mechanistically though we just don't understand them yeah so overall i thought the side effects were less than i would have expected let's now talk about the results i'll actually hand you the table here because i don't not that i would ever expect you to remember table 2a but walk a little bit through kind of what you guys saw and how you tested it so you're using a couple of different flu vaccines etc a couple of different strains yeah so the standard flu vaccine had in those days three different antigens for three different kinds of viruses two influenza a strains one influenza b strain and i think as we all know the flu vaccine is designed every single year based on the circulating flu strains in asia to try to match the vaccine to the strains of flu that we expect to get in this case in the southern hemisphere or for us in the northern hemisphere so patients were treated with one of those doses of rad001 or a placebo and the study was randomized double-blind and placebo-controlled so neither the doctors nor the patients knew who was getting what and i guess there's one detail i omitted which if my memory is correct the patients were treated for eight weeks six weeks six weeks and then there was a washout so then they had a period of nothing for was that six to eight weeks it was two weeks after the six weeks of treatment oh that's where the eight came in so it was six of treatment two of washout then vaccination right and the rationale for that was we wanted the drug to be completely gone at the time we vaccinated so we were asking the question is this a residual effect of the drug on the immune system not so not a lingering effect on the immune system per se yeah not a direct effect of the drug but an indirect yes okay so with that said what was the first finding so we were looking for whether the response to the flu vaccine was 1.2 fold better in a drug treated group than the placebo and that 1.2 fold came from a previous study that had been published that showed that was the minimum requirement to see a clinically meaningful decrease in symptomatic flu in vaccinated patients we saw and we required this was pre-specified two out of the three strains to have that improvement and we saw that improvement or better in the two low doses of rad001 but not in the high dose and the high dose we just saw one stroke one of the three strains was better and the other two were actually a little below one so a little below the placebo what do you make of that is it noise do you think there's something mechanistically happening there i do i think we certainly know that high doses of arapalog are immunosuppressive the dose of 20 milligrams once a week is sufficiently high to fully suppress torque 1. i expect that we probably interfered with lymphocyte proliferation and do you think it's just a tweak that you didn't see what's confusing to me is that you still saw a much greater immunity in one strain and if i recall it was even higher than the two low doses thinking about the first figure in the top figure in the second figure of the paper so that would be my first guess would be oh clearly you just hit the daily dose of an immuno suppressed patient if they were all below baseline but if you did a 25 weekly in there do you think you would have just seen them all eventually start to go down certainly if we got to some high enough dose i think they all would have been low i got it yeah so it's almost like there's a j curve here or an upside down j curve really yeah an upside down u i suppose of some combination of dose and frequency producing a sweet spot where we're seeing and by the way i can't recall it's been so long so i looked at the paper was there any lympho proliferation i mean these were functional assays any changes in the counts of lymphocytes or any other this specific assay that was the primary endpoint was an antibody tighter assay right we didn't do mixed lymphocyte reactions or some proliferation assay as part of this paper did anyone ever look at fractions of lymphocytes for example did anyone look at cd25 cd3 to see if anything had happened to suppressor t cells we didn't do it in this study well we didn't do functional lymphocyte assays part of this study was a very comprehensive multi-dimensional flow cytometric assay to get lymphocyte subsets and we reported one of the results in figure 3 which is where we saw improvement in checkpoint protein levels on both cd8 and cd4 lymphocytes which mean and checkpoint proteins are very popular in oncology now and some of your listeners may have heard about those things like pd-1 for example the drug target of ketruta or opdiva we had keith flaherty on recently and we had a beautiful discussion about checkpoint inhibition but that said let's assume people don't know what that is it's always worth rediscussing it yeah these proteins inhibit lymphocyte function and they go up as the lymphocytes get exhausted and what we saw in this study is that the level of pd-1 went down on the lymphocytes in the drug treatment group compared to the placebo by what percent it was a relatively small effect of 10 to 20 change but comparable to the effect that you saw in the increase in antibody recognition i mean it was like the mirror of that i guess yeah and presumably the teleologic rationale for that is the more tired a lymphocyte gets the more it wants to weaken its breaks i'll go along with that everything in me in my world lloyd comes down to just anthropomorphizing the immune system that's how i do things so has anyone looked at this by the way to see what rapamycin does or rapalog does in this type of intermittent dosing to inhibitory t cells there have been a lot of studies of t cell subset functions with rapologs both in mice and in humans looking at effector memory transition looking at t-regs with high exposures there's substantial inhibitory effect on b-cell function there's a lot out there do you think that rapid logs could be used to suppress t-regs selectively of course there are a couple of papers that show that because it would sure be interesting to start layering in rapologs with immunotherapy oncology specifically yes yeah there's small literature on that what else did you see in this paper i think we've touched on the high points yeah the other experiment we did which i think we mentioned in the text but didn't go into great details is the flu vaccine is a t dependent antibody response we also vaccinated patients with a 23 valent pneumococcal vaccine which is b cell which is a pure polysaccharide vaccine so it's a t independent response we were thinking could we improve antigen presentation perhaps if the dose of the wrapalog we used augmented autophagy and could that contribute to antigen presentation we saw and we measured seven of the 23 antigens wait tell me why that would be that's not an obvious purview into autophagy to me so let's back that up a little bit so you're giving them a pneumococcal vaccine which is what type of vaccine that's a polysaccharide antigen polysaccharide antigen you're not giving back the whole bacteria and how does it get presented to the immune system there are specific elements of innate immunity that recognize bacterial polysaccharide antigens and that brings it to professional antigen presenting cells likely dendritic cells and then it has to be internalized and then presented so that's mhc class one this isn't a peptide presentation this is presented in the context of an innate element that recognizes polysaccharide antigens okay all right so we're outside of class one class yes yes and you're saying the ability to internalize or basically the ability to phagocytose that like the polysaccharide and then and directly stimulate b cells yeah it was an exploratory element of the study we saw in the seven specific antigen responses we measured if i recall six of them increased but by a small amount it was a encouraging trend but we didn't further follow it up okay any other markers you could have here for autophagy i mean did you look at light chain transition or anything like that no autophagy is a really difficult clinical investigation paradigm and i know you recently saw mitch weiss's paper on unpaired hemoglobins in thalassemia patients i was super excited when i read that paper because here is now a clinical paradigm where we can test drugs that augment autophagy and see something easily measurable in a not that rare patient population yeah let me think in those patients did you collect serum that allow you to look at amino acid levels in the plasma or anything else no we didn't do any of that do you still have any of that banked serum i don't think so easy enough experiment to repeat but but of course the other thing i'm curious about is is there anything about rad001 administration that mimics fasting for example i mean how much of the benefit here is through direct inhibition of mtor and are there any pleiatrophic benefits that aren't quantified through this obviously some of them i mean the fact that you waited until the drug was out of the system to check the immune response is actually a great insight because obviously you eliminate some of those things but in the way that many people have argued statins have a direct effect they inhibit cholesterol synthesis an indirect effect the liver up regulates ldlr a really indirect effect which is immune suppression or other sort of benefits around endothelial health and things like that do you think there's a possible third leg to this stool that we haven't thought about the fasting story is kind of complex so do i think there's some other persistent benefit of of a wrapalog i think the mouse experiments tells us there is and it's because relatively short course of a wrapalog is nonetheless sufficient to extend a mouse's lifespan and we do not understand that although it's so hard to extrapolate what short versus long means in a mouse isn't it yes look at the mouse that fasts for 24 hours look at j mitchell's stuff where they do a one day fast prior to a femoral artery ligation and a reperfusion where the mouse that was just fed normally through the insult they all die the mice that had 24 hours of fasting prior to a lethal reperfusion injury either all or mostly live i don't know how to extrapolate that into a higher order animal because it's not even the duration of the fast it's the metabolic consequence of the fast there's some long-term consequence of that that we don't understand and there's several things you could hypothesize is there a change in the dna structure based on histone methylation or dna methylation is it or is this something else those are just the things that come to mind yeah that's a great point right is you could literally be resetting methylation on that you could turn back a methylation clock to its template potentially but people have looked at that with wrapalogs and it doesn't seem to happen in other words you take a horvath clock pre and post and you're not seeing unwinding of methylation yeah that's been done in mice as well or just in humans i suspect it's been done in a bunch of species it's one of these sort of negative studies that may never get published that's a pet peeve of mine by the way negative studies not getting published i think it's a pet peeve of a lot of people it's hard enough to publish positive studies and i'm sympathetic and agree yeah so we're high-fiving on new year's eve 2014 how do you go from what is novartis again if this is confidential by all means just gloss you know we'll skip it but what do the brass at novartis think of the results of this experiment which is effectively taking a drug that we already have on the market for a very clear indication and now potentially expanding an indication can the fda take a study this is a very well done study here this is double-blinded this placebo-controlled and this found a significant outcome is that enough to change the indication for medication like this i can speak in general and that for an indication that could be relevant to many many people you need a corresponding a lot of safety data this study was way too small for studies that would be required for marketing authorization i got it so because something like renal cell carcinoma is relatively infrequent relative to influenza vaccination you had enough safety data to justify treating people with rcc this would not constitute sufficient safety data to basically give every person over the age of 65 who's getting vaccinated this type of a medication that's exactly right if we fast forward a little bit in the conversation we've advanced this program in restore bio novartis licensed it to restore bio and our phase three program is two very similarly designed clinical studies one has a thousand patients the other one will have about 1600 patients you're able to speak about how the decision was made for restore bio to basically acquire a piece of an asset from novartis and and what else was brought in to create that company and how did you joan and i assume many others decide to leave i mean that's obviously a loss to novartis presumably which implies that they probably still have a vested interest in the success of restore bio yeah let's take one step backwards and answer an earlier question you asked which is what did novartis think when we oh yes yes thank you and i think everybody was very excited for reasons that you're excited that was my christmas present of the year and and the guidance was this is so important let's go back and do it again try to do it in a more torque one selective way are you able to say how much that study cost just to give a sense of i don't think we talk externally but any clinical study like this a phase ii study with two to three hundred patients costs millions and a lot of the cost is driven by often exploratory assessments you do in the context of the study beyond the per patient cost and investigator cost but millions i mean it's a lot of money for anybody and it's done with a lot of deliberation and thought so the guidance was to go back and do it again make sure it's real come up with a way to be more torque one selective but using the same vehicle which means be putting a finer point on the dosing not necessarily i mean you're still not at the point where people are saying we need to make a new molecule to replicate this well we had one oh the research team at novartis had come up with a very cool finding that a combination of an allosteric and catalytic torque inhibitor could be more torque one selective and more potent there was actually synergy and this is published by bayat nyfeller lone murphy they showed synergy so arapalog can you explain to folks what the difference is between allosteric versus catalytic inhibition sure so catalytic inhibition means an inhibitor that's binding at the catalytic site of torque 1 and blocking phosphorylation of targets an allosteric inhibitor is a fancy way of saying an inhibitor that binds someplace else on the molecule and nonetheless inhibits it rapamycin i always think of alastair as sort of shape blocking it could be yeah let's say shape blocking so in this case the allosteric inhibitor is the combination of fkbp12 plus rapamycin binding to torque one so the combination of those two synergistically inhibits torque one and it's a little more torque one selective everolimus does the same thing it also binds to fkbp yes it binds to fkbps also maybe later on we can get to that lambing paper which is which yeah i'd love to get to that paper yeah yeah so with that understanding we could then explore put a finer point on the dosing as well as explore the biology of that catalytic inhibitor with and without red zero zero one and that's what the next study did overall a very similar study design we treated for six weeks two week washout interrogated the immune system function with flu vaccination and got fundamentally similar results there's one other point i'd like to bring in because it leads to where we are now in the very first study we did in analyzing we saw immune function improvement which and our marker for that was flu vaccine response in the adverse event listings we saw fewer infections in the drug-treated people compared to the placebo patients over what time horizon we followed people for a year and by the way did that increase in vaccination translate to a reduction in influenza or is that the infection you're speaking about are you speaking about all infections all infections okay what about influenza specifically too few events to be able to make a conclusion it's underpowered to look at the flu exactly if you think about all infections you get or patients get most of them are respiratory tract infections colds and flus in the winter season an interesting thought experiment you wouldn't do this experiment but interesting thought experiment would be a two by two vaccine no vaccine rapa no rapa powered to see difference in infection big experiment huge experiment but great gadonken right yes i agreed so in this very first study we found again we weren't thinking about it and we weren't looking for it but we observed it in the adverse event listings so what were some of those infections lloyd that you saw like utis or cellulitis that kind of stuff two most common ones by far the most common was upper respiratory tract infection or respiratory tract infections that was not influenza yeah maybe some of them were we didn't measure we don't know what the pathogens were we do know from surveillance experiments that the cdc has done that most of them are rhinovirus and then there's metanumavirus there's various other echo god only knows what yes and we saw a decrease in utis also and that persisted for a year the biggest effect was when the patients were shortly over the course of drug treatment and some time thereafter but even if we analyze it over the course of a year we saw it although the effect waned in this very first study in 2014 we brought patients back a year later and revaccinated them to see if the improvement in immunologic function persisted and it did not okay so by a year they'd clearly lost it yes and of course we didn't do the experiment but do you know if six weeks was necessary or could you have done four plus two or three plus two or two plus two would the benefit have been better if you went eight plus two or ten plus two or twelve plus two like how did you agree on six weeks of treatment i understand the two week wash out but what about the six weeks of treatment it came from two places one is that that's what they did in the mice my same caveat implies i totally agree and then secondly we know the timing of lymphocyte production from committed precursors in human bone marrow and we were thinking that the drug could be acting at that level and six weeks of treatment is sufficient to by the time you vaccinated eight weeks have some new lymphocytes from those committed precursors so your hypothesis would be six was the minimum time required to get a full turnover and going eight versus ten would not necessarily bring benefit and might only expose you to longer side effects we actually never tested this we came up with our dosing period for the rationale that i gave you and we've not at least with a wrapalog tested other intervals we did see in the second study which also worked on the vaccine endpoint we promoted respiratory tract infections and infections in general to secondary endpoints so we're looking at them prospectively we're collecting them more carefully that was in the second study in the second study and again the drugs decreased the incidence of respiratory tract infections the biggest effect was observed with just the catalytic inhibitor alone the second biggest effect wait the catalytic inhibitor was a new molecule yes it's a new compound it was in that paper it was called bez235 and this is the molecule licensed by restore bio so bez235 is not rad001 combined with something else no we tested the combination and it also decreased respiratory tract infections and the combination was the best at improving the flu response but the single catalytic inhibitor was the best at preventing respiratory tract infections this study had an extra arm it was a somewhat bigger study 264 patients was this the one published two years ago yes 2018 oh yeah yeah a year ago okay so let's now talk about the creation of restore bio so essentially the story is that we did the second study for prevention of respiratory tract infections and enhancing immune function with mtor inhibition worked again everybody's excited and novartis as in most big companies big pharma companies the research teams produce more than global development can handle and it's done deliberately it gives early in drug development you never know exactly what's going to work best you want to create enough opportunities so something will be exciting and the program transitioned to global development and they had a lot of exciting things to do and this fell below the funding line it reflects in part the excellent productivity of novartis research it reflects in part the great opportunities the global development has of course as the champions of the program we were kind of disappointed but novartis felt and again i'm speaking for myself now i'm not a nevada spokesperson but novartis felt this drug looks like it could work and it could help people we have to find a way to make it available to people if it could work so other pharma companies do this too the decision was to out license it and joan is the sort of originator of the idea and the biggest champion wanted to go outside of novartis and start a company i introduced her to an absolutely awesome ceo i know who was ready for his next role and they raised money and they created a restore bio and that was a pretty quick path to going public restore buyer went public late in 18 didn't they it reflected in part the need for funds to run a phase three program yeah what did restore bio raise in the ipo uh you're asking me a hard question i was at novartis but probably around 90 million i think wow yeah so yeah as you said that's you're basically going right to phase three at this point because so you licensed one or two molecules from novartis restore bio licensed bez235 which is now named rtb 101 and they then did a phase 2b study these two studies we had done were phase 2a2a yeah right so in the first study published in 2014 that we've been discussing respiratory tract infections and infections in general were observed to be decreased in the drug treated group compared to the placebo by reviewing the adverse event listings this was not something we had considered a priori but we recognized decreased infections could be a consequence of improved immune function which is why we looked in the first place in the listings and then in the second study where we explored a catalytic inhibitor which is now rtb-101 rad001 as well as the combination we promoted respiratory tract infections and infections in general to a secondary endpoint and we specifically included collecting those data both by patient reporting as well as investigator querying the patients at home regularly and again we saw decreased respiratory tract infections the best drug was bez235 which we now call rtb101 in terms of decreasing respiratory tract infections the combination also worked interestingly the combination as well as rad001 improved the flu vaccine response but the bez235 or rtb-101 did not remind me it's catalytically inhibiting so it's binding directly to tor yes and is it binding equally to tor when bound to raptor meaning complex one as it is binding to tor bound to richter known as complex two so the way this is usually done is in a cellular assay context so we don't look specifically for the binding but we look for inhibition of phosphorylation of sites of serine 6 or which one s6 kinase for torque 1 and phosphoa kt there and we look specifically at the phosphorylation site that torque 2 does not the one that any other enzyme does so we're able to see that a catalytic inhibitor at high concentrations will inhibit both rtb101 has some preference for torque 1 and it's a little different depending upon which cell you look in i wanted to come back to that because and i've got to remember that where we are in this story because i don't want to lose this thread so maybe we can agree to just park this again but i definitely don't want to leave the discussion of tissue selectivity we've focused so much on c1c2 selectivity but we haven't talked about muscle versus liver versus adipose tissue for example which you could argue you might want very different behaviors there in terms of drug design drug pharmacokinetics is it easier to target tissues or is it easier to target enzymes proteins etc when designing a drug or waving magic wands no magic wands involved it's far easier to design a drug to hit a target to hit the target in a particular tissue is harder but doable sometimes you can do it in a deliberate design fashion for example making a pro drug that's cleaved to an active form only by an enzyme present in your desired tissue you also have to be mindful that within every tissue there are multiple cell types and you want the drug in the cell type that will make the difference and again all of this is possible and it's just how much time and effort you're going to put into it so when you go back to even the first experiment in 2014 and all of the animal data that came from it did you have a sense of where this was acting tissue wise did you feel like you were acting on bone marrow did you feel like you were possibly acting in the thymus did you feel like you were acting in some other cell line that directly or indirectly was playing a role i mean or did you have a sense that you were seeing this everywhere but it didn't seem to matter except in the bone marrow we thought it would be bone marrow and perhaps secondary lymphoid tissue which are lymph nodes or glands but we didn't explore it exactly in general small molecules that aren't specifically tissue targeted will often go to many tissues we knew from toxicology studies with the compound that it distributed to our target tissues we felt we had enough information to move ahead yeah so when rtb 101 was basically the basis upon which restore bio was formed correct that's right now i was very confused during your road show which was about a year ago maybe more than a year ago it might have been early 2018 i've sort of lost track you were at novartis at the time so it wasn't really your road show at the time but i naively i guess thought that rtb 101 was actually rad001 the evrolimus combined with a pi3k inhibitor so that's actually what i thought was happening and i remember even having discussions with other people looking at the data and saying is this what this company is so i assume that this company out licensed evralimus combined with a pi3k inhibitor so how were we confused by that when restore bio was formed it licensed rtb 101 from novartis for all uses and there was also a limited license to use rad001 only in combination with rtb101 for our indication now the phase 2b study that restore bio ran showed that the most effective drug or drug combination for preventing respiratory tract infections was just rtb 101 alone at 10 milligrams and remember the previous study that novartis had run had shown that although the combination was best at augmenting a vaccine response it was just rtb 101 alone which at the time was called bez235 was the best at preventing respiratory tract infections we believe this is because the mechanism by which it prevents respiratory tract infections is upregulation of an interferon-stimulated antiviral gene response interferon remember is a substance in the blood that upregulates many different proteins most of which are involved in preventing viral infections and you need protein synthesis to make all of these proteins and i worry that if we inhibit mtor for a long time we can upregulate the genes but they won't be expressed adequately and there are some literature data that you need mtor in order to express the proteins induced by interferon so these experiments taken together suggest to you that i guess it just reinforces this idea of intermittent dosing not just intermittent within the week which i think was clearly established by the phase 2a study but even applying a secondary cycle over the course of a year for example i mean you know that doing a six plus two once a year is probably not adequate so there's some frequency upon which you want to metacycle that but the reason you don't just want to go all the time taking it presumably is you might actually start to impair protein synthesis that's necessary to for lack of a better word basically empower your new superpowers of immunity through enhanced protein synthesis yes protein synthesis there's several different kinds of protein synthesis and some are more or less sensitive to inhibition by rapalog mitch weiss's very recent paper one of the interesting things i found in it was that there wasn't much of an inhibition of hemoglobin synthesis despite the fact that they were using fairly high exposures of a rapalog so i think there are some proteins that are sensitive to translational inhibition by rapalogs and perhaps some that are less sensitive before we go down this path of getting a little bit more into rtb 101 let's take a step back here and say do you think that all of the benefits that we saw in the itps across all these other species if you think of the benefits that matt caberlyn is seeing in dogs if you think of sort of the global excitement that exists around rapamycin and rapidlogs how much of it do you think is mediated through what you guys are testing which is you're clearly enhancing immunity in a positive way which could have at least two very distinct benefits one is the reduction of infection the other could be frankly reduction of cancer through increased surveillance they're very similar viruses and cancer obviously behave or susceptible to the similar branch of the immune system do you think there are other things that we haven't talked about yet such as increased autophagy targeting of and or destruction and or the silencing of senescent cells reduction of inflammation enhanced mitophagy what other mechanisms do you think could be involved here and what evidence exists to support or refute that well i think we know from academic experiments that every single one of those mechanisms can extend health span in preclinical models we do not know in people and i think similarly to follow up our earlier discussion about what tissues you have to inhibit mtor in in order to get a clinical benefit we don't really know the answer to that either it's been studied in some of the pre-clinical models i can recall an experiment in the drosophila fat body where inhibition of mtor right there was sufficient to extend a fly lifespan there's still a lot we need to learn what does your intuition tell you how much of an overlap or parallel do you see between the benefits of fasting and caloric restriction and the benefits of rapamycin globally yeah so one of the interesting things that we did and was done previously in a nature publication i think the author was sengupta was looking at the consequences of fasting on mtor activity in young people as you would expect fasting leads to suppression of mtar activity activation of the cellular recycling machinery autophagy suppression of protein synthesis and dna and lipid synthesis and so forth basically preparing for lean times in old mice that's impaired we've only done the liver tests in mice so we back translated this experiment and gave actually i think it was rats it was old rats doses of mtor inhibition that corresponded to the doses we were using in people that were well tolerated and then we looked at their ability to suppress mtor so in the old rats even with fasting their mtor was still active in the liver in a young rat it's suppressed so the young versus old had the same degree of inhibition to the same dose of rapamycin well you couldn't test in the young rats because their mtor was already low oh but if you did it outside of the fast i mean well certainly the exposures were the same there was no age dependent difference in exposure of the liver or the blood that's interesting does that suggest that the older animal lost the ability to respond to the environmental reduction in nutrient exactly exactly that's upsetting although it does explain a very interesting finding which is everything comes back to the 2009 paper what really was interesting scientifically was that those mice were 600 days old those were mice that if you fasted them wouldn't have lived longer they'd already passed that stage where caloric restriction would extend their life and yet their lives were extended 15 and 25 by rapamycin that was a big freaking deal yeah we published our experiments in that 2008 paper it was it was sort of an interesting back translation experiment where we treated the old rats based on what we do about the old people and of course we could do in rats what we can't do in people is take their livers out and study their mtor inhibition but we weren't the first ones to do that there was a very good nature paper that showed the same thing do you think this applies to humans i mean do you think that intermittent periods of caloric restriction are not beneficial to people in their 60s or 70s which would be the equivalent of those quote unquote old rats the only thing that our group has been able to try is we looked at whether we could detect mtor activity as assessed by things like fossil s6 kinase in the peripheral blood leukocytes of old people and we couldn't detect activity we can't answer the question i think we would need liver samples under fasting conditions i mean are you volunteering yeah i'm absolutely volunteering no i tell you there's a lot of things i subject myself to i'm never excited about the liver biopsy i just i think that's the problem of doing a residency in general surgery is you've had one too many calls down to the interventional radiology suite with the patient that you have the recency bias of you only remember all the cases of liver biopsy has gone bad the all those hepatologists that have never had an issue you don't hear about those cases but you hear about everyone that yeah there's sort of a referral bias you never see the thousand that go well yeah you only see the one that didn't yeah i don't know i think at some point i'll probably have to sign up for a liver biopsy i think there's a lot going on there there's so many questions i have about the liver especially my own no liver biopsies you can get samples other ways at least for this reason but it is an interesting open question and yet another one of these things we don't know is is mtor suppressed in elderly people with fasting and in which tissues and by the way do we know if autophagy is impaired in older folks with fasting because autophagy and mtor inhibition are not synonymous that's right they overlap but they're not synonymous yeah well there's a lot of biology there and it's not only mtor that can trigger autophagy there's other mechanisms there's becklin one mechanisms and so forth but it's an interesting set of experiments to do with a young group of patients and an old group of patients and there's a priming effect to this that i just don't i mean it's so multifaceted to study all of these things you think of the infinite combinations you can have which is what's the effect of wrap-up plus fasting when staggered for example does one prime the other it's hard you can't really go on fishing expeditions with these questions you have to be more thoughtful in your hypothesis generation there's just too many variables that's right there's too many ways to be fooled that's right so what can you tell us now about rtb 101 what has been published on this in other words i don't think we can speak about obviously anything that's not published at this point or at least hasn't been publicly signaled what's next for this compound so the excitement is in the phase 2a study that novartis ran we saw decreased respiratory tract infections in elderly people treated with it in the phase to be study that restore bio ran again the same dose 10 milligrams once a day saw the same thing a decrease in respiratory tract infections now that study was a complicated study and did it also have an rtb 101 plus rad001 arm it did and there was not a decrease in respiratory tract infections there but there was an increase in immunity or was that that was a secondary outcome that was assessed but it hasn't been talked about yet the cool thing about the 2018 paper that was published from the novartis study is that because we saw a decrease in respiratory tract infections but we did not see an increase in vaccine response it told us that the mechanism for the decrease in respiratory tract infections had to be something different and we had collected some samples for exploratory profiling we learned that there was an upregulation of antiviral gene expression in peripheral blood leukocytes so a set of interferon stimulated genes responsible for antiviral activities was upregulated so we identified a candidate mechanism and it makes a lot of sense so to put that in english it's not that the response was mediated by better recognition of viruses it was mediated by more efficient targeting of and or disposing of viruses perhaps another way to say it is that the vaccine response we were measuring as the primary endpoint was a lymphocyte acquired immunity measurement so in other words you're immune the flu because you've been vaccinated if you've been vaccinated for rabies you're immune to that i've never been vaccinated for rabies i'm not immune to rabies in contrast there's something called innate immunity which is the immunity of our species this is an immunity that was developed because we have all co-evolved with our pathogens and those of us who are here yeah this is why the lps on strep is you don't need to be vaccinated to recognize it exactly so there are many many many many other things that we can recognize elements of pathogens so we can mount an effective immune response and we're born with this we don't have to be immunized for it and this part of the immune system is what mtor inhibition can also activate yeah which is to go back to historical that's not what we care about in transplant no because in transplant you certainly didn't we didn't evolve to reject kidneys we evolved to accept our kidneys therefore we reject someone else's kidney that's mhc based right although blood type matching of your organ transplants is for well that's true and now they're doing so many incompatibles that it's i mean the immunology involved in organ transplantation today is remarkable a subject for another time i know and all started at your alma mater that was the nobel prize right there right that's right dr murray so is there anything else you can tell us because this is obviously something like have you guys spoken about what the phase three is going to look like yeah well we're almost halfway through halfway through enrollment we enrolled the first phase three study fully and getting ready to start the second so tell us about the first one yeah so well let's do a little more on the phase 2b because that study answered several questions in one study we enrolled patients with pre-specified comorbidities and pre-specified an analysis of them independently we did doses we did five milligrams and 10 milligrams we did a different schedule we did 10 twice a day and we did a combination with arapalog rad001 with the primary endpoint of decreased respiratory tract infections we also extended the dosing period to cover a winter cold and flu season so now we're dosing 16 weeks uninterrupted uninterrupted okay although with the once a day dosing which is where we saw efficacy we're only inhibiting mtor partially for part of the day by the way if you had to speculate going back to the very very first the 2a with rad0001 if you had taken all four of those groups and measured them at the end of six weeks and then after the two week washout what's your prediction as to how they would have differed i'm sorry because we didn't vaccinate until if we vaccinated at six weeks versus vaccinated at eight weeks correct and you did comparison in other words i'm asking on drug versus off drug how much i know why you had the washout but is it also possible that on drug you would have the same immune response yes on the low doses on the high doses i bet we wouldn't have and do you define high as 5 and 20 high is 20. okay got it so you think the five and the 0.5 still would have had benefit on drug 20 probably got a benefit in fact that might explain the question i asked which is why did they still at least have one good strain response it could have been that the two weeks off gave them recovery it could be yeah so back to restore bio we figured it and then the other element to the study is we ran it in two different cold and flu seasons one in the southern hemisphere one in the northern hemisphere 652 patients in the study because we answered a lot of questions we found that some patient populations responded well over 85 patients and patients with asthma patients with diabetes also responded patients who were smokers or had copd did not there are some pre-clinical data that provides a mechanism for why this is the case in the sense that it's a different mechanism for airway inflammation and smoking in copd and it's exacerbated by mtor inhibition oh so i thought it was going to be a different way of antigen presentation or something i don't think so okay the coolest thing about the study is that we saw the same degree of efficacy if we looked at the patients in the southern hemisphere is in the northern hemisphere it's almost as if there was two sub-studies in this study now each of the patient groups by themselves were insufficiently powered to get any statistical significance although overall the patient population did that's a bold study design move that could have backfired badly right because if you had discordance between the northern and southern hemisphere you would have been underpowered well the goal of the study was to look at the overall patient population which we did which included responders and non-responders and we saw a 30 decrease in respiratory tract infections yes but you had two different strains of the flu didn't you flu was not involved here was no vaccination in this study oh sorry i mean what i mean is you had two different environments of viruses yes absolutely absolutely so you deluded i'm just saying you you loaded the deck against yourself if you did everything identical but they were all in the same country presumably you'd have a higher concentration of pathogen you'd have a better chance of seeing a signal it's sort of all i was saying yeah i think you'd have a more consistent you'd have a higher chance of seeing consistency that's right and you had the lowest chance imaginable because you spread out across two hemispheres yet we saw consistency yes so i think we're saying the same thing which is it's more a credit to the finding yeah and i'm just saying thank god well if the drug works this is what we should have seen yeah it's just a big bet for a startup to take yeah and so now we've seen 10 milligrams of rtb 101 decrease respiratory tract infections in the phase 2a and in each of the parts of the phase 2b and we use the phase 2b to power the phase 3 program so the phase 3 program is and the primary indication is respiratory infection or all infection respiratory tract infections and patient population is 65 and up 65 and up so the first study that we're calling the program the protector program the first one is fully enrolled 1024 patients they're getting 16 weeks of drug treatment and we're following them for respiratory tract infections with sort of an electronic record that the patients fill out if we were just targeting this at northern hemisphere patients is it your view that the optimal 16-week window would be sort of may june july august how are you deciding when winter cold and flu season is when they actually want to receive the drug yes okay so basically so you're so confident that 10 milligrams is not too high that you're willing to give them the drug during flu season or during winter cold season yes all right so let's turn over to something else you brought up earlier which was the dean lambing paper that came out about two months ago that's a prolific lab lemming was a postdoc in david's lab so no stranger to this science there are lots of folks out there that are working on selective mtorc1 inhibition notwithstanding the potential ways around it through intermittent dosing or looking at catalytic binding or things that might be offer you a little bit more insight what is your take on the biochemistry of selective binding and selective inhibition more specifically the binding is quite selective yeah i thought basically to summarize that paper for the listeners the lambing group looked at i think it was 90 different wrapalogs presumably related to rapamycin and looked for their ability to be selective for torque 1 even with more sustained exposure then they identified a couple that were and they most of the paper was on one that they liked the best the really cool thing and this is going to get us into an immunofilling discussion is that they found possibly the reason the compound was selective was that it bound to one of the immunofillins but not another so specifically it bound to fkbp at least fkbp12 was required for the compound to have activity but another fkbp fkbp51 was not but i still don't understand this if you bind to fkbp12 and then the rapalog plus fkbp12 binds to mtor don't you still get into the same problem where after a long enough period of time you don't have enough tor to make complex 2 i don't think that's why complex 2 is inhibited what do you think rapamycin specifically is doing to inhibit complex 2 then i think it's a downstream and indirect sort of counter-regulatory signaling mechanism i see so it has to do more with sort of the serine kinase or the fourier bp1 or something like that like something downstream of a direct phosphorylation is counter-regulating or yes yeah i see and you're saying presumably if you only bind a wrapalog to fkbp 12 you somehow don't hit that target well i think what their data say is because the compound that they show has no torque to activity at all does not bind to fkbp 51 or at least that's the implication because down regulating fkbp51 which i think they did within sirna had no effect on its inhibitory activity suggests that there's a complexity to the complexes formed sorry for that that we don't yet understand and it's an exciting area to explore so remember every cell has many immunophelins in it it has several cyclophyllins it's got several fkbps so fkbp12 51 and 52 are probably the big three but there are a few others by the way i thought rapa only bound to 12 rappa binds to what they showed that it binds to at least 12 and 51. okay i mean that's amazing i had always thought that rappa binds only to fk bp12 which then binds the tor i didn't even realize it was binding to 51. so we know it binds to 51 in their paper and there have been some other papers studying the rhianidine receptor that show that it binds to 12.6 also which is in cardiac myocytes we've talked all about inhibition are there any times when you want to be activating this there's a lot of talk that ketamine may be activating mtor and obviously ketamine has some really interesting properties as it pertains to recalcitrant depression yeah so two points here for patients with major depression intravenous ketamine is almost a miracle drug we're accustomed to typical anti-depressive drugs requiring weeks and weeks to work and having modest effects at best or even days but this is minutes ketamine works in minutes to hours and a huge effect size it's really amazing i don't think we know what the specific cellular mechanism is of that is i'm giving you lots of things we don't know in our discussion wasn't there a study that showed rapamycin blocked the effect of ketamine yes and there's a biotech company called navator i know them well and they're using an mtor activator to treat depression their lloyd equivalent is also a very smart guy george is yes george is fantastic so lloyd is this a relatively recent understanding then about how rappa is binding to the fks and how it's yes the complexity around first of all how many of these things there are and how you can change their properties by which ones you're binding to yeah so it's something that's not discussed a lot in the literature but there are several fkbps or fk 506 binding proteins we almost always talk about fkbp12 and it's sort of a shorthand but the understanding has been that rapamycin binds to all of them in a few specific cases that's been shown to be true there's also a bunch of other activities for and roles for fkbps that aren't at all part of torque one biology for example they all have an enzymatic activity they're peptodylprolial isomerases but what the biology of that is remains pretty much unclear it's a very interesting enzymatic activity it's involved in protein folding but there's been some studies where maybe a dozen different of these immunofillings are completely eliminated at the same time from cells there was no clear cellular phenotype so whether that means the others can all substitute because it's such a critical function or they have no function that's important are there disease states where people are lacking any of these there may be but i don't know them and how conserved are they across species highly conserved these immunofillings are present in almost all species although they can vary a little bit is there any cell in the body that does not contain mtor i would bet some of the terminally differentiated a nucleated cells may not red blood cells for example do certainly red blood cell precursors do i was thinking about platelets for example i don't know if they have mtor yeah yeah interesting and i bet that's known it's just i know the answer and i feel better that you don't so now we need to make a list of david sabatini questions well i'll make sure david listens to this and you know what maybe we'll do an ama with david specifically on tour so last thing i want to chat about because it the paper came out kind of recently was this sort of interesting paper it's interesting not in the sense of the intervention because it was an n of nine and it was a very poorly controlled study in the sense that there was no placebo group and every patient actually was on their own sort of tailored cocktail of three different drugs or two hormones in a drug but the paper did get a lot of press because it used an epigenetic clock are you familiar with these clocks yes yeah this is the horvath's work right yeah yeah however that's probably the best of these clocks maybe it's just a little bonus episode tell folks how these things work what they're measuring we've already talked a little bit about methylation so maybe we put a bow on this by discussing that so i forget how many years ago it was now but it wasn't that many that we learned from horvath and others that by looking at the methylation pattern on peripheral blood leukocyte dna we can tell how old you are within about six months to a year and this has been replicated by several groups so we're all familiar with dna and that's even true among centenarians and people that are just genetically blessed to live longer excellent question the studies that i've seen and actually the one that we participated in i don't think we had people over 80. okay i don't know the answer to that but for people between about 20 and 80 there's a stereotypical change in methylation patterns on dna and this is just a chemical change to dna that happens over time that's quite characteristic of your chronologic age this is the what david sinclair talks about as sort of the scratching of the cd the cd being the master copy of your genomic yeah i guess we have to say something like that because we can't use wearing out of the vinyl anymore but i think about it a little differently i think about aging fundamentally as a biologic process controlled by pathways and presumably it's a consequence of changes in gene expression and this methylation changes gene expression so it's a pretty cool story and certainly we know that if you take a differentiated cell and treat it with a set of transcription factors called the yamanaka factors you can reset the cell back to a pluripotent stem cell and the methylation goes away too so i'm thinking that dna methylation likely could be causally related to the expression gene expression changes that not only are associated with aging but may cause aging so has anybody looked at the effect on the horvath clock or dna methylation in response to the rapologs we've been discussing today i'm thinking of one experiment but i don't know that it's published yet and i think the answer was negative so it's interesting because the paper that i was talking about again there are 10 ways to sunday this could just be an outlier especially without a control group i mean it's really difficult to make any conclusion but if any of this benefit was real which was growth hormone dhea and metformin set the horvath clock back i think was a year and a half or two and a half years the initial hypothesis of the experiment was that this was going to improve thymic function which was going to improve immune function doesn't seem like a stretch that you could potentially see that benefit from a wrapalog if it's also acting on immunity which is why i think i was sort of probably why i asked about the thymus in the past yeah so i have a few comments about this one is first dhea we know goes down substantially with age but there have been several to many studies of replacing it and there's no clinical benefit and i think the author used it for the effect of reducing the hyperinsulinemia that follows the administration of growth hormone and in his i think personal experience taking growth hormone noted that he could blunt the hyperinsulinemia by taking something like 50 milligrams of dhea by itself but again i've that's not something that's well documented in the literature and your point of course is documented which is dhea by itself you can fix the number but that doesn't seem to have any clinical bearing exactly my second point is the growth hormone the biologic activity of it is mostly driven not exclusively by igf-1 which used to be called i think somatomedon when we were in medical school we know that lymphoid tissue is probably the most sensitive target organ for igf-1 and it causes hypertrophy so if he's looking for enlarged thymus in patients he's treating with growth hormone i would be surprised if you did not see that and he did and so the question is wouldn't you have expected that to have sped up growth i would have expected if he treated long enough i would have expected to increase the size of the thymus if he could find it in people i believe the study looked at mri and showed an increase in thymic size they were treated for a year i believe not surprised at all i bet the spleen increased too is there any reason to believe that that would enhance immune function i'm thinking if i've read a paper about that and i don't know and then what about the metformin wrench in the works metformin is a really interesting compound i think we have excellent data than in diabetics it is a wonderful drug and there's some retrospective data of longevity in diabetics treated for a long time with metformin and of course this is the question near barcelona wants to answer with the tame study right and near and i have spoken about this many times and i agree that it's hard to make the case for a more beneficial agent in someone with diabetes or hyperinsulinemia metabolic syndrome or anything on that continuum on the spectrum of course the question is what is the benefit of metformin in a perfectly healthy person or even a fully optimized person with respect to other variables i'm not aware that there is a benefit of it remember it has some adverse effects on mitochondrial function too potentially it's so funny you bring that up that's exactly the question that i think most plagues me which is if it is a weak mitochondrial toxin is any benefit that you might see in a non-diabetic more than dwarfed by that downside whereas even the simplest benefit of it like a reduction in hepatic glucose output in diabetics might more than make up for the sort of inhibition yeah i don't think we know the answer to that question it's one i'm super interested in working on and actually going to volunteer for a study that will take some muscle biopsies and look at peak mitochondrial function which you can induce through certain types of exercise with and without metformin interesting yeah well lloyd this has been just a fantastic discussion i am so grateful for the introduction that tim made and it's been an honor to sit and speak with you you know i had tried to reach out to joan about a year ago i never heard back so i'm gathering it was just too busy a time but in many ways it was better to get to talk now because so much more has happened in the last year and maybe that might have been just after the ipo so it was a very busy time i'm guessing my email went to spam but this has worked out really well and i'm incredibly grateful for this i wish you all the continued success with this program well thanks we remain optimistic and we will have top-line data from the first phase three by the beginning of 2020 so the data will speak for themselves well we'll count down the days till we see it it's been a great discussion i've enjoyed being here i feel like i've said i don't know an awful lot i'm feeling a little bit like i'm back in school but it's been fun and i have some homework to do thanks well i think that's one of the beautiful things about folks that come on this podcast is great scientists saying i don't know probably more than they they know the answer so that's i think a testament to your honesty but thank you appreciate
