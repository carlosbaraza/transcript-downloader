## Description

Original release date: 8/20/2018

Matt is someone who is deeply interested in understanding the biology of aging. Why do we age? What happens to us as we age? What are the things we can do to slow the aging process? How can we delay or prevent the onset of age-related diseases? These are all questions that Matt thinks deeply about, and explores these questions with his research at the University of Washington. He is currently investigating many of these questions through the Dog Aging Project and the compound rapamycin—the only known pharmacological agent to extend lifespan all the way from yeast to mammals—across a billion years of evolution. We talk about cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease, healthspan, lifespan, and what we can do to provide longer, healthier lives for both people and dogs.

We discuss:
-Matt’s early years and his aha moment on aging [4:00];
-Studying dogs [6:30];
-Dogs, rapamycin, and its effects on lifespan and healthspan [15:30];
-An unexpected finding in presumably healthy dogs [36:00];
-Rapamycin in cancer treatment [50:00];
-Why isn’t there a rapamycin trial for Alzheimer’s disease (AD)? [1:01:30];
-If Matt could do a definitive study on life extension in dogs, with resources not being a concern, what does that experiment look like? [1:16:00]; and
-More.

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the podcast episode with Matt Kaeberlein:

1. **Executive Summary**:
The episode focuses on Dr. Matt Kaeberlein's research on rapamycin and aging in dogs. The discussion covers his groundbreaking work using companion dogs as a model for studying aging interventions, particularly focusing on rapamycin's effects on heart function, immune system, and overall health span. The conversation explores how dogs serve as an ideal model because they share our environment, unlike traditional laboratory animals.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Dogs develop similar age-related diseases as humans but with different frequencies [05:10]
- Cancer is the most common cause of death in dogs, especially in large breeds [13:04]
- Dogs show less vascular disease compared to humans but more cardiomyopathy [11:20]
- Rapamycin showed improvement in cardiac function in dogs after 10-week treatment [34:43]
- High-dose rapamycin showed 60% life extension in male mice after treatment [44:07]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Consider age-related decline in organ function as a target for intervention [58:27]
- Focus on healthspan improvements before disease onset [09:14]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Rapamycin:
- Dog study dosing: 0.1 mg/kg three times per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) [34:43]
- Lower dose: 0.05 mg/kg three times per week [35:10]
- Current cost approximately $7 per milligram [1:23:32]

5. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Cardiac function (ejection fraction, fractional shortening) [1:19:20]
- Activity tracking via GPS collars [1:19:20]
- Blood chemistry every 6 months [1:19:20]
- Microbiome analysis [1:11:45]

6. **Notable Quotes**:
"I think one of the reasons why the preclinical research has been disappointing at developing therapies for Alzheimer's disease is because very rarely have people approached that from the perspective that this is a disease of aging." [1:04:47]

7. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What is the optimal dosing schedule for rapamycin in humans?
2. How does the microbiome influence rapamycin's effects?
3. What are the best biomarkers to track rapamycin's effectiveness?
4. How does rapamycin's effect differ between males and females?

8. **References & Resources**:
- University of Washington Dog Aging Project [multiple timestamps]
- Novartis MILES trial (mentioned regarding everolimus) [24:07]
- Texas A&M Veterinary College collaboration [1:24:53]

## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD com

[00:00:41] this podcast I'll be speaking with Matt Kay Berlin at the University of Washington I met Matt about a year and a half maybe two years ago through David Sabatini who some of you may be familiar with just based on all of his remarkable work around mTOR and rapamycin Matz recognized globally for his research in the biology of Aging he got his PhD from

[00:01:01] MIT in the lab of Lenny courante who's produced a number of notable folks in this field he went on to do his postdoc at the University of Washington and after completing his postdoc he has remained there and continues to run a fantastic lab in this episode we're going to talk about his experience as the director of the dog aging project which as its name suggests focuses on the animal model of dogs for its research now of course this is really interesting because while fruit flies and yeast and mice are interesting dogs are obviously much closer to us and of course these dogs because they're pets generally have something really unique to us that virtually no other research animal has which is they share our environment and this puts them in a pretty unique spot that even the rhesus monkeys studied in the niña Wisconsin project didn't have going for them no if you haven't already done so I'd recommend listening to the podcast that

[00:01:56] I did with David Sabatini because that will get you some of the background on mTOR and rapamycin I think we get a little technical in this podcast but I suspect it's something that if you've listened to that other one with Sabbatini you'll have the background to follow and we talked about a bunch of other things that people seem to be interested in as well beyond rapamycin we also talked about nad probably get into sirtuins a little bit the other thing I really enjoy about speaking with

[00:02:19] Matt and I had so many discussions with Matt you know over meals and stuff where I think to myself after man I wish that was recorded because one I want to be able to hear it again and two it's the kind of stuff that people are always asking me and I think Matt just has such an amazing way of thinking about this stuff Matt's work is really remarkable because it's actually focusing on healthspan it's easier in some ways to study healthspan because you can study it over a shorter period of time and in particular when you look at the cardiomyopathy model meaning it's a type of heart failure that dogs experience and you look at how rapamycin can improve ejection fraction you can get these answers in a really quick period of time in fact much quicker than I think Matt even expect it and we talked of course about cancer heart disease and Alzheimer's disease so if you're interested in rapamycin if you're interested in mTOR if interested in longevity I think you're gonna find this interview very interesting it was actually recorded initially in December of 2017 as part of the interview series

[00:03:11] I was doing for my book and we may at some point throw up the video as well you can find a lot more information in the show notes of course and without further delay here's my conversation with the remarkable Matt capably Matt thank you so much for being here it's really fantastic to you know be able to talk with you in this format I've been a huge fan of your work for many years now obviously I know quite a bit about your background but I think it'd be great for the listeners to kind of get a sense of you know what did you study in college how'd you end up doing your PhD where did you do it and most of all why did it get you where you are sure so I got undergraduate degrees in biochemistry and mathematics at Western Washington

[00:03:55] University and then I went to graduate school at MIT the biology department there and my background up till that point had been in biophysical chemistry so I really went to graduate school thinking I was going to work on structural biology or x-ray crystallography or something like that and I heard a seminar by Lenny grantee who I ended up doing my PhD thesis with during my first semester at MIT where he started talking about how his lab had begun working on the genetics of Aging and try to understand you know what are the factors that influence the rate of aging and this was in yeast that's what his lab worked on at that point and it was really almost like an aha moment where it just clicked with me that it was really fascinating that you could use genetics and molecular biology and biochemistry to study something as complicated and fundamental as the biology of Aging and so I got fascinated by the topic I ended up going and talking to Lenny and then subsequently doing my thesis research with him so it was really that that moment of hearing him talk my first year in graduate school that got me interested in aging and that's what I've been fascinated by and passionate about since then and so then I went on and did a postdoc with

[00:05:10] Stan fields at the University of Washington also working on Aging and then ultimately he started my own lab so it's been almost two decades now that I've been working on this problem if my memory serves me correctly when you were in Lenny's lab who's obviously no stranger to probably people who are listening to this you worked on sirtuins correct yeah so so my thesis work was actually the the work that first showed that if you activated or over expressed a sir to and in this case it was sir to the founding member of the sirtuins in yeast that you could extend lifespan and slow aging and obviously we were very excited about that especially when a postdoc who was in the lab at that time heidi Thyssen bomb about a year later showed that you could also over express the worm version of sir to an extended lifespan and C elegans and so that was really the first example of a conserved genetic modifier of lifespan across two widely evolutionarily divergent organisms because it was a relatively similar version of sir - yeah so more different than the daft stuff that we saw in C elegans versus the IGF that we would see in some of the higher mammals right so it at that time we knew that daf-2 could extend lifespan and C elegans I don't think we knew it was what's there are similar mechanism that's right yeah now I think one of the things that makes your work so interesting is that you work on dogs okay how did you end up doing that yeah so that's relatively new in career it was about four years ago when

[00:06:42] Daniel promise low moved from the University of Georgia to the University of Washington and Daniel had started thinking about dogs as a model to understand gee how genetic and environmental factors influence the aging process and I'm a dog person I've always had dogs I have three dogs now that qualified Yeah right and I had never really made the connection between dogs as companion animals and dogs as a model for understanding aging until I talked with Daniel about this and through those conversations and occurred to me that not only could we understand genetic and environmental modifiers of

[00:07:21] Aging but but our pets could actually serve as a transformative next step in testing some of these things that we know work in laboratory mammals like mice but have never yet been taken outside of the laboratory and so it was really that sort of connection in my mind about three years ago that propelled me to really move forward with the dog aging project one major goal of which is to actually do this to take some of the interventions that we know extend lifespan and slow aging in the laboratory and test whether they have that effect in the real world in a larger mammal that's also very socially relevant I think that that's an important aspect of this people love their dogs if we can actually slow Aging in people's pets that's going to have a huge impact both on the quality of life for the pets and the owners but also the way that people think about the biology of Aging they're gonna believe it a lot more if they see that their dog is living longer and aging more slowly than just reading an article in The New York

[00:08:25] Times or wherever right right and it's you know I sort of when I talk about this I generally talk about these four classes if you carry that's going from you know yeast to flies worms and mammals but usually when we talk about mammals we're talking about mice absolutely they have a couple of problems at least right at one problem is they're generally especially if they're inbred I mean they're homozygous at all low sighs so right you have to question their applicability to us in terms of their susceptibility to disease but then the second point which you alluded to which I think the dogs might be the first quote-unquote laboratory study that gets out of this is they don't live in our environment right the mice that right right so so so the dog truly lives in the environment you and I live in which at least in theory should be the environment we care most about preventing aging in that's right I think

[00:09:14] I think that environmental variation is hugely important the genetics is also important in dogs are so there's there's a couple things that are worth mentioning dogs have some of that same genetic homogeneity if you look within individual purebred breeds but we also have many purebred breeds that are widely divergent both genetically and morphologically all you have to do is look at a chihuahua on a great day and write to see that divergence but we also have this really interesting and complex mixed breed population there's a combination of all these different genetic variants that each breed has so so we have kind of the best of both worlds in the sense that if you want to do a study in a relatively genetically restricted background you can do it in a specific breed or set of breeds but if you want to capture that genetic variation all you do is look in the mixed breed dogs but the environmental part of this I think is probably the most important from a what are we going to learn from dogs that we can't learn from mice perspective as you said dogs really share our environment to a greater extent than any other animal maybe with the exception of cats and so they're drinking the same water in fact may not even be drinking the same water most people if you drink it worse yeah right are not gonna give their dog bottled water right but they're breathing the same air if you smoke they're experiencing that or someone in the house smokes they're experiencing that secondhand smoke so they really do capture most of our environment the diet is about the only place where dogs don't quite have the same sort of nutritional diversity that people do but with an exception of diet it's the environment is pretty close now we have a pretty good idea of how we die all right I could actually map out how you and I are gonna die based on our age and a whole bunch of other factors again it's probably an oversimplification because of this species diversification but it's a general rule how do dogs die yes so I'll make one quick comment on that first of all that I think you're right that we do know what diseases most often kill people and that's important information

[00:11:20] I'm not sure it's the most important information because what people die from does not always equate to what they died with especially today most people are dying with chronic diseases yeah multiple comorbidities right yeah so just because you may die from heart disease it doesn't mean that you didn't have kidney disease or something moving towards kidney disease or diabetes so yeah I think it's important to a premium or they know that there are that you can have multiple diseases and only one of them is probably going to kill you having said that it is useful to think about do dogs die from and with the same age-related diseases that people do and the answer is in general the equivalency is pretty good so dogs get all of the same age-related diseases that people do they don't get them at the same frequency necessarily so one big difference is in dogs there's actually relatively little vascular disease which is a major killer in people so specifically atherosclerosis whether it be peripherally or cardiovascularly doesn't seem to be as prevalent does not seem to be as prevalent but there are breeds that die from from heart disease and certain forms of heart disease cancer is probably the most common cause of death in dogs and big dogs tend to get more cancers than small dogs but across all dogs cancer is probably the number one cause of death kidney disease is a major cause of death in dogs is the etiology of that kidney disease related to blood pressure is it related to some other nephrotic syndrome that's otherwise unidentified I don't know the answer to that yeah I don't I don't have the veterinarian background answer that one of the things that's interesting in dogs is that there's a little bit of a debate whether dogs really get

[00:13:04] Alzheimer's disease they clearly get dementia some dogs do and they clearly show cognitive decline it's not completely clear whether they get what would be clinically diagnosed as Alzheimer's disease and people apparently they do accumulate a beta in the brain whether it they get the plaques and tangles still seems to be a little bit up in the air and there are people studying that but at least at the level of cognitive dysfunction and dementia it's clear that dogs experience that with age as well so for the most part they do develop the same age-related diseases the increase in risk for those diseases goes up essentially exponentially just like in people but the relative prevalence of specific diseases is not always the same and can also be breed dependent so there it is certainly the case that within purebred dogs different breeds have different predispositions to certain diseases which is exact exactly what you'd expect based on the genetics so basically they're probably getting a little more cancer significantly more renal failure as a proximate cause of death as opposed to dying with renal insufficiency which - you're pointing a lot of humans are you they're getting a lot of heart disease but it sounds like it's more cardiomyopathy and or valvular disease but not asterisk erotic or ischemic disease and they unfortunately die of accidents just as humans do which would probably be in the top four for humans and dogs I'm guessing yeah and actually that's an interesting point you're right what I haven't seen great data on is the age distribution of death due to trauma I suspect it's gonna be mostly younger dogs but I don't know for sure so that that's actually an interesting question it is absolutely true the other thing that is worth noting about dogs is it's actually the case that most pet dogs don't die from an age-related disease they die from euthanasia which is a difference between yes that's a great point well let's turn the discussion now to what you do about this I've been a big fan of rapamycin and tour in that entire pathway for several years now it's become almost an obsession if one can have an obsession that's not half a lot and I think what attracted me to your work a couple of years ago probably David Sabatini pointed me in your direction so maybe three years ago it was actually after the magic paper came out in which was around 2014 yeah right so 2014 really interesting look at the human data I want to come back to that paper as it relates to immune function and stuff but maybe give us a sense of how you decided that next logical step was to actually test the god molecule as I like rapamycin right in this context in dogs yeah yeah so again this was all happening about three years ago when I first sort of made the the leap to thinking that we could test interventions in dogs and actually that's not at least for me was not an immediate that wasn't immediately obvious to me that we should so you really have to think as soon as you start talking about bringing trial of a drug out of the lab and into the real world whether it's the human clinic or the veterinary clinic in the context of aging you really have to start to think about safety and side-effects right because there is a very low tolerance for side-effects when you're talking about treating a healthy person or dog that was the first thing that I had to really come to grips with is could we do this safely and you were thinking we're not gonna take dogs that are already sick that's right we were gonna take healthy dog that's right I mean for me as somebody who is fundamentally interested in the biology of Aging the intent is to slow Aging in people before they get sick right to keep them healthy longer so in many ways it's it's the opposite of traditional medical approach biomedical research right where normally historically we wait until people are sick and then we try to cure their disease this is the reverse of that right so that's right so so because we are talking about intervening in a healthy person or a dog the tolerance for side-effects from a regulatory perspective or even just public perception is very low when you're talking about a healthy person now you know the way I view that first of all I think that is we need as a society and and within the scientific community to have a discussion about this because I think that we need to recognize that a healthy 70 year old is not the same as a healthy 30 year old right and we know what's gonna happen if we don't do anything about aging so my personal view is that there should be a tolerance for some level of risk if the outcome is going to be 10% 20% 30% more time spent in good health that's that's a discussion that we haven't had either at the regulatory level or at the society wide level but I think we need to have so I dress a little bit but I had no idea I think that's one of the most important points you could make and I sort of think a lot about this because my colleague and I were discussing this the other day which was you know you take this oath at the end of medical school the Hippocratic oath weren't you first thing you learned to say is first do no harm and I think the spirit of that is excellent but I also think it's highly impractical in a world where it forces you into binary thinking which is we will only undertake interventions that are guaranteed to have no harm and otherwise we will do nothing right regardless of the outcome which of course it's not practical we live in a probabilistic world where the probability of harm is not 0 or 1 but rather it's a continuum between 0 and 1 and you really need to take a risk-adjusted a prose that's right to out some so I mean I think that's a yeah that's exactly right so I had to kind of go through that thought process in my own head though and especially thinking about moving into pet dogs where because of the way that that many people feel about their pet dogs you have to be as sure as you can that you're not gonna hurt anybody's pet and they like the more than their friends yeah absolutely right yeah people love their dogs right a lot of people feel similarly about their dogs as they do about their kids right so you kind of think that's kind of the way I thought about it is could we do this in somebody's child and so with rapamycin there is a perception out there that I don't share but there's a perception out there that rapamycin has lots of side effects based mostly on the human clinical literature which to be clear is generally in transplant patients transplant patients taking high doses and taking lots of other drugs yeah so sick people taking a high dose of rapamycin in combination with other medications right and it does have side effects there's no question about that but one of the things that's come out of my own research and other research in the field is that the both the benefits and the side effects are strongly linked to dose so so one question was is there a dose of rapamycin that will have beneficial effects in the context of healthy aging without significant side-effects that wasn't unknown I think that we're getting to the point where we're pretty sure that that's the case at least you can get some of the benefits of rapamycin and we can talk more about the data that support that but at that point it really wasn't it really wasn't clear and when you say the DOS do you think that the peak or the trough play a bigger role in toxicity yeah so that's that's still an unknown but I think the data that are out there suggests that the trough levels are most strongly correlated with side effects now what is most strongly related to health span or life span there's no data as far as I know and this is an area where I think there's a lot of work that could be done and should be done exploring more broadly even in laboratory animals in mice the sort of dose response and dose timing space for where do you get the biggest effects on lifespan or specific measures of health where don't you get any effects can you uncouple say the improvements and heart function from the improvements in immune function by changing the dose or the timing there really has been very little done on it now maybe for the listener who's not familiar with the pharmacokinetic discussion let's explain maybe trough and peak how did we think about those dose yeah so when you give a medication they have a rapamycin pill when a person takes a rapamycin pill there will be a rapid increase in the levels of the drug in the blood mm-hmm and if they don't take another dose then the drug will start to get cleared and it will go down and so if you're taking a pill every day as soon as you take the pill the blood levels go up and then it starts to get cleared and then the next day you take the pill it goes up and then it starts to get cleared so if you were to take the pill every other day it would go down further before you get that spike again so the spike the top of the spike is the peak level the bottom before you take the nectar next dose is the trough and so the little bit of data that's available and again there's not much data for different doses of rapamycin in people who are not also taking other drugs so the combination here is both dose and rapamycin as a mono therapy and so really the only study that I know of that looked at this really at all actually didn't even use rapamycin they used a derivative of rapamycin called rad zero zero one everolimus that's the Manics turn story we talked about so there's really no good data in people on different doses of rapamycin as a mono therapy in healthy people so we're kind of stuck looking at the data that we have so in in Jones study with everolimus or rad 0:01 they gave the medication to healthy elderly people and they tested three dose and delivery combinations so one of them was I believe 20 milligrams once a week one of them was 5 milligrams once a week and one of them was 1 milligram a daily right and this was looking in the context of immune function as measured by a flu vaccine response so the outcomes were that I think at all 3 doses they saw evidence for improved vaccine response which was consistent with prior data in mice that immune function is improved by rapamycin pause for a moment that's still a bit counterintuitive to the layperson when I say the layperson I mean like the layperson who still thinks about rapamycin all right yeah actually lots of physicians sure yeah because we think of this as an immune suppressant yeah and yet they took this drug in mono therapy under a different dosing schedule than a transplant patient would take it and we saw an improvement in their t-cell function the same cells that we tend to knock out right in a transplant right yeah so let's come back to that because that I think is that's that's an important issue but it's replicated just to come back to the the trough levels and side-effects so they saw evidence for efficacy with every delivery method although they got I think the best efficacy at the 5 dollars once a week but they also had the lowest side effects and the my side effects were what so ones every day or the 20 is once a week I think it was at the 20s once a week but I I can't remember it was pretty comparable so the first thing to say is none of the side effects were bad by clinical standards none of the people dropped out of the study because they were taking the drug which is I think a pretty good indication for how tolerable the drug is so even though they did detect some side effects they really were not serious they weren't even serious enough that they were uncomfortable and people stopped taking the drug so I think that that's really the only evidence that we that I know of that it's really the trough levels that drive side effects so

[00:24:32] I kind of think that's probably true but I'm not confident and I really think we need more data to know for sure it's certainly true in other classes of drugs and when you look at gentamicin for example in the auto toxicity or nephrotoxicity it's a trough problem not a peak problem right yeah so what do I have to make sure the patient's clear it before you read those so there's there are other reasons to believe that you know yeah so now coming back to this immune function there was a wash right there was so there's there's a couple things again there to consider so the data suggesting that rapamycin can act as an immunosuppressant again is almost exclusively based on very well don't shouldn't say very high doses higher doses than were tested in the Novartis study in people who are also taking other drugs that probably are true immunosuppressed basically at least two if not three other drugs that's right

[00:25:26] Arco so it's really not clear to what extent rapamycin as a mono therapy in healthy people has immunosuppressive properties and the data in mice I would say is mixed it really seems to be the case then for some forms of a Mian challenge at high doses rapamycin can enhance susceptibility to infection for other forms of immune challenge and enhances function but again those studies are almost always done at very high doses of the drug that are even much higher than you would give to a person so it's it's an unknown now what seems to be the case both in mice and people is that short-term treatment with rapamycin in an old mouse or an old person followed by a two-week washout where they stopped taking the drug when you then test immune function at least as measured by a vaccine response you get a better response so one model would be that the treatment with rapamycin is restoring immune function in an aged animal probably through enhanced stem cell function although I don't I think that that hasn't really been demonstrated clearly and you might need that washout here if there is an immunosuppressive effect you might need that washout period to be able to see that rejuvenation and immune function again that's really speculative though cuz nobody's done in Jones paper did they do I'm sure they didn't actually know what I think about it they didn't have enough people in this study we've been very interesting to have seen the immune challenge without the washout subset no I was just gonna say nobody's done it and either mice or in people that actually would be a fairly easy experiment to do in mice the problem is you would never get an NIH study section to fund that experiment because we already kind of know the answer that it rapamycin works they wouldn't be viewed as an even though it's really important from a translational perspective it wouldn't be viewed as innovative or important enough for somebody to fund a grant to do it so it's it's an unknown and I don't know how long it'll be till we actually get the answer to that question now bringing it back to the dogs one of the challenges of course in leaping from mice to dogs is mortality becomes difficult to study you have an animal that lives a lot longer whereas mice you know you can get a longevity answer in you know months if you select them correctly in dogs if you want to study them for true hard outcome of you know death it seems they want to do so so you pick a proxy well you can yeah yeah I'm saying I'm saying like the shortest path would be let's look at organ function or something else right so what we did so we've done one study where it was a 10-week study of rapamycin in middle-aged healthy companion dogs and we chose heart function as our short-term measure and that again was based on Mouse data where two different actually three different labs now have shown that if you take 20 to 24 month old Mouse that's maybe then that's like a 40 year old now it's more like a 60 to 65 year old person that if you just look at the heart of a 24 month old Mouse compared to let's say a six month old Mouse you can see declines in heart function just like you can in people and and the parameters that have been studied with the respect to rapamycin specifically are mostly measures of left ventricular function so ejection fraction fractional shortening things like that and this is done by echo cardio rafi so it's relatively non-invasive so you can see a decline in function with age and what what has been seen now in three independent studies is that six to ten weeks of treatment with rapamycin is enough to cause those measures of heart function in the old mouse to go back about half way to what you would see in a young mouse so it doesn't bring you all the way back to a teenager but it gets you back to you know maybe a 35 year old heart if you're doing this sort of mouse to human equivalents and just to be clear that was how many weeks so the studies have varied is between six and ten weeks all of them saw improvements it's not clear whether you get bigger improvements by longer treatments so it's kind of in that range and these animals also require a washout to see the benefit no washout so these are measures of heart function taken while inks are still on the rapamycin and these animals were dosed daily so yes all three of those studies used the encapsulated rapamycin in the diet so they were getting the drug daily and it was not and this is where it gets a little bit complicated because I'd say 85% of the studies on Aging or age-related functional measures in mice with rapamycin have been done with an encapsulated form of rapamycin in the diet we call it Arafa and so that's different from a pill right because mice are gonna eat throughout the night so they're probably not experiencing exactly the same pharmacokinetics that you would experience from a pill or the other kinds of experiments that people have done in mice have been injections where you get you know this rapid peak in the drug and then a pretty steep drop-off as the drug starts to get earlier nobody's ever done that like the 24-hour measures of rapamycin blood level on the mice getting very different yeah so I don't know how different it is but it's probably different in the sense that it's probably a more stable level of rapamycin in the blood for a longer period of time rings I mean I would expect that the e-rep animals are gonna have lower Peaks and higher troughs I mean that would be that would be the expectation yes but I don't know that anybody's ever really looked at that so having said that I think all three of the studies that looked at heart function in mice used the ear app and it was a pretty low dose of the the common eight milligrams per kilogram it's 14 parts per million in the food I don't remember off the top of my head what that works out to in milligrams per kilogram I feel like it's in the about the two range Wow but much well yeah but again you have to you have to keep in mind that you can't translate the dosing across species very well two milligrams per kilogram and a mouse is not going to be the same as two milligrams per kilogram in a person or it because the dogs in the humans I suspect are probably a lot closer than you would think so although I don't know that there's actually good evidence to support that so certainly in terms of body size if you're talking about a bigger dog they're they're closer in terms of metabolism of the drug though that I imagine could very have had actually beers two species I don't know that's a good question I'm pretty sure it's not ready for yeah it's obscene as a supporter that's gonna be in the liver so how did you ultimately come up with both a dose and a schedule of delivery for your first trial so this again goes back to this question that I was asking myself can we do this safely and there's very little data in dogs on rapamycin at all and just like in people there's almost none on rapamycin as a mono therapy and healthy animals so I started you know basically digging and talking to as many veterinarians as I could to find out what was known and I was very fortunate to actually be able to get in touch with a veterinary group at the

[00:32:36] University of Tennessee who was studying rapamycin in dogs who had had hemangioma of the spleen and so they had done the pharmacokinetics and had developed the dosing strategy that they feel is extending life expectancy and dogs who have had him angiosarcoma of the spleen and where they weren't seeing side-effects and they had had some of their dogs on rapamycin for more than a year so so we were pretty confident or I was pretty confident after talking to them that if we took their dosing strategy that we're unlikely to see any significant side effects over a 10-week period and so I said the cardiac function was the functional endpoint that we were using really the goal of that 10-week study though was to confirm just a phase one base we could do this that we could get people to participate they would actually give their dog the medication and that we didn't see any significant side effects so I was pretty confident that based on their dosing and delivery protocol we at least wouldn't see any severe side effects in a ten-week at the nih fund that study well not directly so we got a little bit of nih money because we have one of these nathan shock

[00:33:44] Centers of Excellence in the biology of Aging and we had a small amount it was on the order of a few tens of thousands of dollars left over from the prior year and so I asked Felipe Sierra who's the head of the division of aging biology at NIH if we could use that surplus specifically for this project and he was he was kind enough to to agree to that but it wasn't we didn't write a grant and get it but you sort of bootstrap this thing yeah so actually I paid for this study mostly out of funds that I had gotten because I was recruited to get a job somewhere else and as part of my retention package the University of

[00:34:20] Washington gave me some money that I could spend on whatever I wanted to and I thought this was a good way to spend the money so what did that 10-week study show right so first of all I'll go back to the dosing before I oh that's right yeah yeah so so I talked to this group the University of Tennessee and so their strategy was 0.1 milligrams per kilogram given three times a week okay Monday

[00:34:43] Wednesday Friday and that made sense to me in light of the what we were just talking about from the manic paper where it seems like if you give an extra day to let the trough levels get down it made intuitive sense all sisiter yeah so I don't know that that's the case but but it made sense and so that was the dosing strategy that we went with for our highest dose and then we also tested a dose that was half of that so 0.05 milligrams per kilogram again Monday

[00:35:10] Wednesday Friday so we enrolled dogs into this study this was a very small study all for it at a private veterinary specialty clinic in the Seattle area and so the dogs had to be at least 40 pounds and at least 6 years old and they could not have any pre-existing conditions so again this is a study of healthy aging we wanted healthy dogs coming into the study six years old at that weight range we figured that that would be you know roughly the human equivalent of 55 years maybe big dogs age faster than small dogs so that's why we had the weight criteria so we wanted to have a population where we expected there would be the potential for some age-related functional decline but that we wouldn't get a high proportion of death you don't be too close to the edge of the cliff that's right that we're really sick so one thing we we found though that was unexpected was that about 20% of dogs and that age and weight range actually have asymptomatic heart disease that you will see if you give them an echocardiogram but you won't detect from a stethoscope exam and that was in hindsight it kind of makes sense right again heart function is going to go down with age and where you decline like what is the clinical threshold that we call disease is sort of a moving target sometimes right if a vet with the stethoscope takes a heart murmur and then they give the dog an echocardiogram and they see regurgitation they'll call that heart disease if they don't hear a heart murmur nobody's gonna give their dog an echocardiogram right it's expensive yeah and so I'm not a cardiologist but I can't imagine the day would ever come we're using a stethoscope I could detect you know a low EF like to the tone of right yeah I mean unless you would not get that no no it's really the regurgitation their hearing is as a heart murmur and and that was most of most of the dogs that we ended up having to exclude we had to exclude because they had a pre-existing education that came out from the echocardiogram but this was actually a discussion that we had to have with the cardiologist you know the cardiologist initially went into the study with the feeling that if there's any regurgitation that's beyond trivial you know that that's heart disease and so we when we started to see dog after dog show up with this level of regurgitation we had to have this discussion what's normal aging versus disease right in right and so just because of the way that the protocol was written we ended up having to exclude about 20% of dogs because they had underlying heart disease so so we had 40 dogs come into the study for their first exam that was our target number we ended up having 24 go all the way through the study most three groups three doses plus yeah yeah and they ended up not being evenly distributed and in part this was this was because part is because of my first clinical trial that I had ever done and I didn't didn't plan for the fact that we would have to exclude as many dogs as we did so the way it ended up was we had 8/8 placebo 11 high dose and five medium lower dose yeah right that went all the way through we only had one dog leave the study and that was because the owner just stopped giving their dog the medication and we had one dog where the owner gave their dog the wrong amount of the medication which ironically enough was a physician low so the dog was randomized into the high rapamycin group and ended up getting one quarter of the expected dose so other than that there was fantastic compliance all of the owners did what they were supposed to came in for their exams so the main outcomes of this study were one there was no evidence for increased side effects so the owners filled out weekly surveys that there was a long list of the dogs didn't fill them yeah well you never know there was a long list of did your dog experience any of these things and then there were a couple of just open-ended questions you know do you feel like you observed any positive changes there were negative changes in health did the group in Tennessee see the Aptos ulcers in their dogs because that's seems to be I remember as a resident when we would give rapamycin I mean the biggest complaint by far was those abscess ulcers yeah and we didn't again in hindsight we we probably should have done a better job of looking but we did not have any evidence that that that was happening the only thing that initially

[00:39:29] I thought that maybe we were detecting that was because we had several owners then this was while the study was still blinded so I didn't know which dogs were which at this point we had several owners report that their dog was drinking a lot more water and a couple of them actually came in for urinalysis and stuff like that and so I thought maybe that that could be like a dogs response if they have sores on the inside of their mouth and they're uncomfortable maybe that would be the sort of the canine equivalent of how they would yeah as it turns out though when we unblinded the study that reported observation of increased water consumption was equally spread between the placebo and rapamycin group so I don't know if that's happening in dogs that's something we'll look at in the next phase so again for all of the side effects though that we surveyed owners on no difference between treated and untreated the blood chemistry showed no significant changes with rapamycin which was actually a little bit surprised you do a glucose tolerance test we did not do any we did not do a glucose tolerance test in part because we wanted to keep the the number of assays that we were asking the owners to subject their dogs to as small as possible make it as non non invasive as possible for the animals we did get blood chemistry at at week you know before randomization at week three and at week 11 so within one week of coming out of study and we saw improvements in heart function now I will say it's a small cohort they were on sort of the borderline of statistical significance so two of the three measures that we had as our primary endpoints the three measures were ejection fraction fractional shortening and eja ratio and again that was just coming directly from the mouse studies two of those three were statistically significant one was p-value of point oh six yeah I mean you must have been underpowered on absolutely anything yeah that's amazing you saw surgeries I agree yeah so I think the way I view this is it's it's about the most positive outcome that we could have hoped for clearly needs to be replicated but at least the changes are going in the right direction and an interesting couple of interesting things when you actually look at the heart data it very much looks like the dogs on rapamycin that got the biggest benefits were the ones that started with the lowest function which is not surprising but that also is encouraging because that's that's kind of what you'd expect right the Dodge would have undergone a greater age-related decline are likely to be the ones that are gonna get the biggest benefit from a treatment that's actually affecting that so that was really encouraging and then we actually had one

[00:42:03] Doberman Pinscher in the study and this turned out to be interesting because Doberman Pinschers as a breed are highly prone to dilated cardiomyopathy something like 60 65 percent of donor Pinschers will develop dilated cardiomyopathy as they get older I wasn't really aware of this literature going into the study uh-huh but it turns out that many Doberman

[00:42:27] Pinscher owners will actually give their dogs echocardiograms or electrocardiograms routinely as they're getting older to try to detect dilated cardiomyopathy as early as possible and this the owner of this dog didn't tell us this before she came into the study had actually been aware of this and was giving her dog echocardiogram before coming into the study that dog had low cardiac function but it was not yet to the point where it was clinically but as dilated cardiomyopathy so our cardiologist in the study also not knowing the dog's history of having prior echoes did not flag the dog is needing to be excluded so the dog was randomized it just happened to be randomized into the higher rapamycin dose and its function was that was one of the dogs where we saw the largest improvement in function what is interesting about that is the owner then after the study was over continued to get echocardiogram every three months and has shared that information with us and so it's really it's an end of one but it's a really fascinating sort of case study because you can see the dogs cardiac function declining then the dog comes into the study gets rapamycin it shoots up it's quite a dramatic increase and then within about was the increase in EF do you remember I don't remember I don't want to say the exact there was a big it was from the borderline of being a dilated cardiomyopathy up at least 10 10 % percent yeah an absolute person that's right it's yeah enormous yeah well ince back into the normal range yeah and has that patient or that patient has that woman shared with you what the resulting decline in EF has been the trial about

[00:44:07] I've got the data out to about six months and and we're just now trying to reconnect with her to see if if she has additional data that she'll share with us by about six months out the ejection fraction and fractional shortening we're back right at the point when the dog came into the study and at that point her cardiologist diagnosed the dog is called DCM so so clearly going down the path to dilated cardiomyopathy in a study like that or in a case like that is if you had to guess what would be the ideal way to take care of that dog to delay the onset of cardiomyopathy as long as possible would it be just keep this dog on that dose three times a week in perpetuity would it be give the dog a 10-week holiday ten on ten on ten off right so it's clearly ten on every six months is just a seesaw in fact if everyone is working the way that that yeah we think it is yeah my guess is that the default there would be to keep the dog on the drug unless you start to see side-effects right so so continue to monitor by eka every three months and unless you see side effects or unless you see something else that makes you worried that rapamycin is is having a negative effect just keep the dog on on the drug but you know it's an unknown as to whether we would eventually see side effects at that dose because you know as I said the only data that I know of is that University of

[00:45:32] Tennessee group you know where they did have some dogs that survived more than a year and continued to take the drug those dogs you know as I said had had him angiosarcoma of the spleen they'd had surgeries you know they were very sick coming into that study and so I don't know even if there were mild side effects that you would really be able to you know to tease that apart from everything else that's going on with those dogs there are other larger mammal studies that are going on correct with rapamycin yes pacifically so there are well so there are research studies in the context of Aging in marmosets they're very small and and very early but but those are being done at the

[00:46:08] University of Texas or San Antonio yeah Texas San Antonio the Barshop Institute and then there are a variety of cancer studies in dogs with rapamycin so there's a large study of rapamycin for osteosarcoma in dogs and then there are a few smaller clinical trials but I don't know of any other large animal studies in the context of a Jetta yeah now I want to obviously come back to the anti-aging in the dogs but on the cancer topic there are some data that are actually suggesting the the increase in a toff adji that one might see with rapamycin which one would expect to see at least with them torque one inhibition might be paradoxically not ideal in the active setting of cancer right so I guess my first question is are you swayed by those data and if so what would be the teleological ination yeah so I'll say I'm not swayed much I think it's I think that those kind of data are important to be aware of I think one of the real challenges in the autophagy field is that not everybody like that we can't measure it be one of them yeah beside the fact that we kid we don't really know how to measure it I think as a as a community we really don't know what we mean when we say that autophagy is increased or decreased so different people use different markers or measures for auto fuji so my view is that one of the things that can happen not just for cancers but for lots of different pathologies is one of the ways that cells try to deal with many different forms of stress in particular protein misfolding but also other forms of stress is to turn up Auto Fuji so I think that auto fuji some markers of auto fuji going up can be a response to a pathological condition also what often happens is that response of turning up potaka G does not lead to productive auto fuji so you actually get an accumulation of auto phagosome 'z because they don't ever make it all the way through the process and so depending on how you're measuring a tofu g what you really might be detecting as a block at the late stages of auto fuji and what you're seeing is you're measuring a backlog that's right yeah so it's not necessarily the case that more Auto Fuji is bad in that context it's the failure to actually bring it to completion and again I don't have a lot of data to support this my intuition is that at least for some diseases one of the things that rapamycin does and I don't really understand the molecular biology here it seems to alleviate that block so you actually get productive etapa G working again and again I don't know exactly how that works but that's what it seems to me is happening and so we have seen some evidence for this in mitochondrial disease in the brain where if we look in the brain we can see these sort of massive auto phagosome that are trying to digest mitochondria that can't do it while the disease is progressing and somehow rapamycin fixes that so I think you have to be cautious in interpreting an increase in autophagy markers in a disease as necessarily meaning that increased etapa G is causing or contributing to that disease and it could be the case that depending on how you activate our toffee G it could be a detrimental or it could be beneficial and so there's really two different questions the first would be if you take a patient with cancer and you inhibit mTOR is it not helpful because the tumor has already evolved so much to be outside of M tour's purview or is it it's actually harmful and that's of course separate from the option that could be helpful right so my understanding of the clinical and the literature in humans is that for most cancers once it's reached the point of diagnosis that rapamycin is disappointing in its effectiveness it's not particularly effective that's not true for all cancers but for most cancers it has not been as effective as you might expect given that we know that activation of mTOR is common when you get high proliferation and they're turning down and poor should stop that turn off for a collaborative self so I think I think you're probably right that at least part of the story is that one of the steps in the progression to cancer is evolving to ignore that signal to break yeah turning down mTOR so rapamycin may not be effective there I think it's a complicated system though because the effects of rapamycin on the immune system could have beneficial effects in terms of cancer or detrimental effects so we know that immune surveillance is probably the most important anti-cancer mechanism certainly one of the most pardon anti-cancer mechanisms and we know that immune function goes down with age that's probably one of the reasons why most cancers are age-related so if you can boost age-related immune function with rapamycin enhance immune surveillance that's gonna have a potent anti-cancer mechanism and again this is my guess my guess is that's why we see in the studies in mice that cancers are pushed back during aging by rapamycin on the other hand if the dose of rapamycin is high enough that you're actually inhibiting immune function that could be that could promote amplify sirs yeah and there's not a lot of data yet so we did one study in my lab where we gave mice I think it's the highest dose that's ever been given in the context of an aging study this was a daily injection of 8 milligrams per kilogram so we call it the party dose yeah right and so this was a study where we only gave the mice rapamycin for three months so this was from 20 to 23 months and then we stopped the treatment and what was interesting there was we got completely different effects in male mice versus female mice the male mice lived 60% longer after the end of treatment they had better muscle function they got less cancer the female mice had no difference in lifespan the mice the got rapamycin or didn't get rapamycin but they died with I want to say from but it's hard to say for sure what a mouse dies from they died with very different types of cancers so the female mice that had gotten this high dose of rapamycin for 3 months all had aggressive hematopoietic cancers hmm whereas about I think it was about 30 or 40 percent of the vehicle treated mice so the in black 6 that's not an onion again but none of the rapamycin treated mice had non tomato pointed cancers whereas like 60% of the mice that didn't get rapid mice now the 2009 study that kicked all this off actually showed a greater survival benefit in the female mice didn't it that's right so I think and again this is a guess because I don't actually have the data to back it up my guess is that because we push the dose so high we might have actually taken it too far in the female so one school of thought is that female mice at least we don't know if the is true in any other organism female mice are more sensitive to rapamycin and that could either be that they don't clear the drug as quickly or that for whatever reason and female mice the same amount of rapamycin has a greater emmett or inhibitory effect but that's one school of thought and I kind of think that's right so at lower doses of the drug you see a bigger lifespan benefit in females than man did you repeat that experiment at like four migs per kick or something - haven't we have it with we should so we did do I just need to tell you finit pooling money I do all the things like just answer all the grabs the most important questions and I think the dose response is really important we did do a lower dose for three months as well and there we saw increases in lifespan in both males and females roughly the same magnitude so it was that dose was nine times higher than what the ITP tested well so one of the things that's interesting though is as you go higher in dose so 3 times higher than what they originally tested the females still live a little bit longer but the difference between males and females the gap has closed quite a bit so I think that females for whatever reason at a given concentration of rapamycin are just more affected by that amount of the drug and I think what we did in our high dose study is we just pushed it a little too far we pushed it to the point where rapamycin did something probably to the immune system that that allowed these immune cancers to to escape surveillance or become hyper proliferative and again I'm not

[00:54:51] I'm not a cancer biologist I'm not an immunologist so I don't I don't have a good feel for what the mechanism is I can tell you what the observation is and that's that all of those animals had aggressive hematocrit cancers when they got this 3 months of rapamycin just out of curiosity more beef seller t-cell do you recall they don't recall it's in the paper we can look it up because there's an opportunity here to do the reverse right

[00:55:13] I mean there's an opportunity to take right now we're seeing just an unbelievable amount of activity and adoptive cell therapy and or even when you just talk about like checkpoint inhibitors and things like that like it makes you wonder are there ways to make these things better maybe the checkpoints the wrong example because you might get more autoimmunity but but certainly when you talk about adoptive cell therapy anything that could boot either you know cd8 function or inhibit the regs or something there might be ways I can almost makes you wonder if using rapamycin in a different manner in combination with immune base therapy that might make more sense yeah I know I think there's a lot that could be done there for sure part of the reason why we haven't explored this in more detail one reason is again as I said I'm not a cancer biologist so it's not that's not the thing I'm most interested and I think it's really interesting biology but it's not the thing I'm most interested in but

[00:56:02] I also feel like because the dose that we gave was so high that again thinking translationally about rapamycin as a drug in the context of aging my feeling is that what we've uncovered here is not going to be relevant at the doses that we would think about giving to so that's why I haven't really spent a lot of my time trying to figure out what's going on there but I think certainly in the context of cancer immune therapies I think we do need to think a little bit more about how effective those kinds of therapies are going to be in the elderly and maybe something like rapamycin could help could actually enhance the ability of those thing I mean this question you posed when when David Sabatini Tim

[00:56:47] Ferriss and knavish endo and I were an Easter Island a year ago over a year ago this might have been our favorite mealtime discussion which is what best explains the increase in cancer incidence with age being in other words what with a primary driver be the reduction in immune surveillance or the length of time to accumulate mutations or the frequency of mutations like I mean yeah it's not an obvious answer and

[00:57:13] I don't think it has to be just one no exact it's almost call this likely to be all of it yeah yeah yeah I certainly over the last few years have come to think that the decline in immune function is it's certainly more important than I had initially thought but that's my I mean I secretly want that to be the biggest driver because I think we have a better chance to control that yeah than some of the other ones and I think it probably is that would be my guess and I also think it kind of makes sense that if you have an immune system that's functioning the way it's supposed to you can actually deal with the mutation accumulation because your immune is going to clear those mm-hmm before they become yeah problems so now let's go back to the anti-aging thesis right which is we're gonna take healthy dogs eventually healthy people we want to reduce the rate of decline it's probably the best way to think about it right so we have a deterioration so we a yeasted in organ function okay all right one of the things that's been surprising to me again over the last few years is the different ways that rapamycin not only seems to delay the decline but it seems to make things better there clearly seems to be in at least some organs or rejuvenating function and

[00:58:27] I suspect that's mostly stem cell mediated but again the mechanisms haven't been worked out yet so we've already talked about immune function you can take an old immune system and make it work more like a young immune system we've talked about cardiac function it can take an old heart you make it work more like a young heart there's some evidence from David's lab that intestinal stem cells okay can be rejuvenated by rapamycin we've recently published that alveolar bone levels so in the mouth the brown around the teeth can be rejuvenated back to a more youthful level by short-term treatment with rapamycin so there are now multiple different places in the body at least in mice where you actually see functional improvements back to a more youthful state and so I don't think rapamycin is gonna do that for everything but at least four tissues and organs where stem cell senescence plays a big role

[00:59:18] I suspect that rapamycin can have not just an effect on delaying declines but actually bring things partially back towards a more youthful functional state what's the best available evidence for that centrally in the CNS mmm that's a good question so there are Studies on cognitive function in mice showing that that you can improve cognitive function in aged animals I believe at least one of those started the treatment late in life and saw improvements in cognitive function and then in all of the major

[00:59:53] Alzheimer's disease mouse models you can the literature is a little bit mixed there's at least evidence that you can wait until the pathology of the disease has set in you see the a beta accumulated you see the functional deficits in terms of cognitive function you can start the treatment and you can improve things and on post-mortem are you seeing an actual reduction and yeah yeah you are so we haven't done this so this is the work of several other labs in the ad area yes so again the date is a little bit mixed so there are a couple of papers out there where they they see that you can get really robust benefits if you start rapamycin treatment early but they didn't see benefits and the ad models when you started late and then there are studies that that did see declines in aggregation increased auto foggy and functional improvements minimum we start layering if you could take an animal and ultimately of course a human who's already accumulating a B and tau yeah and even just halting that is a big deal there's one drug right and you know yeah yeah now you're going right into my biggest pet peeve right now which is why there hasn't been or isn't a kernel rapamycin trial for Alzheimer's disease but I think you're right and I and again three years ago if somebody had asked me will rapamycin is it likely to have any benefit in somebody who's been diagnosed with AD I would probably said no I come around to thinking that there's at least a reasonable chance that it cannot just halt progression but it could actually make well especially if you you know one of our colleagues is a neurologist here named Richard Isaacson and he runs the largest Alzheimer's prevention clinic in the country at Cornell you know

[01:01:31] Richard's thesis which I think makes a ton of sense is again I think other people share this view is you want to catch people while they just have the first signs of mild cognitive impairment sure absolutely and your ability to actually impact them is enormous and and so the question is why aren't those people being considered for clinical trials when we already know that these other agents aren't really doing anything right yeah I agree I think that if I was going to design a clinical trial for Alzheimer's disease or dementia with rapamycin that I thought had the best chance of success that would be the target population those trials are harder to do in some ways because they're longer during and not everybody moves from MCI to all blow and AD at the same rate and we don't have at least my understanding is we still really don't have great predictive biomarkers of how fast that's going to happen and in an individual but that would be the that would be the study that would have the best chance of working having said that I still think there's a decent chance in somebody who's you know already gotten to the point where where they will be diagnosed as having Alzheimer's disease serious functional deficits there's a chance that rapamycin could make things better now I get the practical reasons for why people don't want to try a risky clinical trial it's expensive if you fail you know you're then your drug gets a bad reputation all of that so I understand why people are hesitant to do that trial I think there's actually a pretty good chance especially you can combine it I mean I think you know

[01:03:00] Richard often talks about and and others do as well that one of our failures in Alzheimer's as we consider it a single disease I agree it's as naive as saying John has cancer oh well gosh that's the end of his life right well don't you want to know what kind of cancer first or maybe what mutation so similarly but broadly speaking and this is a gross oversimplification if you consider the metabolic version of Alzheimer's disease the vascular version of Alzheimer's disease and then the sort of toxin clearance impaired version of the disease to me I'm generally most optimistic about the metabolic one so the variant of this disease that seems to be mostly due to a failure of energy metabolism in the brain that also strikes me as the one that's most amenable to certain systemic therapies as well right if you improve insulin sensitivity if you improve glucose disposal if you reduce hypercortisolism exercise sleep a number of other things start to modulate that that strikes me as the one where you want to at least take your first shot at adding wrapup I think you're probably right although again with rapamycin because we know that it is effective at for example turning up atif AG it might also be might work in the harder one yeah that's a harder that I agree I tend to agree with you I think that's a good point I also want to add that I actually think the biggest problem with the way that the scientific community has thought about Alzheimer's disease aside from considering it to be one disease is not really recognizing that it's a disease of aging I really think that one of the reasons why the preclinical research has been disappointing at developing therapies for Alzheimer's disease is because very rarely have people approach that from the perspective that this is a disease of

[01:04:47] Aging and so something that can affect the mouse models of Alzheimer's disease when we create this disease in young mice may not work the same way in an aged person or an aged animal and that's one of the things that also makes me optimistic about rapamycin is we already know that it hits the hallmarks of aging you know and it also seems to be effective in these Alzheimer's disease models so that makes me think that it's acting and it was sort of a more fundamental level you have to target the molecular causes of this disease well especially look I mean if you can regenerate a cardiac myocyte from its stem cell it's not an impossible thought that you could regenerate neurologic stem cells absolutely and this is again an area where I mean 20 years ago we would have said that's impossible impossible right going back to the dogs for a moment again I'm not familiar with dog literature what is the fasting literature look like in dogs there's not a lot that I'm aware of either and I think that kind of makes sense so you know first of all you have to differentiate the literature in laboratory companies from companion dementia but there's probably not much in companion dogs I don't know of true fasting experiments in like B so we can't use like the fasted versions as proxies for what we would hope to see on the rapid dogs which is the way they sort of did it in mice right they sort of said well you know we know that if you calorically restrict this mouse this strain of mouse under this degree of caloric restriction can expect as much of a longevity boost and oh lo and behold rapamycin is probably even better than that right although from a metabolic perspective I think it's still unclear even in mice whether rapamycin and caloric restriction are working through the same mechanism and this is this is this is actually another area where there haven't been a lot of good experiments so there's a portion of the field that argues strongly that the caloric restriction and rapamycin are completely different which to my mind is absurd I mean we know that one of the main things that caloric restriction does is it inhibits mTOR right and we know that rapamycin inhibits emptor so they're not fundamentally different so I think they are overlapping but distinct not everything that caloric restriction does is going to be mimicked by rapamycin and vice versa having said that when you look at the gene expression profile or the metabolic profile they don't look all that similar at least at the low doses of rapamycin and so I think it's it's a little bit unclear you're right lifespan they both extend lifespan rapamycin might actually extend lifespan across a broader than caloric restriction but when you get beyond that

[01:07:28] I think it's still an unknown whether there are you know say are their metabolic signatures that are common to both that might therefore be more likely to be causal I think I think we don't know the answer so one other what you're really getting at is probably the next thought I had subconsciously which is could we use calorically restricted animals to develop a metabolic signature as the gold standard for how we would then titrate rapamycin both in dose and frequency I don't know of any evidence to support that but it would be a stretch yeah I mean it might be possible but there just isn't much good data out there at this point I do feel like if we want to put the resources into trying to identify predictive signatures which I absolutely think we should do I think the the metabolism and the serum metabolomic s-- a lot of sense so that would be where I would look and nobody's really done it well part of the problem is the data that's out there for rapamycin is again all at that very low dose that the ITP tested originally we know that suboptimal for lifespan it's quite likely that the effects that the lowest dose of rapamycin are having on metabolism are going to be relatively modest compared to higher doses so the changes might be there but they might be so subtle that you're not going to detect them in a sort of a high-throughput screening approach so I think there's a lot we don't know but that would be where I would put my effort in trying to identify i sirum metabolomic signature yeah of rapamycin that we could then correlate with the effects on function in a variety of different tissues as well as life yeah because I mean I think as wonderful as it would be to just wave magic wands and have biopsies of tissue it's just not going to be I mean we're not gonna take cardiac biopsies yeah right so you if you're looking for predictive signatures you can do those experiments initially in mice but you really have to think about is this something that's reasonable to do in a person yeah or a dog and have you looked at the gut biome and the dog at all a little bit so so we did a study in mice this was that that study I referred to previously where we treated them for three months with either the high high dose or the high but and we did look at the fecal microbiome and we saw quite dramatic changes there some of which are interesting and so that's that's an area that we would love to pursue I've tried to get a grant to do that and so far haven't been successful through NIH but it hasn't been done in dogs yet has not been done in dogs so we have a little bit of preliminary data from our phase 1 study and we're seeing changes on the microbiome there as well so far the data that we've got in dogs is not the sort of comprehensive metagenomic approach or every sequence everything is there it's more of a standard veterinary approach where they have sort of broad classifications of different types of microbes and there are definitely changes with rapamycin it looks it's very early but it looks as though at least in dogs that have a bad microbiome a dysbiosis in the microbiome which can be defined clinically from this test there were two dogs that we've looked at that started out with a bad microbiome they were in the rapamycin group they were better by the end of the study obviously don't know if that's meaningful or not so so there are changes in the dogs but it's really too early for us to know whether they look like the mice and or whether that is going to either be predictive or potentially play a role in some of the effects of rapamycin it is definitely the case though in both dogs and mice and I'm sure this will be true in people as well that rapamycin has a large effect on the composition of the gut microbiome I suspect that will also be true for other compartments in the body like the oral microbiome maybe even the skin microbiome nobody's looked yet so that there's a lot to be done there I also don't necessarily think that's going to be unique to rapamycin I think that lots of drugs that we take absolutely diet and it's not clear if that's the effect or the cause of it yeah so one of the reasons why I think that there's reason to think that at least some of the changes in the microbiome could be causal for some of the effects of rapamycin is that one of the things we saw in our mouse study was a pretty profound increase in a bacterium called segmented filamentous bacteria or SFB and the rapamycin treated mice it turns out if you look in the literature there are links between

[01:11:45] SFB and diabetes and obesity and also between sfb and t-helper cell maturation so it could be the case that changes that rapamycin is having on this specific bacterium as well as other bacteria are then having effects both on potentially nutrient utilization and uptake but also direct effects on say immune function I mean the intestine is an important compartment the bacteria are physically right there these SFB actually form filaments directly associated with the intestinal cells so it certainly could be the case that there are signals being sent back and forth that rapamycin is modifying by through modification of the composition of the microbiome and that that's affecting the immune function adiposity all sorts of different possibilities so like I said that's something we're really interested in in testing so there's like an infinite number of things I want to know yeah there's this company out there that's looking at duodenal ablation to ameliorate diabetes and the data are actually really interesting so interesting in fact that when I first saw them I thought this has got to be nonsense what's not clear is the durability and the economics of it that's just from a scientific standpoint they're doing these ablations of the duodenal mucosa and they're seeing like immediate step function changes in insulin sensitivity arguing in fact that this may be the mechanism by which the room and why gastric bypass is ameliorating type 2 diabetes it's basically taking this dysfunctional duo denim out of the loop right and just saying we're going to join them to jejunum yeah or you know stomach to jejunum basically it's really interesting so this is another area that I've gotten interested in and we haven't really dove into it yet much but I I think there is there's clearly literature growing in all of the model organisms that with aging there is a decline in intestinal barrier function and that at least in flies that seems to be causal for death so in other words it's strongly correlated and there are ways every way that extends lifespan also seems to improve this intestinal barrier dysfunction and I've been thinking and we have again a little bit of data suggesting that rapamycin might actually have an effect on this age-related decline an intestinal barrier function and why would a loss of intestinal barrier function be important well I mean one thing that happens we know this happens is that you tend to see an increased level of microbial proteins and DNA in the circulatory system with age that causes a inflammatory response that may contribute to the sort of systemic increase in inflammation that we see during aging so the loss of intestinal barrier function may actually drive to some extent the inflammation the increase in inflammation with aging or at least contribute to and so anything that you can do that is going to improve that will potentially have an effect on systemic inflammation and that again could be another way that rapamycin is sort of impacting the entire body in addition to the effects of rapamycin when it gets to a cell and inhibits mTOR in that cell and whether that's through changes in the microbiome yeah you know or changes an intestinal stem cell like Sabbatini has shown right there's lots of possible ways that it could be working but I do believe that this decline in intestinal barrier function with age probably is contributing to this sort of increase in systemic inflammation that we see during aging and there it's very clear that that happens in people and in non-human primates as well during aging now talking about people again I don't hold out much hope that there's going to be an anti-aging trial in humans using rapamycin or a wrap a log you know watch out how much difficulty it is to Eve try to get that study done with metformin which I mean is about the most inert you know it's like yeah you might as well just do it with drinking water right yeah we're gonna randomize you to seltzer versus flat water here so the real question is for the people who want to be on the tip of the spear you're not gonna have gold-plated stamped RCT you're going to have to triangulate from everything else many roads point to your work and more importantly what your follow-up work will look like right so again I realize that to try to secure funding to do this from NIH is slightly more complicated than trying to get bipartisan support on healthcare but if we took the economics out of the equation if there was a 10 to 20 million dollar pool that the National

[01:16:19] Institutes of aging said you know dr. K Berlin we want to we want the definitive work on how to extend the life of dogs knowing that that's probably the best thing we're going to get right towards humans what do those experiments look like right so so the study that we want to do is a five-year study with rapamycin and and certainly this is scalable right so so what we have designed is a study with rapamycin there are other interventions coming down the pipeline that I think have the potential to be as effective as rapid so this doesn't necessarily as long as you can do it safely in pet dog yeah you can test any intervention and one of the things that I am now convinced is owners are enthusiastic about participating in these kinds of studies we've had more than 6,000 people sign up through our website with no advertising at all participate in the rapamycin in human clinical trials which I'm more familiar with recruiting cost is a is an endowment doesn't cost anything you get free recurring right so having said that the study we would like to do is a five-year study in dogs starting treatment at middle age so again the dogs would come in you know at least six years old we might push that up to seven or eight years old and they prep there would probably be a weight limit or like

[01:17:37] I talked about before because again big dogs age faster so let's just say 40 pounds at six years old at least six years old so there will be dogs anywhere from six to ten or bring in 450 500 dogs or enough dogs to get 450 all the way through the study and look at not just lifespan but lifespan is actually a really important metric here right lifespan is certainly still the gold standard in the aging field if we want to convince the scientific community that this is affecting aging it darn well better increase lifespan yeah it's also important to owners for obvious reasons and I think because as we talked about euthanasia is really what most dogs die from because the dog gets sick enough that the owner and the veterinarian decide that it's time to put the dog down yeah I think lifespan is actually a really good metric of health span in dogs because most of the time that's not an easy decision right Hubbs owners are not going to put their dog down usually especially owners who want to participate in a study like this unless that dog is really sick so I actually think lifespan is really maybe more important in dogs as an outcome measure than it is in mice so lifespan is one of the key endpoints that we want to look at and then we want to look as broadly as we can at functional measures of aging that we know are important in dogs and so this goes way back to what we were talking about before what do dogs get sick with as they get older so heart function we will definitely look at in part because that's what our preliminary data yeah you showed that with a handful of dogs we have good evidence that we can detect and expect to detect improvements in cardiac function activity so one of the nice things about dogs is you can put a

[01:19:20] GPS tracker on their collar and get very quantitative measures of activity as the sensor technology improves it might be feasible to use a microchip instead of a GPS tracker on the collar to also get some physiological or a Fitbit on their wrist you know yeah right well I mean that's really what the trackers are but it would be nice to get some physiological measures in sort of continuous real-time if we can so far the sensor technology isn't quite there at least that's my understanding but well at least get activity and that'll give us a measure both of things like arthritis so dogs that have arthritis are going to be less active and also muscle function and also how how well are they feeling again a dog is more likely to be active if feel as well now obviously that's confound it a little bit by whether the owner takes the dog for a walk but I still think total activity is an important thing and is this a three group study in your mind so this study that we're designing now is three groups it doesn't have to be but the three groups are a placebo group short-term group so six month or year long treatment and then the continuous treatment group the reason for doing that again comes back to the mouse data in part because we as I mentioned we've published that a short-term treatment in mice is enough to give you large benefits on lifespan and at least some measures of health and also because again as we're thinking about ultimately bringing this to people it's easier to envision transient performance treatment than it is a continuous for the rest of your life sort of treatment so we see single dosing that's the way we have the study design now I can see a rationale for doing three months on three months off or some some variation on that we felt that the simplest thing to do first so you know it's always a balance between getting as much information as you can from a study like you and doing things that are going to be where the complexity isn't so great that it yeah your power analysis could give you it right so the design that we're working with now is one year on and then the rest of the time off and so those so we'll get have one group that's five years on one group that's one on four off and then placebo that's right blinded across the yeah it's all gonna be a randomized double-blind trial right in addition to life span and heart function and activity will track cancer incidence of a kidney kidney function get routine blood chemistry on the dogs probably every six months we'll ask the owners owners to bring their dogs in get echocardiograms collect serum for metabolomics and feces for microbiome so what would that study that you just described cost if you could complete so let's say you had to screen 600 dogs to complete 450 which actually pretty good yeah attrition so it would run about five million that's about the the budget for that study some of that depends on what we can ultimately get the rapamycin for sometimes right now it's the street values about the lowest we've been able to find is about seven dollars a milligram yeah now it may be possible if we have a large study that we can identify a supplier that would cut us a deal for for less but and the drugs are actually a pretty similar part of the cause of the budget yeah the veterinary costs or the other large expenditure again the nice thing about companion dogs it's unlike a study in mice in the lab is they live with their owners we don't pay cage costs and things like that the other major costs are going to be for the analysis the analysis and also we need people to be able to communicate with the owners retention will be important I don't think it's gonna be as hard as it is for some clinical trials just based on our experience even though it's a short-term trial the owners that came into the short-term trial they were extreme this will be easier than communicating with patients in a trial I think so yeah and there's actually I mean it's kind of funny but there's actually data that dog owners are more likely to give their dog a prescription medication than they are to take their eyes high it's not that for a second so yeah so the owners that come into this study are highly motivated and some of them are extremely disappointed after the study ends when they find out their dog was in the placebo group so but there is a communication component to this where we have to keep the owners engaged maintain communication will be sending out regular surveys - it needs to go beyond the surveys how would these all have to be dogs that live in the northwest they'd have to be able to come in in fact they almost certainly would not be so the way that we're planning the study now is that we will partner with five to seven veterinary schools around the

[01:23:49] United States so that's exciting and that actually there's a lots of reasons why that's that one is ready but veterinary cardiologists there's there's not a huge population of veterinary cardiologists out there so if we were to try and do a study like this in the Seattle area I don't think that we have the enough veterinary cardiologists to actually do that just a cardiology part of the study so fortunately you know veterinarians are very enthusiastic about participating in projects like this and we have collaborators lined up at the vet schools around the country so it will probably be five or seven sites obviously all of those sites have to have veteran a cardiology but almost any major veterinary school is going to have that and we prefer to work with veterinary schools that are in a suburban or urban area some veterinary schools like like our school in the state of Washington is all the way on the other side of the state from Seattle it's kind of out in the middle of nowhere so that makes it harder to get owners to actually bring their dogs there yeah so our lead veterinarian is at Texas A&M Veterinary

[01:24:53] College and so she would be the head clinical person on the study and that would probably be this site that the other veterinary sites plugin coordinator yeah well Matt I could sit here and have this discussion for another two hours I just have to talk about it it is and I really appreciate your time and your insights I think the work you're doing is certainly what I would consider to be among the bodies of work that are at that tip of the spear because I I guess I don't have a lot of hope we're gonna get the answer to this question directly I think it's going yeah be an indirect triangulation of of data and I think to be able to do this in companion dogs that live in our environment it's gonna be a really important thing so let's see if we can get that study done yeah I also want to

[01:25:36] I mean I think it's also important to at least note the impact of a study like this would have on public perception right I mean do I think in the absence of any data and then the little bit of data we got from the phase one study the amount of media attention that we've got Debra and I are talking about this with

[01:25:54] Terry Gross right has been huge and so I tend to agree with you that it's going to be challenging to generate enthusiasm for a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of rapamycin for healthy aging in people challenging is probably not even a strong enough word but I think we do need to or we should at least not underestimate the potential impact if we're successful at accomplishing this in people's pets that that we'll have on public perception as well as perception among the broader scientific community I do feel like the field of aging research still has a bit of a reputation problem among the broader scientific or community part of that is historical part of that is because are some fringe elements that get a lot of attention but that aren't scientifically credible I think that actually being able to show in dogs living in the human environment that we can modify aging will have an impact not just on the public in terms of I'm sure we'll get lots of media attention but also among scientists who might actually say ok aging research has arrived

[01:27:03] I think that's happening already I think the tame trial has actually been mostly a positive in that sense or the proposed tame trial I should say but I think we still have some words a listener is tired yeah which is I mean I support that study I think that it's probably the right first study in this area because as you've already said metformin we we know that it's very safe at least as far as as a drug you might consider for a study like this it's very safe there's very good human data suggesting that that diabetics taking metformin not only have less diabetes but they have fewer other age-related diseases so I think the human data is pretty compelling the downside to metformin and I think one of the reasons why it has been a struggle to get that study funded is that I think there's a perception that we already know about metformin it's not going to be completely surprising given the literature that's out there if it does have relatively small effects on other diseases and then I also think it probably isn't going to have that large of an effect I could be wrong I hope I'm wrong but again my view of the literature that's out there is that metformin probably has modest effects but they're not gonna be 20% increase in lifespan and rejuvenation of heart function and immune function so I agree so so I think that that's probably the downside to that study but but again because we're also battling this perception of resistance to the potential for side effects when you're talking about treating healthy elderly people that's probably the right way to design this first study the other thing about the tame trial though is it's not being done in healthy elderly people right the people that they're enrolling have to have at least one age-related disease and it can't be diabetes yeah so even that is really not the gold standard study that we'd all like to see whether it's metformin or rapamycin or you know something else we've got some work to do to get to where we can actually do that study and maybe the path forward is you know as you said individuals who are willing to kind of come together and do these sort of self experiments if you can do it in a rigorous way where you're actually measuring the things it needs to be a model system right that allows it so that if you and I and Bob and Rick and

[01:29:18] John do it we're right now the downside to that kind of a model is that it's it's still going to be hard to convince just the scientific community yeah the way that it is no it's much harder to convince them that it's real having said that if the effects are robust and you see it over and over and over and multiple people will get there eventually so so that may be the path that we end up taking you know I'm not betting on that path I'm betting on the path that you're describing as being the shortest distance between these two points and I hope that as we start to do more of these studies in dogs and and also the preclinical stuff in mice as we start to find functional measures that are improved over a relatively short timeframe that people will start to do some of these clinical trials that are feasible in people I mean you could

[01:30:09] I mean Novartis has already done it right you can you know do a clinical trial where you treat healthy elderly people for six weeks eight weeks ten weeks and look at a functional outcome yeah and so if it's the case that rapamycin rejuvenates immune function and rejuvenates cardiac function and and delays or restores alveolar bone levels in the mouth right those are clinical endpoints that are impactful and could be studied in a short terminal trial so we may get a few of those that will kind of build this body of evidence that rapamycin is having a similar effect in people again the hard part is there's not a lot of money in rapamycin so I don't know who's going to fund those trials that's the Challenger so we we need to identify so either it's going to be rapamycin derivatives that are under patent like Novartis --is it has developed and now rest or bio is further developing or it's going to be alternative funding sources whether that's foundations or wealthy individuals who recognized the potential impact of this work and are willing to fund a clinical trial to actually start to go inside us Matt thanks again just a super interesting and best luck with your continued work thank you you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog and the nerd Safari at Peter DMV com what's a nerd Safari you ask just click on the link at the top of the site to learn more maybe the simplest thing to do is to sign up for my subjective lean on lame once a week email where I'll update you on what I've been up to the most interesting papers I've read and all things related to longevity science performance sleep etc on social you can find me on Twitter Instagram and
