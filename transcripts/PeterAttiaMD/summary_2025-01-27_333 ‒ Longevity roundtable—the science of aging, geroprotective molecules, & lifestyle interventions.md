## Description

In this special episode of The Drive, Peter introduces a brand-new roundtable format. Joined by three renowned experts in longevity science—Steven Austad, Richard Miller, and Matt Kaeberlein—the group explores the rapidly evolving field of geroscience. Together, they dive deep into topics like the relationship between healthspan and lifespan, evaluating interventions like rapamycin and senolytics, the role of epigenetic changes in aging, and whether GLP-1 receptor agonists hold geroprotective potential. They also tackle major challenges in funding and public acceptance of longevity research including how geroprotective interventions might be tested in humans. Packed with nuanced debate, humor, and groundbreaking insights, this episode is a must-listen for anyone fascinated by the science of aging.

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of this longevity roundtable discussion from The Drive podcast:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode featured a high-level discussion between experts in aging research, including Rich Miller, Steve Austad, Matt Kaeberlein, and Peter Attia. They discussed the current state of aging research, funding challenges, biomarkers, and various interventions. Key themes included the distinction between healthspan and lifespan, the challenges of measuring biological aging, and the critical need for more research funding in aging biology.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- NIH funding for aging research is approximately 0.5% of total budget, despite aging being the primary risk factor for 9 of top 10 causes of death [00:27:29]
- Rapamycin consistently extends lifespan in mice across multiple studies [02:25:05]
- Metformin's effects on aging remain uncertain, with methodological flaws in key studies [02:12:14]
- NAD precursors show mixed results, with ITP studies showing negative evidence [02:38:49]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Exercise benefits extend beyond longevity to quality of life [01:43:44]
- Focus on both healthspan and lifespan, as they are interconnected [00:10:14]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- Rapamycin dosing typically 3-6mg weekly in humans [02:32:51]
- Resveratrol lacks convincing evidence [02:35:52]
- NAD precursors show limited evidence of benefit [02:39:36]

5. **Exercise & Movement**:
- Exercise clearly extends lifespan but unclear if it truly slows aging [01:42:51]
- Exercise increases GDF11 in blood, which may have beneficial effects [01:44:38]

6. **Nutrition & Diet**:
Limited discussion of specific dietary interventions in this episode.

7. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Epigenetic age tests show high variability between different commercial products [02:42:09]
- Need for better aging rate indicators versus simple biomarkers [01:26:19]

8. **References & Resources**:
- ITP (Interventions Testing Program) studies referenced throughout
- McKenzie report on economic impact of healthspan extension [01:53:48]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"I haven't seen anything to make me believe that you can separate healthspan and lifespan" [00:10:29]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
- How can aging research funding be increased?
- What are the best aging rate indicators for human studies?
- How do we better translate mouse studies to humans?

The discussion highlighted the complexity of aging research and the need for more rigorous scientific investigation while acknowledging the challenges of funding and implementation.
