This clip is from episode #357 ‒ A new era of longevity science: models of aging, human trials of rapamycin, biological clocks, promising compounds, and lifestyle interventions | Brian Kennedy, Ph.D.

In this clip, they discuss:

- Hallmarks vs. Pillars of Aging – While frameworks like “hallmarks” and “pillars” of aging provide structure, they don't explain the true cause of aging, as everything is highly interconnected
- Interconnected Pathways Over Isolated Targets – Interventions like rapamycin affect multiple hallmarks, highlighting that aging is a network of interdependent processes, not separate targets
- Aging Is About Homeostasis – Healthy aging is framed as the body’s ability to maintain balance and respond to damage, rather than targeting individual biological changes
- Inflammation as a Central Player – In experiments, inflammation consistently emerges as a strong signal tied to aging and longevity interventions, showing up in aging clocks and biomarker analysis
-  Causality Between Hallmarks Is Unclear – The discussion debates whether mitochondrial dysfunction causes epigenetic changes or vice versa, reflecting the challenge in defining primary drivers

## AI Summary

Based on the provided transcript excerpt, I'll structure a partial analysis focusing on the discussed content:

1. **Executive Summary**:
The conversation primarily focuses on the possibility of physical immortality and the challenges of aging research. Dr. Brian Kennedy and Dr. Peter Attia discuss the likelihood of achieving immortality, the state of aging research funding, and the inevitability of various age-related diseases. They particularly examine how different diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, and dementia relate to the aging process.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Physical immortality is considered highly improbable but not impossible [00:00:32]
- Even centenarians and supercentenarians show remarkable frailty despite their age-adjusted health [00:01:43]
- Cardiovascular disease is identified as the most preventable of major chronic diseases [00:05:02]
- Cancer may be less modifiable by longevity interventions than other diseases [00:06:25]
- Cancer's inevitability is linked to both mutation accumulation and immune system decline [00:06:55]

3. **Notable Quotes**:
"I like to tell people that I'm immortal because I think the mindset that it gives me is a very healthy mindset" - Brian Kennedy [00:00:00]

"If anybody tells you they have the answers to that, they're lying to you or they're lying to themselves" - regarding stopping/reversing aging [00:03:23]

4. **Follow-up Questions**:
- What specific funding amounts are currently allocated to aging research versus disease-specific research?
- How do lifestyle interventions specifically impact the progression of dementia?
- What are the most promising current approaches to maintaining cognitive function in aging?

5. **Research Focus Areas**:
- Criticism of narrow focus in Alzheimer's research [00:07:30]
- Need for more basic science funding in aging research [00:04:22]
- Importance of studying natural aging processes in animal models rather than artificially induced conditions [00:09:12]

The transcript ends before covering many of the requested categories (supplements, exercise, nutrition, etc.), so I cannot provide analysis for those sections based on the given excerpt.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] Do you think that immortality is impossible unless we define it through kind of like AI copying your brain? Let's put that I mean physical immortality. Do you believe that that is that is impossible? Well, I I like to tell people that I'm immortal because I think the mindset that it gives me is a very healthy mindset for me. We can come to you know you you talk a lot about the emotional aspects of age in your book. I love that chapter. We can come to that later, but that's I don't really believe it's true.

[00:00:32] I think the odds that you could achieve that level of change in aging is nonzero, but close. So, so I I'm skeptical that that can be done. I think it's fair to say, but I I wouldn't rule out the possibility. Of course, nobody's ultimately going to be immortal because you're going to get hit by a bus sooner or later. But what you're really talking about is being immortal in terms of dying from aging.

[00:00:55] Yeah. What I guess what I'm really saying is can one ever get to the point where resilience is high enough that you cannot die from disease. I have seen nothing so far that suggests that's possible. Okay. But but that doesn't mean it isn't possible. Yeah. Yeah. And then that gets even to physical frailty and sarcopenia and things like that where even when we see centinarians and super centinarians their frailty is still pretty remarkable. meaning meaning like they still look pretty feeble and frail. Like I mean the age adjusted they're great but at the end of the day like when they're 110 they still look like someone who's in the final years of their life just as someone would if they were 84 85.

[00:01:43] I mean I had two grandmothers that lived to almost 100. One died at 99 and the other 101. And the one at 101 I would say that at 90 she was driving at 95. I think she quit driving. She bowled a 238 game at 93. She was looked like a 93. Yeah. But but so she looked like a 70s something year old. Exactly. My point is she just had a phase shift of 20 years but it didn't undo the inevitability of that decline.

[00:02:11] Yeah. Yeah. No, I agree with that. I I think that you know but getting us to 100's a good goal. I think I I agree completely. Do you think that again we're spending too much time worrying about finding immortality, escape velocity, understanding the core of aging when maybe we should be spending more time on how do we preserve health span in the last decade of life?

[00:02:38] Um why is it that most people in the final decade of their life are physically too frail to enjoy life are cognitively just you know even even absent Alzheimer's disease they're just not cognitively sharp enough they're in pain they've they're fracturing their hips they're not doing what you know what gave them joy through most of their life that yeah I I think that uh we should fund um aging somewhere closer to the level we're funding cancer and answer both of those questions At the same time, I think one of them is a translational question about how do we slow aging as much as we can right now and improve the health of the population as much as possible? And the other one is a basic science question. Can we stop aging? Can we reverse aging? No one can.

[00:03:23] If anybody has the tells you they have the answers to that, they're lying to you or they're lying to themselves. Okay? We don't know. And uh I think that but it's it's maybe the most important question in biology and we should be throwing money at it. So, we've seen all this money go into like the private sector side, biotech companies, supplement companies, longevity clinics, and on and on. And I think that's great, by the way, and I've spent a lot of my time working with those groups because I think it's important, but we're not seeing the academic funding that's going into the basic science of aging and longevity. And the big questions still that you just raised are still not answered. And so I'm not I'm not I'm I'm changing your your question to a plea for more funding. And unfortunately the the kind of funding that supports that is usually government funding, foundation funding, and and that's under major threat right now. So it's uh I'm really worried that we're not going to answer those questions.

[00:04:22] Well, it's funny. We this was a discussion that came up um on a longevity round table. I think most people, myself included, were really surprised to hear how desperate the funding differences are and how if you could um put I don't know if you could reallocate 10% of funding from the disease specific pools to the age pools um it it could have an enormous difference based on how little the funding. Yeah. Yeah. So when you think about the big chronic diseases Yeah. cardiovascular disease, cancer, uh dementing diseases, and metabolic diseases. Right? Those would be the big four.

[00:05:02] I've often maintained that the that the least inevitable of them is ironically the one that is the most deadly today, which is cardiovascular disease. Yeah, I agree. the athoscllerotic diseases, so cerebro and and and cardiovascular um ironically the most preventable because we have the best understanding of what causes them and we couple that with the most tools to prevent them whether it be uh tools to combat hypertension, dysipidemia, etc.

[00:05:26] And they're responsible to responsive to to lifestyle modification. I mean, which of those major diseases of the other three, dementing, cancer, metabolic, do you believe is the most inevitable to our species? I wouldn't put uh metabolic in that category for sure because I see that more like cardiovascular.

[00:05:48] I agree. Yeah. Um so of the other two, cancer and dementing or neurodeenerative diseases, which one is just seemingly inevitable? We don't know enough about dementia to answer. But I will say that cancer is a little bit different than these other diseases I think and it's not a it and it may be less modifiable by uh longevity interventions. Um dementia we we just don't know. My guess is it's highly modifiable too, but there's not enough data to be sure of that like there is for metabolic and cardiovascular disease. But cancer is is is an accumulation of mutations. So it's a more defined event that's happening.

[00:06:25] It's also a impact on the immune system that's different a little bit than normal aging. So it may be less um approachable from a longevity viewpoint. You know it's funny that's exactly my view uh that cancer is the most inevitable of these diseases. Do you think that the inevitability or the age related component stems more from the accumulation of mutations or the weakening of the immune system?

[00:06:55] It's probably both. I mean, you you don't get to cancer without the right mutations happening. Um, but I think we're learning more and more that the immune system is playing a major role in it and that we can see that very clearly from the interventions that improve immune function and they're having a big role in certain types of tumors and but

[00:07:14] I think that's going to be true for Alzheimer's and the dementia as well. We've completely underestimated the role of inflammation and the immune system and those diseases as well and they may be the primary drivers. you know, I I kind of have got I'm very frustrated by some of these fields. One of them is

[00:07:30] Alzheimer's. You know, the um I kind of feel like, you know, the that one of these Alzheimer's researchers, they're going to die at some point of 90 and on their on their tombstone, it's going to be like, you know, major accomplishment was to completely remove plaques from the brain, died of Alzheimer's at 94. you know, it's it's it's there's been so much focus on one or two mechanisms of disease that we spent 30 years not studying the others, which may be more important. And why do you think that? I mean, I write about it in the book, but I I'm really curious as to why you think that's happened. And and because that's not a unfortunately that's not an isolated incident in science. So why do you think it's happening in a field where the results are otherwise so dismal?

[00:08:14] What's the what's the saying that scientific progress happens one funeral? One funeral at a time. Yeah, I I think that's part of it. You know, you get people that that have successful research programs and uh their postocs get hired in all the jobs and and so when you take a field and it grows from a small field to a bigger field, you everybody can draw their lineage back to four or five different PIs and and so whatever models and those PIs get really focused on those models and they see that as their ticket to prizes and things like that. And so then that you you focus on a subset of the disease mechanisms at the exclusion of all others. And I I don't want to single

[00:08:52] Alzheimer's out. I think a lot of diseases meet that category. But it's unfortunate because what we're realizing is that, you know, there's a lot of factors that contribute to any disease. And I think longevity may be an interesting way of looking at it. Like I think it's better like I'll take a take a mouse. Okay? We've tried to make

[00:09:12] Alzheimer's models in mice and they they don't prove that informative. Why? You're make you're creating a disease a mouse doesn't get genetically in a young mouse and comparing that to a natural disease in an old human. I think it you learn more about Alzheimer's. If you look at the brain neurogenic changes that happen in the mouse normally with aging the the downstream things are different but the drivers may be the very similar to the ones that are driving Alzheimer

[00:09:40] Alzheimer's and that may be a better model of Alzheimer's than trying to artificially create something that a mouse doesn't get. So that's what I think aging is helping change that perspective that you know the the drivers of aging I think are very similar between a mouse and a human that the downstream events can be different uh but the drivers are what we care about right so
