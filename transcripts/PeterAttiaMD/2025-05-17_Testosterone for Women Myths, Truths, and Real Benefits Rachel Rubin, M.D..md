## AI Summary

Here's my analysis of the provided transcript segment about testosterone for women:

1. **Executive Summary**:
The discussion focuses on testosterone's crucial but often overlooked role in women's health, featuring Dr. Rachel Rubin. The conversation highlights how testosterone isn't just a "male hormone" but is essential for women's health, with women having significantly more testosterone than estradiol when measured in comparable units. The discussion emphasizes how testosterone decline in women is age-related rather than specifically menopause-related, starting in their 30s.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Women have 10x more testosterone than estradiol when measured in normalized units [00:01:00]
- Testosterone decline in women starts in their 30s, independent of menopause [00:02:49]
- Birth control pills suppress natural testosterone production [00:03:08]
- FDA recently removed cardiovascular disease risk labeling from testosterone therapy [00:01:00]
- Global consensus exists on testosterone's effectiveness for low libido in postmenopausal women [00:04:08]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Consider testosterone levels even if menstruating regularly [00:02:09]
- Don't dismiss hormone issues just because periods are regular [00:02:09]

Risk/Benefit Considerations:
- Common side effects include increased leg hair growth [00:05:46]
- Potential for acne, especially if prone during youth [00:05:46]
- Risk of deeper voice or clitoromegaly with super-physiologic doses [00:06:37]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Medications mentioned:
- Testosterone therapy (topical, at 1/10th male dose) [00:06:37]
- Birth control pills (mentioned as high-dose hormone therapy) [00:03:08]
- Pellet therapy (discussed with caution) [00:06:37]

7. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Testosterone levels should be considered even in pre-menopausal women [00:02:09]
- Regular periods don't necessarily indicate optimal hormone levels [00:02:09]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"We are testosterone driven beings. Both of us." [00:01:00]
"I feel like me again" - Common patient response to testosterone therapy [00:07:37]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:

## Transcript

[00:00:00] There are two hormones we've talked a lot about, but there's a third that we haven't yet talked about that is um very linked to these two hormones uh doesn't get enough attention in women and of course that's testosterone. So uh before we get into how one should think about replacing hormones, can you talk about the relationship um of testosterone to to women's sexual health and what's happening to testosterone levels during this transition from perry to menopause because of course this I want to bring this into the HRT discussion. So it's super interesting and I'm very passionate about this topic and so I think it comes from this idea that I do uh testosterone for men all the time, right? I'm very confident. I love prescribing testosterone for men's sexual health for um uh and actually very interestingly enough when we prescribe testosterone for men remember their gas tank doesn't get empty it gets low right it's off label right we are doing off label testosterone therapy in men unless they have klein filters or some you know significant medical problem like we're doing off label testosterone for men and it's very understood it's talked about the FDA just three weeks ago removed the labeling on testosterone therapy saying it no longer is a cardiovascular disease risk. So that's great news, right? So the the thing about women in testosterone is it's actually not a menopause thing. Testosterone is an age related decline. So in your 30s, you're starting to drop your testosterone. And testosterone I I don't know who said who decided that men get testosterone and women have estrogen. Like we both have all of the hor like we we have both of the hormones. Sorry to interrupt. You probably heard me make this point before because you alluded to it a few minutes ago. We measure testosterone in nanograms per deciliter. We measure estradiol in pograms per milliliter. If you normalize those to the same level, women are shocked to learn that they have 10 times the amount of testosterone in their body that they do estradile at peak estradi. We way more, right? And I love sharing that. Right? When you put everything in the same units, we are testosterone driven beings. Both of us, right? Are testosterone driven beings.

[00:02:09] And so it's a, you know, again, and and we don't teach this to OBGYNS. No OBGYn knows, well, some do, but but very few know about the role of testosterone in women's health. And so we love to gaslight women and say, well, if you have your period, your hormones are normal. It drives me insane. This women are told this all day, every day is, well, you you can't possibly have a hormone problem because you're getting your period regularly. And the reality is is that's not true. Why? Because if no one talk that that curve that curve we were just talking about testosterone is nowhere on that curve. And so we know there's a peak of testosterone around ovulation right that is nature's way of saying let's make a baby. We know that.

[00:02:49] We know that your libido goes up around ovulation because your testosterone goes up. And so there is this age related decline in testosterone. And here's another big problem. We give women birth control pills all the time. How does birth control work? By the way, birth control is highdosese hormone therapy.

[00:03:08] We love hormone therapy and birth control, but as soon as you become menopause, everybody's afraid of hormone therapy. It makes no sense. So, birth control is high dose. I would argue, you know, sort of the hormone therapy we're talking about in the WHI that is more synthetic, that has side effects that have issues like that. So, birth control turns off your ovaries and it adds back ethinal estradiol and a synthetic progesterine. It doesn't add back testosterone. So, we are botching testosterone for women sort of for along the life cycle to be honest. But if you take someone who's never been on birth control, their testosterone starts to drop in their 30s. So, what are they complaining about? It's not just a libido thing. We know their testosterone receptors all throughout the genitals and the urinary tract. So, we see women have an increased risk of UTI. We see an increased risk of pain with intercourse or pelvic pain conditions. We see uh there are some studies that indicate potentially depression and anxiety can increase because we do think there's a testosterone uh effects on the brain.

[00:04:08] But we have global consensus and I don't know if you've read the news lately Peter but like we don't agree on too much as a globe but there is global consensus that testosterone in women works for low libido and so specifically the data is on postmenopausal women. That's where the global consensus is but there is data in pmenopause and much smaller studies on uh before that. So, but the the consensus is it works, but everyone has emotions about testosterone. I don't know. I didn't think testosterone was a feeling, but apparently it is a feeling for people because people hate talking about it.

[00:04:40] And again, nobody taught you how to prescribe it. So, people are and there's no FDA approved product for women except in Australia, it's approved by their their governing body. And so, you have a lost art of knowing how to give people back testosterone when they are symptomatic. And I think this is an area where women sometimes are also a bit concerned about what happens if I take testosterone because testosterone understandably has conjures up images of all sorts of things from large muscles, you know, big mustaches, uh lots of, you know, other things. So, so how do you talk to women about this? um we we enjoy having these discussions and um and also acknowledging side effects, right? Like the most common side effect we see in women is acne, right? And and I I don't think I've ever gotten to the point where I've seen any of the really dramatic side effects. Um but I do tell women, I say, "Look, there's a decent chance if you were shaving your legs every 5 days, you're going to be shaving them every 3 days.

[00:05:46] That that's that's a chance. If you were kind of susceptible to acne growing up, you might get a little bit more of it and we'll have to back off. Um, but how do you how do you talk about the risks of testosterone therapy? I love talking about this and I'm actually grateful for celebrities because just in the news in the past few weeks, Halib Berry says she's on testosterone. Kate Winslett says she's on testosterone therapy and I they look pretty amazing to me and they don't look androgenized at all. And so I actually want to do this study. It's it's something my research team's working on is I think I have more patients who never start testosterone therapy because of the fear of side effects than actually stop testosterone therapy because of the side effects.

[00:06:22] That's my sort of observation in doing a lot of this. Now, when we talk about side effects, I tell them think about a horny teenager. They have these great libidos, but they have some oily skin, acne, you know, um but that's when you get really high with your doses. We really don't see it clinically. Yes.

[00:06:37] Could you I tell them to put the I I I use FDA approved testosterone for men just at doses kind of onetenth the dose in a way. They rub it on their leg because if they do get hair on their leg, people are used to having hair on their leg and so they shave it, they wax it, they laser it, whatever it is that they do with hair with leg hair. Um I don't have that many patients stop for acne, oily skin. Um again, I think there's that fear when you get really high in the dose. So I'm not a pellet promoter or user because you get super physiologic levels and I can't take it out if you get a pellet put in and so if you have deepening voice or clitoromegaly or you know a hair issues these are the challenges with some of these super physiologic levels but when we're using sort of um reasonably dosed uh level like um uh topicals we really see magic happen and and I can't tell you when we get estrogen and progesterone Right. For our patients, it is by adding that third piece, that testosterone, because your ovary does three, it probably does more than three things, but at this point, estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. When we add that testosterone piece, I it's wild. All the the patients come back and they say to me, "Wow, I feel like me again." It's wild, right? That's the piece. Wow, I didn't realize how badly I felt. Wow, that was the missing piece. I hear it over and over and over again. I can't not want that for all women, right? can't not want to give them that as an option on the menu.
