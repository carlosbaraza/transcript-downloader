JoAnn Manson is a world-renowned endocrinologist, epidemiologist, and Principal Investigator for the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI). In this episode, she dives deep into the WHI to explain the study design, primary outcome, confounding factors, and nuanced benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). JoAnn reflects on how a misinterpretation of the results, combined with sensationalized headlines regarding an elevated risk of breast cancer, led to a significant shift in the perception and utilization of HRT. From there, they take a closer look at the breast cancer data to separate fact from fiction. Additionally, JoAnn gives her take on how one should weigh the risks and benefits of HRT and concludes with a discussion on how physicians can move towards better HRT practices.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode:

**1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
This episode features Dr. Joanne Manson, a principal investigator of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), discussing the study's findings and implications regarding hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The conversation focuses on how the WHI results were misinterpreted, leading to a dramatic reduction in HRT use, even among women who could have benefited from it. The discussion emphasizes the importance of timing, formulation, and individualization in HRT decisions.

**2. KEY MEDICAL/SCIENTIFIC POINTS**
- WHI included ~27,000 women total: ~17,000 in estrogen+progestin trial, ~10,000 in estrogen-alone trial [00:22:24]
- Average age of participants was 63 years [00:13:50]
- Only 7% of participants were on statins at study start, increasing to 25% during the trial [00:17:10]
- Study found 1 additional case of breast cancer per 1,000 women per year in the E+P arm [00:40:33]
- Estrogen-alone arm showed reduction in breast cancer risk [00:41:05]

**3. HEALTH OPTIMIZATION TIPS**

Universal Recommendations:
- HRT decisions should be individualized based on age, symptoms, and health status [01:01:38]
- Women should seek clinicians with specific training in menopause management [01:01:38]

Context-specific Recommendations:
- Best candidates for HRT are women in early menopause with moderate to severe symptoms [01:04:05]
- Women can find certified menopause practitioners at menopause.org [01:15:54]

**4. SUPPLEMENTS & MEDICATIONS**

Medications discussed:
- Conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) [00:15:35]
- Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) [00:15:35]
- Bioidentical estradiol [01:10:06]
- Micronized progesterone [01:10:23]

**5. BIOMARKERS & TESTING**
- Annual mammograms were required during the study [01:09:49]
- Breast density was monitored as a risk factor [01:10:06]

**6. NOTABLE QUOTES**
"Timing is everything when it comes to hormone therapy" [01:04:05]

"The pendulum has swung from hormone therapy being good for all women in the 1980s and 1990s, to being bad for all women in the early 2000s, to now coming to rest in a more appropriate place - that hormone therapy is good for some but not all women." [01:04:05]

**7. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS**
1. What are the specific differences in outcomes between transdermal and oral estrogen delivery?
2. How do modern bioidentical hormones compare to CEE in terms of cardiovascular effects?
3. What is the optimal duration of HRT use for maximum benefit/risk ratio?

Would you like me to expand on any of these sections or provide additional details from other categories?

[00:00:01] foreign [Music] welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter attia this podcast my website and My Weekly Newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness full stop and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level at the end of this episode

[00:00:38] I'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to Peter attiumd.com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode [Music] my guest this week is Dr Joanne Manson Joanne is a professor of medicine and the Michael and Lee Bell professor of women's health at Harvard Medical School professor in the department of epidemiology along with Chief of the division of prevention medicine at

[00:01:07] Brigham and Women's Hospital she is also a physician epidemiologist endocrinologist and the principal investigator or co-pi of several research studies including the Women's Health Initiative which we of course discuss here in length along with other studies such as the cardiovascular components of the nurse's health study the vitamin D and omega-3 trial known as vital her primary research interests include randomized clinical prevention

[00:01:32] Trials of nutrition and lifestyle factors related to heart disease diabetes cancer and the role of endogenous and exogenous estrogens as determinants of chronic disease in women Joanne has received numerous honors including the American Heart association's population research prize the American Heart association's distinguished science award their research Achievement Award election to

[00:01:54] The Institute of Medical of the national academies and the National Academy of Medicine membership in the association of American Physicians Fellowship in the aaas and so many other awards that I could spend the rest of the interacting this podcast going over them she has published more than 1200 peer-reviewed articles in the medical literature and is the author or editor of several books and textbooks she serves as the editor-in-chief of contemporary clinical trials and is the past president of the

[00:02:23] North American menopause Society she is one of the most highly cited researchers in the history of published research and one of the Physicians who is featured in the National Library of medicine's exhibition history of American women Physicians in this episode with Joanne we spend the entire conversation focusing on one of her main projects the study that she was involved in called The Women's Health Initiative of which she was one of the principal investigators in this discussion we speak about the reasons for the study the questions being examined the study design inclusion exclusion criteria we then go into the nuances of the study including why it was prematurely stopped and how it was interpreted of course the most important part of this discussion is what the implications are for someone today listening to this hormone replacement therapy is potentially one of the most controversial bits of medicine today and

[00:03:22] I would argue and I make this point to Joanne that the misinterpretation of the Women's Health Initiative some 20 years ago may be one of the greatest missteps of medicine and by extension the medical press in the past several decades I make no bones about my bias here in this podcast which is that I think the fears of hormone replacement therapy are completely overblown and are generally being propagated by people who are not familiar with the literature which is why I wanted to sit down with Joanne today I could think of no better person to sit down with and go through the details of this study than the person who is more familiar with them than anyone else so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with Dr

[00:04:08] Joanne Manson [Music] Joanne it is great to finally be sitting down with you this is a topic that is arguably as important as any topic that we'll cover in this podcast and there's probably no better person to speak with about HRT than you so maybe just by way of background well maybe I'll introduce you with one interesting statistic do you know how to actually calculate the H index yes okay so so tell folks what the

[00:04:41] H index is how it's calc calculated I'll embarrass you by telling people how high you rank on that okay this is very embarrassing Peter but let me start by saying it's great it's great to have a chance to talk with you and I'm so glad that you're interested in this subject and providing more information to your audience on this subject the H index is calculated from the number of Publications you have that are highly cited if for example you have an H index of 100 that would mean that you have at least we have a hundred

[00:05:18] Publications that have 100 or more citations each an H index of 200 would be 200 Publications that each have at least 200 citations are referenced in other Publications you know we throw those numbers out like 100 and 200 those are epic age indexes I mean a person with an H index of a hundred has done 10 people's you know lifetimes work in their lifetime your H index Joanne last

[00:05:52] I checked is 305 is that correct it may have crept up even higher yeah well I would say that you are generally in the top three h index rankings in the history of biomedical science and I know this because I've checked this I've never interviewed anybody with a higher H index than you and I've certainly interviewed a lot of people with a very high H index so with that as a little bit of background let's go into a slightly more it means I have wonderful colleagues and collaborations going on throughout the world yeah it certainly does but let's talk more specifically about this discussion so there is a study that many people have heard me talk about it's called The Women's

[00:06:35] Health Initiative it's a study that you were one of the principal investigators on and it's also a study that has produced results that I think we would look back today 20 years later and say maybe weren't interpreted in the best way and the implications of that are you know obviously significant from a public health perspective but let's go back in time to the beginning of the planning of this study which I assume would have been in the early 90s is about when you and your peers decided we needed a randomized experiment to test what was being found in the nurse's health study and other epidemiologic studies exactly it was the very early 1990s talk a little bit about what was observed through the observational studies the epidemiologic studies and how that shaped the design of the Whi yes so back in the 1980s and 1990s there were several observational studies these are not randomized clinical trials but large observational studies looking at women who chose to be on hormone therapy or whom doctors were prescribing hormone therapy for and they did tend to have lower rates of heart disease in those studies compared to women not using hormone therapy they also seem to have more favorable outcomes such as less cognitive decline line lower all-cause mortality rates they were generally doing better but we often say that observational studies of this nature cannot prove a cause and effect relationship but they can generate hypotheses to be tested in randomized clinical trials but before the randomized clinical trials were even launched in the early 1990s there was already an increasing practice in clinical medicine to prescribe hormone therapy for the express purpose of trying to prevent heart disease cognitive decline and other chronic diseases so this was a trend that was occurring not only in recently menopausal women in not only when women had hot flashes and night sweats and were in early menopause but many clinicians we're starting to prescribe these hormones for women who were well over a decade 10 20 30 years after the onset of menopause so it's very important to understand whether this practice of prescribing menopausal estrogen therapy or estrogen plus progestin therapy was advisable when used for prevention of chronic diseases this was a very different question compared to asking does hormone therapy reduce hot flashes night sweats and should women in their 40s early 50s who are just starting to go through menopause and have these symptoms should they take hormone therapy to treat those symptoms it was accepted that hormone therapy is effective for treating hot flashes and night sweats it's actually actually FDA approved for that purpose it has an indication for treatment to reduce hot flashes and night sweats but the question of its use for prevention of heart disease stroke cognitive decline other chronic diseases had never been tested in a randomized clinical trial and that was the goal of the

[00:10:19] Women's Health Initiative despite the fact that the epidemiology suggested benefits in all of those Arenas people who listen to this podcast are no strangers to the different types of biases that can creep in and perhaps there's no greater bias that creeps into something like this than the healthy user bias it could easily be the case that the women who had access to

[00:10:40] Physicians or who had access to the type of Physicians who maybe felt more knowledgeable or provided better care and part of that could have been the provision of hormones it could be that they were coming down with fewer cases of chronic diseases not because of the hormone replacement in therapy but because of other factors that were a part of a healthy lifestyle of which hormones might have been a part of it so there's no doubt that an RCT is going to be essential to carry out the elucidation of causality here let's also talk a little bit about the formulations

[00:11:11] I guess if we go back into probably gosh the 1960s when the idea first came along to Physicians to replace estrogen in a menopausal woman I think they were just probably using estrogen alone correct and they didn't understand the role of progesterone as opposition to that to prevent endometrial hyperplasia but where were we in the early 90s clearly that had been figured out what were the formulations that were most common well that's a very important question Peter and the most common formulations were conjugated estrogen with and without medroxy progesterone acetate and so women who had a hysterectomy could use estrogen alone but women with an intact uterus needed to take take a what we call a progestogen which counteracts the effect of estrogen on increasing the thickness of the uterine lining the endometrium and so if women who have an intact uterus take estrogen alone they have a very high risk of developing endometrial cancer and early on they will just have proliferation of the lining of the uterus and increased vaginal bleeding related to taking estrogen without the progestogen so those are the two formulations that were very commonly used and also importantly those were the two formulations that had been extensively studied in the observational studies where the results had looked very promising for a lower risk of heart disease and cognitive decline all cause mortality so it was felt to be important to test the formulations that had contributed so much to the observational study findings as you say the women who were taking hormone therapy in the observational studies tended to be a higher socioeconomic status more highly educated and more health conscious and these were all potential confounding factors that may have contributed to their lower risk of chronic diseases however it's also important to note that in observational studies the women who were being prescribed hormone therapy were still largely women in early menopause they were at least being started in early menopause even if they continued into mid and later menopause so that's another important perhaps biological difference between the women in the observational studies and women in randomized Trials where in the

[00:13:50] Women's Health Initiative the average age was 63 or more than a decade past onset of menopause when the hormone therapy was being started I know you're not a gynecologist so you may not know the answer to this but do we know if the age of menopause is moving over time I mean we certainly know that girls are getting their periods earlier and earlier even over just two decades do we know if menopause is also a moving

[00:14:17] Target I don't know that that's been studied really rigorously and systematically the average age of menopause is 51 believe that stayed relatively constant for quite a while although as you say the age of puberty and menarchy start of menstrual periods has become younger over time so there are those changes but I don't know that there have been really clear differences in the age at menopause do you have a sense of why the conjugated equine estrogen and the mpa a synthetic progestin were the dominant forms of these hormones used in the 80s and in the 90s which of course then became the precursor for the epidemiology for example do we know why there was not just a bioidentical estradiol and progesterone which of course is we'll talk about those things later in our discussion because of course those are the most dominant forms used today but do you have a sense of just historically why that was not the case even at the outset there are some theories about that Peter you know one theory is that a pharmaceutical company developed the conjugated estrogens as you know they were originally and even many of the forms today derived from the pregnant

[00:15:35] Mare's urine and this pharmaceutical company really became the dominant force in terms of hormone therapy and the synthesis of estradiol you know from plants and it's a more complicated process that really did not get going on a very large scale until more recent decades but for quite a long time many many decades more than 50 years there was you know the conjugated estrogen available so the investigators of which your how many of you were actually sort of lead pis were there three of you in the overall Women's Health Initiative there were initially 16 clinical centers and then expanded to 40 clinical centers for most of the duration of the Whi so there were actually 40 principal investigators throughout the country let's go over sort of study design and participant criteria inclusion and exclusion criteria so you've already alluded to several of these and this is a very important distinction and it's something I think you and I even discussed many many years ago not on a podcast but just over the phone one day which was women who were having vasomotor symptoms were excluded correct no were not excluded this actually is a common misconception that women could not have hot flashes to participate in the Whi women who had very severe hot flashes self-selected out of the study because they want it generally they wanted to be on hormone therapy at that time the

[00:17:10] Assumption was that hormone therapy would have very favorable effects and they were already taking hormone therapy very often for their severe hot flashes so they did not want to be in the study but we didn't exclude any woman on the basis of the severity of her symptoms or presence or absence of hot flashes night sweats in fact the majority of the women in the study especially those in the earlier younger menopausal ages did have at least mild or moderate hot flashes I see I misunderstood you I thought the thinking was by minimizing the number of women who had vasomotor symptoms you would have less dropouts in the placebo group because of course women who are getting a placebo would presumably not be relieved of those symptoms which are obviously the most responsive to the HRT you said the average age was 63. what were the exclusion criteria so women could not have a prior history of breast cancer endometrial cancer or any other estrogen sensitive cancers and overall if they had cancer it had to be could not be estrogen sensitive cancer and it had to be more than 10 years previously women could not have a recent heart attack or stroke or any of those major clinical cardiovascular events although a very small percentage of the women did have a more remote history of heart attack stroke bypass surgery that type of clinical history for the most part the women were healthy in terms of past history of cardiovascular disease cancer other conditions they were certainly allowed to have diabetes hypertension high cholesterol and many of the more common health conditions that women will have and men will have in midlife smoking not an issue they were not excluded for smoking though we had a small percentage less than 10 percent osteopenia osteoporosis was not an exclusion it was not an exclusion they were not selected on being required to have osteoporosis or osteopenia but as a broad range of bone health similar to what you would expect in the usual population for women age 50 to 79. and what about family history for breast cancer or uterine cancer women were allowed to participate it was really up to them whether they thought that their family history was so strong that they did not want to take any chance of being randomized to active hormone therapy many women did self-select out of the study for that reason but they were not excluded by these study investigators on the basis of their family history and was there a limit as to how long they could be out of menopause before enrollment no it was on sorry into menopause yeah the criteria were based on age so the women were 50 to 79 with a mean age of 63. some of them had gone through menopause in their early to mid 40s some of them had even had hysterectomy with ovaries removed in their 40s or much earlier in life so there was no exclusion on the basis of for example being more than 20 or 30 years past menopause was on the basis of age 50 to 79. wow amazing diversity of age there right I mean you think about basically three decades worth what about prior hormone use what fraction of the women had previously been on the exact same drugs that they were going to be potentially randomized to and was there a required period of washout okay very good question about 25 of the women in the estrogen plus progestin trial had prior use of hormone therapy and close to 50 percent of the women with hysterectomy and in the estrogen alone trial had some prior use of estrogen therapy so women were not excluded for having a past history of using hormone therapy but especially in the estrogen plus progestin trial the large majority did not have prior use it was only about 25 percent who had prior use and overall just looking more specifically at the percentage of women in the trial who had hot flashes night sweats at the time of enrollment it was overall about 45 45 to 50 percent who had some symptoms mostly mild or moderate hot flashes or night sweats and a little over 50 percent did not have any hot flashes or night sweats at the start of the trial how many women are enrolled in this trial about just under 30 000 In My

[00:22:24] Memory correctly yes so 27 000 a little over twenty seven thousand in the two trials combined in the estrogen plus progestin trial close to 17 000 in the estrogen alone trial close to ten thousand and again we've stated this but I think it's very important that people again understand why there are two trials if a woman has a uterus she must be receiving progestin along with the estrogen so that's the E plus P trial that we'll talk about right if a woman has had a hysterectomy then estrogen alone is sufficient there's no risk of endometrial hyperplasia because there is no endometrium and there's an e alone trial each group has its own

[00:23:06] Placebo yes separate Placebo for each group great so roughly we're talking about four groups the E only is roughly five thousand plus five thousand with a randomized one to one exactly and then the E plus P would have been you know roughly 8 500 in E plus p and then 8500 Placebo for that group correct okay primary outcome was there a single primary outcome and was it ascvd was that the main outcome the primary outcome for both trials was coronary heart disease with these primary safety outcome because of concern even before the study was designed was breast cancer so the two really key outcomes of the trial were coronary heart disease and breast cancer and obviously this is incidence of breast cancer not mortality of breast cancer accidents a diagnosis of breast cancer that's confirmed by medical record review and coronary artery disease would be what we would think of today as mace so major adverse cardiac event Mi stroke death as a result of anything or was it more complicated primary outcome was actually the coronary events so it was heart attacks it was either non-fatal heart attack or fatal coronary disease which is most commonly a fatal heart attack what was the study powered to detect on either of these obviously those numbers the study subjects is something that I'm sure the investigators thought long and hard about what was the power analysis suggesting a difference that was anticipated remember that the hypothesis was that there would be benefit for heart disease and that there would be overall many favorable effects of these hormones on chronic disease outcomes it was powered to detect an important clinical reduction such as a 20 reduction in heart disease do you recall at the time what fraction of the women were taking lipid lowering therapies how common would that have been in the early to mid 90s you know I think one of the interesting aspects of the Whi is that as you pointed out hormones were being used as a preventive treatment for ascvd you know I think today very few Physicians would really consider that I think given the complete explosion we've had in both the availability variety and efficacy of lipid lowering agents a person who's deemed at risk is going to be managed much more critically with respect to blood pressure and lipids again I don't know that I've ever come across that stat that may not be something that you know but I'm just curious as to how prevalent that was yes I do know it it's right in the the paper that we published in Jama in 2013 and we've published repeatedly on the subject of the use of many of these medications for chronic health conditions so seven percent of the study population was taking statins at the start of the study by later in the trial during the intervention phase it was over 25 percent there was a very large increase in Statin use even during the trial itself and would longer follow-up obviously these percentages are even higher getting to 40 50 percent very high percentage what was known about oral estrogen at the time again going back to the early to mid 90s as far as its impact on coagulability for example blood viscosity today oral estrogen is not used very often as a result of that but at the time was it what was known it was a that or oceans and oral estrogen goes directly through the portal circulation to the liver and has a direct effect on the liver in increasing the synthesis of clotting proteins that was understood at that time because similar to oral contraceptives it had been seen in observational studies that both oral contraceptives and postmenopausal hormone therapy were associated with an increased risk of deep veined thrombosis and even pulmonary embolism that had been suggested but it was believed to be relatively rare and that the benefits for heart disease and for other chronic diseases would outweigh those risks of thrombosis what was your personal hypothesis going in I mean there's obviously the hypothesis that is driving this study but do you remember back you know gosh it's probably 30 years now since you you were in the planning phase of this what did you think was happening mechanistically to explain the observational data did you believe the observational data did you think that that they were being confounded heavily do you have a recollection of that I believe that it was likely that there was at least a small amount of confounding because it was clear that women taking hormone therapy tended to have a higher socioeconomic status tended to have better access to Medical

[00:28:36] Care and to have somewhat more favorable lifestyle behaviors be more health conscious many of these factors were considered in the data analyzes it's not like the observational studies were just looking very crudely at associations there was adjustment for many of these lifestyle factors and socioeconomic status and some of the studies but a benefit a risk reduction for heart disease did tend to persist even after those adjustments my thought was that women in early menopause who are transitioning from having their natural pre-menopausal estrogen exposure which many studies suggested was protective a cardio protective favorable in terms of risk factor status in terms of dilating the blood vessels to the heart and increasing blood flow to the heart there were many studies already suggesting that a woman's own natural estrogen during pre-menopausal years was one of the reasons why women started to have heart disease later 10 years or more later than men my thoughts were that it is likely that starting estrogen in early menopause would translate into at least a slightly lower risk of heart disease but I was skeptical from the very start that the magnitude of risk reductions seen in the observational studies you know the 40 50 percent lower risk of heart disease would stand up to a randomized clinical trial assessment of this question so I thought it was likely to be a small reduction wasn't sure whether that benefit might be offset by other risks that would be identified but overall you know I thought there's likely to be some confounding going on in the observational studies when you think back to again that same period of time what was your thinking with respect to the relationship between estrogen and breast cancer you know obviously the classical teaching I mean I was in medical school in the mid 90s and you were taught chapter and verse that estrogen causes breast cancer but on the surface some of the assumptions are a little hard to understand in the same way that there has historically been the assumption that testosterone causes prostate cancer except for the observation that men with the highest levels of testosterone I.E men when they're you know younger have lower rates of prostate cancer than men when they're older and similarly I mean this was demonstrated as long as 15 years ago that the lowest levels of testosterone were associated with the most aggressive forms of prostate cancer

[00:31:24] I don't know how similar the data are for estrogen and breast cancer but given that most women get breast cancer in menopause and not prior to menopause they're getting breast cancer even estrogen sensitive breast cancer at a time when they have their lowest levels of estrogen so what was the understanding of the pathophysiology of the relationship between estradiol or estriol even and or maybe it's estrogen that was would deemed to be even more problematic what was the understood relationship for why that relationship existed there there was an expectation that there would be at least a modest increase in risk of breast cancer with giving either estrogen plus progestin or estrogen alone in fact the most surprising finding in terms of breast cancer was that no increased risk of breast cancer was seen with estrogen alone even though the observational studies had suggested that both estrogen plus progestin and estrogen alone would be associated with increased risk of breast cancer but there were many many observational studies suggesting that hormone therapies associated with increased risk of breast cancer but the thinking tended to be these are estrogen receptor positive breast cancers they tend to be more favorable outcome types of breast cancer and that breast cancer mortality would not be appreciate increased so that was the thought going into it and also in the observational studies there was always that concern that differences in mammographic screening patterns could be contributing to Greater detection of breast cancer among women taking hormone therapy because most doctors would not continue to prescribe the hormone unless the woman was having regular mammography and showed a normal mammogram without concern about a lesion there so mammography also could have been contributing more frequent mammography in women on hormones versus women not taking hormone therapy could have contributed somewhat to the increased risk in the observational studies which was why it was important to look at this question in a randomized clinical trial with uniform surveillance for breast cancer with a mammogram being required every year so there was an increased risk of breast cancer with estrogen plus progestin also there were denser breasts developing over time so breast density was looked at in a study of mammograms several hundred women whose mammograms were examined and there was a change in increased breast density which is known to be a risk factor for breast cancer the increase in breast density was greater with estrogen plus progestin than with estrogen alone now what was really surprising as I mentioned although there was this increase 25 30 percent increase in risk of breast cancer seen with estrogen plus progestin there was no increase in breast cancer seen with estrogen alone and would longer follow-up there was the emergence of a reduction in breast cancer close to a 20 reduction seen with the conjugated estrogen and the view was that this may be something specific to conjugated estrogen which is a relatively weak estrogen and may have certain properties similar to tamoxifen where it may be both serving as an estrogen and an anti-estrogen but we cannot assume importantly we cannot assume that this finding with conjugated estrogen will necessarily apply to all formulations of estrogen alone and certainly will not apply to the combination of estrogen plus progestin so that's interesting Joanne I wouldn't come to that as my first kind of Occam's razor conclusion because the same conjugated equine estrogen was used with the mpa that found a clinically irrelevant but statistically significant increase in the incidence of breast cancer in other words I wouldn't conclude from the differences in those two arms that it was the conjugated equine estrogen that was unusually beneficial no I'm not I'm not concluding wouldn't it be that the mpa was the difference yes it's the mpa that the only way to look at the role of the estrogen is in the estrogen alone trial because in the estrogen plus progester and try you can't disentangle it's given a combined pill every woman in the trial was taking the combination so I completely agree with you Peter The increased risk of breast cancer seen with estrogen plus progestin was mostly be attributable if not entirely attributable to the progesterone to the medroxy progesterone acetate and of course the question has been raised with other types of progestogens such as the bioidentical micronized progesterone would that also lead to an increased risk of breast cancer there are some observational studies that suggest less increase in breast cancer with that particular formulation of a progestogen however we have no large scale randomized clinical trials that have done head-to-head comparisons or even really tested long-term the effects of other formulations of progestogen on breast cancer risk so probably the most prudent and cautious approach is to assume that at least with longer duration of treatment with estrogen plus progestin there will be an increased risk of breast cancer let's go back and talk about the study being stopped so the E plus P arm so the Cee plus MPA arm was stopped early correct a little over five years it was stopped after 5.6 years and it was stopped 3.3 years early and this was stopped presumably on the basis of the finding for the increased incidence of breast cancer correct it was stopped on the basis of the increased risk of breast cancer together with no reduction in heart disease which was the primary endpoint and an overall unfavorable risk benefit ratio as shown through the global index which looked at all of these chronic conditions now one of the things that I didn't realize until somewhat recently was that the dropout rate was a little bit unusual in that in the placebo arm of the e-plus P group in the first second third third year relative to the final year do you recall what those numbers were the dropout rate is actually substantial in all hormone therapy trials It's a combination of people do drop out of all trials because it requires a lot of effort to take a medication that's not being prescribed for your health it's just part of a study you don't know exactly whether it's active or Placebo so all trials have some Dropout over time in terms of compliance adherence with study medications also there are some side effects of hormone therapy the women who had an intact uterus and were taking estrogen plus progestin some of them continue to have some vaginal bleeding and you know some of them did not want to continue to have those symptoms they may have had some breast tenderness or other symptoms and dropped out and women dropped out of the placebo arm as well some of that is just taking a medication day in and day out taking a study body pill a fatigue will set in in any randomized trial our participants were extraordinarily dedicated I cannot imagine any group being more committed to women's health and to getting answers for women on these very pressing issues in menopausal Women's Health but there's going to be some Dropout in any trial do you think the answer might have been different if the trial had gone to it was originally for over eight years over eight years I mean I guess we'll never know what it would have shown had it gone longer so at the time that the study was halted really the big headline of the study was estrogen causes breast cancer I use this as a great teaching example when I talk about the difference between relative risk and absolute risk the relative risk difference in the group that was Cee plus MPA relative to

[00:40:33] Placebo or versus placebo was 24 25 correct yes I think it was a little higher on the surface that sounds incredibly startling right so women who are getting CE plus MPA have a 25 percent higher risk of breast cancer during this 5.2 year period the absolute risk increase was 0.1 percent it was a difference of one case per thousand exactly remember correctly the women in the placebo group were getting breast cancer at a incidence of four cases per thousand women the women in the CE plus

[00:41:05] MPA group were getting it at an incidence of five cases per thousand the absolute difference of that being one case per thousand it was about the opposite that was seen in the Cee versus placebo alone although I don't think it reached statistical significance at 5.2 years did it no it didn't yeah it had a p-value for your follow-up to see that reduction yes to see that there was indeed a reduction in many ways it seems that that was the headline that dominated the world I don't have any recollection of it at the time Joanne because I was in my surgical residency when the study was first published and I must admit I wasn't paying attention to this literature I'm embarrassed to admit

[00:41:44] I don't even recall this paper coming out what is your recollection of that time how much it sort of captured the imagination and fear of the world well the medical community was Shell Shocked there was a sea change in clinical practice a size shift in clinical practice but let's think about what the shift was two major things changed there was a dramatic reduction in use of hormone therapy 70 to 80 percent reduction in use of hormone therapy so women who were being prescribed hormone therapy in the past for prevention of chronic diseases prevention of heart disease stroke cognitive decline those women were no longer being prescribed hormone therapy and that was a positive thing that was a positive change in clinical practice because the Whi showed that when hormone therapy is used for prevention of chronic disease purposes in women who have average age of 63 in women in mid to later menopause on average the risks outweigh the benefits so it was a favorable change but the unfavorable change in clinical practice practice was that the results were extrapolated to women in their 40s and 50s who were taking hormone therapy for treatment of bothersome even distressing hot flashes night sweats and were in generally good hell and they were being denied hormone therapy to relieve these symptoms and that was an inappropriate extrapolation of the findings that was a negative outcome women never should have been denied hormone therapy for the treatment of bothersome distressing hot flashes night sweats to improve their quality of life especially generally healthy women and early menopause who have such low absolute rates of Adverse

[00:43:51] Events now as you say in the Whi even in the overall cohort with an average age of 63 most of the Adverse Events events were relatively rare such as one extra case of breast cancer or heart attack or blood cloth per 1000 women per year I mean it's still important and it can add up with longer term use however it's a low absolute risk and I think that the results were perhaps blown out of proportion especially in terms of the use of hormone therapy for a clear indication and FDA approved indication of treatment of hot flashes and night sweats among women in early menopause who had even lower absolute risks than one extra case per thousand women per year and that type of extrapolation really should not have happened so there was some positive outcomes that hormone therapy was being used less for inappropriate purposes such as prevention of heart disease stroke cognitive decline but also this unfavorable change that it was being used less commonly for treatment of bothersome hot flashes and night sweats in early menopause I guess what I find most troubling is that when I speak with most Physicians today unless they're really really steeped in this world and you know most aren't they can't reiterate what you just said the only thing that they seem to understand and by extension the only thing that their patients seem to be led to believe you know really the enduring Legacy of the

[00:45:42] Whi from an Insight perspective is that hormones in particular estrogen cause breast cancer and that HRT is synonymous with breast cancer and there are really two enormous inaccuracies in that the it are so inaccurate that they're almost a parody right and when we've discussed them both but I think it's always worth bringing it back for the listeners so that they aren't lost in the details the first is that nothing about this study suggested that estrogen is causing breast cancer if anything this study suggested MPA is causing breast cancer based on the fact the group that was only receiving estrogen had a reduction in the incidence of breast cancer while the group that received estrogen plus

[00:46:29] MPA is the group that saw this small potentially statistically significant but potentially clinically insignificant increase the second thing that seems to get lost from this and again it's sad that most doctors and patients who are contemplating HRT don't recognize this is that the study only found an increase in the incidence of breast cancer to the tune of one case per thousand but no difference in mortality one has to wonder what the cost of that was let's talk about some of the other outcomes here first of all would you agree with with that by the way that that would be perhaps a more charitable interpretation of the Whi two caveats one I think we cannot assume Zoom what was found with conjugated estrogen will apply to all other formulations of estrogen and I think there is very strong evidence from several lines of biology that estrogen plays a role in breast cancer including the fact that when women have their ovaries removed it lowers their risk of recurrence where's the risk of development of breast cancer lowers the risk of recurrence and I think there is quite a bit of evidence that estrogen does play a role the higher estrogen estrogen would be specifically the type of estrogen that for example is associated with increased adiposity and post-menopausal women is linked to a higher risk of breast cancer so I think there are several lines of evidence that estrogen is a factor in breast cancer and this was actually also known even before the Whi that many of the observation studies had linked hormone therapy to an increased risk of breast cancer but I agree with you that it seems to be when you're talking about conjugated estrogen it's the combination of estrogen plus the medroxyprogesterone acetate it may be specific to that particular progestin we don't know we have very limited research in terms of randomized clinical trials large-scale studies of other formulations of progestin in terms of breast cancer mortality the results in the Whi are very close to a statistically significant increase in breast cancer mortality with estrogen plus progestin it doesn't quite make statistical significance but it is getting toward a significant increase in Risk on the other hand the conjugated estrogen alone was associated with a significant

[00:49:08] Advocate a statistically significant reduction in breast cancer mortality so really diametrically opposite effects of the combination with the medroxy progesterone acetate of the estrogen with the hydroxyprogesterone acetate versus the conjugated estrogen alone I think that the absolute risks are still low and that is a very important point to emphasize that we are talking about one extra case per thousand women per year for a woman who starts out with a high Baseline risk because of a strong family history are the risk factors this would certainly be something she would want to avoid but for a woman in early menopause at usual risk of breast cancer who would derive the benefits of symptom relief and She's suffering from disrupted sleep very bothersome hot flashes and night sweats that interfere with her day-to-day activities they this would be a risk that you would probably be willing to accept with an understanding that all medications have some risk and that she could be monitored closely with monography and breast exams and you know usually there would not be a fatal form of cancer a diagnosis overall we did not see any significant increase in total cancer total invasive cancers with either estrogen plus progestin or estrogen alone and interestingly with the combination estrogen plus progestin we saw a significant reduction in the endometrial cancer the uterine cancer developing over time and colorectal cancer also seemed to be at least borderline reduced so I think the clinical message and the message for the public is that hormone therapy has very complex effects it has a complex Matrix of benefits and risks that vary according to a woman's age her time since menopause her underlying health status and decision making about hormone therapy really has to be individualized personalized and women themselves play such an important role in the shared decision making because many women will say I do not want to take hormones no matter what and even if a woman's at lower risk and the doctor or clinician may think that they really should consider hormone therapy that's the woman's decision and you respect it however other women let's say will say that they want to take hormone therapy even though they know that there may be

[00:52:06] X Y or Z increased risk because their symptoms are so bothersome they're so distressing they're being disrupted their sleep is being disrupted they are not being able to have work productivity their day-to-day activities are affected their quality of life is really impaired and it is very important that women be able to help make that decision together with their clinician that they share in that decision making I don't disagree with any of that I guess the only issue

[00:52:40] I would potentially highlight is that in this scenario you described where the physician thinks that it's the right thing to do the patient is experiencing vasomotor symptoms the patient already has osteopenia and their bone mineral density is only going to decline with time and they're not at unusually high risk for breast cancer that scenario where the patient is in you know almost a fear mode of saying oh my God no way I want you know HRT it's going to cause breast cancer I guess what I'm arguing is that's a very ill-informed decision so yes it's their decision and yes they should be able to make whatever decision they want but that doesn't mean it's a good decision and that doesn't mean it's a decision based on good data because in reality it's not Based on data that's my fear is that this is no longer about the data because I think the data what you and I are discussing today is the data and the data really don't make a very strong case for avoiding HRT outside of

[00:53:34] Select circumstances and yet I worry that the last 20 years of women entering menopause have been put into two categories right either there are women who really want HRT but they can't find Physicians who will give it or there may be a physician who understands the data at the level you and I are discussing it but the patients themselves have been so frightened off it by misinterpretations of the data I think that conference conversation has to take place and you know it is important for the clinicians to be informed themselves about benefits and risks and be able to discuss the benefits and risks in a very knowledgeable way with the patient but my view is that if a patient feels strongly that she doesn't want to take hormone therapy maybe you know her mother developed breast cancer while she was on the hormones whether or not it was directly due to the hormones so she is going to have a lot of fear and anxiety surrounding use of hormone therapy and that will affect her overall well-being that's a factor in the benefit risk equation so I would generally say don't push someone by just showing that the absolute risks in terms of number of cases cause versus prevented might be favorable for them because their emotional well-being is a very important part of the equation however I do agree that we need to emphasize absolute risk that absolute risks are low and that there are better candidates and there are worse candidates it's amazing how the pendulum has swung so in the 1980s 1990s the perception was that hormone therapy was good for all women women were being routinely started on hormone therapy then after the Whi in the early 2000s the pendulum was in the opposite direction that hormone therapy is bad for all women and now I think it is coming the pendulum is coming to rest in a more appropriate place that hormone therapy is good for some but not all women and the best candidates are women in early menopause who have moderate to severe or bothersome hot flashes and night sweats and are in generally good health those are women who will derive quality of life benefits and have very minimal apps absolute risk from hormone therapy one of the things I've thought a lot about is how many women if you go back to 2002 and the data are published but the media has a different take on it the media has the take on it which is kind of how we're discussing it now not very exciting so maybe that's why that's not to take the media had but I play the what if game which is how do things shake out so instead of the pendulum going so far to the other side of women can't and shouldn't under any circumstance have HRT because they're going to get breast cancer it turns into no there will be additional cases of breast cancer you know I've done sort of a back of the envelope calculation based on the assumption that somewhere between four and five million women probably missed out on HRT in the last 23 years 22 23 years as a result of the study which saved mean it reduced about 4 500 cases of breast cancer there's benefit to that didn't really reduce mortality from breast cancer but here's what's interesting even though it's not a primary outcome HRT reduced the incidence of hip fracture by about one and a half percent in absolute terms that's remarkable yes there was the benefit for hip fracture and there were benefits for in other cancers as well there were benefits for endometrial cancer with estrogen plus progestin but here's the problem with the whole argument for using it for bone health women in their 40s and 50s have a low risk of osteoporotic hip fracture they may have a hip fracture from a traumatic incident but it's not likely to be related to osteoporosis so it's when they get into their late 60s 70s 80s that they're more likely to have the osteoporotic fractures and if we were to treat women from early menopause into their 70s 80s that would be very long duration of hormone therapy use which would lead especially combination hormone therapy would lead to an increased risk of breast cancer and once women go off of hormone therapy bone loss is very rapid so all of the benefits to the bones in terms of preserving bone mineral density that dissipates very quickly within a matter of a few years after stopping hormone therapy so that if a woman is taking hormones in her 40s and 50s and then she stops let's say at age 60 then by the time she gets to the age where her risk of hip fracture is very substantial in her 70s and 80s she's really not going to have a persistent sustained benefit from the hormone therapy and we looked within the group at high risk of osteoporotic fracture whether they had a favorable overall favorable outcome in terms of the global index combination of all of these outcomes with hormone therapy and overall there really was no group of women irrespective of their risk of osteoporotic fracture who had a clearly beneficial ratio from benefit risk ratio from estrogen combined with progestin when used for chronic disease prevention again this does not mean that it isn't a very effective treatment for hot flashes and night sweats and that women in early menopause would have a favorable benefits profile taking into account the quality of life benefits we haven't talked about age differences I think that overall it's so important for women to understand that the absolute risks of these hormones are much lower in early menopause than in later menopause and in many ways timing is everything when it comes to hormone therapy because not only are the absolute risks the risk of having Adverse Events on hormone therapy lower in the younger women women in early menopause but also we saw some signals that especially with estrogen alone the women in their 50s the youngest women in study were 50 to 59 those women tended to do quite well in terms of heart disease and heart attack rate compared to the women on Placebo there was a signal there for benefit also a signal there for favorable outcomes in terms of all cause mortality so overall there were favorable signals with estrogen alone in the younger women and also lower risks of Adverse Events suggesting that certainly for estrogen alone in a woman who's had a hysterectomy if she is symptomatic with hot flashes night sweats the benefits of treatment are likely to outweigh the risk and even for combination estrogen plus progestin despite what may be a small increase in risk of breast cancer the benefits are likely to outweigh the risks even combination therapy when used for the purpose of treating bothersome disturbing saying hot flashes night sweats disrupted sleep and impaired quality of life and women should not shy away from the use of hormone therapy and to discuss the option weigh the benefits and risk carefully with their health care provider with their clinician and see if it's the right decision for them and if they have trouble finding a clinician they can go to the North

[01:01:38] American menopause Society has a website menopause.org and they can find the tab for find a health care professional a certified health care professional with training in menopause and they can put in their zip code and find the clinicians in their area who have this expert training I'm an endocrinologist and I know that many endocrinologists have the training to talk about hormone therapy and discuss hormone therapy with patients but many clinicians have had limited training in you know use of hormone Thera therapy and it may be helpful for women to seek out a clinician who has had some additional training in menopause management and hormone therapy pros and cons and for women who are not good candidates the good news is that there are non-hormonal options as well they're not quite as effective as the menopausal hormone therapy for treating hot flashes and night sweats but some of the antidepressant medications ssris snris some of the Gabapentin pentanoid medications these medications have been found to be quite effective 40 50 percent reduction in hot flashes and night sweats with these medications and there's a new medication that may be approved by the FDA fairly soon that works entirely in the brain in terms of making women less sensitive to the changes in temperature and has a very beneficial effect in terms of preventing hot flashes and night sweats I guess I still kind of come back to something that the math doesn't quite add up right which is if a woman stays on estradiol for the duration of her life say from age 50 to 80. we accept that there's going to be an increase in the incidence of breast cancer though it doesn't seem to translate to a difference in lifespan but on the flip side we are reducing her risk of fracture during a very dangerous window so the incidence of fracture saved is about one and a half percent and the mortality of that once she reaches 65 the one-year mortality depending on the series is 15 to 30 percent so even if we just want to do this on the basis of mortality Apples to

[01:04:05] Apples it doesn't even appear close does it well let's look at the actual data because we publish in Jama 2017 the mortality results the all-cause mortality results by age and time since menopause and we did see that the younger women the women who were in their 50s taking either estrogen alone or estrogen plus progestin had signals for about 30 percent lower mortality though it was not statistically significant in either trial individually yet the women who were older in their 70s 70 to 79 randomized to estrogen alone had a hazard rate 22 percent higher risk of all-cause mortality it was not quite statistically significant so it was right at the border of being statistically significant and with estrogen plus progestin it was actually quite neutral almost completely null so there were estrogen alone seemed to be just a tad worse in the women's 70-79 though it was a tad better among the women 50 to 59 so again timing is everything when it comes to the all-cause mortality results their favorable signals for the hormone therapy the women earlier in menopause age 50 to 59 in the study quite neutral results in age 60 to 69 but in age 70 to 79 there's a bit of a signal that estrogen alone may be linked to a small increase in risk of mortality that is a little different than what I was asking

[01:05:53] I don't think the study can answer the question I was asking which is really more of conjecture that if a woman has started at the appropriate time which I think we all agree is during the transition from perimenopause to menopause and I'm really asking this question through the lens primarily of hip fracture which I think is just such an underappreciated cause of mortality in both men and women over the age of 65 but estrogen is hands down the most important hormone as it pertains to signal transduction from The Strain gauge within the muscle to the osteoblast and osteoclasts and so what

[01:06:27] I'm really asking is it's more of a you know thought experiment if we put women on HRT at 50 and they stay on HRT for 30 years by my calculation it's a 15x reduction in mortality because even if you accept a slightly higher incidence of breast cancer it's being more than dwarfed by the reduction in the hip fractures that they will be sustaining 15 years after beginning again we don't know the answer and we'll never know the answer because I don't think anyone's going to do that study but the magnitude of that difference is so great and that's where I just think the discussion is very confusing for people because they only see one thing which is breast cancer and they don't see it through the nuanced lens that we're talking about it which is why I'm glad we're talking about it I think this is the discussion people need to understand I agree that there there may be an excessive focus on one isolated outcome such as breast cancer when it's really the overall health of the woman and of course all cause mortality is an integration of all of these life-threatening health conditions and it was quite neutral with hormone therapy overall the results were what we call null for all cause mortality there was no increase in risk or decrease in Risk in the overall study population and in the younger women there was a signal for some reduction in

[01:07:49] Risk but a randomized trial has never been done that would look at 30 years of hormone therapy treatment starting in early menopause and continuing into mid to later menopause and the reality is we don't know whether the benefits would outweigh the risks I know that some women will make the choice to continue to take hormone therapy into middle to later menopause because they started in early menopause they did well on the hormones their quality of life is very good when they try to stop or reduce the dose they feel hot flashes coming back and they end up taking these hormones well into their 60s 70s even longer and in the observational studies this looks like it has a relatively favorable benefit risk ratio however keep in mind this is a very select group of women who are choosing to stay on hormone therapy long term because they're doing extremely well with it and they've tolerated it well and they haven't developed any of these interim events such as a heart attack a stroke a blood clot in the legs or lungs or breast cancer other estrogen sensitive cancers so that's right so we're selecting for healthier women selective group of women and I think that overall we just don't know what a randomized trial would show with long-term hormone therapy but I think there would be concern that the risks would outweigh the benefits because keep in mind the Whi showed an increased risk of stroke with both estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin and there was cognitive decline in increased risk cognitive decline among the women 65 and older although that was not the case in the younger women but we just don't know how the pattern of benefits and risks would change with longer duration once you get into 15 20 25 years of treatment it's pretty clear to me we'll never get another bite at the Apple as far as going for that duration but do you think we'll ever get another bite at the Apple to use kind of better practices I mean

[01:10:06] Cee and MPA have largely fallen out of favor very few women I've never actually seen a woman take those I'm sure some do but most women these days are using you know the vivelle dot or one of the topical FDA patches which is just pure estradiol as you alluded to earlier most women these days are taking micronized

[01:10:23] Progesterone which is a bioidentical progesterone or foregoing oral progesterone altogether and using a progesterone coated IUD which seems to offer the same degree of local endometrial protection without any of the systemic effects for some women who can't tolerate that so in some ways the entire cluster of insights from the Whi are less relevant today given that the drugs that were tested aren't the drugs that are in Mass adoption do you think it's likely we will see another short-term study and I call short-term like kind of a five-year study that tests the same question using the current formulations and potentially does so in a manner that is in line with more current use cases of the drug or do you think that that's too much of an undertaking and something that we'll never really get another RCT to address

[01:11:13] I think that it is a good Trend to move toward the transdermal estradiol and the micronized progesterone these FDA approved bioidentical formulations of hormone therapy as opposed to the oral conjugated estrogen hydroxy progesterone acetate I think that that is a good Trend we have to keep in mind that we really don't know the long-term benefits and risks but based on other you know in terms of clinical outcomes such as heart attacks Strokes different forms of cancer and all-cause mortality but I think it makes sense based on how these different formulations affect clotting affect biomarkers for clotting and cardio metabolic Health blood pressure all of those parameters I think that there's reason to use the transdermal and the micronized progesterone preferentially over the older formulations I think we need more randomized Trials of these formulations that are now in more common use especially looking at breast density mammographic breast density to see if there is less suggestion of a future risk in breast cancer based on the change in mammographic breast density whether or not there is going to be another large-scale trial of the magnitude of the Women's Health

[01:12:46] Initiative which would be if you take women in early menopause in order to have similar numbers of Health outcomes and similar robust power to look at Health outcomes it would have to be at least 40 50 000 women being randomized in their 50s and followed four seven eight years I think it's really unclear whether such a trial could be mounted would be extremely expensive and also because of the rapid changes in formulations over time there would be this similar risk that the results might become obsolete by the time the results were available as your suggest testing is the case with the conjugated estrogen and MPA but let's keep in mind that even though the

[01:13:39] Whi was testing the most common formulations at that time in the early 1990s it did put an end to a practice of prescribing hormone therapy among women in later menopause for the purpose of preventing strokes and heart attacks and cognitive decline which actually were found in the Whi to be adversely affected by hormone therapy and women were not getting the benefits for quality of life that many of them didn't have once they were in their late 60s 70s they were not having any hot flashes night sweats disrupted sleep related to these symptoms so they weren't getting the benefits and they were getting these adverse outcomes so it's important to acknowledge that the Whi did put an end to what was an unfavorable practice the problem was it was over extrapolated the results were extrapolated to women in early menopause taking hormone therapy for the hot flashes night sweats it's really important for women to understand and that the Whi results are really not intended to discourage a woman who's having disrupted sleep very severe significant symptoms to discourage her from seeking help and seeking hormone therapy as one of her options for treatment and in her specific case in early menopause and generally good health the benefits are likely to outweigh the risk that's the really key message that women in early menopause should take these symptoms seriously make sure they find a clinician who will take these symptoms seriously and discuss their options their treatment options review with them the pros and cons and if they are not finding that clinician they need to go outside their current system and find a clinician who can help them to do that because there are many clinicians out there who are knowledgeable in menopause manage knowledgeable in hormone therapy decision making who can help them to make the best choice for themselves

[01:15:54] Joanne what was the reference you gave for women to go and look for finding a provider near them where they enter their zip code what was the name of that again menopause.org website of the North American menopause society and they can go to the find a certified menopause practitioner Tab and it will give them an opportunity to put in their zip code and then we'll tell them which clinicians within five miles 10 miles have the expertise in menopause management and hormone therapy and other treatments well I could continue talking with you for hours and extract so much more insight but so many other topics we didn't we could talk about vitamin D for another few hours that could be another it could be another time there's a whole other discussion yeah so I'll conclude with two things I guess one is just I still remain somewhat sad because I think there's a Lost Generation of women

[01:16:46] I think there's 20 years of women who entered menopause who were denied HRT due to the ignorance of their Physicians and the irresponsibility of the media and I look at women like my mother and my mother-in-law who were entering menopause just as the Whi was coming to its conclusion and who suffered unnecessarily and I don't know how many millions of women suffered unnecessarily

[01:17:09] I think you're right I think the pendulum is swinging and I'd like to believe that there aren't women that are suffering that way today the other point I'd make is I really have always respected you and continue to do so because I feel like you're one of the few people who was such an important part of the Whi who has been able to look back at that and acknowledge its limitations and I think your thinking seems to at least me through your writing to have evolved over time I don't think that's a property that is necessarily inherent to everyone at your position so I really applaud you for that and I think that you're doing more good today by speaking out on the limitations of the Whi then you probably probably even did by taking part in the
