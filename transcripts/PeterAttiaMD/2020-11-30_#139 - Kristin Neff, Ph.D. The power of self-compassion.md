[00:00:03] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia this podcast my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness full stop and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level at the end of this episode i'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to peteratiamd.com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode [Music] my guest this week is kristen neff kristen's an associate professor of educational psychology at the university of texas here in austin she's the author of the book self-compassion the proven power of being kind to yourself she's widely regarded as one of the world's leading experts on self-compassion being the first one to truly operationally define and measure this construct basically over the past decade now in addition to her research into self-compassion she's also developed an eight-week program to teach self-compassion skills in daily life she co-created this with her colleague dr chris germer it's called the mindfulness self compassion msc i stumbled upon kristen's work in my own search for better understanding self-compassion this is something that came up for me personally is an area that needed enormous improvement and in doing so i realized i wanted to speak with her reached out to her and obviously the rest is history in this episode we talk about her own journey towards the discovery of self-compassion which somewhat coincided with her discovery of of mindfulness and you'll see in this podcast it's actually quite interesting and it takes me until the very end of the podcast to truly appreciate the distinction between mindfulness and a practice of mindfulness in meditation and and so if you're listening to this and you're an astute listener of podcasts where either meditation has been discussed or the concepts of mindfulness have been put forth pay close attention and hopefully you won't make the same mistake i will but basically kristen arrives at this conclusion that you know when she's going through a difficult time in her life the best approach is to take a compassionate approach to herself and that experience personally then basically shapes the remainder of her professional career and she does a great job here contrasting self-compassion from self-esteem and self-pity and i think this is a very important thing we get into sort of some of the concerns that people have with self-compassion you know hey will this reduce my output or my productivity or my competitiveness and i think you'll see that frankly by the end of this this is a very nascent field much of what we talk about here is not hard science there are a lot of things here that we we are speculating on but i think what nobody will speculate on if they've put any of this into practice is that you feel better and ultimately that's probably the metric that matters more than anything else so with that said please enjoy my conversation with dr kristen [Music] hey kristen thank you so much for making time today i know you're super busy and we're gonna talk a lot about what it is that keeps you busy i've wanted to speak with you for probably about four or five months now since i started to become interested in your work and the broader topic of self-compassion but i think to understand how you came to study it we have to understand more about you and what it is that sort of brought you on that journey so i sort of know little bits of your story but i kind of want to go back a little bit further maybe even starting in college what did you study in college and what piqued your curiosity okay so actually as an undergraduate i was very much into issues of kind of culture and how culture impacts reasoning i took a three-part series in cultural anthropology and i just fell in love with the topic thinking of how culture and the larger cultural context may influence the way we think about the world and think about moral topics and so i went to uc berkeley to study with a moral developmental scholar named elliot troyel who was just amazing and i was again researching i was really interested in things like how people balance concerns with autonomy and connectedness it was a theme actually that's run through my entire research career kind of you think about how they balance concerns with self and other and i started getting interested in that in terms of moral reasoning how people resolve moral conflicts especially between self and other i did my dissertation research in india looking at i think it was called reasoning about rights and responsibilities in the context of indian family life so basically i became interested in how especially how gender hierarchy in a very traditional place like india impacted how people resolved conflicts between their personal needs and their others needs some people had said that india is a duty-based culture and it's all about meeting the needs of others whereas the united states is a right space culture and it's all about meeting our own needs i thought well is that really true i mean what about gender it seems like with a lot of gender hierarchy that yes women really need to do their duty and meet their husbands needs but husbands have a lot of rights to do what they want so you can't really separate out power and gender and culture from the way people think about things and by the way i did find that i found that they emphasized duties for wives and rights for husband but the indian woman were like but that's not fair we'll do it because we have to but we don't like it it's not fair kind of showing the kind of also that we aren't totally dictated to by our culture we're individuals who can reason and decide actually that's not fair i think that should change while i was in india i started basically i talk about it a lot in my book but while i was in india my life fell apart basically i had been married and it was kind of a i'll go ahead and say it right here because we're talking what had happened was i left my husband for another man which is something that i was a very moral person i never ever thought i would be in that situation but it happened so i left my husband for another man who was supposed to join me in india and he didn't and basically so the whole thing fell apart and i came back to berkeley and actually when i came back talk about trauma he was he had brain cancer and he died within a year the man i left my husband for who didn't leave his partner or her and so basically i was a mess i was feeling a lot of shame it was very traumatic i consider myself a very moral honest person and the fact that i got myself in that situation kind of was just really upsetting to me that i had allowed myself to get in that situation plus the fact that it really it didn't work out so well right so he didn't come and the guy left my husband before ended up dying of cancer within a year my husband who had been divorced when i got back hated me and i was just a basket case basically and so i thought i would learn mindfulness meditation because i'd heard that mindfulness was good for stress and trauma and all this stuff which i was going through so i started learning about buddhism as a way to kind of help me through what i was going through what kind of support network did you have at this time so i'm trying to picture this so you how long were you in india uh a year i was in india for a year and so you come back and you're in the process of writing your dissertation now i assume yes i wrote up my dissertation what type of interaction you're having with your girlfriends are they consoling you do you feel isolated and i had a very good support network and actually believe it or not i had actually met the man who was going to be my second husband when i was in india he came as well which helped it was a very soap opera-ish peter it was like days of our lives right it was kind of the script of a soap opera all these elements that came together i had support but i knew i really needed something to help me deal with everything i'd been going through and i was always a spiritual person my mother had books by like indian gurus duran das b here now is on my coffee table which is probably what drew me to india to be totally honest i also thought that i might find some spiritual awakening there didn't actually happen in india it happened when i got back but nonetheless i was always kind of drawn to those alternate ways of thinking about the world so it was kind of a natural for me to start meditation and what drew you to a mindfulness form of meditation there are other forms of course and especially being in india certainly the birthplace of transcendental meditation or other things to be totally honest it was because this meditation group which was that tit not hang group a group that followed the teachings of the zen master han it was right down the street from me so it was kind of happenstance the one thing that i kind of liked about buddhism i didn't know a lot about it but i knew enough to know that it was more scientifically grounded the thing about buddhism is it's more like a science of the mind there's not a lot of belief systems you don't believe in reincarnation you don't have to believe in a god or gods just basically a way of understanding the mind and because i was a scientist getting my phd that also drew me and then plus i'd just been hearing good things about mindfulness meditation but really thank goodness it was a tick not han group because han is one of the buddhist teachers that talks a lot about self-compassion more than a lot of other teachers do others do but that's like a big theme of tikna han and so the very first night i went the woman leading the group talked about self-compassion if i had gone to a transcendental meditation group or some other group it may have been i don't know shambhala or some other type of meditation they might not have talked about self-compassion it may have just been about quieting the mind stilling the mind observing the mind not the group i went to she talked a lot about self-compassion and it had an immediate impact on me i mean literally when i got home the first night i thought wow i had never even thought about being actively kind and supportive to myself i wasn't a particularly harsh self-critic you might think that i was i actually wasn't i was kind of like an average self-critic but i was feeling a lot of shame about everything i'd gone through and the kind of soap opera that had become my life when i just started being actively kind and supported to myself i started speaking to myself in a way like hey kristen i know you're hurting this is really hard it's understandable there's a lot of reasons for how things unfolded the way they did um you know i'm here for you i started really just i did it silently but speaking to myself as if i was speaking to a friend and it really was like finding a superpower i didn't even know i had it was almost immediate the impact it had on me now mindfulness meditation took a lot longer to figure out it's a more subtle practice then i did learn to meditate and i went on many retreats but self-compassion and probably because i have fairly secure attachment with my parents it wasn't very difficult for me to learn i got it almost immediately but i did have to practice applying it to my life now how do you go to the point where you are able to sort of say to yourself in compassionate ways the things that you're saying without first being aware of what the default voice is that's probably happening subconsciously is that necessary because to me that's the harder part is i think we'll discuss later most of us have some level and some more than others of being incredibly critical the real challenge is how subconscious that critical voice is and how we're not aware of it so were you even aware at that point of how degrading you could be to yourself or how demeaning you could be i think you're right that some of these things are less conscious than others like i say i actually wasn't a particularly harsh self-critic it was more that i was just lost in the i mean i was feeling shame and so you might say there was self-criticism but it wasn't an entrenched pattern for me how were your behaviors because i guess that to me is one of the telltale signs you come back from india you're probably at that point mostly sitting in your apartment and much of your work is analyzing data and writing but how did that shame manifest itself as an outward manifestation of whatever the inner voice was saying were you in any way depressed or anxious or anything like that i think i was feeling discombobulated that's probably the best word i can use to describe it i didn't get into a deep depression i also had a lot of stuff going on in my life at the same time so again i was also starting a new relationship which kind of made it more complicated it also gave me you might say some support but i've always been psychologically oriented kind of interested in my internal landscape i could be aware of the feelings of guilt and shame for me the biggest shameful thing was i've always identified as being a very honest person and the fact that i did that was just it was really hard for me because it just goes against my self-concept the fact that i got myself in that situation i understand it how it could happen but it was really hard for me i started noticing these thoughts about my self-concept what does this mean about the type of person i am and that was really helped by starting buddhism because buddhism is all about understanding this sense of self that causes suffering this sense of identification with the separate self the kind of thoughts of i am this type of person or i am that type of person did it take a long time to notice that it certainly got better as i got more deep into it especially if you go deeper into meditation you can start to see even more subtle layers of self-judgment but it wasn't necessary to get there before i could start seeing the benefits of self-compassion so it deepened over time a lot of people are just blown away by the simple thing of putting your hand on your heart and saying something kind and supportive to yourself here's the thing peter i really believe in part psychology i've used internal family systems therapy as i used that type of therapy for many years that's dick schwartz right schwartz's model we have different parts of ourselves and i really do believe we have different parts of ourselves can you explain to folks a little bit about what dick's work is so the idea is we have different parts of ourselves that all kind of play a role he it's a terrible name we call it internal family systems but basically the idea is we have different parts of ourselves that kind of form a family and interact like a family but it's on the inside and not just outside and so we have a part of ourselves that may be self-critical maybe feel shame we also have a part of ourselves that maybe wants to defend against the wounds of the shamed part of ourselves so maybe he's really angry at others or gets really busy you know we have different parts of that a different function the function of all the parts ultimately is safety it's kind of survival that's kind of how these operate so there's a part that defends our ego as a form of survival there's a part that defends against those feelings of shame but there's also a compassionate part of ourselves i really believe that all of us have and that compassionate part of ourselves typically gets exercised when we're relating to others people we care about maybe our children our good friends or other people we're close to we also have a compassionate part of ourselves so i don't think it's the case that you need to totally uncover that all the self-critical parts of ourselves before we can activate the self-compassionate part it's there we actually are already pretty familiar with it as it relates to other people so i think what happened is i was able to activate that self-compassionate part i was able to see wow this really makes a difference if you take that self-compassion apart and aim it inward as opposed to outward it almost immediately changes the landscape also the physiological as well as the mental landscape you're actually moving from the threat defense mode to the attachment system mode you're kind of priming your own attachment security when you tap into the compassionate part of yourself so for me it got better over time and went more deep over time i was able to uncover more layers more hidden cells full of shame or inadequacy related to my father and all the stories that you unpack in therapy but it was easier than i thought it was that's the thing that surprised me over my career is actually easier than you might think to help people get in touch with their compassionate self because for many many people that compassion itself is very very well practiced as an expert just aimed at others so you don't have to create something totally new that's not there that's the useful thing about it yeah i have a friend who in sort of helping me think about this so unlike you i'm probably naturally much more self-critical you sort of describe yourself as probably in the middle kind of normal i would be an olympic level self-critic including actually audibly i mean i could literally you'd think i was a crazy person at times because i could literally speak in a voice like this to myself in a incredibly harsh and critical way so a friend of mine rick elias who has been on this podcast and who i consider not just a friend but kind of a life mentor said i want you to practice something which is when you're in that moment and you're about to have that discussion with yourself i want you to picture that the same events occurred that are upsetting you but now it wasn't you that did it it was one of your close friends that did it how would you console him this is interesting it was for me a process of five months of doing this but for example i'll give you so there's two things i do almost every day i either shoot my bow and arrow or drive my race car simulator now those are two seemingly nonsensical activities but unfortunately they both have become barometers of self-worth so when they don't go well the inner self-directed hatred is enormous and it results in anger and tantrums and outbursts and feelings of total worthlessness when they don't go well so instead what i started doing and i literally did this every single day for five months is after every single episode of doing one of those activities which meant every single day i would take my phone out and i would speak into the recorder as though it were my friend who had that bad experience and i would say i would use my name so i'd say hey peter i know you just had a really bad day shooting and you couldn't hit the broad side of a barn if your life depended on it but doesn't mean you're bad it just means that you had a bad day at archery today but you're still a great dad and you're going to get another chance to come out here and do this tomorrow and there are probably reasons for it today you might not even know why you didn't shoot poorly but i would send text that message to my therapist every single day as a form of accountability it really was amazing how much it de-escalated me it was actually very quick it used to be at the point where driving or shooting poorly could ruin my day and it got to the point where within about three minutes i had forgotten about it yeah that's the power of self-compassion and again it's because you already had that part developed it had been one thing if you hadn't had any experience your whole life of how to be compassionate or supportive to someone but you'd spend many many years developing that skill probably with your kids or your friends so you just needed to access that part of yourself which you weren't accessing before and that's why i found to get back to kind of in terms of for myself that's why i was just blown away by how useful it was and then so i started getting interested in buddhism and the whole idea of self-concept what is this thing we call a self anyway and it really made a lot of sense to me this way of understanding how the sense of separate self and ego and separation leads to suffering and so i thought well maybe i want to kind of pivot and i didn't pivot totally away but pivot away from moral reasoning and get into understanding self-concept how the development of our self-concept impacts things so i did my post-doc with susan harder studying self-concept development she was also studying autonomy and connectedness so it was a natural fit so i've been studying autonomy and connectedness and moral reasoning and she was studying autonomy and connectedness and relationships your self-concept are you other focused are you self-focused are you both so it's an absolutely natural fit for me to go work with her and do my post-doc but she was also one of the country's leading self-esteem researchers and she had done research along with others showing that self-esteem is not necessarily a good thing it's good to like yourself is supposed to hate yourself but the ways we get our self-esteem can be very very problematic you know a lot of social comparison is contingent like for you if you shoot the bullseye you feel good about yourself if you miss it you hate yourself i mean that's not very stable it's very contingent it's unstable so it was when i was finding out more about self-esteem and i was just kind of questioning the whole self-esteem thing anyway through my buddhist practice and what is this thing we call an ego and that we invest so much in that we have to judge it positively and it can't be negative at all and then it was just a natural just think wow i think self-compassion is a lot more helpful than self-esteem when i was working with susan i was developing all my ideas about that and then eventually i came to show that empirically and i got ut austin when you sort of take a broad lens at human psychology when did this idea of self-esteem become something that was really pushed i mean certainly as long as i can remember as a kid i mean this is what was talked about all day every day the table was pounded kids that don't have high self-esteem do drugs and whatever sort of but that couldn't have been the narrative forever was there somebody that was a champion for this school of thinking or well it's interesting because if you actually look at the founding american psychology william james who was writing early 1900s 19th century he wrote about self-esteem and he actually identified contingent self-esteem he defines self-esteem as perceptions of competence in domains of importance in other words being good at those things in life that are important to you like you could probably care less if you're bad at hockey if you don't play hockey but you do care if you're bad at archery because you care about archery that's kind of the way self-esteem works we need to be good at those things in life that we value so he was actually talking about it way back then but then it didn't really take off in psychology then they started going into psychoanalysis and then into behaviorism and it was probably people like rosenberg all blackied on his first name who created the rosenberg self-esteem scale that was probably one of the big factors creation of good measures of self-esteem because people could say wow when people score higher on the self-esteem scale they're less depressed they're less anxious they're happier and then that kind of started kicking the ball rolling and noticing and it is true people of higher self-esteem have better mental health than people with low self-esteem but the problems is all the unhealthy ways they get to that high self-esteem like feeling better than others bullying others we know that the reason kids in middle school start to bully others is to have high self-esteem because they want to feel good about themselves in comparison how do we compare and contrast narcissism with self-esteem or other negative traits because self-esteem by itself doesn't really sound to be negatively valenced but a lot of those other traits do there's nothing wrong with self-esteem and in fact there's a pretty strong correlation between self-compassion and self-esteem if you're self-compassionate you all have higher self-esteem and you have less self-hate so they're linked but the healthy form of self-esteem is what they call unconditional self-esteem you feel worthy not because you're good at something that you value you feel worthy just because you're a human being an intrinsic sense of self-worth and that's the type of self-esteem that self-compassion gives you if you look at them head-to-head that compare my self-compassion measure against a self-esteem measure you'll find that it's self-compassion that explains stability of self-worth over time you know in other words it doesn't go up and down as much because it's less contingent on outcomes on a good day and on a bad day so just to make sure i understand that there's some discordance between self-esteem and self-compassion a person with self-compassion generally has self-esteem but not everybody with self-esteem has self-compassion yes exactly it's hard to tease them apart but for instance if you have self-esteem because you're a narcissist you probably won't have higher self-compassion you don't have lower self-compassion either because that would have to say that people who aren't compassionate who hate themselves have higher narcissism so they're completely orthogonal when you put them all together in a regression equation you control for self-esteem and self-compassion then narcissism is the outcome it actually came out as 0.0 correlation totally orthogonal between self-compassion and narcissism where self-esteem i forget what it was i think it was a moderate correlation i'd have to look again it's not that self-esteem is bad we want to feel worthy it's really why we feel worthy how we feel worthy is important i think viscerally it makes so much sense using like i said the trivial example of do you shoot well or not if your self-worth is dependent on performance you're doomed to fail at some point right and then when you do fail what do you do and so people criticize themselves thinking it's going to improve their performance and by the way it does kind of work it has to be admitted many people have gotten through med school or law school through hard self-criticism so it's not like it doesn't work at all but it works with a lot of negative side effects like a performance anxiety is a big one so if you have a lot of anxiety because you're slamming yourself you're beating yourself up next time you have some big tests or something you're really worried about doing well because you know if you don't you've gotten the negative reinforcement of beating yourself up so it makes you more anxious which actually undermines your performance it can make you more disconnected from others if you're really invested in doing better than other people and that can lead to like little interpersonal behaviors that actually aren't good at creating closeness and connection it kind of works there's a lot of problems with it and self-compassion works better what we know in the research is constructive criticism is more effective than harsh criticism only know that of course we know that you still want criticism you want to know where you went wrong and how you could improve it's not like oh that's fine if you're a professional archer saying oh well just had a bad day that's not going to help you and that's not going to help you achieve your goals which means it's actually not ultimately loving if you're a professional archer you want to do your best because that's related to your happiness and well-being but what's going to help you do your best constructive criticism says okay well here's what didn't work and you did it this way this didn't work why don't we try it this way i believe in you you've got my support i'm here for you that type of constructive voice is actually more effective yes a coach that says you're crap you better do better it kind of works it doesn't work as well as constructive criticism and we know that because obviously that's one of the concerns that anybody would have going down this path of self-compassion if somebody had spoken to me when i was in high school or college and said look we're going to work on you not beating yourself up i would have said no way i'm not willing to give up my edge in exchange for feeling better in the moment right which is ironic because it actually doesn't give you an edge it actually is not nearly as effective it gives you more of an edge if you have constructive criticism than destructive criticism and again study after study shows that yeah so walk me through some of the the social psychological experiments that can test that hypothesis research has come out of uc berkeley which shows a lot of research shows that self-compassion is not only more effective than self-criticism which kind of occurs naturally but also is more effective than self-esteem as a motivator so just as an example of one type of study they had uc berkeley undergraduates they had them all fail a vocabulary test they took like the hardest items from the sat they had the students take the test and everyone failed because it was a really hard test they split up the students into three groups one group they gave instructions to be self-compassionate about the failure it was a really hard test try not to beat yourself up about it just you try to be kind and supportive to yourself about failing this test the other group that gave the self-esteem instruction they said don't worry about it you got into berkeley you know you're smart kind of give them a self-esteem boost and the other group they didn't give any instructions which meant they were probably self-critical they didn't encourage the students to be self-critical that'd be kind of unethical they just didn't say anything what they did is they said you're going to take the test again you've got some free time to study for the exam they had materials they could study for the vocabulary test just kind of let us know when you're done and you're ready to take the exam and what they found was that people who were told to be self-compassionate about the failure studied longer and harder than the other two groups and how long people study was related to how well they did on the next exam i mean what would be another interesting group as a fourth group would be a group that was berated and told you crap yeah like you guys got into berkeley and you still flunk this test yeah pathetic i'd be curious to know if that was positive or negative in terms of reinforcing additional study yeah i guess it's kind of unethical to do that it'd be very hard to do like that you can't actually insult subjects in an experiment like that because it's considered psychologically damaging let's pause for a moment on that the irb won't let you say to an undergraduate something like that whereas think about what was done 40 and 50 years ago with some of the famous psychology experiments down at stanford that's why they've changed the rb and actually peter do you know what you have to use as an insult the feedback you use is you did average that's considered an insult if you tell people their score was average is considered an insult there's lots of research like that that basically so what happens is when you're self-compassionate about a failure first of all it allows you to learn more from the failure i mean it's such a truism failure is our best teacher but if you're full of shame and you're just really mad at yourself you don't actually have the presence of mind to look objectively and say huh where did i go wrong how could i do better next time but self-compassion support actually does give you that presence of mind to be able to learn from your experiences and so self-compassion leads to what they call growth mindset where you actually learn from your mistakes as opposed to a fixed mindset which means you just think you're stupid or smart one or the other how soon in a child's development can these patterns be set we don't have a lot of data with kids partly that's because we don't have a good way to measure self-compassion in children there are a few scales actually just came out the scale for youth that can be used for younger kids at brand new it came out like last year it hasn't been used much we don't have a lot of data on this but i suspect that about age seven or eight once kids have learned about friendship and they have like psja would call two-way thinking you can understand reciprocity they understand concepts of fairness they understand kind of that back and forth they can take the perspective of another to be self-compassionate you have to take the perspective of another towards yourself and also by the way self-criticism doesn't really kick in until later on in development partly because of that because children are just kind of like happy and they have a positivity bias and they tend to think they're great unless their parents tell them the exact opposite kind of it's called one way thinking they're all one or the other i would assume two-way thinking would have to kick in which would be about age seven or eight so there are some good books out there and you can find them on my website if you want to get the reference kind of teach kids when they learn about friendship that they should also be their own best friend learn about what it means to be a good friend they should also learn to be a good friend to themselves and i suspect that's probably the best time to start introducing these concepts and then adolescence once you start getting metacognition and you get more abstract thinking it's even more appropriate because that's when really the self-concept formation starts kicking in what kind of person am i and then you can start having conversations with teenagers they actually do understand issues like do you really want your sense of self-worth to be contingent on being pretty enough or having people like you or being smart enough they have enough abstract thinking skills to be able to understand something like self-compassion now some would argue that we're sort of in the midst of a social experiment for which the outcome might not be known for decades which is a group of kids that are growing up in a world where comparison is at a level that you or i couldn't imagine you and i grew up so i'll speak for myself but i didn't have a clue outside of my neighborhood there was nothing i mean even looking at the tv was very abstract not like i knew anybody that lived out of the borough of the city that i lived in and you barely watched tv there was no way to sense what was happening and of course today that couldn't be further from the truth so you spoke earlier about ego being so entwined in self compass right in comparison to others that you would argue that we are in an environment today where the potential for that comparison that ranking is so high so it would seem to me that self-compassion is more important today than potentially it ever has been i hear what you're saying i think it certainly is frightening on the other hand i don't know a lot about it my son doesn't use social media i don't use social media i'm like a dinosaur my book has a facebook account but i don't so it's a whole other world and i know i'm not really part of it my son's not part of it either but i do from friends who have teenage kids i do hear this on the other hand it seems like that the younger generation is more open-minded than past generations that it may be because they've got the ability to know so many different stories like in some ways when we were growing up probably a little older than you but still it's like there's a few sitcoms on and everyone watched all in the family or mash or whatever it was i'm probably dating myself you're probably like seven when those came out but nonetheless there were certain sitcoms that everyone watched and that was kind of the unique frame of reference shared frames of reference at least in cultures like the united states but now people they can get the point of view of like so many diverse points of view depending on what they like what they're interested in i haven't seen any data well that's not quite true there is some data showing that suicide rates are up and stress is up i just don't know i think the jury's out i think the jury's out i think in some way social media can be used for instance if you're part of the lgbtq community you have access to people like you in a way that you wouldn't have had 20 years ago and in that sense social media could be a positive thing it could make you feel less isolated and more connected to others on the other hand if you're just looking at instagram and followers maybe not so i think i just don't know what to think about it it's scary though i admit it it's really scary we don't know that's a missing point now you mentioned your son does not use social media your son has autism correct yes he's how old now he is 18. and by the way he just got his driver's license i can't even tell you how proud he is and how proud i am of him that he just got his driver's license it is like independence is just around the corner he's a sophomore at high school he was delayed because we homeschooled him we started him a little bit back so that he could catch up academically but yeah he's doing really well really well you probably start to figure out that something is not exactly quote unquote normal when your son is two or three years old i knew earlier because i was trained as a developmental psychologist and i knew something was up but there's a myth that autistic children don't make eye contact they make eye contact a little less frequently but a lot of them make a lot of eye contact especially with their parents and i literally used to joke with his father huh well at least we know it's not autism look at that eye contact but then it turned out it was autism he's actually an extroverted there are extroverted artists he's an extroverted artist so what did you notice and when the diagnosis finally came how did you start to process that and how did your training and self-compassion serve you i started noticing because he was delayed in language development actually delayed pointing is one of the biggest indicators of some sort of delay and he was just using the echolalia just the repeating of the words kind of the repetitive behaviors but he was very social i had the stereotype that autistic kids they weren't loving they weren't affectionate they didn't make eye contact which wasn't him at all but then once i realized that a lot of autists are extroverted and social i realize oh yeah he's got it and then we had the official diagnosis it was devastating it was devastating the first feeling quite honestly is one of disappointment it just has to be kind of owned this isn't what i imagined being a parent would be like i imagined something different these long in-depth philosophical conversations about life and actually we're starting to finally have it took a lot longer than i thought it would he wasn't potty trained until he was five which is really really hard he would tantrum a lot well past the terrible twos and so i was disappointed i was overwhelmed it wasn't the plan i had signed up for and so my self-compassion and my mindfulness practice both together and they really can't be separated mindfulness is a necessary ingredient to self-compassion the day after he got his diagnosis i went on a meditation retreat and i just sat there on my cushion and i cried what i did was i allowed every single emotion to come up you're supposed to feel disappointed because i love my son more than anything else in the world i didn't say okay this emotions allowed and that emotion isn't allowed i just let any emotion i had to come up feelings of grief feelings of disappointment feelings of fear and not only was i allowed myself to be with them without suppressing them or fighting them the thing that made the biggest difference for me is i actively gave myself support because of them this is really hard kristen i know you're disappointed i know you're frightened it's gonna be okay i'm here for you i'm so sorry that you're having struggling but care about you i treated myself just like i would treat a good friend who had a similar situation what i found and over and over again the more i could give myself compassion for my son's autism the better parent i was to him and the more i could accept him the more i could accept my own difficult feelings about his autism the more i could actually accept his autism whereas if i had fought them and suppressed them or said i'm not supposed to feel this way or i could allow myself to feel this way i think it would have created a tension that would have actually made it more difficult to accept him for who he was and when you were going through this process did your husband mirror you in that practice or did he sort of have his own way of doing this so you were kind of in this journey of you were supporting him and he was maybe delayed and what was that dynamic like a bit of both he had kind of his own way in dealing with things he's much more of a doer and it wrote this book called the horse boy and he thought about how can i make this into an adventure that's kind of his way of dealing with things if life throws you lemons how am i going to make lemonade which is a little different than my way of doing it and so he made had this whole adventure and we took her son of mongolia and he wrote a best-selling book and a documentary about it and he really tried to look on the positive side of it there's really value to that as well a different approach than what i took mine's kind of more like how do i hold the pain with love and his was like yeah i think he has a line in his book when life gives you lemons why stop that lemonade make a margarita very much his way of dealing with things and by the way we aren't together anymore just so you know we split up about nine years ago there's a point in that documentary by the way oh so you did see it yes yes i did it's very powerful it's at least represented in the documentary that rowan basically didn't make a sound maybe i'm misremembering this but it was only when he first encountered the horse that he sort of came to life am i remembering that correctly it was the first time he did a complete sentence so before he could repeat words it might be like food he liked back then might be bottle or water or muffin or something like that he would repeat the words but it's the first time when he got in betsy i actually wasn't there when it happened so i'm assuming it's true he said he's a nice horse betsy's actually female but he's a nice horse first time he was on the back of the horse and i did see a change so there's some research to suggest on horses it's actually they think it may have to do with the cerebellum because when you continually have to find and refine your balance it influences the cerebellum which helps brain integration and one of the things that's happening with autism is a lack of brain integration because overgrowth of white matter you probably know all this about autism lack of adequate pruning it's hard to get cross-brain communication in autistic kids which is one of the reasons you get kind of hyper specialization and fixations there's a really good scientific reason to think why things like being on a horse finding the refinding and the balance would help cross-brain communication which might allow for things like language and also it was just a lot of fun basically learned to speak on horseback it was pretty amazing remind me how old rowan was when you guys did this trip about five between five and six and you obviously alluded to kind of these outbursts right i mean children with autism obviously can have remarkable outbursts yeah because they get overwhelmed my son likes to tell me autistic children they don't tantrum because they're trying to get their way they do it just because they get overwhelmed and it's just a natural reaction but they don't do it to manipulate so it's interesting which i think is very true so where does self-compassion come into trauma you alluded to it very briefly up front but there's also some literature for formal diagnosis of ptsd isn't there oh in terms of self-compassion yes it's not so much that self-compassion aids in the diagnosis of ptsd there's a lot of research actually on self-compassion and trauma so there's kind of two parts to that research one is that people with early childhood trauma so sexual emotional physical abuse and actually hinders the ability to be self-compassionate as an adult and that's mainly because of the attachment system so if you have secure attachment it means you think you're kind of valuable you're worthy and your needs are worth being met if you had secure attachment with your parents and your parents treated you like you were worthy and they met your needs consistently then when you're an adult it's easier to think that i'm worthy and i'm going to meet my needs because i'm worthy of having my needs met if you have insecure attachment then you may not think that your needs are worthy of being met and if your parents were actually harshly critical or actually abusive what can happen is the system that's supposed to make you feel safe the attachment system gets fused with feelings of fear because these people who are your only source of safety and comfort in life are also terrifying you and then so what happens is everything gets kind of jumbled up and mixed in and for some people actually it can be frightening to give themselves compassion paul gilbert talks about this he calls it fear of self-compassion because basically when you're activating the attachment system which is supposed to make you feel safe it actually makes you unsafe and so some people when they start opening their hearts with self-compassion they have memories dramatic memories come up or like just this voice in their head saying you're crap you're worthless or maybe some memories of kind of some sort of abuse it's harder to be self-compassionate if you have a trauma history but having said that self-compassion is one of the best ways to deal with early childhood trauma because what you're doing is you're like re-parenting yourself so maybe the program is okay you're worthless you aren't worthy of care but if you actually intentionally give yourself compassion for those feelings which are so hard well it's really hard to feel that i'm worthless these feelings are shame they're really difficult how can i learn to relate to the pain of the trauma with some kindness it's not like cognitive behavioral therapy where you work directly with rewriting those negative schemas i mean that's also useful it has its role for sure what you're really doing is learning how to hold the pain any pain with this kind supportive stance and so when you do that there's actually some research showing you can get what they call earned secure attachment as an adult you can actually learn to have a secure attachment schema through self-compassion maybe your parents didn't meet your needs consistently but you can learn to meet your own needs consistently when you're frightened or you need help or you need support in some way it is harder the road's bumpier and it usually really helps have a good therapist help you unpack all of this once people can do it there's lots of research especially with compassion focused therapy created by paul gilbert which is specifically designed for people with early trauma there's different ways you have to approach it and the way in is a little different has to go slower and things are a little different but it actually is remarkably effective and you can get people who are able to heal from early trauma through self-compassion and so there's a research showing this if you look at trauma that's not cause for early childhood for instance there's a lot of work with combat veterans so combat veterans who went to iraq or afghanistan who experienced a lot of combat trauma what they found is those veterans who are more self-compassionate toward themselves about what they'd experienced they were less likely to develop post-traumatic stress syndrome and so in a way post-traumatic stress syndrome is when you know the trauma kind of almost gets locked in your body and you keep re-experiencing the trauma because you can't process it and so self-compassion towards the trauma helps you process it so it doesn't get kind of you might say locked into place through post-traumatic stress syndrome yeah which really makes so much sense when you look at the incredible success that the organization maps has had in testing mdma in people with ptsd because mdma is the ultimate compassion molecule so it basically takes a slight amount of compassion you might have and it just amplifies it tremendously and that's presumably why people in as few as two or three sessions can have otherwise debilitating ptsd rectified i think there's only one study that did show that mdma increased self-compassion but there isn't a lot i think there's a huge we'll see starting there's a huge boom already looking at psychedelics mdma mushrooms because what they do is they give you an experience of basically love and connectedness and i think as you say one of the reasons probably that it works is by increasing well both self-compassion and a sense of connectedness the two are actually go hand in hand i wouldn't be surprised if we find that that's kind of the active ingredient of how it works is through increased self-compassion increased mindfulness and increased connectives the three components of self-compassion are self-kindness mindfulness and common humanity or kind of the sense of connectedness and the three really do go hand in hand they operate as a system what's the relationship between those in physical health so there is an emerging literature that shows that self-compassion is linked to better physical health it's kind of a small to medium correlation maybe i think like there was a meta-analysis that found 0.28.30 so significant not mind-blowing but still there with physical symptoms at least self-reports of like colds aches pains physical symptoms a lot of research actually fuchsia stir was one of the big research in this area and she finds that it's linked to better physical health there's also research showing this is probably why it's linked to physical health is it operates through the nervous system so self-compassion and this is done either looking at self-report of self-compassion or by like enhancing a self-compassionate mood you can have people think of something they're dealing with and write to themselves a paragraph being mindful kind of accepting of what's happening remembering that they aren't alone common humanity and being kind to themselves like it would be to a friend if you induce the three components of self-compassion what we find is first of all reduces sympathetic activity things like inflammation things like cortisol levels and also increases heart rate variability which is the main marker we have of parasympathetic activity and it's probably by changing the nervous system reaction that it influences physical health because of course what your body's doing how reactive it is is linked to how healthy you are also immune function is linked to better immune function it actually seems to me like i wouldn't be surprised if a greater body of literature emerges from this because i think it sounds so cliche to say that the mind and the body are related but they are they clearly are and i think anybody who's tried to help people in one of those dimensions and not been able to help the other is pretty aware of that focus and and certainly i interviewed bob sapolsky some time ago and i think his work in stress is just so interesting and stress is really to me kind of just one other piece of this vector so i'm excited to hear that we're becoming more aware of this because obviously the lens i kind of come at all these things through is longevity and longevity isn't just living longer it's living better and that for me i think was the turning point in coming to accept the value of this was even if figuring out a way to become more self-compassionate didn't make you live one day longer it increases telomere length closely but even if it didn't the impact it would have on the quality of your life alone would be worth it and i think in the final analysis quality of life matters more than length of life and there's no reason you can't strive for both the old joke about lifelong caloric restriction is it will increase your lifespan and you'll know it or something to that effect it'll feel like it you'll live longer and it'll sure feel like it because you're so miserable so to me that's kind of a big part of it i want to kind of go back to tease out a little bit more of the nuance in this because one could easily misconstrue self-compassion for self-pity how do you distinguish these we need the three components of self-compassion just self-kindness or self-love it could be a self-focused state that i'm just poor me and i feel sorry for myself what's the difference between pity and compassion how do you know and what's the difference between when someone pittes you or someone has compassion for you if you think about it we like one and we don't like the other well that's a good question i mean pity feels condescending i suppose exactly this separation you're looking down is the separation compassion is hey i've been there man it's shared and that is the whole difference between compassion and pity and that's why in my measurement and my construct of self-compassion we need to include the sense of common humanity i name it common humanity i actually wanted to call it interdependence or inter being it's kind of like going beyond the separate self but i knew that that would be kind of a hard term for most people to get their head around but that's really what it's pointing to when you have self-compassion you recognize that everyone's imperfect everyone needs an imperfect life suffering failure hardship this is part of the shared human condition and also if you really go deeply enough with it you also realize that what i experience is not separated from what you experience it's all part of these interdependent causes and conditions co-arising in the idea that you can really separate yourself out of the larger hole and in some ways is an illusion you don't have to go that deeply with it but that's ultimately where it's pointing but if you didn't have that sense of connectedness in the experience of suffering it may turn into self-pity that's why that part has to be there also mindfulness so self-pity isn't very mindful self-pity tends to exaggerate it tends to catastrophize poor me this is like the worst thing ever kind of very self-focused mindfulness kind of has more equanimity it's more of a balanced state of mind and see things as it is is just the little things we do see importance just like say carry on that type of thing i'm not going to focus on the fact this is hard i'm just going to pretend it's not there that doesn't help but on the other hand catastrophizing doesn't help either and the mindfulness component partly comes from the inherent perspective that comes from self-compassion ironically it's interesting to think about this but because we are used to giving compassion to others whenever we give ourselves compassion there's like an inherent sense of perspective there because we're treating ourselves as we would treat another we aren't lost in our drama we're like stepping outside of ourselves and that perspective which actually leads it's not exactly the same as mindfulness but they're very related it actually gives us more perspective and balance in terms of how we relate to our own situation from my point of view all three need to be there to be self-compassionate and actually psychometrically if you look at psychometric analyses at the self-compassion scale they all operate as a system and all three change simultaneously so they really do operate as a system now one of the things that anybody who starts to practice this becomes aware of is when you fall short of it depending on how harsh a critic you are in the first place you can easily fall into a pattern of self-judgment right beating yourself up for beating yourself up it's the double bang yeah so what advice do you have for folks who want to begin this practice to pull themselves out of that spiral well i think it's really helpful to know why we criticize ourselves we criticize ourselves because we care the reason we criticize ourselves is because we want to be well we want to do our best we want to be safe we want people to love us to support us because we're afraid that if we don't do well maybe we're going to harm other people or we're going to harm ourselves bad things are going to happen to us if we don't do well and good things are going to happen to us we believe if we do do well and so it all comes from the basic sense of safety we don't need to beat ourselves up for beating ourselves up we need to have compassion for the reasons we beat ourselves up which comes with a very natural desire to be safe and once you recognize that it's like okay that's just me trying to be safe well actually there's a more effective way to help myself feel safe and that is by giving myself compassion for what's just happened when we teach people especially self-compassionate motivation if you want to help people move from motivating themselves with criticism to a more kind of constructive criticism more compassionate motivation if you leave out that step of having compassion and even gratitude to our inner critic for trying to keep ourselves safe it actually doesn't work and i think why that is is because that part of ourselves the self-critical part is really scared for its life in many ways it's like from that point of view it's like life will end if i fail or life will end if i make this mistake my life will end if i'm not a good archer whatever you know it's not a really rational part of ourselves it's just like an emotional reaction and so if we just skip over that part and say hey shut up i don't want to listen to you i want to listen to my compassionate part that part of us gets even more scared life's going to end and you aren't listening to me listen listen listen life's gonna end it's like it shouts even louder if we don't listen to it but if we listen to it and say hey okay i see you're worried you're worried about my safety thank you so much i hear you trust me i'll do everything i can to keep myself safe once you do that then it's much easier for the more compassionate part of ourselves to try to motivate a change kit also wants to keep us safe also wants to do our best also wants us to change unhealthy behaviors but does it not because it's afraid that will be inadequate but just because it cares it's a much more effective and sustainable voice of motivation i think that's a really interesting point i'm glad you brought it up because i don't think i've appreciated that nuance you do have to acknowledge again this maybe comes back to maybe not so much dick schwartz's model but other models of essentially us having wounded children within us adaptive children within us functional adults etc you can't ignore anyone's voice inside that's right and the idea is just integration we want integration and we want to learn part of what your inner critic is telling you may be useful but you just want to clean what's useful and what's useful is probably about where did you go wrong what could you do better next time it's not useful to say you're worthless or you're a bad person what are you going to do with that right it's not helpful but you don't want to shut down that voice at all but you don't want it dominating things either because it's a very one-sided very kind of immature not very wise part of yourself that just is freaking out basically i have no doubt that there is a very strong correlation between and it would really be a reciprocal correlation or an inverse correlation between high levels of self-compassion and low levels of maladaptive behaviors such as addictions i wouldn't dispute that for a second what i'm curious about is how much is causative in other words is there any evidence that we could use self-compassion as an intervention to treat at least partially maladaptive behaviors gambling substance addiction things like that i wish there were more research on self-compassion and addiction there is a little bit of intervention research i believe actually trying to think is there a randomized controlled trial with addiction as the outcome with the intervention there may not be i think it's more cross-sectional research that shows they're negatively correlated and of course we don't know causality in that case there's some research showing that one of the things when aaa is successful it appears that one of the reasons it may be successful is because it increases self-compassion by the way i think it depends what group you belong to i've had people who've gone through a a that said it was all about shame another say it was all about self-compassion so i think it definitely varies depending on what group you go to i would be willing to bet money that you would find that i don't think we're quite there yet and in terms of the two-way causality for instance if you're really addicted it may make it harder for you to be self-compassionate once you come off the substance it may be easier to be more self-compassionate so all these things are always kind of bidirectional and how easy is this i mean i think is we sort of think and look to the future of using self-compassion as an intervention so if you think about the easiest interventions or drugs here's a pill the treatment group gets a placebo pill the intervention group gets an active pill all you have to do is take this one pill once a day and we'll figure out if it lowered your blood pressure your cholesterol well when you start to get into now we're going to test whether mindfulness-based meditation is beneficial or self-compassion is beneficial it becomes more complicated how challenging is it from a clinical research standpoint to package the practice that you've spent the better part of 20 years refining in yourself writing about but then taking it into a clinical setting with a group of subjects and being able to blind them being able to randomize them and then blind researchers who are going to measure outcomes based on obviously the differences in behaviors we have developed the mindful self-compassion training program which actually isn't designed for clinical populations but can be adapted for clinical populations and there's also compassion focused therapy which is similar that is designed for clinical populations and there have been randomized controlled trials of both with a weightless control which isn't as good as an active control where you put people in peer support you might get similar findings and actually expect you might get similar findings from a peer support group it's actually not that difficult i think we definitely have the tools in place right now to do the research i'm not doing that research because i'm more focused on developing the interventions i really hope people do also i don't think it has to be reinventing the wheel i think adding some explicit self-compassion to pre-existing interventions that we know work is probably the way to go there's more than just self-compassion self-compassion isn't everything i think including mindfulness interventions i have to say personally my feeling is although mindfulness training naturally increases self-compassion it makes it stronger if you make it explicit if you give people explicit tools they can use to practice self-compassion that's not meditation because when you're like in the supermarket and you have some thought or something happens you aren't going to sit down and meditate in that moment but you can put your hand on your heart and say something supportive to yourself it's very portable it's very scalable and that's the research shows it doesn't require meditation to learn it which also makes it more accessible to a lot more people i love meditation but it's just a lot of people aren't going to meditate that's just reality the self-compassion is easier it's more portable it's more scalable i personally think if we started looking at does adding explicit self-compassion into these interventions strengthen it i suspect you'd find it does we're not quite there i think you're right by the way i think that's exactly the way to go about doing it is you take interventions that are already known to have some efficacy and you layer this on because i think as your story explains this is a relatively straightforward intervention to teach somebody and the results can happen quite quickly i mean if someone who's as harsh as self-critic as i am can in a period of months with a little bit of daily practice with something tangible because it's tangible to practice i'm quite excited about it in the sense that i think there's a pretty big opportunity there i want to go just into this the mindfulness component a little bit because you've made this point now several times which is look mindfulness is not a necessary component of self-compassion it is a necessary component of self-compassion oh it is okay so i misunderstood maybe i misunderstood i thought a mindfulness-based meditation practice is what i really mean is that necessary you don't need to meditate to be mindful so meditation is probably the most tried and true way to increase mindfulness most mindfulness training programs base their techniques on meditation but being mindful is just kind of being aware whenever you're aware that you're suffering you're being mindful of your suffering especially when you're aware in a certain way when you're aware not like freaking out aware but you're aware like okay this is what's happening so mindfulness itself you can't have self-compassion without some degree of mindfulness but our research shows we did a randomized controlled trial the mindful self-compassion program and we found that practice was linked to gain some self-compassion but it didn't matter whether that practice was sitting down and doing self-compassion meditations the program has many or it was just simple things like taking the self-compassion break in the middle of your day and you notice you're suffering giving yourself kindness and support like you showed a good friend it didn't matter how you practiced so meditation isn't necessary but mindfulness is and you can also learn mindfulness without meditation it's just a little tricky because mindfulness is kind of vague and abstract it's hard to get your hands around it so meditation helps do you think an analogy to make this point would be that having strong legs is necessary for walking up a hill one way to do that is just to walk up a hill another way to do it is actually go to the gym every day lift weights and walk up the hill where the actual mindfulness meditation is the going to the gym it's doing the very concentrated focused exercise technically you don't have to do it to still do well but you're in the long run maybe gonna do better yeah so we don't know we don't have data in the long run what's better i mean meditation we know it's tried and true it can change your neural pathways meditation is good i believe meditation i'm a meditator i think it's a little unfortunate that so much emphasis been placed on meditation because not everyone's going to meditate not everyone wants to meditate some people don't have time to meditate it doesn't appeal to them again i do think self-compassion is more scalable you can have someone so for instance we just did a training program for healthcare workers working at a pediatric hospital six weeks of training one hour a week just done at lunch very minimal training we did not give them any homework they had to do outside of the class because they didn't have time they were you know stressed out healthcare professionals we didn't give them any meditation but we said on the job whenever you notice you're stressed or upset or have something difficult happens we give them certain practices they could use to deal with it we did give some informal mindfulness practices like feel the souls of your feet you know come back to the present moment we did things like the self-compassion break put your hand on your heart and help people develop phrases that work for them to remind them of the three components of self-compassion and they got a lot out of it they didn't have to meditate after we taught the program a lot of them said actually maybe i'll take the full program learn how to meditate you know what i mean so yeah so maybe they'll go on to meditate after learning some self-compassionate actually there's some research that shows it helps you stick with the meditation practice if you have self-compassion because meditation is hard but i don't think it's the only way forward and i do think i just think unfortunately in our culture there's a way in which it seems kind of foreign to people i think there's a lot of blocks to meditation that aren't there with self-compassion but it's obviously stuck for you you've gone on several retreats it sounds like yeah 40 retreats i don't go on retreats nearly as much as i used to first of all the pandemic and just my life getting so busy but i still meditate yeah what is it for you that has kept meditation as sort of part of your daily routine well the meditation the reason is useful because what meditation basically is is just it's a really focused time you aren't doing anything else you're kind of reducing sensory input i actually usually meditate in bed it's not quite as good as doing it on the cushion but it's still pretty good and it's kind of more doable for me right so i'll do early in the morning or late at night you don't fall asleep doing that sometimes i do but sometimes i don't like if i do it when i'm really awake if i wake up at three in the morning let's say my mind's racing then it's a really good time to do it and it actually will help me fall asleep i'll be honest the quality of the meditation is not quite as good as when i sit on my cushion but at least i do it whereas sometimes i just find i don't have time yeah so meditation is helpful first of all because what happens when you meditate is you get into a certain brain state basically what happens is your default load network quiets and so your brain state changes and it's easier for you to see clearly it's easier for you to pay attention there's less chatter in the brain and that's very helpful yes so meditation is great but i just don't want people to think that unless they meditate they can't learn this skill so for instance there was one study that just had people kind of like you instead of texting themselves kindness they wrote a compassionate letter to themselves the three components mindfulness common humanity kindness once a day for seven days one week and it reduced depression for three months and increased happiness for six months that's doable anyone could do that you don't have to learn how to meditate to do that and it still helps you does your son have a practice around this it sounds like he's quite aware he's finally coming around to self-compassion but he fought it tooth and nail for years i mean just really recently like the last few months he's come around to it he used to say don't give me that self-compassion stuff mommy because he didn't want to accept the pain he wanted to fight the pain you don't want to accept imperfection he was like just clinging on tooth and nail you know to he wanted the pain to go away he didn't want imperfection to be there he was like full-on resistance but he could articulate it and i would kind of think okay well good luck with that one what can i do like you can try to fight the pain unfortunately i know it's not going to help but people have to come to that conclusion themselves but now finally he's starting to see the value of being kind to himself and see the value of it's kind of understanding that yeah he's got to accept imperfection he said to me the other day he said imperfection is like spicy food you know if everything was perfect all our meals would be bland you know we need some variety we need some spice to our life and that he came up with that himself that's kind of amazing yeah it is and he's finally getting there he's 18 now and he's really getting kind of to the next level of self-reflection and stuff so he's a little behind but he's definitely getting there you have a workbook that's based on your book correct the mindful self-compassion workbook is basically the mindful self-compassion program which i co-developed with chris germer we met back in 2008 we're partners and we've created this program we've got the center for mindful self-compassion we have teacher training we have adaptations it's its own thing chris and i was totally us together that created this program and the workbook is the eight-week program in workbook formats you basically take yourself through the program yeah i mean to me that seems like a really logical place for somebody to start if listening to this podcast has got them interested and at least piqued some amount of curiosity around this idea it's a very structured way to go through this it's not the way i did it but i've looked through the book and i thought boy this is a really nice way to be guided through something i would certainly make a plug for that you can just get it on amazon it's easy it's like ten dollars yeah if you want to actually train in self-compassion it's an empirically supported program there are randomized controlled trials it's very carefully sequenced we refine the program over years and years and years and what worked and what didn't work i'm pretty confident in the efficacy of the program but if you want like more personal stories then you could probably go my first book self-compassion or chris grimmer's book the mindfulness half the self-compassion some people don't like workbooks they like more like the stories and so that would be my trade book well kristen this has been a really interesting discussion and i'm really a huge believer in this in this work that you're doing and you've also lived it too you've had these ups and downs and these challenges that have i think kind of allowed you to sort of roll with things that are hard i had a lot to be self-compassionate about that's for sure well i look forward to meeting you in person at some point when this pandemic rolls over and again thanks so much for your time today thank you it's lovely
