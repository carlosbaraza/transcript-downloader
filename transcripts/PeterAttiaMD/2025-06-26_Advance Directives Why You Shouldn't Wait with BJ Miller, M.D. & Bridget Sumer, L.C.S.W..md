## AI Summary

Here's my analysis of this portion of The Drive podcast episode on Advance Directives:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. BJ Miller and Bridget Sumer discussing the importance of advance directives and medical decision-making. The conversation focuses on why everyone over 18 should have an advance directive, the process of choosing a medical proxy, and how to approach these crucial but often difficult conversations. They emphasize the importance of understanding not just what medical interventions to avoid, but what makes life meaningful for the person making the directive.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Only about 20% of people have advance directives despite most believing they're important [00:01:48]
- Advance directives are legally valid without requiring a lawyer [00:01:48]
- Data shows healthcare providers often have different perspectives on quality of life than patients living with disabilities [00:06:00]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Everyone 18+ should have an advance directive [00:01:48]
- Have multiple conversations about wishes over time, not just once [00:05:09]
- Focus on what makes life meaningful rather than just what treatments to avoid [00:07:18]

4. **Notable Quotes**:
"The job is not for you to insert your will... The job is for you to honor the other person's wishes." [00:04:26]

"We are adaptive. We have capacities that we don't know until something comes along to pull them out of us." [00:06:00]

5. **Follow-up Questions**:
- What are the specific components of a comprehensive advance directive?
- How often should advance directives be updated?
- What are the legal implications of different types of medical proxies?
- How does the "Allow Natural Death" (AND) movement differ from traditional DNR orders in practice?

The remaining categories (Supplements & Medications, Exercise & Movement, Nutrition & Diet, Biomarkers & Testing) were not discussed in this portion of the transcript.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or analyze additional sections of the transcript?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] How far into this relationship are you broaching medical decisionmaking, power of attorney, things like that? I mean, these are these are and and are those are those difficult discussions in that they they require sort of a cognitive acceptance like I'm actually now putting medical decisionm into someone's hands who are not my own because in the future I'm going to lose the capacity to make those decisions. I mean, how difficult discussion is that?

[00:00:30] I think it really depends on the person, right? And how how, you know, have they really truly managed all of those decisions by themselves or they're used to some back and forth or they have a different model that's quite intertwined. So, um, for some people that's really hard to imagine. I think in my experience like in the neurologic illness space so often if a patient has someone which not all do that person's coming to visits right because they've been showing signs where they're not remembering or you know they couldn't get to the doctor's office on their own or get the zoom up by themselves etc. So they're often presenting with somebody else and there's immediately another person to engage with their experience. What are some questions you're going to ask that patient as their cognition is declining and things that you need clarity on from them their wishes? What do you want to understand? Well, you brought up advanced directives and advanced care planning and so let's just spend a moment on that. That's we should all if you're 18 in this country, you should have an advanced directive, you know, and my guess is virtually nobody who's young and healthy has one. That's true.

[00:01:48] I mean, virtually anyone who's older and isn't healthy has one. Exactly. I mean, you know, we ask these questions in studies and also just casually if you give a talk, say, how many people have an advanced directive? You know, maybe 20% of people raise their hand. How many people think an advanced directive is really important? Like most people raise their hand. So there's a none of us many of us are not doing the thing we know we're supposed to do. We just it's this deferable thing like life insurance you know anyway. So one sort of public service announcement here is advanced directives is very important. You can download a form online like this is a free but you don't need a lawyer to do this. No you do not need a lawyer to do this. So um and the most important thing to come out of an advanced directive if you had to pick sort of one of the questions that gets asked it's probably the proxy. If, god forbid, you all of a sudden in an accident or something happens and we can't ask you, Peter, what kind of care is important to you, who do you want speaking on your behalf in such a moment as that? And that's probably the the most important question to get clear on. And you know, why would a young a young healthy person think about that? So, my first advanced directive, I was in my late 20s when I actually finally did it, even though

[00:02:58] I've been in these conversations for a long time. And I I one day was imagining, you know, something unexpected happening, not being able to participate in a conversation, lying in a hospital bed. I was imagining my parents who do not speak to each other trying to make decisions over their child and my, you know, casual partner at the time, you know, mostly casual partner at the time kind of sitting there trying to figure out how they belonged in the scene. And I was like, I don't want that for them.

[00:03:28] Regardless of what happens to me and my body or, you know, what they actually choose, like to actually put myself in the position of the people that those choices would default to. Yeah. Like I didn't want that for them. I didn't I didn't you know if I was at all sentient I definitely didn't want to hear it but

[00:03:47] I I didn't want them in throws of totally unexpected grief to be trying to negotiate that relationally. Right. It's an awesome responsibility. I um I'm very honored to say the the number of people that have asked me to be the decision maker for them. I can't imagine how many have asked you this, BJ, but I mean there are more than a dozen friends who have asked me this and I say the same thing to all of them, which is it's an honor to do it, but we have to sit and talk. Like it's not you can't hand me that stick and and just sign my name on there cuz I like we're going to have dinner. We're going to have a bottle of wine. We are going to talk this through.

[00:04:26] I need to know how to do this. I really need to understand what you want and don't want. Yeah. you good on you because a lot of people don't do that and again the job is not for you to insert it's not my will. Yeah, exactly. The job is for you to honor the other person's wishes. Speak on their behalf.

[00:04:43] So to do that well you have to know the person's wishes and that's not a couple of questions. That's a big old conversation. And just as you do with the bal dinner like that's what we're doing with patients. You're setting a table that's comfortable. Often you're sitting you're asking intimate questions. As providers, you may be sharing intimate details too as part of a relational sort of set a table for in you know in intimate things to happen.

[00:05:09] So I just want to borrow your table setting there. That's what we do too. It's a important piece of getting to this level of detail. So um and it's also true like you don't have those conversations once. I want to Bridget's saying a lot of really important things. I want to double click on another thing like that. The advanced directive the the conceit is problematic right out of the shoots. You're asking someone to prom putting themselves in this future oriented position where they're in a situation that they can't imagine where they can't speak and so what will they want then? So it's a problem. It's but it's as best it's as it's as best as we have you know but it's a problematic tool. And as people move through life with illness or disability, their realization of what they can or might like to live with shifts. You know, we have data around this, right?

[00:06:00] You ask a bunch of health care providers, if you were brought into your own emergency department quadriplegic from an accident, would you want your colleagues to save your life? You know, most providers say, "Hell no, I could never live like that." You know, go ask most quad people who live with quadriplegia if they're happy to be alive and say, "Yeah, I couldn't have imagined this." But, you know, same with me. I, hey, you're going to lop three limbs off. Are you cool with that? Like, no. No. But then you, you know, as it goes in this life, we are adapt adaptive. We have capacities that we don't know until something comes along to pull them out of us. So part of this, you know, mindbender of an advanced directive is to allow room for that for a person's sense of themselves and their capacity to change in any direction. So all that is a preamble to say you have these conversations over time, multiple times, and let the person change over time. I think it's also like this is one of those places where you want to focus on the things that are important to you, the experiences that are central to to good days, to meaningful time. Because you know, having counseledled a lot of people actually in the acute moments of having to make these decisions, being able to reorient them towards like, you know, what I've heard you say is that your dad was like always in his garden.

[00:07:18] He wanted to be at home. like if he could hear your voice, that's what was important to you. Blah blah blah blah. Like the ventilator doesn't get us there, right? That the what are we moving towards is um uh is much more motivating than not doing X Y and Z, not intubating, not resuscitating because those things for most people like exist from scenes from TV shows and are still pretty far away. But we can really but it is easier for people to choose like the scene that we're going towards that they can square against how they knew their person. Um so I I sort of I mean there's there are people who are very clear about AB and C interventions being something that they would never want. Um and and I certainly honor that. Maybe I hold it with a little bit of grain of salt, but I honor it. that I'm more interested in when I have been asked to be in that role to understand you know what what makes this person's life not cuz it's going to perfectly translate like if I can't dance under the full moon in Bali like my life is not enough and you're like okay but what if you could like see the full moon from your bed like is that you know like we we that's a really important point Bridget

[00:08:38] I've never thought of it that way um I I probably have just always had a bias towards okay what are the things we don't want to do what are the things we don't want to do right the we talk like think about medical lingo DNR DNI no chest pounding no intubation blah blah blah blah blah but I like this framing better of okay like what are the minimum set of requirements you need to have to be really to to still hold some delight in life and you know what do we need to get you there that those are the those are the steps we'll take there's language around that

[00:09:10] Peter by there's a movement to change DNR to A and D allow natural death to get away from the things we're not doing and the things that we're are doing just to to make that point and it interesting has that is that has that taken hold yet I don't know that it's taken hold but there is a there is an effort to try I like that and I think you just to your point it's a really if we have a sense of what we're moving towards even if we have to be very flexible and allow our mind to change on route that's just a much more viable. It's It's much more uh it's a much more deliberate path and it's also very helpful for those around us to know what to do versus just not to do.
