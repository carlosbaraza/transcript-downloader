## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast with Dave Feldman:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features an in-depth discussion between Peter Attia and Dave Feldman about lipids, cholesterol, and cardiovascular disease risk. The conversation centers around Feldman's "energy model" hypothesis regarding lean mass hyper-responders (people who develop very high LDL cholesterol on low-carb diets) and whether their elevated LDL represents increased cardiovascular risk. Attia challenges several aspects of Feldman's model, particularly regarding mass balance and the source of increased cholesterol in these individuals.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- LDL particle half-life is approximately one day under normal conditions [1:40:42]
- About 40% of LDL comes directly from the liver [40:27]
- Oxidized LDL testing can measure escaped particles from the subendothelial space [55:43]
- Three factors necessary for atherosclerosis: lipoprotein burden, endothelial function, and inflammatory response [1:07:25]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Monitor both LDL-P and LDL-C, not just standard lipid panel [19:05]
- Consider advanced lipid testing before starting low-carb diet [20:20]

Context-specific recommendations:
- For lean mass hyper-responders: consider reducing saturated fat while maintaining ketosis [2:19:22]
- Monitor oxidized LDL as a marker of cardiovascular risk [55:43]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Medications mentioned:
- Statins [1:24:59]
- PCSK9 inhibitors (Repatha) [1:03:59]
- Zetia [1:08:21]

5. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
Key tests discussed:
- LDL-P (particle number)
- LDL-C (cholesterol)
- Oxidized LDL
- Des-mosterol (cholesterol synthesis marker)
- Phytosterols
- LP-PLA2
- Calcium score
- CIMT

6. **Notable Quotes**:
"LDL is necessary but not sufficient for atherosclerosis" - Peter Attia [1:07:25]

"The body of evidence implicating LDL as having a causal role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is on a different level from the body of literature that gave us the food pyramid" - Peter Attia [2:31:00]

7. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What is the exact mechanism of cholesterol synthesis upregulation in lean mass hyper-responders?
2. How does exercise type (resistance vs. endurance) affect LDL particle dynamics?
3. What role does liver glycogen status play in VLDL secretion?
4. How can we better measure remnant lipoproteins clinically?

This episode provides valuable insights into the complexity of lipid metabolism and cardiovascular risk assessment, particularly in the context of low-carbohydrate diets. The discussion highlights the importance of considering multiple factors beyond basic lipid panels when assessing cardiovascular risk.

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD com hey everyone before introducing today's guest a couple of housekeeping issues first if you're enjoying the podcast you'd like to wake up Sunday mornings to what I promise is a non lame email on what I've been up to and the most interesting papers I've read or some other relevant insight please sign up for my weekly email at Peter Tiye MD com secondly if you have any questions on the papers topics or people or anything that we discuss on the podcast be sure to check out the show notes which are at my website my team puts a ton of work into doing this and we've been getting great feedback on just how robust they are so I just wanna make sure that people know it's out there if in fact you finish a podcast and you're like that that was a little over my head in this area or what were they talking about here pretty much anything that's discussed on the podcast is going to be found in more detail there so head on over there if that's something that interests you certainly today's podcast will provide an opportunity to test that third if you're enjoying the podcast it would be an honor if you would head over to Apple podcast and leave a review and if you don't like the podcast I guess you can leave a review also but I'm probably not gonna ask you to spend as much time doing so alright on to today's guest now this is gonna be a slightly longer introduction than normal apologies in advance if you positively absolutely don't want to hear it just skip ahead I don't know five minutes or so if you're a low carbon thews iasts you've undoubtedly heard about Dave

[00:01:58] Feldman and his cholesterol drop roll call and his take on what he calls lean mass hyper responders or people who go on ketogenic or low carbohydrate diets see a very high LDL cholesterol and or LDL particle number you've probably also heard the Davis somewhat skeptical of the LDL is causal paradigm more thinking in atherosclerosis so you're probably understand that out of the gate Dave and

[00:02:23] I don't really see eye to eye on the genesis of heart disease we go right into the conversation assuming people know the background and the reason for that is I knew that this was going to be a long enough discussion anyway and I'd already heard Dave on a number of other podcasts present his model and his observations so I thought rather than recapitulate those things here we would link to those previous shows of which there are at least two or three including a couple of presentations on

[00:02:49] YouTube so that you can kind of watch those if you're not already familiar with Dave's hypotheses I do recommend that you familiarize yourself with these because as I said I didn't really make the time in this episode for Dave to go into the depth that he would normally go into and again that wasn't out of any reason other than I knew that we were gonna have enough to talk about without that and I didn't want to reproduce or recreate the wheel so to speak no I believe Dave is putting up a companion blog post for this episode so if you head on over to his site which is cholesterol code dot-com he will undoubtedly have his own links and show notes and that will probably on some level overlap with what we do but also probably provide some new information now we've got a kind of a special treat on this as well which is Tom Dayspring who if you don't know who Tom is you certainly will by the next week or so because Tom is kind of my foremost lipid mentors and I wanted him to make sure that anything that Dave and I said that wasn't accurate was sort of corrected so he's actually taking a look at the transcript of this which we usually pulled together for our episodes and he's kind of weighed in with some commentary mostly clarifying and elaborating on some technical stuff but even as I said correcting any mistakes that we've made so hopefully Tom's clarifications to the transcript will be valuable to those who want to kind of get on the next level of detail the show notes will have lots of links to graphics that help conceptualize some of these topics we get into I mean a lot of the time that Dave and I were talking we were looking at diagrams and pointing things out and so we hope to reproduce that for you now before jumping into this episode I do want to provide my summary and synthesis of where I've landed in my own mind when all was said and done I think I came into this with a point of view and I think I left with a slightly different point of view and I think that it's actually kind of hard maybe to follow the logic in my mind as I go through the episode so I thought in the days after we recorded this which was in July this year 2018 that I would sort of just put my thoughts down and sort of crystallize them so again kind of an unusual thing to do but I do think that this is a complicated enough topic that it's helpful ultimately I am not convinced by

[00:05:04] Dave's model and again truthfully I came into this maybe 20% thinking that there was a chance I would find the the argument convincing but I left with that number being a lot less and I'll explain why there are basically three reasons the first is Dave was unable to explain to me the mass balance meaning how does one account for the greater amount of cholesterol in and the greater number of the LDL particles now it's possible that at the time of this podcast being released Dave has given more thought to the questions I posed and has an answer for that but no one including Dave is disputing that the phenotype of interest has more LDL cholesterol and more LDL particles so therefore there was only three ways this can happen and these three ways are collectively exhaustive but not mutually exclusive first you can make more cholesterol second you can clear less cholesterol and third you can transfer cholesterol from other pools that we didn't see previously such as cell membranes into pools that we now look at such as the lipoprotein I think the data makes the first of these cases by far the most likely but Dave seemed unable to address why that would be the case and therefore what could possibly account for this increase in the LDL P and the LDL C so on first principles my doubt of the model has gone up from where we started the discussion to where we are now because the person who developed the model wasn't able to really articulate to me one of the most fundamental tenets any physical model which is it must respect mass balance not to be clear even if this fundamental condition were met it would not be sufficient to make the case that this phenotype is not at risk it would be at best a necessary but not sufficient criteria so in addition to not being able to really explain the mass balance of how these additional molecules of cholesterol show up in the

[00:07:00] LDL particles the second thing that I found difficult to reconcile was the Dave argued that VLDL production was driving the LDL concentration but the fact remains that an insulin sensitive people which presumably this phenotype that he's referring to are it's actually the opposite that is true there were fewer not more triglycerides being exported from the liver and there was less not more a possi 3 on the VLDL particles this would actually reduce not increase their residence time in other words these so-called lean mass hyper responders would actually have less vl2

[00:07:38] LDL conversion than say someone with type 2 diabetes and I even point out in this discussion that even the person with type 2 diabetes does not have nearly as much of the LDL as we might think they do so I really see no evidence whatsoever from this energy model which is I believe the terminology Dave uses that we could explain this phenotype on the balance of triglyceride export through the LDL to LDL the third point that I still was not able to fully come to grips with was that basically even if you ignored the first two points

[00:08:10] I've made which I would argue you can't I'm still unconvinced at this notion that we should exclude the roughly 2,000 genetic mutations that are known to produce a phenotype of high LDL high HDL and low triglyceride these are called natural experiments and we have as I said about 2,000 of such these natural experiments and surely at least some of these cases for example the pcsk9 gain of functions are excellent proxies for the key features of these lean mass hyper responders and yet to ignore them for reasons that are not at all based in our understanding of the physiology of this disease for example the pcsk9 hyper functions somehow having toxic endothelium reactions in response to this inability or impaired ability to take up cholesterol despite there being no evidence of that being true because there's no evidence that pcsk9 hyper functioning patients use an LDL receptor to take up cholesterol into their endothelial cells is to basically say that one doesn't want to know the answer to this question now I believe Dave is about his intellectually honest as anybody is in this space and I've made no secret of my general disdain for the groups of folks that claim that LDL is not causal and atherosclerosis none of this is to suggest that I can be entirely certain that folks of this phenotype with very high LDL are absolutely at increased risk for atherosclerosis or to state that more technically that their risk for atherosclerosis is commensurate with their lipid profile I don't know that and ultimately I don't think we'll ever really know that nothing that Dave or I discussed could ever definitively make that case for the reasons that you know make this study of lipids challenging science is based on skepticism and uncertainty is forever elusive so science gets better and gets sharper through this type of discussion but that said a body of evidence produces a probability of accuracy and in the end the probability of one idea here seems disproportionately higher than the other and as I said coming into this discussion

[00:10:13] I thought the probability that Dave's ideas were correct was quite low but following this discussion I feel I would say of a higher degree of confidence that his hypothesis is not correct in other words my confidence and the probability of his hypothesis being correct has gone down based on these three points I raised above the idea of probability and is the knew once that's sort of missing from this discussion and that's what troubles me I guess is that people think that we're dealing with a disease that has one and only one risk factor when in reality we know that atherosclerosis is incredibly complicated and is impacted by many things beyond the lipoproteins but that doesn't diminish their role in the causality of atherosclerosis in the end

[00:10:58] I would ask you to make up your own mind because ultimately anyone who's listening to this who's LDL is through the roof as a result of going on a ketogenic or low carbohydrate diet has to make a decision for themselves and so I hope that what Dave and I have discussed here allows you to make a slightly more informed decision that you could have made before and some of the other guests that I have already had on this podcast including

[00:11:23] Ron Krause or those that will be on the podcast including next week's guest Tom Dayspring will allow you to further think through those issues so without further delay and with apologies for how long this intro took welcome to this episode with mr. Dave Feldman hey Dave welcome to San Diego thanks for having me Peter you're here for a conference as

[00:11:46] I correct that's right low-carb USA God if that would explain all of the low-carb folks that seem to be in town this weekend how many are gonna end up showing up here none I'm actually leaving very early tomorrow to go to new house so I will be missing this I'm either deeply honored or very scared right now no I actually was gonna try to talk to one other person too but they bailed on me and took a better offer this is gonna be a bit of a different episode Dave in the sense that I think this will be even by the standards of this podcast perhaps a bit more technical at times and I think this will probably a podcast where you know I've already spoken offline I suspect a lot of what we discuss will need to be included in show notes because there's just gonna be so much of visual stuff there's so much data we're gonna be talking about and some of its just quite graphical in nature which is not to be confused with graphic we will apologize in advance that this might be one of those shows when you're gonna probably get the most out of it sitting in front of your computer but nevertheless hopefully we can certainly get some interesting stuff out of the way I've been trying to think about how to set the stage for this because I think it's safe to say many people listening to this don't know who you are and don't know what we're going to be talking about or why we're even having this discussion so I'm gonna take a small liberty of trying to synthesize some of what I've heard you say in the past but then turn it over to you to clarify it and kind of put it in context from my standpoint I think you're one of the more thoughtful people on what I would call the LDL is not necessarily causal and heart disease camp and so certainly there's a number of people out there for various different reasons who have argued that the causality of low density lipoprotein and atherosclerosis is not a foregone conclusion and in fact there may be a subset of people in whom it's not quite relevant and what you and

[00:13:44] I have done over the years has had email exchanges and things like that and you've been very curious you've done a lot of self experimentation which you won't find a more sympathetic audience for self experimentation than me and I think in large part we want to kind of explore some of the deep lipid ology around these ideas but ultimately it comes back to a question and this is I think the question that at least if I'm gonna be selfish as the question I care about which is today I have to make a decision and I mean that literally so meaning at five o'clock this morning I had a call with a patient luckily he was in a different time zone but we had to make a decision about his lipids and I will have three more interactions with patients today of which two will center around the same discussion so ultimately decisions have to be made about how to manage dyslipidemia and most decisions have to be made with incomplete information so I certainly don't have any expectation that we will emerge from this discussion knowing an answer but nevertheless hopefully we'll have clarified a few things so before I go any further Dave if someone were asking you what are you known for with respect to this so you can probably juggle five tennis balls simultaneously or something else but with respect to this discussion how does the low-carb community to kind of describe you well and many of them right now would describe me as a lipid expert the irony is that I actually push off that reputation to some degree I'm not a formally trained biochemist I'm not a medical professional I regularly feel like I need to emphasize that in fact I I think that your series straight dope on cholesterol was probably a way for a lot of people myself included to kind of short-circuit a lot of the formal education that typically one would have to go through through university to get to really the general concepts of lipoproteins and how they work within the system and so what got me to this place going a little bit backward is that I went on a low-carb diet and now this story is fairly vic wa tiss you hear it a lot a number of people myself included saw their cholesterol rise substantially after that happened yes / what you just talked about I started doing enormous amounts of self-experimentation and I started elucidating a pattern and part of what motivated me to do that was that even though I had very little training on the medical side I did have a lot on the network side as a software engineer and I saw a pattern that looked very familiar to me and without getting into a lot of geeky terminology if there happens to be any software engineers listening you'll probably be familiar with this term it's called dependency injection and it's something that gets involved with networks of distributed objects and I saw that with lipoproteins which you talked about at length in the straight dope on cholesterol and if I can by the way interject just this one thing thank you for making that serious

[00:16:47] I know I'm not the only person listening right now who would say that it really was kind of a light during a very dark time and so from that kind of this whole journey began and weirdly I went from being a fairly well paid software engineer to kind of a poor in of one scientist definitely tackling just exactly how far I could take moving around my cholesterol and I'm gonna make an outrageous claim I can do it this week cuz I have too many things going on but I had always fantasized about the possibility of having a conversation with you and given where I'm out on the research now saying I would like you to write down a number between 100 and 350 and then once you do in about a week's time I'm going to move my LDL see cholesterol to that number plus or minus 20 milligrams per deciliter and I think that would have been a lot of fun and maybe we'll get a chance to do that in the future but the bottom line is I feel as if I've come across enough with my own mapping of my own metabolism that I found how I can move LDL cholesterol and

[00:17:47] LDL particle count up and down without medication or supplements by finding what I believe to be the primary influencer which is the energy metabolism especially that of fatty acid utilization for energy okay I think the other thing we'll want to make sure listeners have done by this point if they want to get really deep on the understanding of this is probably go back and listen to at least one but potentially two or three of the other podcasts you've been on you've been interviewed a number of times I've had the privilege of listening to several of them which is what helped me get more up to speed on some of your arguments and I think rather than just spend an hour going over those again here I'd rather we sort of get to it more quickly which we will and then let the listener go back and get that way of background so with that said let's talk a little bit about your story so before you went on a low carbohydrate diet you probably had a standard lipid panel it probably showed what I believe the very last one that I had was typical of what I'd usually had gotten which is my total cholesterol I believe it was 186 my LDL see was 131 my

[00:19:05] HDL was 40 and my triglycerides were 80 obviously people who have heard me talk about this before will know that that tells us virtually nothing your total cholesterol is of no interest your LDL cholesterol at 131 by the framingham puts you a little over the 50th percentile your HDL cholesterol of 40 puts you quite a bit below that actually and your Triggs of 80 in someone who's

[00:19:31] Caucasian doesn't give us a great insight gives us even less insight if you were african-american but your trig to HDL ratio of about two would be considered acceptable by most most people would even consider up to three acceptable so we would have no way of knowing from this what your LDL particle number would be or your a PO B which would be better predictors of your risk than any of these numbers here but nevertheless this is what everybody gets right this has throat of the standard test yes and in fact anybody who's ever considering going on a low-carb diet it's one of the first things I jump on as I say do me a favor and take a particle count test before you start the diet because I think a lot of us would be very interested to know what particle counts are before people start the diets it may actually hold keys to understanding what's going on with what I'm not sure if it was you or

[00:20:20] Tom Dayspring I think one of the two of you first started using the term hyper responder to elucidate those people who going on a low-carb diets either cholesterol go high not just the reality LC but the particle count yeah I think Tom would deserve the credit for that in fact it'll probably come up many times throughout this discussion and will certainly linked to it Tom wrote a really fantastic piece on this in his lip holux series I think it was in 2013 might have been 2014 but it was following a number of cases that he and

[00:20:55] I had shared back and forth about this phenomenon I would add something else Dave if you're gonna make a request that people draw the advanced lipid panels before the other thing that is essential is that they get a sterile panel and that's not to be confused with sterile like you know I'll it's sterile oh L and the reason for that is that there are basically four things that are moving

[00:21:21] LDL particle number and when I sit down with patients and talk about this we always start from this place which is what moves the LDL P well three things that move it are generally cargo related and one is generally clearance related so the two things that move at the macro-level the cargo is the amount of triglyceride it's carrying in the amount of cholesterol it's carrying or to be more specific cholesterol ester so to get a sense of what its trial is right burden is you can get a crude sense from looking at the serum triglyceride level though there are no commercially available tests to my knowledge that actually measure the triglyceride content of an LDL particle at the research level that's been done and I have some data on a self experiment I did in 2012 where we tracked movement of cholesterol ester and triglyceride through all of my lipo proteins including chylomicrons and if it becomes relevant will will certainly go over that I think you'll find it super interesting yeah and I think it's worth stratifying that just for a moment for the audience what you're referring to is if we do a blood test for triglycerides that's inventory of all lipoproteins so we're not actually gathering it on a per lipoprotein Basin this is what you're saying is this test will help or at least what we're trying to elucidate is exactly what it is on total triglycerides the blood test tells us nothing about the triglyceride burden within the lipoprotein directly but we know that that's one of the cargos and as a general rule the more we see the triglyceride go up the more we know we need particles disproportionate to their cholesterol content to traffic them the next two things we look at that are also quote-unquote cargo related is the synthesis of cholesterol it turns out we can measure that quite well and we measure that by using a number of molecules but most commonly a molecule called Dez master all which is the penultimate molecule in one of the cholesterol synthetic pathways so cholesterol synthesis begins as you know with the creation of a molecule from two molecules of acetyl co a and many many steps later I believe it's north of 30 a it's 30 you'll have this pathway where you'll go from des monster all into cholesterol so when we measure the des master all level especially when we measure changes in it absent any other drugs because there are some drugs that can interfere with the conversion of des

[00:23:40] Monastrell to cholesterol but we get a sense of what the synthetic function looks like and so there are some people that are hyper synthesizers there are some people that have normal degrees of synthesis and there are some people that actually synthesize a relatively low amount the third thing we look at are phytosterols so these are plant-based sterols which means we can't make them but by measuring them we get a clever insight into how cholesterol may be recirculated in the body so again I know you know all this stuff day but I think for the listener it's important for them to get a little brush-up on this stuff most of the cholesterol in our body is endogenous meaning we made it and then we recirculate it maybe about 15% is exogenous maybe less it would depend on a number of other factors but the majority of the cholesterol that you eat and every once in a while you see a funny case study and there was one this week about you know guy eats 30 eggs a day and has low cholesterol how is this possible it's sort of an idiotic discussion that

[00:24:38] I can't believe we're still having even Ancel Keys noted this a million years ago dietary cholesterol plays a very trivial role in the circulating cholesterol pool because it has a certified sidechains that can't be absorbed nevertheless you may call this cholesterol we'll talk about in detail I'm sure how its trafficked it comes back to the liver a portion of that is secreted through biliary means and now that biliary cholesterol along with phytosterols are brought in through this niemann-pick see one like one transporter into the NRO site where the lxr gene basically tries to regulate how much of this stuff do you need and if it's doing its job correctly it jettisons out anything excess through this atp-binding cassette g 5 g 8 of course there are people that have deficiencies and all of these things that can lead to hypercholesterolemia and in theory the system should balance itself out people who are very high synthesizers tend to compensate by being low absorbers and vice versa so the long winded soliloquy was for a reason it's not only important to get the lipid and lipoprotein numbers but it also helps to know those three things at baseline one of which you get for free you're going to at least get a benchmark of your triglyceride but to also know your levels of does mas draw which would be your proxy for synthesis your levels of site Austral cohen stan all site of stair all these things are phytosterols meaning we can't make them so the higher they are the more we know we're absorbing sterile the fourth thing that regulates LDL P so again it's triglyceride burden cholesterol synthesis cholesterol reabsorption the fourth thing is LDL clearance now that is not as static as people would like to believe it's probably not even as static as I used to believe I used to believe that it was sort of genetically determined what your LDL clearance would be and obviously there's a great variability there we see it all over but it that that is highly regulated at the level of the liver so even though we can use a drug to demonstrate the variability of it a statin being the most obvious example statins are specifically designed to increase LDL clearance from the liver by decreasing liver synthesis of cholesterol other changes in cholesterol concentration throughout the body probably the burden of reverse cholesterol transport and other things will also impact that clearance and the majority of LDL of course is cleared hepatic li so we don't have an assay for that so this is the one where I always have to say to patients the only way I can really figure out if your LDL P skyrocketed because of defective clearance which would by the way have to be a new onset of defective clearance is if the other three things don't change or if they get better meaning they all I hate to use the term better or worse actually because it's this is really they're neither better nor worse it's they just are what they are right right but if the synthesis goes down the absorption goes down the

[00:27:34] Triggs are largely unchanged and the LDL goes up the LDL P goes up then you know clearance has gone down so most of the time you can't actually measure that unless you get lucky and by measure I mean sort of impute so anyway this is helpful and I suspect this will offer an alternative hypothesis to sort of what we're seeing but anyway I apologize I'm talking more than I should be for what it's worth what you just mentioned I myself have not gone a sterile test

[00:28:01] I haven't actually broken down these but I've been particularly interested in this and for what it's worth I've been looking forward to this because I think I may actually be just the stealth interviewer in the room because I think it's just as possible I may be asking you more questions that you're asking me

[00:28:15] I do want to add one thing to what you were just talking about on a lot of people go on a low-carb diet and they know they're bringing out their total amount of dietary cholesterol who then see a likewise increase in their serum cholesterol the cholesterol in the blood naturally because it's intuitive come to the conclusion that must be because I am a hyper absorber I must be absorbing more cholesterol and I think in the course of this conversation this will help illustrate another reason why that may be the case because you made in fact be trafficking more fat as energy and therefore it may be ride-sharing with cholesterol in these lipoproteins yeah I think that terminology is going to be confusing so when we talk about hyper absorbers we're referring very specifically to this mechanism about the best Niemann pc1 like one transporter in the ATP binding cassette d which is called it's usually referred to as a b c g 5 g 8 but as you said that person who says hey Dave I just went on a low-carb diet and I'm you know I'm eating more eggs and more this and where that and my cholesterol has gone up well the problem with that is it's like wrong on many levels right we should never be talking broadly or vaguely about cholesterol what went up specifically right did LDL cholesterol go up that LDL particle number go up in total cholesterol go up etc but it's quite likely that those two things are not causal meaning the person who's increasing their consumption of dietary or exogenous cholesterol is also usually increasing their consumption of dietary fats absolutely and as we'll talk about later I'm sure one of those subtypes of fats in a subset of susceptible individual seems to set off a hyper synthetic pathway for cholesterol which when we get to it I want to share with you my data set on hyper responders meaning these patients which is what is the pattern of hyper response because not everyone has this experience where they go on a ketogenic diet and their

[00:30:12] LDL skyrockets I didn't have that experience but I have the privilege of getting to see the blood of tens if not hundreds of people over the past few years so I get to see oh sometimes this happens sometimes it doesn't what else is going on here so what year did all this start for you in April of 2015 was where I got my second a1c of 6.1 which is the hemoglobin test which suggests that I'm pre-diabetic and that was where the triglyceride of 80 yes actually that's correct that was the very last time that was that same test so when I saw that I then immediately felt compelled to go and learn everything I could on how to change my blood glucose levels because also I had a fasting glucose if I want to say like 103 and at the doctor's office they said well yes is the second year in the row we'll keep monitoring it and I said well no thanks I'm gonna start trying to figure out what it is I can do to dodge type-2 diabetes because it's rampant on my dad's side of the family and so I started to go to diabetic forms diabetic forms they were talking about this lchf diet which I would then find out as a low-carb high-fat diet I would then look a little bit further I found out about the ketogenic diet and it all sounded very interesting and I remember at that time asking on the forum saying okay now wait a sec how can I be sure my cholesterol won't go up and at the time the common answer was well it only happens for a few people and even then it's complicated but it's really probably not a problem and there wasn't really a very solid answer to but I felt at least confident enough that it was unlikely to happen to me and therefore I would go ahead and take the shot because my cholesterol numbers were generally pretty good I did like hearing that it typically raised HDL and that was the one thing my doctor would occasionally ping me for he'd say like it if your HDL was a little bit higher so after I started both my dad and my sister got enticed to do it as well my dad type 2 diabetic his last day once he was like 8.3 my sister's not diabetic but was hypertensive they both get inspired they end up going on the diet to this day now my dad's in the five 9s something along those lines and my sister's no longer hypertensive when she's staying on the diet fairly well the two of them get their cholesterol test before I do after they started the diet around the same time and both of them I warned them in advance their LDL cholesterol might bump a little and sure enough that is what happened to both of them but it wasn't that concerning I get mine a little bit later about seven and a half months later and mine skyrockets this is like late 2015 correct so November 2015 I believe my total cholesterol was 329 my LDL see was 200 and I want to say 250 I can't remember somewhere around there and that was a very cathartic moment for me at least as far as I'm looking at the lab work I'm going what the heck happened how did I get to this place and for two very miserable weeks I found this guy

[00:33:16] Tiye who happened to already have a lot of data and a lot of a great series I like engulfed or series but I could hardly understand it at the time and I started reading up on Thomas days spring I found Tara doll I started looking at just anybody and everybody who could say anything about lipids and in the course of doing it that's when I started seeing this pattern as I started like tweaking a little bit into a clinical ibadallah G the book and when you say the pattern just to be clear the increase in LDL cholesterol on the presence of a low carbohydrate high fat diet no I actually mean it being a network okay any more about that lipoproteins are a boat this is gonna be one on one but let's kind of do that for the listener for a second there are lipid carrying proteins and so your body makes them and they make them at numbers we can't even imagine they're measured in quintillions which is like a million trillions and it's doing this both in the gut and in the liver and when they make it they're basically packing in lipids that these cells need and in particular they packed just about every kind of lipid not just triglycerides which our body uses for energy but also cholesterol which we're gonna be talking about a lot but also fat soluble vitamins like a D and K and it packs all of these the same container but what's neat about it is this boat in order for it to get to the cells that want to make use of it need to have a complex system in place so that they can kind of special order what it is that they want to take off of these lipoproteins and that's where it gets interesting because the lipoproteins have these kind of snakey bumps on the top of them that are proteins that are the OPO lipoproteins and hopefully we don't have to get too technical for the audience on that but of course I'll appreciate it if we can we're going to have to but yeah we're probably gonna have to but it's those aple lipoproteins that you could relate on a computer side to like metadata to like headers for example as far as where it is that they're going to go and why and what excited me about as I was learning about this I was like I don't know how much of this I'm projecting my own experience as a software developer but this looks like a very complex series of distributed objects that surely if I'm looking at from a payload perspective is primarily energy distribution network it appears as if its primary job more than any other job particularly chylomicrons and vldls are to deliver this fat based energy to tissues that's what they go out with and that's what they come back typically not with coming back to the liver and because almost everything ends up coming back to the liver this looks like it's a central regulator and in that sense this looks I mean in many respects it has many attributes common to what we would call in software as a cloud network something we use a lot and it's very important to be able to do things at scale but particularly with the level of interaction that goes on with the lipoproteins between each other it's not like these boats go out autonomously and never have any interaction beyond just going to dock and dropping off their different cargo they actually constantly connect with each other through things like cholesterol ester transfer protein phospholipid transfer protein and so forth these are different ways in which they in the process of moving through the bloodstream actually have further interactions that move around the total pool that's being used by the entire system and hopefully I didn't get too technical there but you get the sense of it in many ways this has a lot of overlap with techniques that we use right now and how we build networks out of servers so I think we do need to get pretty technical on this because I suspect that you and I will draw different conclusions from the data and in my experience the easiest way to understand where those differences lie is to sort of start to get into some of the things that we would view differently so I'll start with one thing that you said so I like to be I think maybe clear on where I believe the chylomicron the VLDL the idea on the LDL are coming from going and what they're doing now we can't actually know for certain any of these things I've had some very interesting discussions with people about this over the years and I mean I've had one of the most brilliant lipid ologist I've ever spoke to said why do we have LDL to which the answer is it's just God's cruel trick on our species because you know most other species don't have the LDL burden we

[00:37:43] I think a more thoughtful answer though is the overwhelming burden of evidence is that the purpose of LDL is to carry out reverse cholesterol transport you alluded to this already you basically have these three different lineages this is a bit of an oversimplification of lipoproteins you have these chylomicrons which as you said are primarily getting fat from the gut and very rapidly undergoing a process of hydrolyzing themselves and releasing through an April lipoprotein called a possi to all of their triglyceride through interaction with something called lipoprotein lipase so we have this rapid chemical reaction that very quickly gets rid of these incoming dietary and sometimes non dietary because I want to be clear that we can't really distinguish exogenous and endogenous fat in that pool because you're going through that same recirculating process but at the risk of oversimplifying fat comes in the body if you're on a high-fat diet you're eating fat it's coming in the gut the chylomicron which is its own little lineage because it has a different April lipoproteins and has this thing called a

[00:38:46] PO b48 as you know that comes in and then the a possi to interacting with the LPL is what's extracting that oh yeah great Dave just whipped up a great picture so little English all this stuff yeah so Davis you can make a note of this one and that we're making the show notes will link all that stuff okay then you have another path we're not going to talk about much today which is the HDL path totally different these particles last much longer they are primarily responsible for reverse cholesterol transport of which there are two types reverse cholesterol transport means taking cholesterol from the periphery back to the liver that can occur directly which is when the HDL brings cholesterol itself back from another tissue to the liver and the most important place it does this is from the sub endothelial space so if you have oxidized sterols waiting to cause atherosclerosis the HDL can actually go and through another one of those atp-binding cassette sit candy lipid ate the HDL the sterile take it right back to the liver that's direct RCT but there's also indirect RCT which is the

[00:39:51] LDL can bring cholesterol back and give cholesterol to the HDL through C temp as you alluded to and that goes the other way right like you mean HDL actually taking the cholesterol and giving it to the LDL to take back to the liver no the well actually both so LDL gives to HDL to go back to the liver I see yeah through Seto so that's indirect RCT but it's that VLDL to IDL to LDL path that is governed by these a poby like their lineage is described by a PO b100 which differentiates them now one of the things I didn't learn until recently and

[00:40:27] I don't know if this is accounted for in the model because the figure that we're gonna link to is not actually showing that is that about 40% of LDL comes directly from the liver it's de novo created right Tom Dave spring linked me to the study that I had since read on this one really which one this is the

[00:40:45] Frank sax I don't remember and remember the authors they get into the different subspecies of a possi threes and a Bowie and how they counterbalance each other as far as degree of affinity for clearance and so forth yeah that's sort of I mean I didn't say it's unrelated this stuff's all related so I will Park this topic cuz it's super interesting but when these lipoproteins have a PO e on them which is pretty unusual it's about two to five percent if my memory serves me correctly will fact check that it might be different but a very small number of these a PO be 100 s or carrying a Bowie and when they do they actually have much more rapid clearance as in having a Bowie only and not having a beau c3 well that's actually a good question a possi 3 is clearly the worst actor you could have here there's nothing worse than having an a possi 3 sitting on your a poby 100 cell in fact some would argue that may be the single worst thing you could ever have happen because it increases the residence time of them so we're going to come to this I know because you've written about remnants

[00:41:43] I'm going to argue that we have no way of knowing what a remnant is without being able to measure a post c3 because when we look at a VLDL cholesterol and I apologize to the listener I swear we'll get back to our main point here unless we actually know something more than just how much cholesterol is in VLDL we have no way of knowing whether it's an appropriate remnant what we call a physiologic remnant or a pathologic remnant and the pathologic remnants disproportionately carry a possi 3 which increases their residence time and the same is true on LDL I do want to follow up on that point yes yes yes we absolutely will because it's such an important point and to me it's one of the two most interesting clinical assays

[00:42:21] I'd like to see developed I would love to see a clinical assay for a possi 3 & 4 LDL triglyceride concentration which goes back to a point we had a few minutes ago and for anybody listening who's developing this a please reach out to me because for all the self experimentation I do I mean one of the things I didn't mention is that I literally just did my hundredth blood draw last Tuesday I've obviously done enormous amounts of self testing to do this and that's exactly one of the things I want to check is how dynamic or not dynamic the distribution of things like a Bo c3 are based on for example existing illness or the energy distribution of so forth so anyway I realize we're kind of getting in the weeds here that means you should have a low level of c3 because your insulin levels are quite low so c3 tends to move with insulin so this right may be one of the things that explains why someone with type 2 diabetes who is hyperinsulinemic will on a particle for particle basis maybe even have a greater burden of the lipoprotein because the actual residence time of each of their particles both the LDL and LDL is longer than someone with lower insulin so you have this de novo creation of vldls and you have this de novo creation of LDLs and they form this circulating pool but to my knowledge we can't really differentiate those when we look at that snapshot

[00:43:46] I can't tell is that an LDL that came from a VLDL or is that an LDL that came straight from the liver in that form and that was actually one of the questions I had for you was how with a kinetic study can you actually determine if an April be 100 lipoprotein that was secreted by the liver ever has say an a BOS c2 on it

[00:44:08] I think you and I would probably be an agreement that we don't know we don't have any clinical way to measure that right and in that sense I fully concede that I can't be sure even with the energy model that the LDL particles that I'm seeing the LDL P that I can say with any level of real confidence how many of the total proportion of those were truly for energy delivery so I would argue that depends this is where we get into the semantics I would argue none of them are for energy delivery because that's not what LDL does but I think what you mean is how many of them came from vldls that we're trying to deliver energy right originated as vldls for the purpose of doing it if the job of your in the morning let's say that your job is to deliver pizzas right and that's your job and you know what it only takes you about an hour to do and then guess what the rest of the next two to four days you're actually gonna be patrolling the neighborhood you're the neighborhood watch and you're going around you're also you know helping to fix up people's houses or something along those lines somebody who comes into the neighborhood and sees a whole bunch of these cars patrolling they don't know how many of those people actually delivered pizzas before they got started on that part of the shift and that's basically what we're both coming to right we don't actually know how many people left the liver how many vldls well we sort of know I mean we know that if I mean what Frank Sachs paper showed is if you take patients with low triglycerides and I believe he used a cut-off of 130 milligrams per deciliter 38% were de novo secreted by the liver sixty-two percent came from either IDL or VLDL where you had de novo

[00:45:46] I don't think the paper differentiated between which ones went ideal to LDL versus VLDL to ideal to LDL so that's an important point the second thing is the half-life I actually had to go back and look at these kinetics because I did a podcast with Ron Krause as you know I mean I don't remember when we recorded it I think it came out kind of recently but he mentioned that LDL half-life was a day and I was like I always thought it was longer than that the literature says to 240 no actually you go back and look at the kinetics study people are confusing half life with residence time the half-life of an LDL particle is about a day now it can be longer but that's a pathologic state which gets back to this a possi three thing that's interesting yeah you can have a pathologic state where LDLs will hang around longer but if you look at the actual kinetic studies and brown and gold scene did this work and this is part of the work I believe that they want to know about prize for the kinetics of LDL are pretty well understood using very elegant tracers and we'll link to that paper because I actually had to go back and look at it because I was surprised by Ron's answer when he said that the LDL particle half-life is really only a day under non pathologic states so but you're right if

[00:46:54] I look at your LDL particles and I see three thousand animal per liter I do not know with absolute certainty how many of those your liver made directly versus not but again assuming your insulin sensitive assuming you fit Sachs's model a patient that would suggest that you know roughly forty percent of those were just denovo created and then of the remaining sixty some of those were from de novo ideal and some came all the way through the VLDL pathway so with that in mind here's what I would speculate and this is purely hypothetical but I would speculate if you were to grab a whole bunch of people who are and will hopefully get into this model that I'm talking about that I call lean mass hyper responders people are at the far end of the spectrum they are athletic they are thin and they are very very low carb and therefore see very high levels of LDL C and LDL P but they also have very high levels of HDL C and low levels of triglycerides I suspect that they would show a very high rate proportionally a VLDL secretion that there actually are trafficking a lot more for their energy triglycerides in the LDL particles and therefore have succeding LDL particles as to the explanation as to why their LDL CN l-dopa would be higher so let's use this as a moment because I want to get into that in greater detail but let's take that step back and have you maybe just put a little bit more color on what you mean by your lean mass hyper responder phenotype for those people go on a low-carb diet some subset and nobody seems to agree on this because there's really not been a large study done on it some people will say it's 5% some will say it's 30% will like me see that their

[00:48:36] LDL their total cholesterol they will see both of those rise to one side yeah have the people at vr-2 health released any of these data because they would probably have the most rigorous database on this here's a little bit of my qualification here the problem that I have is at least with what we see a cholesterol code calm that the blog that I have we have lots and lots of hyper spotters that send it in there is seeming to be a higher proportionality of people who are lean and/or fit who are seem to be metabolically flexible Verta of course it's pool of participants they had to start I I hope I don't get this wrong but I believe that their BMI is at a much higher level winnings well it's a company obviously that is dealing with patients with type 2 diabetes so yes they're not gonna be disproportionately lean and fit to begin with right you're saying that that basically wouldn't be the ideal pool to observe this phenomenon I would prefer a broader base okay so with that said it's absolutely true they've got some of the most pristine did they also have that data that I would be looking for where they get NMR's for example before the participants start so that was nice too they're gonna have so much great data that comes out of that but getting back to hyper responders per what you were talking about before this was what we call people and this predates me who would go on a low-carb diet would see their LDL cholesterol the LDL particle count climb and then there seem to be a subset and I wrote about this about a year ago last month of people who are on the farthest end of the spectrum actually tend to have the highest levels overall of LDL cholesterol but also have other things in common this pattern is very distinctive they would have say an

[00:50:20] LDL of 200 or higher you mean LDL cholesterol sorry LDL cholesterol of 200 or higher hdl-c cholesterol of 80 or higher and triglycerides of 70 or lower and this is so prominent to the extent to where I even did this kind of recently at another conference I call that another speaker to where I said I'd very interested in your lipid numbers because

[00:50:43] I think you might be a lean mass hyper responder and she said well I hadn't actually taken it in years and we tested it on the spot and it hit all of those points her LDL see was 189 her hdl-c was 80 and her triglycerides were 70 and this seems to so far span across all sorts of for example a bowie types a

[00:51:03] Bowie 3 threes and 2 three's as well as the three fours and four fours and we have not been able to identify any other snip or anything that's clearly associating this type including the P power alpha and P power gamma that's one of the ones I want to follow up on particularly since I heard your podcast with Rhonda and I had a bunch of people on Twitter just send me full body pictures for me to use in this most recent speech I did on lean mass at responders it has to be careful with that you can get into trouble by the way

[00:51:31] I didn't say be sure to respond this tweet where I'm specifying exactly I'd be using them for so anyway generally speaking they tend to be very fit they tend to be very thin and often times and I'm you kind of had a story of your own from before I even got into this they'll say I really don't want to stop I really love this way of life I'm feel better than I ever have in my life and I give the same answer not too far different from yours and then I say okay generally speaking I feel like all of your markers look great low inflammation across the board of course

[00:52:06] I give the standard I'm not a medical doctor and this isn't medical advice etc but all that said it's hard for me to come to the conclusion that you're in trouble unless we can likewise see further markers such as expanding CI&T and CAC and so forth that's going to show that you actually are developing higher rates of atherosclerosis now qualify in advance because I'm sure you'd want to say this as well and I've mentioned this to several people things like atherosclerosis can develop without any sign for a fairly long period of time for example I think it's what 60% before you even see occlusion in the lumina for example well let's back up a little bit so I always want to be careful that when people are talking about C IMT and CA C that we're never using those in the same terms as we would think of biomarkers right so a biomarker what you've described is let's look at your LDL cholesterol or better yet your LDL particle number but remember something a CA C which is a calcium score so it's a DRI CT scan that very quickly scans over the heart and just picks up calcification no anatomic detail or a CI MT which is a type of ultrasound that looks at the intimal thickness so that's one of the walls of the arteries thickness in the carotid arteries in the neck these are both tests that are used to try to gauge advance disease so the real way to think about this is to and I think Ron and I talked about this at length in the podcast is to look at a pathology textbook when you look at the autopsies you'll get a sense of what's going on long before you have luminal narrowing which may or may not accompany a problem you have a very clear documented path of what this disease does so again I think you know this Dave but I think for the listener it is worth repeating this if they don't want to go back and read some of the posts I've written on the progression of atherosclerosis when we're born we have these beautiful arteries the arteries have this endothelial lining so this very thin type of cell that coats the luminal meaning the part that's closest to where the blood is flowing so there are spaces between these and via diffusion lipoproteins get in there and out of there all the time this is relatively well understood to be a gradient phenomenon so the more of the lipoproteins you have the more of them that are gonna go in but as we talked about earlier other things will influence it the residence time for example which might be why this a PO c3 thing is such a pain in the butt because if it allows these cells to stick around longer bad things happen now what most people don't know I think is that an LDL particle is more likely to come back out when it goes in there than it is to stay in there that's good news HDL particles always come out of there there are other types of particles LP little-a and pathologic VLDL remnants can do the same thing as well the problem occurs when proteoglycans bind to and let's just make math easy and not get into the LP little A's and the VL deals at the moment let's just talk about the LDL since that's the largest burden of this but when these proteoglycans bind to the

[00:55:06] LDL and it gets retained all of a sudden now you have something that's where it's not supposed to be that's not where we want that thing it's obviously in a high oxygen environment so it's going to undergo a chemical reaction called oxidation because it's carrying a cargo a sterile that and by the way they can be carrying phytosterols and other things like that but these things have ample opportunity to undergo an oxidative reaction it's that oxidative reaction that then kicks off an inflammatory response in the endothelium now the good news is today we at least have one laboratory test that can measure that burden of oxidation it's called the ox

[00:55:43] LDL assay now this has been around for a while but clinically we've only been using it for a couple of years because it turns out some very small percentage of those LDLs once they are oxidized escaped back into the circulation so by sampling those we can track indirectly hey what's the likelihood that oxidative damage is happening so for me this is one of the most important metrics I look at because I want to spend some time later on going over some clinical cases

[00:56:11] I want to see some of the data on yours I want to show you some of the data that will explain maybe how I'm thinking about this but this oxidized LDL which is well documented and described in different quintiles right is giving you a small sample of what's going on but for the listener it's important to understand that when you get a blood test that's not telling you what's happening in your artery right it's giving you probabilities of things that are largely stochastically governed that are going on in your artery and the ox

[00:56:42] LDL is no exception even though it's a beautiful marker it's still dependent on the idea that a subset of those oxidized sterols are now escaping can I actually ask a little more on that one so we already know that LDL particles specifically able be 100 at the LDL stage have a alpha tocopherol I think is how I'm saying basically it's vitamin E right as part of the antioxidant defense system part of the purpose of an LDL particle is to actually provide that as a means to battle reactive oxygen species right I don't know about that and if it were solely true it would make me wonder why people with LDL deficiencies wouldn't have deficiencies of those processes as well whereas to the best of our knowledge they don't because I've actually been waiting to get into this a lot more recently and correct me if I'm

[00:57:34] Rhonda basically there's a certain degree with which you've got vitamin E on board on top of that you've got the potential of the phospholipid shell to become oxidized if you get oxidized phospholipids that also can bring it the role of LP little a that can cleave off the oxidized phospholipids that's ultimately what LP PLA 2 is right caress the enzyme that's ultimately involved you're helping to and this is also I don't know how much of this is actually demonstrated but as ultimately where a lot of the concept behind why it is you would have a higher detection of small lipoproteins particularly small LDLs can come around to is if you're getting them constantly oxidized and having to constantly cleave them down to much smaller amounts and then they constantly remodel yeah but we're getting off into two different things here so let's come back to this it's not clear to me that that there's sufficient evidence to suggest that part of the role of LDL is to combat the oxidative stress okay let's put that as homework that will catch up on this but this is relevant for whether or not we're detecting oxidized LDL s that had never entered the intima right know the oxidized LDL is that we're detecting have escaped the intima interest is a very small subset that are getting out okay that's definitely something I would like to follow up because I'm genuinely curious about yourself as to whether or not they can be oxidized sufficiently that they'd get picked because it also may be something that as part of the test or isn't a part of the test but I'd be curious as to how we can actually determine that yeah meaning what you're basically asking is how do we know they weren't oxidized never inside the sub endothelial space and that's a fair question I don't know the answer I know very little about this assay I mean I know the technical stuff of how the assay works like it's an

[00:59:14] Eliza I say I know what enzymes it's looking at but the broader question is without a trace or do we know if that LDL has actually been in the sub and if they go space where it was bound oxidized and then escaped or liberated so fair question it's certainly relevant to this larger question of the value of

[00:59:33] LDL particles as to whether they play an important part of the immunological role well they do probably nowhere near as important as the HDL particle which is probably why the HDL particle has such a long residence time and the HDL particle as important as it is for reverse cholesterol transport both direct where it's taking the lipid back to the liver directly or indirectly talked about and you corrected me thank you where it takes it the LDL and the LDL takes it back to the liver certainly some have argued that an even more important property of the HDL is the proteins that it carries the immunoglobulins all of the other things that it carries that play this important role in in immune function so it really seems that the overwhelming body of evidence is that the purpose of the LDL particle is to carry the cholesterol back to the liver interesting but a this gets back to the multi-purpose value of a vehicle is it doing things other than that that also turned out to be relevant and I think this kind of gets to the larger and more important question overall like the question that I started with going back to my November 2015 days was I thought very naively that in a few days I would learn all I would need to about cholesterol in lipoproteins find the landmark study that had a gajillion people and they would just show that if you had lower LDL cholesterol you just died less like that was it end of story and at first I thought that I had found that because I had found plenty that pointed to events and pointed to lower cardiovascular risk but then wouldn't necessarily talk as much about all cause mortality I didn't had to learn about cause mortality and then more and more I felt like I couldn't get to something that really emphasized I thought for sure at least I would see for example an elderly population generally speaking to lower your natural LDL we can get into snips for example on this the more likely it is that you would just live longer period but you have to remember how these studies are powered so the challenge with a cm is I don't think any study in the history of civilization is going to be powered to detect that it's hard enough to detect cardiac mortality in a study I think we need to be more clear and what our concern is if the concern is if you are less likely to die of heart disease you are more likely to die of something else then we should state that explicitly and say hey low

[01:01:54] LDL while maybe protective of cardiovascular disease I will argue that is unambiguously clear and we can discuss that but the bigger question is are you concerned that well it's increasing the risk of cancer or neurodegenerative disease a trade-off yes so the question there is that's a question of power and so it's not uncommon in cardio ask Euler studies to see a reduction in coronary mortality with no change in all cause mortality or a non statistical change you know most of the time you just don't see a change or it's a change that's very slight and then you have to ask yourself the question even if it looks you know like hey death went up or down of other causes you have to go back and ask yourself was the study actually able to detect that that's a very hard thing to detect absolutely in fact there's even a paper that I pointed to recently that says is this even worth chasing after because it takes so much expense in time in order to get to a level which it would be powered to detect for all cause mortality should we even make that part of the criteria that's required well there's a broader issue here which is the lifetime exposure problem exactly and this is of course just the problem with atherosclerosis in general is you do a drug study that's two three years but atherosclerosis doesn't take two to three years from zero yeah I try to not get into any Wars on Twitter but once in a while I'm just I don't know I've had one too few topo chicos and I'll let it rip but if I have to see one more person try to tell me why Fourier and Odyssey aren't interesting trials because they didn't show a big enough benefit I might scream so just for the listener Fourier and Odyssey were trials that looked at two pcsk9 inhibitors I want to also be clear before I get into my rant I am never having an economic discussion about this I'm saying that because people often confuse efficacy and effectiveness and cost and value and benefit and I am NOT for a moment suggesting those things don't matter I am NOT going to argue one way or the other that the cost of a pcsk9 inhibitor is worth it that's an individual decision unfortunately that decision is for most people made by their insurance company and that's totally reasonable

[01:03:59] I'm only interested in this as a conceptual tool which is does inhibiting pcsk9 make a difference and if you had told me I remembered knowing this that Fourier and Odyssey had such short time horizons I thought there is no way they'd find a benefit in particular for EA so Fourier took patients with an average LDL cholesterol of something like ninety or ninety to mmm as per decilitre these patients were already on the maximum tolerated dose of a statin okay so they're at the tenth percentile in terms of their LDL C and in two point two years showed a reduction in events the null hypothesis should be it should have never worked you should have needed 20 years to show any benefit when you understand Alan

[01:04:50] Snyder mins lifetime exposure model so a lot of people are critical and say it didn't show a mortality benefit it just reduced revascularize and events in 2.2 years to which I say you're looking at that incorrectly the fact that it showed anything to your point Dave lifetime exposure is staggering also on patients who are already maximally statin eyes so coming back to this thing about lifetime exposure this is where the Mendelian randomization becomes a very important tool in understanding LDLs causality what you alluded to at the outset you are correct in noting is deficient there is no lifetime study where without a drug you can prospectively manipulate

[01:05:35] LDL and follow people for a hundred years and determine outcomes that would be the ideal so yeah that would that would be okay you actually you talked about this in the street dope I know I remember someone going on that's what the magic one right just yeah and I think it's worth plugging in something important here you've already said this on a prior podcast and I don't want to miss understand that you don't necessarily buy into the zero LDL hypothesis you don't know that you would have LDL at zero so you do believe there's some kind of trade-off and you mentioned a few for example commonly known diseases for when your LDL actually gets to such a low level like cognitive disease the way I would say it is this so I'm glad you brought this up because it is a very important distinction I absolutely believe that the lower the LDL the lower the risk of cardiovascular disease all other things equal why because LDL is necessary but not sufficient for atherosclerosis and I say that full stop now it's important to understand what necessary but not sufficient means because there's gonna be some people listening to this who are getting all phosphorylated now and they're just getting super pissed off and my advice is sit down shut up for a minute and pay attention extra points for the phosphorylated insert by the way that's fresh lipid files yeah yeah so necessary but not sufficient is the relationship between oxygen and fire oxygen is necessary but not sufficient for fire can you have oxygen and not fire yes can you have fire without oxygen no the lower the concentration of oxygen the less likely you are to spontaneously get a fire so and again that's a bit of an oversimplification because there are so many other factors endothelial health and oxidation and inflammation of course are so important here but the problem I have with the zero LDL model which again

[01:07:25] I think I don't want to speak for people who but I think what people are basically saying is there's a subset of people in the medical community who are saying we should just be driving LDL to zero because you know that's the best thing well my view is as you said no that's not necessarily the best thing that might be the best thing for the heart in other words it might be the best thing to lower the risk of atherosclerosis but it's irrelevant because it might come at other costs and so it depends on your point of view I do from time to time get into arguments with other physicians who take care of my patients as well because I'm not a primary care physician so I have to share my responsibility with other physicians and about twice or three times a year I do have to sort of go to war with one of these Doc's and it's usually over one extreme or the other and the most recent example of this was a patient of mine who came to me on 80 milligrams of lipitor which is the maximum dose of lipitor he had a very high calcium score and a very bad

[01:08:21] CTA but he had not had an event that we knew of but for all intents and purposes this is a secondary prevention patient meaning we define secondary as has he had an event or not well he has had an event his event is look at his coronary arteries right but nevertheless he came on 80 milligrams of lipitor and his you know his LDL cholesterol was very low but his particle number was not quite at goal the goal for a patient like that would be tenth percentile or lower given how you're aggressively you're managing he also had a slight elevation of LP little-a so I added zetia which because he had very high levels of absorption not uncommon given how much his cholesterol synthesis was being hit and that brought him into goal so now he was totally at goal his cardiologist was happy I was marginally happy but what I didn't like was his des Master all level was now unmeasurable now it turned out it was unmeasurable before but I was so fixated on just trying to get him in the right zone but now we had some breathing room and I said you know now that I'm thinking about it oh and by the way in the interim Rafa and prowlin had been approved these are pcsk9 inhibitors and I thought this guy has no measurable cholesterol in terms of synthetic function so it's very very low now a lot of people are right now going oh haha that's the problem with those statins they inhibit cholesterol synthesis well careful that's true but every cell makes more than enough cholesterol for its own use with maybe a couple of exceptions gonadal tissues steroidal tissues during periods of high stress need to borrow cholesterol from other tissues but for the most part every cell can sufficiently produce its own cholesterol

[01:09:57] I think you're right on the most part I'm not sure if I am convinced that every I mean your body's running a buffet that's the blood stream the blood stream is this buffet of things that the body anticipates it wants to make available on demand to cells and I believe I mean again this is kind of just the engineering approach I'm but we don't know that's true that's a hypothesis with respect to the lipoproteins at least absolutely true hypothesis but it's not been proven to the other side as well right we can see that the synthesis can happen within most cells to be able to make their own cholesterol do we have even in vitro studies where we can actually observe that every amount of cholesterol that they would need would ultimately be synthesized even under periods of stress like for example muscle repair and growth well we have natural experiments right we can look at the a beta hyperlipoproteinemia patients who can't traffic cholesterol therefore they would be entirely dependent on their own cellular and dajin as production and they seem completely fine so that's not proof but we don't have proof to your point but it's certainly evidence to suggest I think we also know when that's off right so like one of the first things we used to see in the ICU though at the time didn't pay any attention to it was anytime a patient came in and they were septic or under great stress so they had what's called systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs so you could be in a car accident you were shot you have a you know a horrible infection their HDL cholesterol would transiently take a huge bump and I didn't think anything but at the time other than it was neat it's like wow 2 X bump in HDL cholesterol overnight I think I you now look back and interpret those data as huge reverse cholesterol transport now the HDL is going out of its way to deliver cholesterol to probably the adrenal glands first and foremost because the enormous uptick of glucocorticoid even epinephrine or epinephrine are needed so clearly there are examples of when this is not an homeostatic balance so so I'll take your point that because the a beta lipoprotein emia patients in theory should be the ones who are out living us all right they can take out the whole component of heart disease of a thorough

[01:12:04] Scrat ik plaque everything they should have massive longevity relatively speaking to everybody else so there's all about 12 genes that are well enough studied we have enough patients that we think we know something and the most important of the longevity genes and cardiac is the hypo functioning a possi 3 s and that actually shows a net a net longevity benefit so work out of Albert

[01:12:30] Einstein has identified these you know roughly a dozen genes and the hypo functioning a possi threes I mean most of those genes are like GH are IGF apoE would be one right so a po e two would carry with it protective benefits in terms of longevity both cardiac but more that is neurodegenerative but it's those

[01:12:51] C threes in fact as we have kind of a lude to a couple of times I believe there's a nice n saw like a nucleotide in clinical trials now trying to impair a post C 3 so now let's becoming a therapeutic target Dayspring alluded to that one yeah and again this is one of those drugs that might not have much of a benefit in an insulin sensitive person they may have already captured that benefit by lowering insulin levels well and that's actually part of what this kind of energy model and particularly that with hyper responders specifically lean mass high responders comes back to

[01:13:19] I know you don't necessarily hang out on Twitter too much but you know that I have had like more than I would like I have this pin to tweet I've been pinging lots of lipid-lowering experts on this I've said look I'm looking for any studies that show people with high LDL will have high cardiovascular disease if they likewise have high HDL and low triglycerides but there's one qualification it can't be a gene or drug study that's to qualify so it's fair enough to qualification but I've seen that here's my concern with that Dave I have no doubt in my mind that you are a truth seeker I don't think that's true of necessarily some of your peers I do think a number of your peers are deluded and so filled with their own confirmation bias and so unwilling to acknowledge that their precious low carbohydrate diets could be hurting them that not with malicious intent but with blind carelessness they are absolutely ambivalent to anything I don't put you in that category so I will challenge you in the following way great when you say show me an example of something that is not a genetic study that can point to that phenotype the reason I would call issue with that is why would you limit yourself from genetic studies it's sort of like me saying show me like I want to know if there are people who are 6 feet tall I think they might be but I've never seen one so if you can go into a kindergarten class and find me one I'll believe it but you must limit yourself to the kindergarten class I mean that's an obscure example what I'm basically saying is you were excluding so much potential data by excluding all of the genetics because when people talk about genetic studies we have to remember something most of the genes most of the snips that lead to alterations in lipids and lipid metabolism are completely unidentified I mean F H for example familial hypercholesterolemia which would be the most obvious example to counter that point you're excluding because it's a genetic condition but what the listener might not know is that

[01:15:20] FH is a phenotypic diagnosis not a genotypic diagnosis FH is arguably the most heterogeneous collection of genes you can imagine so why would we exclude looking at those people when that's in many ways one of the richest bodies of evidence for a natural experiment in to answer the question can you have high LDL C high HDL C low triglyceride and still get atherosclerosis that's what the question you're asking yes yes well so so we'll double back to that I said but basically we're taking us back to genes and this is why I like this is another hypothesis fully untested I'm in the process of trying to collect on it but I

[01:15:58] I call this loosely lipid cellular lipid malabsorption or I just generally shorten it to lipid malabsorption basically here's here's the issue that I have with the existing Mendelian randomization for that matter almost all of the gene based studies is what we're trying to get is as much as we can the isolation of just a higher gradient of

[01:16:17] LDL particle count right and that's what we all secretly we want your wand when you're talking about where we can waive it and then there's just magically more LDL particles in some people or for that matter less LDL particles right without touching any other parts of the process the problem is that I believe of I'm keeping a list of my own s in peas of those genes that are either resulting in higher or lower LDL C and unfortunately of the ones that I find in the Mendelian randomization 's they don't just result in the higher LDL cnl the LP they also come to be that way because there's a lack of lipids or liberal protein uptake by the cells therefore particularly with endothelial cells you've got to be concerned that that could cause dysfunction and therefore could be a reason for why you would have higher levels of atherosclerosis and this is why like I'm blurring sort explain that part of them the last part endothelial cells being dysfunctional you know would that be potentially problematic for atherosclerosis yes okay then why would we want to look at any snip that would in any way impair inhibit them relative to a normal person's endothelial cell why do we believe patients or a subset of patients with FH as a result of their

[01:17:34] FH have defective endothelial cells well if you've got detective LDL receptors there's no receptors on the endothelial cell its diffusion mediated yes but you've got the receptors with the adipocytes right yes but at least 20 if not 40 cent of LDL uptake is not even receptor bound in the body okay but what about that not all cases of fh have receptor deficiencies so there are at least 2,000 vaguely identified genetic causes of familial hypercholesterolemia they have fewer receptors so the PCs canines are a subset of FH right about three to five percent of patients with FH have over expression over expression a pcsk9 gotcha like that's how pcsk9 was first discovered okay but in that case you're impacting a cell's capability of uptake for lipids or flipper proteins right yes you are in that situation those patients livers will take up less LDL because they pcsk9 is a protein that does among other things degrades the LDL receptors because they have hyper functioning pcsk9 they are more rapidly degrading their LDL receptors on the livers so they're taking up less LDL particles which explains why they have higher LDL but this again introduces a dysfunction on the lipid metabolism to do with the endothelium that has nothing to do where a through sclerosis occurs all that's doing is giving you more LDL in circulation let me put it this way why not take anything that results in a higher level of LDL crl dop that doesn't impact any lipid absorption from any tissue at all right but that might be a bit of an artificial constraint right I mean as you pointed out yourself and I think anybody listening this will appreciate this is a complicated dynamic system so it is going to be difficult to have some perturbation in a system that will lower or raise LDL that won't have some other effect the question is how do we with some reasonable degree of certainty look at those other effects and ask whether or not they're germane to the question of atherosclerosis and the causality of LDL to atherosclerosis so I think the pcsk9 example is not an unreasonable one because we have a pretty clear understanding of what that gene does we have a very clear understanding of where that protein lives and what it's doing but if anything that's resulting in the other direction where if you have lower LDL crl DOP from under expression you know a pcsk9 that actually results in a hyper absorption of lipids for example in the yeah they have enhanced hepatic clearance so both ends of that though right so if you have if you have hyper functioning and hypo function and pcsk9 patients out there both of whom exist I believe the hyper functionings were discovered first but the hype Oh functionings are kind of the ones that gave the drug companies the desire to go in or another desire the I guess the idea to go and create a drug to mimic that phenotype but these patients walk around with LDL cholesterol of 10 to 20 milligrams per deciliter and as far as anybody can tell there's no other side effect of that well and this is the thing I want to zero in on is let's say that we do that let's say that we go okay nevermind this side part of the lipid hypothesis ended or I'm sorry the lipid metabolism end of it we should then be able to look back at these people with the more novel versions of snps and assuming that there's at least a large enough population we should see that longevity you're mentioning of the a plus III from earlier is the first that I've been able to find at that one

[01:20:57] I'm interested to see if we would see that across the board with these people have these snps yeah i mean i suspect it will have to do with how many of them there are and how long they're being tracked i sympathize with your concern is it's absolutely the case in nutrition nutrition medicine there's certainly a lot of personalities that are out there but i can understand at least for me on on my end I like hard endpoints over soft endpoints maybe it's just the engineering me I like ones and zeroes death is pretty easy to diagnose whereas soft endpoints the downside is there can be arbitrary decision making on the part of the patient and the doctor is - yeah

[01:21:33] I you know I heard you mentioned that on one of the podcasts I got to tell you I disagree with that having seen more patients in an ER when I was in residency with M eyes I can honestly tell you Dave never once knew what their cholesterol levels were when someone comes in the ER with chest pain I care about the advanced cardiac life support algorithm which involves oxygen which involves an EKG which involves troponin which involves morphine aspirin and potentially a trip to the cath lab but we are in no where in that algorithm are we asking what's their LDL and letting that help us think is this indigestion versus other things so I I do take issue with calling mi a soft outcome it's not so much whether it's a soft outcome it whether or not there are things like say revascularisation x' that can be determined based on a decision on the part of the doctor and the patient that may or may not have to do with their knowledge of the lipids right agree I mean these are all different things but

[01:22:28] I also think we should be careful not to take mortality as the only outcome I will say this and I hate putting on the stupid doctor had cuz it sounds ridiculous in this context but unfortunately I feel like I have to go back into and out of that world here I would say at least half the patients that come to me do not actually find themselves asking for an extension and lifespan my interest is longevity but longevity has two components how do you increase lifespan meaning how do you delay death and how do you improve health span I won't go into what that means but the bottom line is there are many people who say I honestly have no interest in living one day longer than I might otherwise live but I want that quality to be much higher so if we're going to say and again I don't necessarily agree with that I think the bigger issue is a statistical one with all-cause mortality but nevertheless but you're going to modality like if somebody has an MI and it actually impacts the quality of life afterwards yeah right what if your quality of life is decreasing as a result of a procedure necessary or otherwise or an MI or a decrease in ejection fraction because remember about half the people who first present with a thorough scrutiny disease present with sudden death but half the people don't right half the people go through mi stroke God knows what else that follows so again I see it as my chief responsibility to delay the onset of death if a patient decides that that comes at too great a cost that's great that's their decision in the end the patients decide everything but going back to what got us here I am convinced that if patients didn't have LDL there would be little to no atherosclerosis if you could give them no LDL over the duration of their life if a patient comes to you and they've already got disease and you lower LDL I don't think that that gets them out of the woods I think that that's sort of just stochastically moving them in the right direction what we have to be careful of and kind of going back to that patient I was talking about is we have to I be able to identify the patients in whom the risk of LDL lowering is starting to cause a problem elsewhere the meaning therein unacceptable risk elsewhere and in the case of this particular patient whose des master all levels had now become unmeasurable my concern was we have overdone it with him on the lipid side there's a safer easier way we can lower his LDL without impairing his cholesterol synthesis because of the limited but to me quite convincing data on the plausibility of Alzheimer's disease in patients with overly suppressed cholesterol synthesis I want to be really clear when I repeat that I am NOT suggesting that statins cause

[01:24:59] Alzheimer's disease which I know the blogosphere loves to talk about if anything statins slightly increase the risk of diabetes and susceptible people over a great period of time but at the population level there's actually no evidence that statins are causing Alzheimer's disease however I think there are a subset of patients who are susceptible and you have to be able to identify those patients and that's the problem with population data as you know is you can lose the nuance the nuance is you write what matters to you Dave in the end I don't really care what your

[01:25:28] LDL is I care about you not getting arthrosclerosis right and if there is indeed someone walking around out there with an LDL cholesterol of 300 who's not getting atherosclerosis and there are indeed examples of that then that's great news but we have to sort of use this heterogeneous population-based data to then try to probabilistically figure out what do you want to do with somebody new level so with this patient in the end after a lot of fighting the decision was we're gonna put him on repatha or we're gonna start cutting down the lipitor until we get that des master all to bump and so we're still in the process of doing that actually so that to me is like kind of a an example of what I would think of as hopefully where precision medicine would be going which is you're now well outside of a clinical trial right there's never gonna be a clinical trial that's going to ask the question if you take a bunch of patients and statin i's them at nauseam and you drive the cholesterol synthesis very low and follow them for thirty years do a subset of those people get it no I mean you have to be able to look at retrospective data where those things were gathered and will link to what I consider one of the best papers on this topic but getting back to the challenge in a sense you're saying by ignoring the genetic data that the genetic data basically answers the question to your satisfaction to where you don't need to look you know not Jim

[01:26:46] I think of it as the genetic data coupled with the pharmacologic data coupled with the mechanistic data give me a high enough degree of certainty that I am willing to act in a certain direction remember everybody me you whoever's listening to this they have to make a decision sure in decision is a decision so when you showed up with the hemoglobin a1c of 6.1 did you have type 2 diabetes nope your doctor said hey I'm cool just waiting that you said no indecision is not a decision anymore I'm going to do something about it because presumably you said look I have a family history of this I think I have a sense of what the progression of it is and quite frankly I don't want to wait until I have this disease to do something about it so you decided indecision was not a viable decision sometimes indecision is a reasonable decision but the point is people have to understand they are making a decision whatever they decide to do absolutely well and for what it's worth as I say outside of here and as

[01:27:41] I'll say on this podcast as I actually just said at the speech I know if you saw the one I did for him last month I told people I prefer they not be echo-chamber I prefer they find everything that challenges from every side so with that said going back to the lean mass hyper responder you would say given what you know right now given everything we've just talked about that they are at high risk of cardiovascular disease would that be correct I'd want to know more data but yes if I didn't know anything else other than let's say already vascular risk markers save LDL of 200 or higher l-dopa of typically 2,000 or higher hmm everything else is just pristine perfect like CRPS and at the floor there there LP PLA maybe let's look at this patient here so we're gonna we'll link to these labs I asked this patient this is a patient I saw last week so that's the only reason I printed this up because I see this so often but

[01:28:31] I'm like let's just get the last one so this is a gentleman who's been on a low-carb diet for a couple of years is achieving amazing success with it he's a new patient to me but he's been around the block on this stuff before and he's got an amazing history of his labs going back many years so I've seen what he looks like on and off all of these therapies on and off drugs etc but he's one of these guys where across the board looks fantastic right is glucose disposal is remarkable his insulin levels are very low his c-reactive protein is 0.3 so everything looks good so read off some of his numbers just for the folks Dave does he he doesn't quite meet your lean mass because his Triggs might be a bit higher but talking to those guys numbers so total cholesterol has 504 hi this is I I know what you're doing there no I get this all the time where somebody sends me just that number anyway total cholesterol 504 ldlc direct and it's worth emphasizing just real quick for the listener when they say direct it's very important to notice that because usually ldl-c on a typical lab is actually calculated through the Freid world equation so it's direct that actually is a direct measurement and that matters for remnant hope we'll get a chance to talk we will talk remnants for sure so ldl-c at 362 hdl-c at 94 triglycerides at 125 the very first question I would ask if somebody was sending this to me is whether it was faster or not yeah this was but I've gone back and looked at all of his other

[01:30:02] Triggs and he actually normally does reside below about 70 oh he does okay so he would be typical for a layman yeah he might have just eaten dinner a little too late or something you know I'm not I'm not sure what was going on do you mean keep going on that particles yeah so April B is 283 that actually is a little higher than I'm used to seeing

[01:30:18] LDL P is above 3500 small LDL P is at 1483 small dense LDL C is at 47 all right we'll stop there and come back to it so I've told you that everything else on this guy looks pretty good is this guy at risk I'm actually looking ahead because I would have cared about these other markers that could indicate inflammation so for example the fiber genna's is very high LP PLA 2 is above 600 I don't know in fact I think I actually just tweeted about this recently I don't know that I've seen an

[01:30:47] LP PLA 2 above 300 or 400 I think of the labs that have been sent to me and I don't get a chance to interpret oxidized LDL but you have the LDL as above 135 so I would say by this lab as it looks I would be concerned about the triglycerides I would ideally want the triglycerides to go down but is it your impression that if his trick were normal he would be okay I would be interested to see if the other inflammatory markers linked back to the reason as to why the tricks would be a bit higher that would be something I would be very curious about but yes if you were to say I think where you're trying to drive to is if I had only the information of the lipid panel itself and it did say not 125 and the triglycerides make it easier let's pretend that this patient had a zero calcium score both zero calcium score

[01:31:34] I'm not entirely on calcium score but I do care about the score the thing is is I would say if you were to give me the same numbers let me make this easier I've Craig Moffitt's who's very close to this except that his triglycerides are much lower mm-hmm if it was the same one then I would I would wonder if there really was a risk yeah okay so again that is a decision that every patients going to have to make in that situation in the case of this patient I feel very strongly that he is at increased risk though I think on many other metrics I think his risk of cancer he's actually an APO e23 this patient so his risk of dementia is gonna be a bit lower he's metabolically quite flexible but if as other inflammation markers were low like the LP PLA the ox LDL all this stuff that was below would you feel he was at risk if the only thing that was different well I would still feel he is at risk because again this is one of the three legs of the stool right it's the burden of lipoprotein it's the endothelial function or health and it's the inflammatory response to it and I can't measure number two very well right and even number three is pretty kludgy meaning all of these things like fibrinogen and CRP are not very specific so you have to sort of at the individual level be very careful you don't draw too much of a false sense of confidence but look looking at him he has among the lowest asymmetric and symmetric dimethyl arginine levels i've ever seen these are staggeringly low I would have expected those to be through the roof so

[01:33:06] ADM a and s dma are things that we use to look at endothelial health they inhibit nitric oxide synthase so when a DM a and SEMA are elevated you're inhibiting nitric oxide synthase synthase you have less nitric oxide produced in the endothelium you're more prone obviously to constriction I'm never taking that test I'd be interested in trying again just because

[01:33:26] I'm cheap and I didn't want to print up a bunch of paper I only printed two pages of this guy's labs because those are the two that are most relevant but you can take my word for it the others were exceptional right like this is a guy who looked really good across the board the question is should anything be done now if this patient had a negative calcium score which he did not but if he did I would have still recommended lipid-lowering therapy and/or modification of diet why modification of diet because I've now seen more of these patients than I can count and there is a pattern that is emerging I think I wrote about this in one of the cholesterol things but the pattern that always occurs in these folks and I say always with a relatively small end maybe there's thirty of these cases I've seen is this exact pattern this one he's like a perfect example of so his des master all is very high remember what we talked about at the outs yes when defin when a patient's LDL particle number is through the roof you go through the checklist are their triglycerides high no there's no way in hell a trig of 120 accounts for someone being above the 99.9% of LDL particle does he have an LDL receptor defect it turns out I don't think so because I've seen his even I haven't seen his LDL P

[01:34:42] I've seen his LDL see off a ketogenic diet and it was 125 right is he lean and or fit yes okay yeah so his cholesterol synthesis is through the roof and his cholesterol absorption is quite high as well are these affordable tests because I would definitely want to turn these around to the existing group lean mass

[01:35:01] I'm sure I'm sure it's yeah I'm sure the cash cost on these is not onerous but my point is I think that the explanation for this phenotype is the upregulation cholesterol synthesis from the saturated fat I don't think this is an energy issue per se I think this is a sterile regulated binding protein issue or some sort of regulatory path around what the body is doing with ketones and/or saturated fat

[01:35:28] Tom Dayspring told me this a long time ago and I totally forgot about it and then the other day I went and looked up a case because I never paid attention to this we used to see patients all the time with diabetic ketoacidosis so these are usually patients with type 1 diabetes that come in the ER and usually it's precipitated by some acute illness but basically what happens is their glucose level becomes very high they don't have enough insulin of course they get a bunch of electrolyte abnormalities but they present with very high levels of ketones this actually is an emergency so all the talk about ketosis being dangerous this is the example of where it is very dangerous it's life-threatening so what I didn't realize is I went back and looked it turns out a lot of these people have very elevated levels of LDL cholesterol total cholesterol now they also have elevated levels of triglyceride but of course it's hard to know exactly what's driving that but once you correct this metabolic deficit which is quite easy to correct it's basically potassium IV fluids glucose and insulin and you normalize their glucose levels and their fluid balance and their electrolytes the cholesterol returns to normal so it might be that the ketones themselves are a substrate to make more cholesterol and again we'll link to a great paper that

[01:36:42] Tom wrote on Lippa holux several years ago where he goes through the biochemistry of how saturated fats specifically and ketones could in a susceptible individual produce this phenotype and so bringing it back to this idea of genes we might really be dealing with a subset of people these hyper responders whoever whatever percentage of the population they are who are the people that are susceptible to this because you were not going to find a leaner person exercising harder than I was when I went on a ketogenic diet but I never had this response but there is a distinction that I tend to find in this is Occam's razor again more theory and I'm actually going to be testing this myself in the next series of experiments that I'm doing there is a difference between those people who are doing things like say endurance running and weight lifting or resistance training and that I think that there is a greater overall gradient of receptor mediated endocytosis from muscle repair and growth now I could be wrong about that but I'll be very curious to see if that turns out to be the case when I'm doing it myself sorry a greater amount of endocytosis of which lipo and for all the otic of l-dopa in particular into muscles yeah for what product for apparent growth so you're saying that in these people they're relying on their LDL for cholesterol delivery to the muscle well and phospholipids and just about anything else that would be inside a manolio particle there's existing studies there out there as far as like those people who do like a lot of weight training will also see lower LDL see you know and this is why it's saying it's completely theoretical I'll actually be testing this myself over the next few weeks because I'm actually gonna be eating to a very fixed diet fixed sleep schedule a fixed everything and then actually be introducing basically any way in which I can get my muscles sore in a very fixed fashion that I can then turn around as data and if the hypothesis is true I would expect that my ldl-c and my LDL P might change but I'm confused why is the runner's muscle more demanding than the weightlifters muscle or vice-versa the way around that I doubt I would see the weightlifter actually seeing a difference because I think there's more use of the product ability LP directly by the cells I may be wrong about that but what's the evidence that that's happening the evidence as far as the keto gains groups I'm sure you've heard of them no there's a ketogenic group that's keto gains there's not as many lean mass hype responders that come out of that group they'll tend to see the rel DLC go up but not as pronounced as those people who are like say runner types or aerobic types or even people were doing yoga there seems to be actually add more pronounced difference of higher ldlc depending on how much you're doing resistance training or anaerobic training I'm not aware of any evidence to suggest that the muscle is relying on

[01:39:24] LDL for delivery of anything including energy well and I'm not so sure about it on energy what I'm thinking about is in terms of just raw material as far as damage that can happen to for example the membrane of a cell and I realize this is kind of a key difference between us and that your your sense is that effectively anything that the soul is gonna need it can basically synthesize on its own right no I think my sense is that Occam's razor would at least help me start from a place of plausibility and I'm not what's not aware of any data that suggests that well DL is functioning to do this what's the value of non hepatic receptor mediated endocytosis from your perspective so you're talking about very specifically a little bit of LDL that gets out of circulation either with or without a receptor to non hepatic tissue yes yeah my sense is the most important value of that would be two tissues that need more cholesterol to synthesize hormones but specifically cholesterol and not like the phospholipids or anything else that's you know I think the phospholipids probably may be more delivered through others I mean certainly the VLDL delivers far more phospholipid than LDL but LDL is really a custom-built package for cholesterol like if you look at how many cholesterol molecules fit inside an

[01:40:42] LDL particle versus even an HDL particles DL is the general of our CT and yet it can still only carry about 50 molecules of cholesterol the LDL particle can carry 1,500 molecules of cholesterol that's staggering when you again consider the size of these things right like it's tailor-made for that and that is largely conserved I don't to get us too far in the weeds but I did actually did a very interesting kinetic experiment many years ago so I did three blood tests every day for three days like the full NMR panel but this is with kinetics so this is not commercially available so what you're looking at is my ability to track and you'll have to lay it down because I barely remember what I did here but this is pre-workout immediately post-workout four hours later looking at my LDL particles my V

[01:41:33] LDL particles my HDL particles both in terms of their cholesterol and triglyceride content you see them going down yourself I don't see any change in the cholesterol content it's minimal change in cholesterol content right what I think you see here is yeah Wow under really periods of super high intense exercise I actually did take some triglycerides out of this right minimal out of here by the way this backs up Garvey's data which is there's virtually no way to distinguish what's going on at the VA LDL level I mean we can't tell what's a remnant here or what's not around and I apologize for the listener we're looking at the chart but we're gonna link to it so you'll see it we're basically talking about this idea of how much movement of cholesterol is going into and out of the LDL particle under these extreme conditions so I just did different types of workout so on this day I did the crazy high-intensity interval training on this day I did a crazy intense swim and I think on this day was the hardest workout of them all was a crazy intense bike ride and the listener can't see this but I'm smiling ear-to-ear it's almost as if you knew I was I forgot I did this I did this six seven years ago and again it's not commercially these are not assays that can be reproduced right and again I suspect you and I will look at these differently right I'm looking at these to say the VLDL is definitely moving it's triglyceride the

[01:42:47] LDL a little bit the cholesterol is barely moving now this is different from a broader issue which is how much did my cholesterol actually change in those nine blood draws well that was the variability of my LDL P so we'll link to a graph that shows LDL P versus LDL see these are nine points across three days

[01:43:09] I wish I could go back in time find the U it was it's like 2012 2013 something like that yeah probably 2011 or 2012 I'm being Peter this is Dave from the future I need you to eat exactly the same thing you do on all these days yeah I pretty much did he did yeah yeah okay yeah okay good and I was a timing exactly when I would eat it this is back when I was very strictly in ketosis fantastic that's effectively what I'll be doing so

[01:43:34] I'll actually have all added to to your end but I'm super excited to be seeing this now yeah but you're not gonna have unfortunately this I mean this to me is the interesting part is this is the part that surprised me the most was how little the cholesterol was actually moving out of the LDL even when the particle was going down and remember the height of this bar is artificial it doesn't mean anything this is not the

[01:43:58] LDL P right this is milligrams per deciliter milligrams per deciliter of cholesterol of triglyceride maybe I'm getting a little confused here how do you know about the cholesterol I'm moving out of the l-dopa because well what I can say is before the workout there was 116 milligrams per deciliter of cholesterol in the LDL and after the workout that's what was there this is how much triglyceride was in the LDL that's what was there okay so it's sort of a flux right because here's the thing

[01:44:25] I mean in a sense we're sort of I know you can acknowledge this as well we don't exactly know what the true circulatory level of recycling is you're just saying on a per particle basis for testing it afterward it's like for example you don't we're talking about the pool correct not the individual particles in that sense yeah it's basically saying if you took four snapshots in a room and how many people had blue shirts on and how many people had red shirts on and you saw the deltas you could not infer the actual numbers that went in and out but just the net

[01:44:57] Delta so there is either a net influx or a flux of people in blue shirts or red shirts right that's the best we can do now there may be some kinetic studies that could do even one better but that's to me pretty interesting stuff let's circle back to remnants real quick okay so this is why I kind of paused a little bit on the case study that you showed me where you had the triglycerides a bit higher now as you know it's what is the poor man's version of remnants as you basically can just take your triglycerides divided by five you probably actually no no we got to be very clear on this stuff we're gonna confuse the hell out of people okay that's the poor man's version for V LDL cholesterol correct very important guessin so the poor man's version which should never be done because it is such an abomination is to take the triglyceride level divide it by five and that number would be an estimate of your

[01:45:45] V LDL cholesterol what would you Peter Atia recommend as the most effective means by which somebody could determine the remanent cholesterol we can't it's impossible we have no way of knowing remnant cholesterol the ball may be clear I think I know what you mean by remnant which is why I'm asking that question you're asking pathologic remnant you're asking vldls that have shed their triglyceride and are now basically pathologic small started out as big triglyceride rich and now have shed that through their a possi to to LPL pathway and now have the potential for atherosclerosis is that what you're meaning about remnant no I now think we may think of it differently so straight up Wikipedia right now would define remnant cholesterol is basically all cholesterol that's not in either an

[01:46:33] LDL particle or in a HDL particle so if you were to just subtract HDL cholesterol yes if you directly measured total cholesterol which you can and you can directly measure LDL cholesterol and you can and directly measure HDL cholesterol you subtract those two and you have the amount of cholesterol that is virtually all in a V LDL and presumably some IDL if it's some idea around possibly chylomicron remnants if you ate recently but you shouldn't have any kind of micron remnants yeah that would ya that's very easy to exclude right but effectively if you've had a fasted cholesterol test pretty much all your remnant cholesterol pretty much will be in be LDL has the longest residence time relative to the ideals that's correct but that's sort of telling me outside of very few pathologic states like

[01:47:18] Friedreich's and type three B's that's as interesting to me as your eye color hmm the remnant cluster yeah really yeah I mean it's generally gonna be very low it tracks quite well with triglycerides though there are lots of examples where it's been actually I think I brought a copy of one of my other goofy experiments I don't know if

[01:47:38] I probably won't find it anytime soon but there was an example of how mine was so far off it was like a 700% Delta between actual versus predicted and one of these studies but no the point is like yeah directionally speaking I'd love to see a V LDL cholesterol below 15 milligrams per deciliter as calculated by taking non HDL cholesterol subtracting the LDL cholesterol which if you have a direct LDL cholesterol is your best measurement of that but whether it's 10 milligrams per deciliter 15 milligrams per deciliter 20 milligrams per deciliter that just tells me the sum of cholesterol in all of my

[01:48:16] VLDL remnants it tells me nothing about the pathology of them it tells me nothing about what they've done or where they're going but that said the question then becomes even for as much as what you just qualified does that become a more powerful predictor relative to something like say LDL cholesterol maybe but that's sort of like saying is rubbing two stones together better than rubbing like two logs together to start a fire it's like why not just use a

[01:48:42] Zippo lighter right it's sort of like we could split hairs on whether non HDL cholesterol or remnant cholesterol is a better predictor of cardiovascular disease than LDL cholesterol but again given that you know LDL cholesterol is such a crappy predictor of cardiovascular disease I prefer not to really even think about that that's again it's but we do have now a situation where this particular phenotype where lean mass hyper responders will have very low levels of the LDL cholesterol have very high levels of LDL cholesterol will have very low levels of remnant lipoproteins well but we don't know that there's no way you've measured that I've never measured that that's not measurable in a commercial assay that's worth its salt I think vApp does a VAE gas version of that but it's sort of bunk but look at this look at Garvey studies so we'll link to this as well so this is actually measuring the number of particles right so this is an insulin sensitive person their total LDL P is about 1,200 their

[01:49:41] VLDL P is about 80 you go to someone whose insulin resistant but not diabetic their LDL P goes up to 14 35 on average their VLDL goes to 80 for their IDL is counted it's a rounding error though and then you take the population with type 2 diabetes their LDL cholesterol is up to 1600 animal per liter and their VLDL goes up to 100 so you're right the VLDL is going up as you get more insulin resistant but it doesn't appear to be very clinically relevant right because remember it's all the burden of disease is from these they Poe be bearing particles and so the increase in the LDL particle number is not what's driving the risk of the disease you actually had a really nice graph in one of your figures that showed you titled it as remnant they was going up you know the figure I'm talking about yeah we'll link to that as well but you had a graph that showed I think as people who are becoming more insulin sensitive their pool of remnants was growing well and actually I want to qualify something real quick if I think it's the graph you're talking about it was the one downside to that is it was non fasted remnants which I had been trying to find which I have a problem it was in one of your talks it was but anyway my point is what's missing from that analysis is a PO B or LDL P rather it's the expansion of that see this study which is I mean the most elegant study of this ever done shows that if you only saw the top line this to this to the everyone would be like wow the more insulin-resistant you get the more your total burden of a Povey goes up but what this is showing is where is that burden coming from the VLDL only increased by 20 Nana more per liter but the LDL P increased by 400 animal per liter right and the point I'm coming to is this is where we're an uncharted territory is I don't believe this will apply to people who are ketogenic fatted that I don't believe this will apply to people were very ketogenic fat adapted and particularly who had this phenotype so let me see if I can come at it this way right now if I were to be able to get the data set for a Framingham Offspring because that is one of the studies that was showing out from before and I could basically just do this basic calculation of remnant cholesterol the way that we were talking about and conceding the point that your time that you said earlier that there's no way to truly know would I still come up with a more valuable metric for subtracting hdl-c and LDL C particularly when associating it to all cause mortality relative to like say LDL so make sure understand what you're saying you're saying if you could develop an assay to distinguish between the pathologic remnants of VLDL versus the physiologic remnants I'm not even developing that let's say I'm not even development I'm just taking the existing hdl-c and all the LC metrics is that recorded right now like I'm not even oh I see I'm just grabbing the data says it is right now yeah will the remnant cholesterol that I get from that subtraction will that actually be more relevant to all cause mortality than say

[01:52:42] LDL see I don't know but it would certainly rival it again the data are probably more clear on non HDL cholesterol versus LDL cholesterol that's typically what the literature talks about but as you can tell that non HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol are two of the three variables you would need so there's a strong correlation between non HDL cholesterol and remnant cholesterol and yes I believe non HDL cholesterol is more predictive than LDL cholesterol but there's one problem with non HDL cholesterol that I definitely want to bring up for people who are on a low-carb diet if you're going to be powered much more by triglycerides it directly literally triglycerides being brought to you in B LDLs then that is going to be relevant now again conceding per what we talked about before I can't know if I can stake my flag on it just yet but I'd be willing to bet if I'm right on the energy model that in fact you are being powered more by triglycerides found in vldls then you could have a higher resulting LDL particles effectively the bigger question is are particularly lean mass hyper responders showcasing directly that they are being powered much more by tranq less rides brought on these VLDL boats if you will and therefore having more subsequent LDL particles okay so my hypothesis is that that is not the case that it's the higher degree of synthesis right going on with the cholesterol that's correct that it is a higher degree of synthesis which may or may not also be matched by a higher degree of absorption if you're wanting to suggest a way that we could test this how would you suggest that before I do that let me unpack where I think energy is moving from right so I think we all agree that someone who is very insulin sensitive on a low carbohydrate high-fat diet is utilizing a lot of triglyceride we agree on that yes okay let's take an artificial construct and separate endogenous from exogenously asar ID meaning someone on a low carbohydrate diet is eating themselves and they're eating triglycerides from the outside world right assuming they're in the phase of getting leaner right so they're they're losing weight or even someone whose weight static they're utilizing their own internal stores of triglyceride that they're replenishing it if they're staying weight stable 100% okay so the eggs agendas triglycerides enter the body through chylomicrons that's a pure lymphatic play through

[01:55:09] CTEPH that's rapid hydrolysis I think we all get that I think it's this other end dodging his pool that's interesting and if I could just interject this one thing because this is one thing we're dancing around that we both know that probably somebody is not familiar with my work should be aware of chylomicrons they drop off these triglycerides and they're just come on almost like depending on who you're reading within minutes two hours at the roast so if you're taking a fasted cholesterol test per what we were talking about earlier you shouldn't see any chylomicrons or chylomicron remnants they should be gone and the cholesterol payload on those kind of my

[01:55:39] Brown should be gone so with that in mind go back to the endogenous triglyceride so endogenous means we're dealing with the pool of triglycerides that are coming out of you as the person so you have adipocytes adipocytes store triglycerides and those triglycerides are hydrolyzed such that you have free fatty acids that will be transported so where do they go so stay when they come out of the adipocyte who picks them up albumin so albumin then does two things it can take it directly to the muscle so that the muscle can use it in the highly fat adapted athlete or it can take it back to the liver and it can be repackaged in VLDL or it could be turned into a ketone if we're getting into an extreme state of someone who's ketotic so let's talk about Craig Moffatt who looks like a super fit dude who's running around as a total cholesterol of 457 milligrams per deciliter his LDL cholesterol is 335 his HDL cholesterol 109 and his trig is 67 so you have I'm assuming you did the math correctly I'm not going to check it but if that's presumably the LDL is direct his remnant cholesterol is 13 milligrams per deciliter and by the way that's not terribly far off from what you would get by the trig by five formula he's not that far off okay fine so where is he getting his energy so let's say he's out for a run all right so he's not eating anything and he's fat adapted so he's and he'll say he's fasted let's make it even easier he's fasted going out for a run so his adipocytes are releasing free fatty acids to albumin the albumin is taking some fraction of that to the muscle directly and they're undergoing beta oxidation there the albumin is also going back to the liver and some amount of that is being converted into beta hydroxy butyrate which goes down its own metabolic pathway and some amount of that is being packaged in either a V LDL or an ideal because remember there's still de novo i LDL production in the liver just as there's the novo LDL production those V LDLs and IDL's are leaving the liver and dropping off their payload of lipid to that tissue so the tissue is basically getting ketones from the liver triglyceride from albumin directly to the muscle and triglyceride through the VLDL and IDL directly to the muscle do we agree on that we do I'm just gonna expand a little bit on what you just said so yes it's full-body lipolysis and that you're he's releasing the free fatty acids in the literature that are usually calling him nifa is non-esterified fatty acids but we'll just keep it to free fatty acids it's getting released from all and we usually measure them by the way as one yeah it's a little frustrating because a lot of this terminology gets interchanged but the free fatty acids that are ultimately making it back to its liver are getting packaged into the vldls while we're talking about the target sites of the muscles for which are making use of triglycerides I should emphasize that I believe that the primary purpose of the creation of those is to replete everything so it's not just to fuel the muscles it's also to put it back into the adipocytes that just now released it as well in other words Craig Moffatt like many people who are lean mass Hybris monitors if we could install a little turnstile into their adipocytes we would see that turnstyle just spinning like crazy they barely Park the triglycerides there before it's heading right back out and that's because there's less total adipose mass overall on Craig Moffatt compared to somebody who's a lot heavier and therefore there needs to be more global supply of vldls relative to somebody else who has a lot more fat mass but this depends on his energy requirement

[01:59:23] I mean if absolutes while he's running and I wrote a blog post on this a long time ago which I guess we got a link to called it's something about fat flux I remember the name of it exactly but the gist of it was oversimplifying a fat cell as having to input doors in one output door the two input doors being the de novo lipogenesis door which is still an esterified entry door but I separate it as a different storage meaning it's coming from a carbohydrate not from a fat and then you have the rias Tara fication door which is the turnstile that allows fat to go right back in and then you have the lipolysis door which allows the fat to exit so a person who is in fat balance has a situation where el lipolysis equals the sum of the esterified de novo lipogenesis plus the rias terrifi fatty acids agreed that's just math straight up man yeah so when Craig's running he's in negative fat flux make no mistake about it his de novo lipogenesis is zero at that moment his estera fication is something and his lipolysis has to be something bigger right if he's not depleting glycogen which if he's highly fat adapted he's not and maybe it's worth putting out a distinction I'm not talking about whether they were successfully at the moment that he's running successfully rias terrifying these fatty acids back into the adipose and they might be though that's my point is we don't know but what we know is that in which gets back to but do we know that it's the job of the liver to keep maintaining that buffet to keep putting that energy back out there and generally speaking we do know that it's just to what degree my hypothesis is yes my hypothesis is which is not by the way I don't think this is a commonly held view I think a lot of people would disagree with me but my view is that the liver is the N or go stat of the body I borrow that term from

[02:01:04] Mark Freedman who wrote an amazing chapter on this in 2008 that has been one of the most influential things in my thinking on appetite but he described the liver as the N or go stats was an engineer you'll appreciate the nomenclature right it's looks kludgy to someone who's not an engineer to say why would he call it an N ergo stat but in engineering speak that makes perfect sense but that the liver is probably most susceptible to detecting some currency of circulating energy and circulating metabolites ATP would be the most logical thing for it to be sensing so probably ratio of ATP to ADP or ATP to a MP or ADP to a MP something like that but yeah I think the liver I mean I think most people don't appreciate how impressive the liver is in general like

[02:01:50] I was just talking to a patient this morning and I said look man here's the deal anything that goes wrong with you can be supported extracorporeal e right you get into a coma no problem you need to go on a left ventricular assist device okay it sucks but like it's there you need dialysis you need a ventilator all that stuff we do not have extra corporeal support for the liver it is too complicated anybody who follows me knows just how much I'm loving this because you're the you're the preachers preaching to the choir by far i've often referred to the liver is like the straight-laced part her who always puts up with your crap this is whatever you're giving it it's having to parse out and figure out and balance the ledgers and get everything yet and no no that's that's a great point and that was part of the other point I made to this patient who was not in any way opposing that view he was just asking if the elevation we'd seen in his liver function tests which was mild could explain a synthetic issue to which the answer was not a chance in hell under normal circumstances because the liver has an enormous capacity to do its job under even the most ridiculous stress so going back to Craig at the moment that he is running which is the same as saying if someone's losing weight while they're on a low-carb diet they are in negative energy balance they are in negative fat flux and again when

[02:03:04] I say losing weight let's ignore the water weight and stuff like like I'm talking about legitimate weight tablets and no seeds yeah but that's what it means right like on a practical level it means lipolysis the amount of fat that is leaving the fat cell has to exceed that which is re-entering it and again I don't know that this is entirely relevant but you've alluded to it so it's worth reiterating not all of that is oxidized right like some of that free fatty acid leaves doesn't get oxidized and guess what gets mopped back up provided the hormonal milieu still permits it yes so we agree on that completely I look at his remnant cholesterol of 13 milligrams per deciliter and say okay it doesn't tell me anything so I apologize because I've sort of lost your question was looking at that what could we infer what and this probably gets to just a larger problem that I feel like remnant cholesterol is helping us to address is why is it that anybody would have high triglycerides at all why aren't all triglycerides making their way to either the tissue that's using it immediately the skeletal muscle or the cardiac tissue or to the adipocytes if the body means to not have it sitting inside of lipoproteins parked in your bloodstream so that's a totally separate question I want to come back to this remnant cholesterol question though but that's where look this is why I like the original graph that we talked to this is why I draw that dotted line I draw a lot of people's attention to it this is kind of the core emphasis so this is the energy delivery support diagram for the person who's going to be looking at this later right we see that the chylomicron I mean if

[02:04:37] I'm gonna weigh oversimplify it but not by too much chylomicrons job deliver fat based energy yeah but is so far gone that it's not really entering the discussion we're talking about outside of very very rare diseases HDL not to deliver energy will just say things not related to delivering energy but I just call it support generally speaking operations not related to delivering energy all right agree with that okay last line liver this being the April be 100 containing lipoprotein is the one lipoprotein that clearly is pulling double-duty no no but hang on remember now we're this is where your diagram which you acknowledge is oversimplified the oversimplification is hurting you right so the liver has three purple arrows coming out of it the LDL IDL LDL agreed which is why earlier I was emphasizing that I believe there was a higher secretion of vldls overall for those people with lean mass hyper responders which is very relevant to our discussion and that way if there's I know that it's a theory I'm not saying that what I'm saying is if this arrow is fatter if the VLDL secretion is at a greater degree it would make sense why there would be more remodeled final LDL particles remaining and why we would see the inversion pattern in the first place because it originated in order to deliver more of those triglycerides which was brought about so why the excess cholesterol if that were the case

[02:05:59] Dave wouldn't you hypothesize that the LDL particle would be very high because you have more V LDL particles but they're shedding all of their triglyceride in an effort to deliver their energy payload but you shouldn't have an increase LDL cholesterol you should actually have a reverse discordance from what we see in the insulin resistant patient where we typically see the LDL particle number being disproportionately higher than the

[02:06:25] LDL cholesterol by percentiles of course in absolute numbers that's always the case in other words if I was buying your hypothesis I would say the LDL cholesterol should be very low you should have very cholesterol depleted skeleton particles that were mostly used to shed triglyceride as VLDL instead we see the concordance we see the LDL C in the LDL P very concordant people who don't appear to have other types of diseases well at that point they're so high it's hard to know but they're clearly not discordant in the direction that would make sense given your hypothesis in other words what I'm getting at is why is there so much cholesterol in those LDLs correct me if

[02:07:03] I'm wrong but as far as the actual drop-off rate the LDL C is still going to be relatively standard on a per particle basis in a healthy subject how much variability is there typically an LDL C per LDL particle because and again correct me if I'm wrong I thought that the secretion level is tends to be fairly standard kind of like a spare tire is standard per a car yeah it's it's the the triglyceride levels can be very variable yeah but so can the cholesterol levels I mean they have capacity to carry a lot but think about it like you have large and small particles that even for the same amount of class I sit for the same amount or glister I would have different amounts of cholesterol but the bigger point is where is the cholesterol coming from so if we go back and look at my guy or look at Moffitt I'm so Moffitt's LDL cholesterol was 335 milligrams per deciliter right but that's what's in circulation in the blood at that time so the larger question so so hang on just to be clear Dave is there any point during his 24-hour day when that number is like 30 milligrams per deciliter of

[02:08:03] LDL cholesterol in his bloodstream I don't believe so so in other words if you take the area under the curve if we could get real-time LDL cholesterol number on Moffitt and integrate him over 24 hours we could argue for argument's sake he's going to be always over 300 milligrams per deciliter his AUC would be very high yes for the LDL particle I mean basically what we're talking about is what's I almost want to say it and in terms of like birds in the air right like you have so many ships that have left the dock that are continuing in circulation I guess here's a different question that I'll pose back to you how much like the last row I'm actually asking this to I'm trying to understand it how much of this cholesterol has already made a lot are you thinking of this in terms of it's all getting synthesized and then reabsorbed and then recreated again let's go back and make sure we're agreeing on the same conditions here notwithstanding the experiment where they eat a ton of fat and they go from having incredibly high

[02:08:56] LDL to very high LDL but let's just take Moffitt over the course of a week assume you could do real-time ldl-cholesterol sampling on him and specifically LDL cholesterol yes okay or everything everything that's on your page you could sample his total cholesterol his HDL cholesterol his LDL cholesterol his v LDL cholesterol and his LDL particle number you could sample all of these things in every second for a week

[02:09:23] I think we're agreeing that he will always have a very high LDL P and a very high LDL C and a low V LDL see correct unless he eats a lot of fat we'll come back to that after but yes sure okay so given that the half-life of his LDL is a day where is that extra LDL cholesterol coming from I believe it's being recycled well it's always being recycled how is his being recycled so where is he deficient in cholesterol that a person who has an LDL cholesterol of a hundred is not I guess I don't understand the question where is he deficient yeah if he's got 335 milligrams per deciliter of cholesterol in his LDL particles are you telling me that he has less cholesterol in his cell membranes or less of it now somewhere else so he has more cholesterol in his body correct why for the same reason that we would have say life rafts on a boat and once we have more boats we have more life rafts if we had a harbor just outside this window right and you had a hundred boats and on those hundred boats their main job is to deliver something unrelated to life rafts they're delivering cargo to the other to the other Island right and they deliver it a hundred of them go out how to come back and then demand on that

[02:10:35] Island has changed now they need to deliver five times as many things as they were delivering before the problem in that analogy is it assumes a completely fixed number of life rafts per boat it definitely does but that's not how lipids work how does it work there's much more flux in the system and furthermore you could ask the question in Reverse why isn't it higher why would know the LCB higher on her boat no I wouldn't ldlc be higher in that patient in other words what's regulating it what's regulating how much LDL cholesterol he has the demand for the boats themselves for LDL particles what's driving that demand this is I think where we differ right the demand is for the cargo the originating cargo that is clearly getting used right but we agree the VLDL vanishes very quickly the VLDL remodels to LDL very quickly yes but if you go through the kinetics of this I can't follow why he should still have that much LDL cholesterol unless he is making more cholesterol in other words

[02:11:33] I've tried to think of this ten ways to Sunday the only way on a mass balance that I can explain this hypothesis is if he's making more cholesterol and not if he's recycling the same cholesterol like certainly he's making more relatively isn't only if he were depleting it in some other store so in other words if

[02:11:52] I'm making this up but like if you could say well all of us and like I mean you probably know this everyone loves to quote this fact right like red blood cells have more cholesterol in them and LDL particles right right right so the LDL denier loves to say well we don't think red blood cells are causing atherosclerosis and yet they have more

[02:12:08] LDL whatever but my point is unless you've depleted a pool of cholesterol elsewhere in his body just on mass balance you had to make more of it as far as I understand the liver can recycle cholesterol as many times it was yin that's true so litter and the liver and the gut have a very clear pathway if

[02:12:30] I'm wrong the liver is the only organ that can actually degrade cholesterol right non hepatic tissues can't degrade cholesterol well again it depends what you mean by degrade you mean remember cholesterol has no caloric value it's something that we metabolize right right you're synthesizing more you're saying it's gonna go somewhere if it needs to be synthesized more right if you're synthesizing more presumably you have a higher growth of the organism you have more cells you need more cells because obviously probably the highest demand for cholesterol is for cell membranes so what I'm trying to figure out it's like where where is all this extra cholesterol coming from if it's not being synthesized de novo and that's my larger point the inversion pattern is part of what should bring this to light is why then when I have an enormous amount of fat over three days I would see my LDL see drop by 73 why would I see my LDL P drop by a thousand 115 in three days from eating huge amounts of dietary fat why would that happen I mean it's an interesting question I'm just not sure all it's basically saying is you have a way to perturb those levels

[02:13:30] I'll give you another just anecdote here you know I did a one-week fast I went keto for a week and then ate nothing for a week and now I'm actually back on keto for a week and I'm checking my blood every seven days so that was my LDL P before I that's my normal LDL P so I'm walking around at 920 Nana mole per liter this is after you know months and months of time restricted feeding with virtually no carbohydrate restriction other than just I don't need crappy carbohydrates right so then I went keto for a week and look my LDL P actually went up now I don't think I would meet criteria for being quote-unquote a hyper responder cuz it went up to thirteen eighty which is not that high but you know that's still a significant jump for me right okay what should it have done when I fasted for a week shouldn't it have gone up according to this model well here's the catch the catch is I only know the three-day window I don't have a lot of data from people have fasted for a week as in just water fat you do okay you do I've done this on multiple patients who have done three five and seven-day fasts okay who are fully ketogenic and you're saying it typically goes always ketogenic no sometimes they're just you know fat adapted sometimes they're not sometimes they're actually insulin resistant and we use the fast to kick them into a state of ketosis to make it easier and again I want to be very careful this is simply just anecdote because I've only done this on maybe 30 people but this is not uncommon

[02:14:52] I mean look my LDL cholesterol went from 64 to 37 after the fast I mean it went way down Wow fantastic and that's consistent with what I see now that's not the reason I'm fasting to be clear I don't I'm not using a fast to manipulate lipoproteins I'm doing it for a completely unrelated reason but my point is I always see and again I can say always because it's a relatively small n obviously at a large enough n you're going to see counter examples to anything and everything but the general principle seems to be under caloric deprivation LDL goes down and under fat deprivation LDL goes down I've got to put in the one footnote and it's an annoying footnote that I keep putting it

[02:15:28] I really need to and this is why I'm dying to get these parts of the exercise I need to look at a population that also is not getting any particularly weight training a resistance training and so forth whether it's my theory or not that seems to impact overall lowering LDL C numbers seriously that is I mean I've got that any my patients not every one of my patients lifts weights despite my best efforts so I think the more common thing that we see is that when you put people on a high-fat diet the ones that go on to have this hyper response as you know they're Triggs usually go down their cholesterol goes through the roof and it's driven by a doubling tripling or even greater output of synthetic biomarkers like it does master all now for reasons I don't understand you also tend to see at least two other three phytosterols go up now one thing we didn't talk about though I wrote about it so I'm sure you know about this is this seems reversible if you eliminate the saturated fat it does seem to matter in this case you'll like this at least in our own data with a believ force seems more likely if you're in a Bui for you will see a drop somewhat and saturated fats so I don't think I have a large enough sample size because I've only put seven patients through that protocol and I wrote about the very very first one so that's probably the only one that you've seen that I've talked about but this was a young guy who went on a ketogenic diet was crushing it meaning like everything was going well I mean he'd you know he got through the adaption period I mean his performance was exceptional all you know mentally never felt better he was not an overweight or metabolically ill guy to begin with he was just kind of a normal software guy who just decided he wanted to take it to the next level but then he showed up with labs not unlike these he was the first guy I ever saw where there was a greater than sign on the LDL P right it maxes out at 35 yeah I was like oh I didn't actually realize the assay stopped at 3500 this guy's my guy he looked better on some of the other metrics he didn't actually have a lot of the inflammatory stuff this was before the ox LDL assay was commercially available so I didn't have that but you know his CRP and his LP PLA - were okay but we had the discussion right which is the discussion that at the end of the day I'm accountable for having which is what are we gonna do about it and he was young I mean I was 30 so it wasn't like we had to do something tomorrow this is not a guy who's gonna have a heart attack in a week cuz I think when you originally writing about it he actually pushed back a little bit like he wanted to come with well what he pushed back on was cuz

[02:17:59] I basically said look man I don't think the ketogenic diets right for you like these numbers are crazy and he was like yeah I don't ever want to go back to what I was doing before I mean he basically said and not so many words like I'd rather die of a heart attack and feel this good then you know and he's not saying like I'm gonna die of a heart attack tomorrow but he's like look

[02:18:15] I'd rather live to sixty and feel this wave and live to 70 and not to which I say totally fair by the way like that's a very reasonable trade-off to make but let's also think about this a little more logically so that was actually per the first case I ever discussed with Tom and this was I think back in 2011 and it was actually this discussion I think that led Tom to go on to write the lip the holux case even though it wasn't the patient that he used in that case because he then went out and found others like them and what we just decided was on sort of biochemistry first principles we our hypothesis was it's the saturated fat more than the ketones because that was the other thing this guy didn't want to leave ketosis because my thought was let's just dial this back get you out of ketosis but so our hypothesis was both ketones and saturated fat can be readily converted into cholesterol but if he's adamant on staying in ketosis let's at least get his SFA down to 25 grams per day which was hard this is a guy that was eating about a hundred grams of SFA a day maybe eighty grams I mean he was a lot and we basically just made most of it mu fuh so

[02:19:22] I said to the patient I said look the way we could do this just for no other reason is the purpose of a thought experiment is you're gonna basically have to become a non stop olive oil macadamia nut eater even the avocado you can't go hog-wild on because eventually you'll get too much carbohydrate out of it for his purpose and sure enough I think he came back at like 1300 you know after eight weeks or something like that so six more patients have been so adamant about staying in ketosis and not taking any medication but wanting to go through this experiment and all of them have had the same response which is if you can get them to mainline movea you fix the whole problem without reducing or increasing to any measurable effect how much fat they're consuming have you been keeping track of their proof of levels - because it's hard to add a lot of MUFAs there people's going up and you know the issue with that with adding more poof is the downside is is there's the potential that you're actually adding more peroxidation on the particle basis yeah

[02:20:22] I mean I think it depends this is one of those areas where I'm trying to get a lot smarter and I want to make sure I'm not sitting in the echo chamber I've historically measured RBC levels of arachidonic acid and all of those things and tried to keep track of the ratio of that to the EPA and the DHA and but ultimately I don't I don't I don't really think I know the answer to this yet and I also don't think my guess is puffins are not as bad as I've historically thought them to be but they're probably not as good as mofo so notwithstanding that I just want to talk about this from the level of the thought experiment so to speak my sample size of those people is too small to know if there's a relationship to their apoE gene to your point what I'm hearing you say is maybe that's more that's something that you're more likely to do in someone who's in a pony for carrier it's been a proportional kind of thing that we've sort of noticed I don't know but what I do know is it seems to point back to this idea that the hyper responders that the Occam's razor here is that they're making more cholesterol because that makes sense from a mass balance standpoint again I'm still and I would have agreed with you were not for this energy inversion that I see if it were not the very thing that I said from earlier that I could move my ldlc to where I want to move it that would be based on me basically arranging for a few days to eat to a certain level and

[02:21:35] I'd be pushing down my ldl-c by eating up to notice you're pushing up and down on ldlc within super physiologic levels meaning if I recall seeing your data do you mind showing me that again unfortunately the computer day oh that's that's why I've had it close but yes yeah what you'd see is an inversion graph no I'm very familiar with it will obviously link to it but it was as I described it you're showing that you can move your LDL between the ranges of very high and stupidly high no like i've what's the lowest you've ever got your

[02:22:05] LD 98 and i societies okay I suspect I could get my LDL down to 70 if I was willing to go through with it there's another part of this conversation we haven't had a chance to touch on but that you might find very interesting since we talked about the liver and again more theory so about 80% of what I've talked about is an explanation that

[02:22:23] I'm trying to fit on to what I know and this is definitely one of those but I suspect given the data that I have for the whole second phase of my research that actually part of how I'm reducing my triglycerides in the blood through a certain series of experiments I call carb swap experiments is that I'm just trying to get a certain threshold of glycogen stores up in my liver which seemed to be at a certain point meaning that there will be less VLDL secreted and therefore less LDL that's the theory

[02:22:54] I'm sorry to say again by moving glycogen you're doing what again I'm trying to think about it more like as an engineer whether right or wrong I think okay if I were trying to engineer this body and I were carrying a lot about the long term tank of storage which is you're out of post sites but I was also to care about the short term tank what is the reason why it would make sense from a mechanistic standpoint as to why the body would want to be so adamant about mobilizing these triglycerides for fuel and a low carb high fat athlete especially somebody who's very lean and the short Occam's razor from my perspective is it comes down to well there's very low glycogen stores relative to somebody who's on a high carb diet this isn't to say that they have bottomed out glycogen stores but relatively speaking there's less play and because of that it makes sense as to why the body would activate more lipolysis have more of the free fatty acids moving through keep making it more available etc okay so then how could I tweak that but wouldn't that also just as easily be explained by the fact that when someone's walking around with 60% of the glycogen in their muscle there's by definition assuming they don't have a sort of pathologic condition there's not much circulating glucose and therefore it's probably they're also in a low insulin environment which is fostering lipolysis right but it's gradiated there's threshold points which are part of what I'm trying to isolate out and there seems to be a threshold point with me for example if I have around 90 it seems to be the last time I tested it's about around 90 carbs per day net carbs per day that seems to be the magic threshold that if I do that for about three days my LDL see will just drop like substantially now let's see I did 70 net carbs for three days I've already done that doesn't do it I have to get up to a certain threshold and once I get up to that certain threshold which seems to be somewhere around 90 all other things being equal like I have to structure my life around this where I like to sleep the same amount and so forth that seems to be the point at which there's an actual drop and I actually wrapped that around one of my presentations is I actually had a fat to shake a ketogenic shake for I want to say three days for a washout period and then for just two days I added what I thought would be the calculation to demonstrate what I was looking to do so I swapped out the fat for carbs kept at isochoric for two days

[02:25:21] I had one that was a lower amount and one that was a higher amount I can't remember the numbers right offhand but then to further emphasize this I switched back to the high fat diet for the next five days and we saw my LDL see drop almost immediately and continue to remain low for the next five days and in fact it got to the lowest point at the end so it seems to be at least as sensitive on your carbohydrate intake as your fat intake right correct and this is very relevant because again I'm still thinking about this from the energy model but hang on I'm not saying this isn't interesting but for this to be relevant it has to be reproducing something that's going to last over much longer than five days how do we know if these effects aren't transient and also how do we know they're relevant if they require an extreme condition such as you know one of them I know you talked about how you just have to force-feed yourself a ton of fat yeah that was the very first presentation of my data where I was having just a very high product that also dropped your LDL C paradoxically correct correct but the point is we have to back up for a moment why does it any of this stuff matter in the end if you're listening to this podcast or if you're sitting in front of me as a patient you have a very important question you have to ask yourself if your LDL P is through the roof as a result of what seems to be your diet does it matter and do you want to do anything about it right and this is why this is the most relevant question is if you're right and I'm not saying that I know for sure either way let's say that you're right you Peter - you're right that this regardless of how we got here if you have a high LDL P because of being on a ketogenic diet then there's a lot of people who need to know that if they're at higher risk and I definitely want to be one of the people that brings that to their attention I have emphasized this several times before and I'll say once more I am on a journey of science not of advocacy I'm gonna be quite a skeptic but all of that said if I come to a point in which I can feel convinced that

[02:27:17] LDL P is in fact atherogenic absent remnant lipoproteins absent having high HDL low triglycerides but we already know it's absent remnant lipoproteins I mean there's a thousand studies including this to demonstrate that the average Anisa t between these people and these people I'm pointing to the Garvey study has nothing to do with what may or may not be remnants the LDL P alone here so I think one thing that sort of I've not seen a study yet where remnant lipoprotein I mean I'll send you the ones I have if you have somewhere LDL particle is more relevant than remnant lipoprotein I would be very well again variance be very careful what we mean by remnant so there are clearly going to be a subset of remnants that are potentially the most pathologic on a per particle basis but I think the body of evidence implicating the causal role of a poby and LDL P is so overwhelming is it perfect of course not but I think what concerns me with this culture when I say this culture I mean this sort of low-carb culture of LDL doesn't matter is if I had a dollar for every time I had to see some low-carb enthusiast basically dismissing the idea that LDL is relevant and touting the idea that statins are a big conspiracy theory that's a really dangerous problem so look just generally speaking I think dismissiveness in general we care about the quality of evidence oh we sure do let me offer a very controversial viewpoint that I can't believe I'm about to voice publicly I think one of the challenges in the low-carb community is you have a group of people who have become very used to rejecting mainstream information because they did so with nutrition right if you are on a low carbohydrate diet on some level you have decided that the a da the aah a the USDA the NIH and the

[02:29:10] CDC are full of I think that's fair point okay do you know what I think that when it comes to nutrition that's largely true now that I think they're coming around but I think it's largely true and I think the body of evidence the body of literature that pointed towards the food pyramid was quite shoddy I don't think it was nefarious I don't think this was as much of a conspiracy as people want to make it out to be I don't think an soaky's was some evil dude who was like scheming a way to like I don't buy that I think there were strong personalities and lousy science those are very different things and let me go on the record with saying I basically agree I feel like there was an easy part to agree with yeah this is the hard part that's coming up okay okay so what happens is a lot of people get into this mindset of well look over here I saw an entire body of evidence that I was very easy to dismiss and by the way look at the results like you don't have to be a rocket scientist if you're sitting there following the food pyramid getting fatter and sicker and you abandon it and get better there's the proof the real problem and again I apologize for getting on a soapbox the real problem is when people try to look at the last 50 years of lipid literature through that same lens Nobel Prizes have been won in this field now I know that somebody's gonna start screaming oh that's an appeal to Authority that's a logical fallacy I got it to you whoever said that I acknowledge it but unless you're willing to go back and read every one of those papers something even I have not done though I've probably read more of them than most we're talking about apples and oranges with respect to a body of literature here the body of literature implicating LDL as having a causal role a necessary but not sufficient role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is on a different level from the body of literature that gave us the food pyramid and that real challenge

[02:31:00] I think in this low-carb community this LDL denying community is there throwing the baby out with the bathwater now part of that is because I think there are too many doctors who are too lazy at the other end of the spectrum they just assume well statins are what we give everybody anybody who's LDL see is above a hundred gets to be honest and these doctors are equally guilty in my mind of being ignorant and not thoughtful and not understanding the pathophysiology of the disease but somewhere between these is a measured space that requires a very careful consideration of the literature so so with that in mind two kind of broad-based this pretty well this whole energy model that we've been talking about that I've been kind of walking you through in the audience to some degree it's the lens by which I came up with the challenge I didn't come up with the challenge because I was just like today

[02:31:51] I just want to tweet out something that I think will get a lot of people annoyed I believed that I looked at those two sides of the dotted line and I said it looks as if if you are insulin resistant we tend to see that there are high levels of triglycerides we tend to see the high levels of VLDL forget even remnant we can't detect VLDL to a certain extent we can see that people who are down the range of metabolic derangement they've got that and that tends to be highly associated with cardiovascular disease this is all on the energy delivery side on the other side of the LDL we tend to see on the support side that there can be further problems in the immunological role and oftentimes that can be induced by likewise lipolysis you'll see on the the vitamin E studies for example this gets brought up quite a bit for example if you inject lipopolysaccharides into a body you'll actually have higher fatty acid synthesis that's going on the liver along with lipolysis in order to induce that higher response so again we see on that side we see higher levels of triglycerides and I kept coming back to

[02:32:50] I kept paying you know but you're also as we talked about when you inject LPS and somebody you're gonna see a higher HDL cholesterol too I mean everything at that moment LPS is a terrible toxin like it's going to kick the body into a four-alarm fire for sure of course it's going to want all of the energy substrate it can muster and all of the hormonal precursors it can muster agreed agreed so when we're looking at an association between LDL particles and a bad outcome we want to absolutely confirm it was the cause and not the association right but the same reason that if we were to say I want to confirm ambulances aren't the cause of death for people who are dying inside of ambulances yeah I mean we have to be a little careful with that analogy so let's be clear can you get three sclerosis without having an oxidized sterile taken up by a macrophage no okay so if I could take all the LDL particles out of your body right now I can feel totally confident that you will not die of atherosclerosis okay so does that not imply that LDL is necessary but not sufficient for atherosclerosis I don't disagree with that without question LDL particles are it's important it's important for some people to understand that because I do think put it this way I've certainly heard people in this community argue the following that the burden of proof should be on the lipid ology community to demonstrate that LDL is causal rather than the reverse and I find that comical if it weren't for tragic let's go back to the analogy for a second are ambulances causal for ambulance related deaths absolutely they're a part of the project if I took life say the same thing because what you're basically saying is I'm emphasizing an association over causation we both realize that right so okay it could be in this town you actually are in worse shape if an ambulance picks you up there's very incompetent EMTs and their life-saving measures are poorly done and therefore if you could ban all ambulances in this town you'd find that actually all your

[02:34:50] Delian randomization of ambulances would ferret that out I would agree if there wasn't anything associated in the ambulance in the Mendelian randomization with response by ambulances in the first place only way I think you can discount the Mendelian randomization is if you believe that the mutations that you are measuring because so you're looking at a series of mutations that are affecting a phenotype in this case cholesterol level you'd have to convince yourself that each and every one of those is also affecting something else that's driving the underlying cardiovascular process yes yes but we've already went through this right it can't be the LDL receptor because that's not even ubiquitous and there aren't LDL receptors I want to I want this tested on a healthy vascular system however that's a crude I want every cell and I why does a person with

[02:35:43] FH not have a healthy vascular system when they're born when they're born yeah meaning they inherit a clean slate right someone who's born with FH has a normal beautiful vascular system sure that over time and most of them becomes destroyed just answer this question is there any cell in somebody who has FH that would function like a normal cell and somebody who doesn't have FH in order to be able to acquire the lipids or lipoproteins it wants to take yes plenty of patients with FH who do not have defective completely defective LDL receptors and therefore are not impeded but it this way there is a tab ilysm is not impeded is what you're saying not all of them again we have to be very careful when we talk about FH because there are at least 2,000 known versions of that disease it's very cumbersome so that's why I think it gets FH gets talked about like it's one disease it's a phenotype that has all of these things that can cause it so the broader question is is everyone with FH struggling to make steroid hormones I don't know the answer that no in fact FH maybe slightly protective in the case of an infection and in the case of diabetes and one argument for that via diabetes one's a little hard to explain the infection one FH has stuck around for a long time so there may have been a time when having the ability to mount an incredible immune response would have proved to have a survival advantage right and if you have four times the cholesterol of somebody else that's one moment in when that could come at a huge advantage right which gets back to the immunological response sugar but to get back to the the larger point I wouldn't blame somebody who has a poor digestive system for being malnourished as long as we can count on everybody's tissues to be properly nourished and but it's not believing by blaming them like help me understand what you mean by that what I mean by that is if there was a problem with absorption of lipids or lipoproteins unrelated to total quantity of LDL particles that's what I'm gonna care about and I hopefully will have an answer on this soon I'm actually working with a couple researchers who I'm trying to get an SNP list together that doesn't include lipid metabolism issues so Ronald Krause who you had on from earlier he was talking about this that he they were looking right now on for example lots of the genetic studies and he was explaining the receptor issues associated with and this is how you end up with higher levels of LDL C or LDL P right is that you end up having less absorption particularly on the liver side but I'm

[02:38:07] I'm especially interested on non hepatic tissues but there are there are people with niemann-pick C one like one transporter deficiencies there are people with ATP binding cassette efficiencies who have a huge increase in cholesterol it has nothing to do with an LDL receptor it's a transporter I'm not pointing just to the LDL receptor I'm pointing to just the health of the cell as if the health of the cell is not compromised then I'm interested if the lipid metabolism difference but why would someone who's atp-binding cassette in there enter a site that is not appropriately excreting cholesterol therefore driving up the recirculated cholesterol pool why does that mean that their endothelium is somehow defective I would have to follow what the path is that we're talking about I don't know that I could give an answer to that until I can actually see the study that's associated if you can take a biopsy of anybody who's going to have this issue and you can basically effectively see that the cells for which there would be targeted there is not going to be any problems I would have any problem with using it

[02:39:06] I mean basically what we really want what we really want is just the means of just an overproduction on the part of the liver without it touching any other part of the lipid system and your point I'll make your point for you it's hard to get an SNP that doesn't in some way touch other parts of the lipid system but that's also the point against it you see what I'm saying so let me ask you this you're saying look I want more evidence and I mean I think science is based on skepticism I completely respect that but I think we also have to temper that with some modicum of understanding probability theory and saying look at some point the probability looks disproportionately one way versus the other so right now what would your confidence be in the idea that LDL is playing a causal role in atherosclerosis just as endothelial dysfunction and inflammation play a causal role in atherosclerosis let's make a distinction the distinction is if you're saying is it part of the development of an a thorough sporadic plaque it's nearly a hundred percent if you're saying is it the total quantity of LDL particles absent any inflammation or anything else nobody's saying that nobody reasonable is saying that so again listen to what I said right so you've got three things that we can sort of use a metaphor and say they form the three legs of the stool three things have to happen for someone to get atherosclerosis each of them is necessary none of them alone are sufficient that's just the nature of complicated biology let me help you with the question I think this would be a better way of asking it if given the same quantity of oxidative stress whether it's low or high would you rather have one thousand animals of LDL particles or would you rather have two thousand animals of LDL particles yeah we don't need to ask me that question

[02:40:55] I think the question is what would you rather have I used to think that I would say the first I would rather have one thousand I would say last year was probably more like could be about the same difference learning what I've learned especially with the antioxidant defense system and so forth and particularly given my own data especially with the CI MT data that

[02:41:13] I presented recently I don't know if I don't know if you've seen that one as well I was I was getting a carotid intermedia thickness test every six months and during those six months in the beginning of this diet and through the experimentation I was running at LDL sea levels of 200 or higher leop levels of 2,000 or higher for four tests in a row you can actually see the regression that's happening on both the left and right side of the carotid arteries yeah

[02:41:42] I mean again I don't want to get started on CI MT which is not likely it's the same tech doing it the exact same way I mean I'm guessing your CI MT initially was pretty good and it may have gotten a little bit better but I don't know CI MT is even worse than calcium scoring frankly fair enough what again Dave we're putting a couple of n of how many's we're but we're saying look these three little interesting anecdotes are basically calling us to suggest that the null hypothesis around this topic should be what you're discussing rather than what

[02:42:14] I think is a remarkable body of scientific literature that is not without its problems and that is not absolute in its inference but it's not what I'm saying what I'm saying is it might not be what you're saying but it's certainly what Allah people are using your words to say I have an energy model that a lot of people are utilizing probably overly simplistically but if my energy model is right it would suggest as to why the answer of why you haven't even described it correctly to me today right I mean I guess it depends how liberal we want to be with the term model right but there is no evidence that the LDL is there to carry cholesterol you have yet to explain to me where Moffitt got his cholesterol you're talking about 2 the quantity that has it yes guys got three times the amount of LDL cholesterol I think it typically tracks with the total particle count you have to give me the mass balance you're an engineer you know this stuff just as well as I do if you are a hyper sponder coming to cholesterol co.com right now and you turn over your lab I can look at your

[02:43:13] LDL C that's fine and it look that that's just pattern recognition that's not the interesting thing to me I'm asking a very important physiologic question which you have yet to provide an answer to and it seems to be the central tenet of your belief system where did Moffitt get his cholesterol why does he have three times more than he had before and the short answer to that is he synthesized it and he's recycling it now there's some degree with which he's synthesized so this is a totally different answer than before he has now increased his synthesis of cholesterol he doesn't have the same circulating pool this is not a shell game with boats right I was talking about circulating before no but I what

[02:43:50] I'd certainly didn't hear you say before was that he has actually increased his own endogenous production of cholesterol there's some amount where you're increasing it in order to meet that existing demand I don't know how much that is but this is different than what I understood you to say earlier which is the reason he has more cholesterol is it's just it's along for the ride with the boats and he has to have more boats which defies that is correct but that defies the principle of mass balance you can't create matter out of nothing I'm not seeing he's creating matter okay so he had to make more cholesterol I don't see a way around that I am NOT disagreeing with him making more cholesterol I think where we're disagreeing is I think you're saying in total he's making three times more every day am I wrong on that on average he is making three times more or reabsorbing three times more but just based on what

[02:44:39] I'm seeing reabsorbing at the liver or reabsorbing an on hip probably in the gut that's where the majority of the reabsorption is taking place okay in other words he is sending it back out the other side well again this is what we look at these sterile numbers for when that does master all goes through the roof plus or minus the phytosterols that tells you these patients are making more cholesterol okay but here's the question if this were purely about energy he shouldn't be making any more cholesterol he should have more particles perhaps but they should be cholesterol depleted you answer this question for me when does somebody make more cholesterol depleted because everything that I've read in clinical

[02:45:17] Epidaurus and 'red quantity on the non triglycerides side of the ledger if you're making cholesterol on a per particle basis it can vary on a per particle level but generally speaking it tends to hit averages that are fairly consistent but this is an unusual circumstance you're describing right this is the whole purpose of this experiment is you're describing people who it's not unusual and you're saying is so great for triglycerides that they're doing that you make more boats but the boats if they already have a standard composition why would they change that standard composition per boat so are you telling me that you're saying that the large LDL particle and the small LDL particle in the insulin-resistant versus the insulin sensitive patients have the same cholesterol composition no that's my point my point is is getting back to remnant cholesterol why does that I think there would be something that would happen on that dotted line something before-and-after right why would there be a problem with somebody who's metabolically deranged with their cholesterol relative to one of these people that are theoretically metabolically flexible why would there be a difference and the short answer to that short answer is I don't know fully all of the aspects to it I do know though there seems to be a longer residence time with vldls and we see that because that's the fasted blood yeah no we know that that's explained very clearly by a possi three the residence time on the LDL for that matter as well in pathologic states so if I became more insulin resistant and therefore ended up with higher vldls I couldn't say two years later have healed that and then have less VLDL no look back to the Garvey study there's a reason I printed this up because I knew we'd be talking about this over and over again there's very little difference to try to impute or infer something about remnant cholesterol from VLDL is as complicated as trying to assess LP little-a by looking at LDL cholesterol think about that for a moment when you look at LDL cholesterol if it's directly measured do you agree that it's the sum total of LDL cholesterol plus LP little a cholesterol yes yeah it excludes v LDL cholesterol and ideal cholesterol because they contain a PO whereas the LP little a and the LDL P do not so if you have a direct cholesterol measurement the LDL C is technically LDL C plus LP little AC but there is no way on God's green earth you can look at that and infer what the LP little a is right without testing directly yeah and similarly we don't know what's going on with these V LDLs but meaning in moffat cuz we haven't measured it but we've measured this in patients that span the spectrum of insulin sensitive to diabetic and that doesn't appear to be the answer the difference in the a thorough janessa t the difference in the residence time and the difference in the total a PO B load appears all driven through the LDL particle not the V LDL particle so something else explains why they have more LDL that's what I want to find out again I'm very upfront about what it is it's theoretical what is it but we kind of already know the answer that question it's the triglyceride content so we can actually test it on people who are fat adapted or ketogenic we can say that we do when we can do a kinetic study on the LDL secretion with people were particularly like lean mass hypo responders then we'll have some idea but Dave that will only offer you an explanation it will not change the question of risk yes let's say you can do the kinetic study and hopefully somebody wants to fund this because it is an interesting question again I've done the kinetic study on myself you've seen my data right I lose triglyceride not cholesterol right which

[02:48:48] I would expect right I am seeing cholesterol basically stay the same in those cells during the periods of extensive exercise and fasting we're seeing triglyceride movement within the cell but the point is even if this theory turns out to be correct it's an explanation not a reason it's an explanation for something but it's a reason to ignore it is it this is where I think we're getting circular it's an explanation as to why it could be benign or even beneficial and that's where we're disagreeing ultimately which

[02:49:19] I figured we would be right why would you have high LDL for a good reason and your answer would be there wouldn't be one right no no that's not true there wouldn't be a good reason with respect to cardiovascular disease there are plenty of good reasons to have high LDL we just talked about them the FH patients obviously get some benefit from their high LDL but from a cardiovascular standpoint I don't think there is a single good reason to have high LDL and

[02:49:46] I am not aware of a single card-carrying lipid ologist or member of the community that spends a lot of time in this literature that could come up with one and I've been asking maybe something I've been very interested in give me a teleological reasoning a cardio protection standpoint I mean I was asking this question seven or eight years ago I mean there is no answer so again doesn't mean that having high LDL is always bad but it's really important to understand this distinction the other thing to keep in mind is lots of things in biology are not linear so look at

[02:50:18] Jill Barris syndrome Michelle Berra syndrome is a very common condition I you know two or three percent of people listening this have it probably don't even know it but they have elevated unconjugated bilirubin but very slightly elevated so right so if you've had a blood test done you've probably know down at the bottom and says you know alt ast bilirubin a normal bilirubin would be less than one but these patients with Jill bear typically get to about two well in half a dozen studies these patients have an enormous risk reduction in cardiovascular disease why why would having a slight doubling of bilirubin which by the way at high levels is toxic so if you walk around with a billy ribbon of ten you're not going to be around very long and those patients present they get sick they have obvious symptoms they're jaundiced and they usually have some pathology that's leading to it but these patients can walk around with a bilirubin of 1.6 to two and they seem to be getting a benefit from it and they also seem to have lower LDL and even if they don't have lower LDL because the literature is mixed on this they always have lower ox

[02:51:19] LDL and it may be that the best x1 is that Billy Rubin has antioxidative properties so they get this protection from cardiovascular disease but it's a u-shaped curve or an inverted u-shaped curve rather meaning as that Billy Rubin gets higher and higher they start to lose any of that benefit right meaning whatever oxidative benefit they get it's more than being outweighed by the damage that comes from that elevated bilirubin so I guess my point here is even if there's an explanation for why this is happening from an energy trafficking standpoint which again I really want to be clear I do not think there is I do not think that energy trafficking explains this phenotype I think that is not the Occam's razor answer I think the

[02:52:04] Occam's razor answer is they're making a boatload more cholesterol because I think we have pretty good data to suggest that which I'm dying to test by the way yeah yeah I know I mean we should make sure that you can and that other people can do this but of course the point here is it still won't actually answer the question what should you do about it just because there's a reason for something doesn't mean that it's a benign condition or that it should be ignored I agree and not only that separate subjects I'll even go a step further and say it could be a use shaped curve on this end as well it could be that you could have an LDL P of say 1800 and it turns out that's actually the bottom of the curve and people at 1800 don't turn out to be as high-risk as people that are like the one you just showed me above 3500 I not only grant that I also further tell lean mass hyper responders I may turn out to be right on my cautious optimism as far as the risk and cardiovascular disease but it could turn out that there's something else we haven't yet determined that's a problem with this phenotype which is another reason why we should be sharing all the symptoms that may be coming along with it as well but all of that said all of that said the larger question is why then would I be able to identify a certain set of parameters that when studied seem to suggest that high levels of LDL C I want some with high LDL P doesn't prove to be problematic and that's why I want to get a hold of something I want to get a hold of a highly large data set by stratifying stratifying for HDL high HDL stratifying for low triglyceride it's no stratifying for high or no if they're not an increased risk for cardiovascular disease how long will you need follow them to know that well that depends on the data set I can get ahold of I not in your space so I have to work well the reason you're saying you want to do this with the retrospective data correct okay so meaning this is your challenge to say don't give me genetic data don't get me drugged data I'd like just normal non drug non-genetic stratified people preferably and I'd like to stratify just on those three just on HD ll do your patients probably have some genetic snips that are explaining their phenotype oh I would definitely want to know that as well that's why I'm trying to actively get the 23andme I would love to send it away including anybody who has anything that could be called the genetic alteration even though the patient population you're trying to understand this and almost assuredly has a genetic alteration that's rendering them susceptible I'm not trained to exclude that but you just said you don't want to consider any of the genetic drivers know FH let me emphasize if you're making a study that is gene specific then it's the gene that drives the detection the discovery of those people right I don't want to do that I want to actually see if I can get a broad-based study of people who happen to already have high HDL low triglycerides and high LDL and see if they have high rates of not only cardiovascular disease but I'll cut again I come back to the FH patients you can't find a more broader demographic of people in terms of variable genetic inputs that produce a phenotype similar to what you're looking at I think we're just gonna end up in one of these got to agree to disagree moments until I can but which is fine I totally respect that but I just want you to understand what it sounds like from over here is you're looking for 6-footer and you're not gonna be happy to you see a 6-footer and gosh doggone it you're a knight and leave the kindergarten classroom till you find one I would argue the opposite

[02:55:17] I would say look if I could right now just grab a million people in the United States just absolutely randomly determine why would that not be significant data if I found that people there was the stratification for which high LDL did not result in high levels of cardiovascular disease or all cause mortality well because if you're gonna do that honestly you're gonna say well they can't have a single genetic mutation they can't be taking a single drug and they can't be on any funky diet let's say all of that turned out to be true they don't exist if I found that out that would be definitely something I think would be very interesting to my followers I would turn that background but you'll never know if you found or not they've well I've already found two studies that do stratify for those three and of the two that do high LDL does not result in high rates of cardiovascular disease what you're talking about these glycogen storage disease cases no no Framingham Offspring has one study where they stratified by three and I unfortunately my computer's data right show you the other one there's another one that stratified discretely between below 170 ldl-c and above 170 ldl-c and the high HDL low triglyceride group when compared to above and below were nearly identical both on the high side in on the low side yeah but this study didn't stratify by a PO B right I would love to have a boat B okay but that's the Quebec

[02:56:28] Heart Study for you right there the cubic hard study has the stratification by all three of those metrics the Quebec hearts are you here I've kind of printed it up here yes it basically is showing it has nothing to do with the LDL see once you know the a poby look at the risk okay I'm trying to get those three in conjunction I want to specifically stratify those three and in software this is where I get a bit frustrated because I feel like there's such a cultural difference between medicine and software we're used to having just loads and loads of free data just like we're awash in free data Google can't wait to give me everything that I want to see I requested I've actually applied I know

[02:57:05] I've heard you talk about it that's and are you being denied that or do they not have the data they just don't return my emails there's even people that I would think would be sympathetic inside the low carb community and I'm not gonna try to call them out who I've also tried to get this information from and I just can't get it and I want just a nice clean regression on three axes that's all I wanted that's nice and fat so I can react cease being triglycerides HDL and preferably LDL P now there is an important distinction we've got to make with a puppy because a puppy can in theory also include remnant lipoproteins yeah LDL P is more accurate than a PO be right an LDL P would be extremely fantastic if you could help me get in touch with that data set I would be very interested not with any major adjustments I mean you know whatever Cox proportional is something like that might be fine but just generally speaking if I could get a big fat data set and stratify on those three axes I think that would say a lot as to whether there's any validity to the energy model overall so when you look at the Mesa data which stratify on a kaplan-meier curve the difference between ldl-c and LD LP you're saying that that's not relevant because it the thing we're dancing around here is obviously when you have high HDL C and you have low triglycerides it suggested a number of different things but more broadly it's suggesting a properly functioning lipid energy system and probably not being in a state of a challenge of hdl-c tells us absolutely nothing if we've seen enough from

[02:58:36] Mendelian randomization x' and another how many more c type failures do we need to see HDL cholesterol tells us nothing about HDL function in fact anytime you increase HDL cholesterol pharmacologically you seem to make patients worse I know but these are modifications to the existing lipid system if you like Dave but boy if you're gonna hang your hat on it's all about hdl-c triglyceride I mean wow we are so far beyond that in the lipid world at this point like you're gonna go through this brain damage make it for something worthwhile but wouldn't you predict right now that if I did hang my hat on those two things on those two markers against ldl-c or a PO B or error

[02:59:15] LD LP that it would fail that if I were to say hey I want to get a stratification just of high HDL C and low triglycerides that you'd say sure Dave I'll bet you $10,000 I'll give you a hundred to one odds those people with high LDL even if you stratify but for those two will still have right high rates of cardiovascular disease I guess

[02:59:35] I'd have to completely see the patient population before I could even hazard a guess but right now you would assume that I am going to assume that LDL P is going to be a stronger marker of prediction than hdl-c and that's not what I'm making the case on what I'm making the case on is whether or not there's a properly functioning lipid metabolism which would be indicated by all three no you have absolutely no understanding of the lipid metabolism by looking at hdl-c and triglyceride I mean not even close I don't know this isn't like we can disagree on things that are nebulous this is not nebulous Dave this is I mean I can I hate that I'm saying this cuz I sound like a jerk and I don't mean to you've got to spend more time with lipid people now if you really do you are not dealing with your peers this you have to go and figure out like hdl-c is just categorically not a useful metric it is like a first-order term on a like no no it's not even that like an engineer speak it's the fourth order term on a fifth order polynomial that hurts Peter that hurts you know I'm just not that I'm just interested I'm just kidding look it's super crude and don't confuse the ubiquity of it with its utility right the ubiquity of it is yeah it's cheap it's easy everybody's got it but like let's not let people listen to this and get lulled into a false sense of hey if my HDL is high and my Triggs are low who cares what my LDL is and unfortunately I want to prove that right or wrong well first of all you'll never prove anything in science so let's be really clear on our Lango okay very important it's important it's important for your listeners to understand that fair enough fair enough nothing like wise ability sure but likewise would you say the lipid hypothesis is proved absolutely not I just said there's nothing outside of mathematics that exists in a proof right nothing and I had the basis of the luxury of having been a mathematician once so I get it there's a luxury of being able to write QED at the bottom we will never do this here and if people are sitting there saying well I'm gonna keep eating my bacon and eggs like it's mainlining and ignoring my ldlc because my hdl-c is high and my Triggs are low because you know i'm on a low-carb diet and somehow that makes me special because no one's proved that this is wrong wow that's not the legacy i want so what if i continue to find more datasets that actually support that what do i do i don't know i don't know what that means what do you mean by more datasets so meaning more anecdotes no i'm talking like it lets say i do actually get a hold of Framingham

[03:02:08] Offspring let's say I get a hold of I forget what some of these larger datasets are and how will you have to go Mesa Mesa sure let's say I can get Mesa and I can stratify for those three and it's showing the same thing without doing a lot of adjustments or anything along those lines what would I tell my followers I would say no it looks as if still there's further evidence that's showing high LDL C in this case is not problematic or may it did actually stratify for LDL P didn't it yeah so that'd be great example Mesa would be fantastic data to get ahold of is that something you think

[03:02:38] I would ever actually be able to see or D able to run regression suggests I've never thought of it but it would agree with you that would be great I don't know who would the data but would that be compelling to you if it turned out that we could run regressions oh let's say that it was in the next room right now and we worked it up on the computer and sure enough I went by these stratifications I was looking for that or like identical to somebody who would be and they were typical to somebody who was already a lean mass hyper responder and would show that they didn't have high rates of cardiovascular disease would that be compelling data to you I think compelling is the wrong word the question is how would it add to the existing body of literature that informs a decision we have to make every day with a patient and the answer is I'd have to see the strength of it and decide how does this fit into the existing body of literature I mean that's the only way I can imagine thinking about this but everybody listening to this and you and I all have to put our heads on a pillow at night with a null hypothesis against which we have to challenge existing data and I'm not convinced that the null hypothesis here should be anything other than the lipid hypothesis now the lipid hypothesis gets bastardized all the time it gets misstated all the time it gets based on LDL C and a whole bunch of other stuff but I'm talking about the real honest-to-goodness no LDL hypothesis which again I've written about eloquently and I people have written about it far more eloquently I should say I've written about it in a kludgy way others have written about it eloquently the lipoprotein the endothelial damage the inflammatory changes all of these things cascading that's my null hypothesis and in the end if there's data to counter that I'm all for it for example even when you look at the il-1 il-6 agonists the load o'the mess attracts eight studies that showed you could delay or reduce cardiac events without changing lipoproteins I don't think I'm being delusional when I say that doesn't change the the model it actually feeds into the model the model is there are three things that are driving this pathology if you reduce one of them things get better all things equal if blood pressure goes down do outcomes get better I believe they do absolutely they do yeah very potent why endothelial function all things equal if you stop smoking do outcomes get better absolutely so when you start to look at all of these things and again with those my outcomes get better your specified outcome right cardiac the all causes outcome is a much more complicated question that probably as a podcast and of itself to your question yeah Dave of course like I'd be incredibly curious to see this who wouldn't be but don't think that like one regression analysis on

[03:05:15] Mesa is gonna turn over 50 years of data regardless of what it shows the question is how does it alter our understanding and thinking of the problem look the whole reason I'm even pursuing this particular strata is because of the model in the first place I had to have something that I could conceive of that would inform the decision by which I would be looking for what the data is that would disprove it that's why I'm in pursuit of disproving it at the end of the day Peter I can't emphasize this enough I'm not looking to talk to the echo chamber or looking to just maneuver around inside of a number of people are gonna congratulate me I specifically but I think you're better off going to an NLA meeting than a low-carb meeting sure but they're freaking expensive I've looked at all of them I got the low-carb community to fund you if they want to know the answer because I don't think they do if I'm gonna be brutally honest I think the worst of that crowd just want their confirmation bias they have seen these incredible benefits of low carbohydrate diets and their belief is nothing can be wrong with this like we somehow live in a mono dimensional monochromatic world where like it's that black and white and if the diet is good for this it can't be bad for anything and they are so wed to that that the they construct these crazy arguments but if they share your passion for truth then they should happily fund you to go to an NL a meeting and spend a week there and and actually start hanging with these guys who are way smarter than me like I'm a knucklehead I mean I know a lot about lipids for a knucklehead but I'm talking about like the smartest people in the world are the ones you need to be talking to on this topic and they're not at low-carb conferences I promise you that they're not on Twitter and they're not playing patty-cakes they're like high-carb or whatever low-carb blogs like it's just not about that stuff man and again I mean I think what you're doing is really interesting

[03:07:06] I don't agree with the model but I'm glad that you're pursuing it I wish you the best in pursuing it with the right people absolutely well and perhaps you'll be able to help me set up with the right people I would definitely be more interested in finding those voices that can help tear at this model I would be more than happy to help in any way I can great I can't emphasize enough as I anticipated I was gonna ask you more questions than you asked me I'm really appreciative that you took the time to chat with me about this no my pleasure
