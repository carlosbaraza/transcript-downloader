## Transcript

[00:00:00] what would make a school 10 times better than you know old school that that we went to you know and so we we sort of have five dimensions that we do and the first is kids must love school and we literally measure more than vacation like that has to be it and we get 50-ish% of kids depends on the vacation depends on the workshop if it's really good 50% of kids who are like yeah I want to I want to go to school instead of vacation I have plenty of parent well my highlight as a principal was you know in in May uh this year, twothirds of the high school kids sent me a note and they're like, "Can we keep Alpha High open this summer cuz we don't want to take a summer break cuz we love what we're doing." Right? The girl doing her, you know, Broadway musical, she's like, "This is I I want to keep coming to school and doing it, right?" And so, you know, we're, you know, back to my world where I was not into school and I was, you know, sherking and my dad, you know,

[00:00:53] I'm like, "Make a place where kids love school." Um, and vacation's a good standard. Number two, kids need to learn 10 times faster. We just we need an engine that teaches kids 10 times faster. And so our AI tutor based on learning science teaches kids 10 times faster, right? And between five and 10 and we'll get it up and you know, so that's the second part so that you can then that gives you the chance to give the time back. The third dimension of a school is what are if you academics isn't everything, right? To developing kids everybody knows that. What are the life skills that every parent says that is what I wish I knew? And some are, you know, traits, behavioral traits. I hope they they are love learning and are self-driven learner, right? You want things like that. And I want somebody who uplifts others in his classroom and behavioral and is an independent person.

[00:01:42] Others are like those ones I talked about where you're like, "No, I want entrepreneurisism and financial literacy or I want storytelling, public speaking, those those type skills." And so the third is have that curriculum >> suite of skills >> the suite of skills that every parent wants. So we actually have spent, you know, the last three years developing life core, right? The common core curriculum for life skills that because

[00:02:05] I have four hours a day to fill, right, with all this awesome stuff that kids can do. And it's just amazing what they do. Like if you take Atomic Habits, right, that book of 1% better. Most people don't read that till after college, right? And then they're like, "Oh, this is a way I can really develop." last year, you know, our guide, Faith, second grade guide, you know, she sat down and she was working on her her workshops, you know, her life skills.

[00:02:32] She's like, "You know what? I want to teach atomic habits to all the second graders because the concepts they all can understand." >> And she's like, "You know how I'm going to do it?" I'm like, she's like, "I'm going to have all our second graders run a 5K in under 35 minutes." And that interest. I'm like, "Oh, no." Okay. the parents are not going to like that, right? That's too hard. Back to high standards. They don't want struggle, fail it. Where's that road to success part and what percent are going to make it? And so I was, she's like, "Don't worry, it's to I can do this." She was a

[00:03:05] UT athlete and she's like, "We totally can do it." She was a like a head cheerleader or whatever. She's like, "Everybody can do this." And so she sits down with the second graders first day and is like, "Who who can run a 5K?" And they're all like, "That's impossible, Miss Faith." The parents all are like, "That's impossible to say." She's like, "Well, I signed you all up for the jingle 5K, you know, at the domain." And so she goes out to the track and the first day they walk it and they walk 5k.

[00:03:33] She's like, "Okay, so we all established you're going to finish the race, right? And then the next time they ran a quarter lap, walk the rest. Next time half a lap, walk the rest." And by December, right, all the kids are running the race, right? And you know, when they crossed the finish line, just that achievement back to the key to your kids' happiness is high standards.

[00:03:54] That's a really high standard, but they loved it. And they did have to struggle and go through and learn this. But they also learned that life skill of 1% better, right? And so the second graders like, "Dad, I can do anything. I can do 50 push-ups. I'll do one today and two tomorrow." And, you know, build up. And that skill, that life skill, we don't teach kids in school. It's a great life skill to have. And if you have half the day, you can do that. So that's the third element of like how do you build a great a great school. The fourth element and this gets to the teachers. What would make a teacher 10 times better than what it is today? And the answer is well not grading science tests all day and you know writing lesson plans but instead connecting mentorship with the kids, right? And so we ask here's the questions we ask you know the students and the parents which is to kids you know you know kindergarten we're like do you love your guide? Right? And but you know as you get older it's every adult had one or two teachers who transform their life right back to that is your guide that for you right and that is what our guides right that is the expectation that they are the ones that the students are like you are helping me achieve things that I didn't think is possible miss faith you told me taught me how to do the impossible right and so that right that level and actually then you know at the parent side. This gets into you know Dr. Joerger um you know has a book 10 to 25 right child psychologist development expert and it's you know from kids how to uh what matters for kids right from 10 to from 10 years old to 25 right and uh his whole theory mentor mindset you know high standards high support the the heart most parents are not high standards and high support which is what really matters to developed kids They're either low standards, high support. That's what happened to all our expectations. Or they're the inverse, high standards, no support. You know, this would be your classic, you know, tiger mom would be, you know, good luck. Figure it out, right? And the real answer for child development, you need both. High standards, high support. And so that's our guides. But the question we ask parents in middle and high school, right? Back to having what's a school reinvisioning it. It's like, do you trust your alpha guide to hold high standards for your kid so you as the parent can provide the unconditional love and support, right? Which transforms for those who've had adolescence, it transforms your relationship where you don't have to be the naggy parent for the high the high standards. You know, my daughter, my oldest daughter, you know, she's writing her college essay and I'm like, "You want to let me read it?" And she's like, "No." Right. No interest in that. >> Yeah. She's got she's got it taken care of. She's got someone else. >> And for me, I was super relaxed because

[00:06:47] I was like, I know Chloe, right? Back to our guide, right? She's a Harvard grad. I know she was to totally high standards for for my daughter and I know it's going to be fine and I don't have to get in a fight about it or whatever. I'm just like, "Okay, yeah, I can give my daughter a hug and be like, "Good luck."

[00:07:03] Right? And so that transforms what teachers can be, right? versus I'm delivering those seventh grade lessons. And so, you know, and then the fifth dimension that we talk about is the C's, character, community, classmates, and culture. And these are also the hardest parts to measure, but at the end, they're what parents care about the most, right? Which is at the end of the day, all those other for you don't character, right? Is do I have a good kid? Did I raise a good kid? Right? And is the school helping me make right raise a good kid? And so those elements are what we looked at and said, now that you want to reinvision school, right, from the ground up, here's the dimensions.
