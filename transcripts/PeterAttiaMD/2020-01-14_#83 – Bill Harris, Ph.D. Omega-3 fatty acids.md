## Description

Original release date: 12/9/19

In this episode, Bill Harris, Ph.D. in human nutrition and expert on omega-3 fatty acids, sets the table by clearly defining the families of fatty acids (saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated) before diving into the current landscape of polyunsaturated fat (omega-6 and omega-3) with a particular focus on EPA and DHA (the two main elements of fish oil supplements). Bill gives a historical overview, updates us on the latest science related to the health benefits, and provides plenty of insights as to how we should think about increasing our EPA and DHA intake.

We discuss:
-Bill’s long history of studying fatty acids [6:30];
-Defining the fatty acids—SFA, MUFA, PUFA, omega-3, omega-6, and more [9:45];
-What is the significance of fatty acids? Why should we care? [19:45];
-History of fat phobia, saturated fat, and does PUFA reduce cholesterol? [23:45];
-Breaking down the conversion process of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids including how we get to EPA and DHA [28:00]; 
-Takeaway from Bill’s 1980 study looking at how salmon oil affected cholesterol and triglyceride levels [36:15];
-History of our understanding of omega-3 and its effect on LDL cholesterol [45:00];
-Prescribed fish oil drugs vs. OTC supplements—Differences and recommended brands [52:00];
-Health benefits of EPA [57:45];
-Potential benefits of ALA and how it compares to taking EPA and DHA directly [1:12:45];
-Health benefits of DHA [1:17:15];

-Can omega-3 mitigate risks associated with smoking? [1:29:15];
-The problem with the omega-6 to omega-3 ratio [1:30:00];
-The problem with labeling any kind of fatty acid as “bad” [1:36:00];
-Why increasing EPA and DHA intake matters more than reducing omega-6 intake [1:38:00];
-Important takeaway from the VITAL study [1:46:30];

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast with Bill Harris:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Bill Harris, an internationally recognized expert on omega-3 fatty acids, discussing the science behind fatty acids and their health implications. The conversation covers the chemical structure of different fats, their metabolism, and clinical significance, with particular focus on EPA and DHA. Key highlights include discussion of the REDUCE-IT trial and the evolution of our understanding of omega-3 benefits over the past 40 years.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- EPA and DHA are converted at less than 1% efficiency from ALA [1:12:15]
- Red blood cell EPA/DHA levels correlate well with other tissue levels except brain [1:14:28]
- Average American consumes 150-250mg combined EPA/DHA daily [1:38:16]
- It takes about 4 months to reach new steady state omega-3 levels after dietary changes [1:57:29]
- Optimal omega-3 index range is 8-12% in red blood cells [1:23:07]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Consider measuring omega-3 status via blood testing [1:54:36]
- Focus on increasing EPA/DHA rather than reducing omega-6 [1:43:47]

Context-specific:
- Take omega-3 supplements with food for better absorption [1:58:01]
- For high triglycerides, higher doses (4g) may be beneficial [1:54:04]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- Vascepa (pure EPA) - 4g daily in REDUCE-IT trial [1:00:48]
- Lovaza - 850mg EPA/DHA per capsule [1:54:04]
- Ethyl ester forms require food for absorption [1:58:01]

5. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Omega-3 Index (RBC EPA+DHA) optimal range: 8-12% [1:23:07]
- Takes 4 months to reach steady state after changes [1:57:29]
- Red blood cell levels correlate well with most tissues [1:14:28]

6. **Notable Quotes**:
"The problem is the lack of EPA and DHA. If you get those up, your arachidonic levels will go down." [1:43:47]

7. **Follow-up Questions**:
- What will be the results of the STRENGTH trial with EPA+DHA?
- Are there specific populations who might benefit more from EPA vs DHA?
- What is the optimal timing of omega-3 supplementation for those practicing time-restricted feeding?

This episode provides an excellent foundation for understanding fatty acid metabolism and supplementation strategies. The discussion of recent clinical trials and practical supplementation advice makes it particularly valuable for both clinicians and health-conscious individuals.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally are how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination and obsession with this topic I practice it professionally and

[00:01:01] I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something

[00:02:13] I don't know how I can talk about it in thews II a Stickley so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our shows members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:17] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription my guest this week is dr. bill Harris bill was an internationally recognized expert on omega-3 fatty acids and how they can benefit patients across a broad range of medical conditions and but in particularly with attention to heart disease he's a professor in the

[00:04:12] Department of Medicine at the Sanford School of Medicine in the University of South Dakota he's also the president and CEO of Omega quant which is a company he started about 10 years ago that we spend a little bit of time at the very end talking about and again the caveat being of course he does have a vested interest therefore conflict with respect to involvement of his company but you know

[00:04:31] I can say I've known bill for for 10 years and I know people who have known bill for much longer than that and his reputation amongst his peers is really someone who is a very honest broker of the science he's been the recipient of five NIH grants for the study of the effect of omega-3 fatty acids particularly EPA DHA on human health he's published over 300 papers on the topic and we discussed just a couple of those here some of the really interesting ones and he was also the author on two of the American Heart

[00:05:01] Association scientific statements on fatty acids he earned his PhD in human nutrition from the University of Minnesota and did a postdoc in Clinical Nutrition and lipid metabolism with Bill O'Connor at Oregon Health Sciences I was introduced to Bill like I said probably nine years ago from Tom Dayspring and this was around the time that I was really searching for insight around the polyunsaturated fats and in particular

[00:05:25] EPA and DHA and since that time bill has been a very generous generous mentor to me with respect to just one of those guys you send him an email with a simple question and he responds with a very thoughtful you know 600 word response that contains more insight than anything I could have drummed up we talk about mostly the landscape of polyunsaturated fats here but this is a great episode you don't have to know anything going into this episode when it comes to fats we're gonna explain what saturated fats are monounsaturated fats polyunsaturated fats omega-3s omega-6s you're going to come out of this and have a better understanding of this topic than if you went to med school and took a course in this subject matter I think I'm just going to leave it at that the show notes will be very helpful for this episode because some of this stuff it really makes sense to be able to look at a diagram as we go through it and of course as usual for for subject matter like this we're gonna go heavily into studies so you'll want to be able to reference those studies and see them so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with Bill Harris well thank you so much for making the time to talk about a subject matter that

[00:06:34] I think is incredibly confusing and incredibly important that intersection of things that are confusing and things that are important tends to be very important and sometimes overlooked intersection in medicine so with that I want to thank you for making the time yeah my pleasure how long have you been the Guru of this I mean for the listener in the background I give a little bit of your background but I was introduced to you and I think 2011 from Tom Dayspring who basically said anytime I had a question that had to do with you know anything around fatty acids you were the guy to ask and over the past eight years you've steadfastly answered more questions than I can count tell me a little bit about how you you got to be the guy that knows so much about this just hanging around a long time so I I got a my PhD in nutrition in 1978 and I went to work with Bill Connor in Portland Oregon for my postdoc his first assignment for me was to study the question of what does the effect of salmon oil on cholesterol levels because we were very familiar with the effects of vegetable oil on cholesterol and animal fat saturated fat but we really didn't know what a fish oil would do to cholesterol so my first really metabolic wart study I organized recruited subjects did the protocol and we fed people huge amounts of salmon oil basically all of the fat in the diets so people were eating salmon steaks twice a day and this was a 28-day inpatient feeding relaxed he's been outpatient feeding but metabolic warden and beyond the same mistakes they were drinking about a hundred milliliters a day of salmon oil just drinking it straight and so it was a huge load 25 grams of epa

[00:08:24] DHA per day and we found that the omega-3 is lowered while actually salmon oil did lower cholesterol relative to the saturated fat diet and it was about the same lowering as we saw with the vegetable oil diet but the thing that was unique about salmon oil was that it lower glyceride levels and nobody had known that at that time so we published our first paper on that 1980 that's really coincident with the time that the

[00:08:51] Greenland Eskimo studies were finally becoming well known from iyer Berg and bang and the Omega threes had been sort of discovered in the sense at that time and so we started chasing omega-3 effects on lipids and platelet function and all kinds of other things and so I've just been able to stay with it

[00:09:09] I've had five grants from the NIH to study omega-3 related questions and so this again that's it's been a field that's continued to be fascinating and ups and downs but enriching and as you said it's confusing right now it's it's been confusing for most of its history that's kind of an amazing story and I want to come back to that study because it's possible the listener right now doesn't understand the context of what 25 grams of EPA would mean but that's I mean that's a dose of a type of fat we're gonna talk about when we get into the nomenclature that is almost unprecedented and I already have a dozen questions for you about that exact study and were there any side effects such as bleeding noses and anti anabolic effects on these things which but I'll refrain from going down that path to instead make sure we can get everybody on the same playing field so I'm gonna start and give a little bit of a framework but

[00:10:04] I'm gonna very quickly hand the baton over to you to get into the weeds on this a little bit so obviously fat is one of the four or five depending on how you look at it macro nutrients right so fats proteins carbohydrates ketones alcohol and I think most people know that fats come in different chemical families so you've already alluded to one of them called a saturated fat and then everybody's probably heard of a monounsaturated fat and then there are these things called polyunsaturated fats which then get further divided into these Omega threes and sixes typically but there are others do you want to say a few words about what separates the saturated fat from a monounsaturated fat from a polyunsaturated fat and then how we further subdivide those polyunsaturated into the Omega threes and sixes and I guess if you can't answer the question bill not just through the chemical explanation though I'd like you to provide that but also through some of the examples and characteristics of each of them so that folks have a sense of what we're talking about from a chemical structure point of view a saturated fatty acid is a long single chain of carbon atoms all hooked together and there are what we call single bonds between each carbon atom you in chemistry you can have single bonds you can have double bonds you can have triple bonds but in a saturated fatty acid or a SATA and a saturated fat like lard or butter any of those saturated fats have the vast majority of fatty acids that make up those fats are saturated meaning they have long single chain and they're solid at room temperature I think that's the most common characteristic so the simplest way to detect the saturated fat is at normal room temperature they're solid monounsaturated fat fatty acids are the next class and these have the same long carbon chain it can be 12 14 16 18 carbons long and there is one double bond in a mono unsaturated fatty acid soy when there is a double bond in a molecule it's now has a point of unsaturation and why they pick that nomenclature is not worth talking about the moment but that's what that means the classic oil that is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids would be olive oil and canola oil now too those are both very rich in monounsaturated fatty acids they are liquid at room temperature but you put them in the refrigerator and they'll get hard that's kind of a way of telling a monounsaturated rich oil if it's out at room temperature it'll be liquid in the fridge overnight it'll get solid or certainly getting very cloudy the pollen saturates the next group it's really instead of one double bond now we have two or more double bonds and that's the poly so again the same long carbon chain with now 2 or 3 typically actually in foods all you really find is 2 double bonds these oils that contain polyunsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature and they're typically lift put in the refrigerator too you have to put him in a freezer to get him to get solid or to get cloudy even some fish oils will not get solid even in a freezer but the polyunsaturated fatty acids are again they they are what you find in oils we say fats and oils when we say fats we're usually talking about things that are solid at room temperature oils we're talking about things that are liquid at room temperature and again the oils are going to be mono or polyunsaturated rich and the fats be saturated fat rich again we're now in the polyunsaturated fat world we have two families two major families it's called omega-6 and omega-3 and they're called Omega because when chemists to start first started naming chemicals naming fatty acids when they were discovering the structure of them there was the beginning and the end of the molecule and the way they designated what was the beginning of the molecule they called that was the alpha carbon the first carbon and the last carbon in the molecule was always the Omega carbon taking from the Greek alphabet the Alpha and the Omega at the beginning in the end so the Omega carbon was at the end if you have an omega-6 fatty acid this actually said Omega minus six means that if you count back six positions from the

[00:14:28] Omega or final carbon you get the first double bond in the molecule and that's specific for all of all the fatty acids that are omega-6 family they all have that characteristic first double bond six counting back from the Omega or final carbon and the omega-3 fatty acids all have the first double bond in the third position and that sounds like it really shouldn't you know so what but actually chemically it makes quite a bit of difference in the physical properties of the oils as well as the other molecules or metabolites that these fatty acids are converted into by enzymes in the body so that's the omega-6 to omega-3 family fish oils are the ones that contain omega-3 predominantly vegetable oils safflower oil corn oil sunflower oil are rich in the omega-6 fatty acids it would have taken me an hour to have tried to explain that bill and it would have been half as clear so thank you for that the thing that's always amazed me is how many different pieces of information can be conveyed in the nomenclature of fatty acids because you're dealing with the extent or degree of saturation anywhere from fully saturated to not as mono and poly you then have the actual number of carbons in the molecule and then you have the position of that first double bond in the case of the monos and the

[00:15:45] Poly's so even for someone who's taken a course in organic chemistry like it still requires a little bit of thought when you're looking at detailed chemical drawings of these things and I suspect that represents at least some fraction of the challenge that people have when talking about this as we tend to distance herself from what we're talking about because of the confusion but as you point out it sounds like it shouldn't make that much of a difference right the difference between coconut oil and olive oil is one double bond and yet their properties are almost entirely different I don't know if you have insight into this but from a nutrition standpoint does the specificity of enzymes for these fatty acids is that kind of unique in terms of just how much difference you can see in the output relative to the starting structure or do you see that to be relatively conserved across all of nutrition outside of fats that is no I think it's probably a truism that every molecule is unique every molecule is special in our foods in our bodies from water which is probably the most special molecule in the world or in the universe which makes up what 70% of our bodies - down to the fats and fatty acids and of course carbohydrates and proteins are all very unique molecules

[00:17:05] I appreciate you mentioning the number should mention how they are numbered in case people ever see them written out in the number format because any saturated fatty acid let's take a fatty acid that has 16 carbons and it's a saturated fatty acid it's its common name is called palmitic acid it comes from primarily from palm trees palm oil so it's called palmitic acid this designation is 16 : 0 16 means how many carbons are in the molecule the what follows the colon is the number of double bonds in the molecule so all saturated fats is just a number colon and then a zero when he had an ax monounsaturated fats again it's the carbon number first like the most common one is 18 carbon fatty acid 18 colon 1 and the one tells you there's one double bond that fatty acids called oleic acid we get olio from that word oleo margarine once you start putting a double bond in a molecule now you have to tell the reader where it is in the molecule and to your point when you have an 18 colon one you got to know where is that thing and in this case it's at position number Omega 9 it's the ninth position back from the end so that'd be 18 1 colon end all right here we go here's the other confusion part of we say Omega we like to say omega-3 omega-6 omega-9 but chemists like to talk about them using the term end like the letter n it's the final carbon in the molecules the nth carbon it's the last one it's just the nth one again exactly where they came from I don't know sometimes you'll see an omega-3 fatty acid called an N minus 3 fatty acid and - 3 fatty acids the same thing we're talking about the same molecule I think there's mathematicians that have snuck in there so that the n-terminus is where that n must have come from in a geometric series or sequence yes we're gonna include a lot of figures in the show notes that go through what these pathways look like because at least for me I don't find I can wrap my head around these things without actually looking at the chemical structures and I still remember probably a figure you sent me eight years ago that really walked through the pathway from linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid all the way down through the desaturation long cases all of these enzymes and I think I just had to decide like look I'm gonna sit here and I'm gonna learn this and I remember printing it out laminating it carrying it around with me and just going through it it's like okay well it's a desaturates okay that makes sense it's an elongates it's gonna elongate here one that that the and at least for me that was just sort of the way to do it which was just I'm not gonna be intimidated by all of these names that by themselves don't mean much to me but if I can look at them in the context of what you just said which is they're simply referring to positions of double bonds and things it makes it a little easier now of course I think most people listening to this are gonna be like okay guys why are you going so far into this and I think the answer is these fatty acids basically make up the most important parts of our body right I mean every membrane of every cell is formulated with these and it seems that they have a profound impact on our health they do and we're fine we're just discovering that more and more and there seem to be quite differences I mean on the one hand

[00:20:28] I'm struck by the relative convergence that you can see across people consuming vastly different things so there's sort of a dampening effect if you will that the body can do where it kind of converges all sorts of inputs to modestly band it outputs but at the same time I'm struck by the differences so

[00:20:47] I'll give you one example which is in the weeds clinically but it's hopefully for the listener gives them a sense of why we want to understand this so when we do blood tests on patients one of the things we always like to do is look at the EPA DHA AAA levels in their red blood cell membranes and the laboratory will spit out what percentage is EPA DHA total saturates total monounsaturated cetera et cetera the ranges on those are not that big and most people tend to fall within them no matter how much they're eating but they can be at really different ends of those ranges so you don't have people that differ by two and three fold but people can definitely differ by twenty or thirty percent is that that's my observation is that fair that's true and that's true and because when you're talking about a blood test and specifically you're talking about a red blood cell which is the the test suite we like to do and measure the fatty acid composition of the membrane every as you alluded to every member of every cell is made up of fatty acids and

[00:21:52] I would venture to say that there is a unique suite of fatty acids a unique pattern of fatty acid for air every type of tissue and every cell it's not the same anywhere they're all a little bit different and that's because the body and the way that the wisdom of synthesizing cells each cell has its own role to play in metabolism the membrane has to have certain physical characteristics being real loose and floppy or being real stiff depending on the need of that cell and the fatty acid composition is unique to afford a certain kind of chemical the flexibility it's an amazing thing there is certainly much wider variation in the fatty acids we eat then when we see in our blood that's because the body is making the membranes from the raw materials we eat and it picks what it wants and it puts the fatty acids largely where it wants them to be when you're making a red blood cell in the bone marrow the fatty acids that are selected and then put into that membrane are taken out of the blood and the bone marrow takes what it wants you can influence it a little bit but you can't influence is like two and three fold different for most fatty acids to give you one real example that is just a great illustration of this if you take somebody who is on the lowest fat diet in the world or specifically someone who for example goes out of their way to avoid saturated fat someone who's consuming in the neighborhood of ten grams per day or less of saturated fat and you counter that with someone who's on a super high-fat diet that's eating seventy five grams a day of saturated fat or more you might see a 20% difference or a ten percent difference in the amount of saturated fat within their cell membranes as you said the body tends to be a heck of a lot smarter at putting things together than just doing it based on what's available in the diet yeah thank God that's true let's talk about why this stuff matters and let's maybe take a step back and go to back to 1980 so you do this experiment where and I guess just to set the context for listeners in 1980 is really we're witnessing the height or or I would say sort of the wave is about to crest in the major fatphobia 15-20 year run that's about to sweep over America in 1977 George

[00:24:22] McGovern presiding over the Senate Select Committee on health basically comes to the conclusion that even though the evidence against or implicating saturated fat and heart disease even though that evidence is not great it's good enough and they have to make and make a decision and the decision that's put forth at that time is that Americans should greatly reduce their intake of saturated fat I suspect that it's that decision that largely triggers an enormous interest in the type of work that you carried out as that first paper that first major experiment you led as a freshly minted PhD student which was well gosh if saturated fat is gonna do this does polyunsaturated fat do the reverse and at that point in time bill if I'm not mistaken there had already been a number of studies that had suggested that broadly speaking polyunsaturated fats mostly omega sixes actually showed a reduction in total cholesterol is that correct that's correct in fact in those days even starting back in the 70s people were taking tablespoons of vegetable oil to lower their cholesterol he was taken as a medicine what is the mechanism by which taking tablespoons and tablespoons of sunflower oil or corn oil would lower a person's cholesterol it's complicated it's it's been fairly well worked out since but what that does again we mentioned what you eat is not directly reflected in your cell membranes but when you're taking them the omega-6 is or the Omega 9s the patna mono etcetera you're replacing some saturated fatty acids in the membranes if you're reducing your saturated fat intake like McGovern at all suggested or said we should do you're reducing the amount of saturated fat to an extent in your membranes and that has a effect on the physical chemical fluidity of the membrane and there is buried within all of our cell membranes hundreds and thousands of these receptors protein that are sitting right in the middle of membranes one of these is called the LDL receptor low-density lipoprotein which is the primary lipid particle that carries cholesterol in our blood and that receptor is sitting there in the liver membrane and if you remove saturated fat or lower the amount of saturated fat in that membrane changes the properties of the membrane so that that LDL receptor is more efficient at removing and binding to and removing LDL particles from the blood that essentially lowers your cholesterol level so the cholesterol lowering comes through more lowering of the LDL than the HDL correct it's the LDL that's affected by primarily by the saturation of fats there's some effect on HDL cholesterol but most of it is LDL on the surface that would sound like a very positive thing so as tempting as it is to sort of look back at the low fat mania that swept across America 30 years ago or 40 years ago and just sort of dismiss it as buffoonery for a handful of reasons especially with the sort of substitution of what became the go-to default based on just the mechanisms and the studies of the day it was not an entirely unreasonable thing to suggest no particularly as you said McGovern committee said saturated fat should be reduced didn't say all that I think that's where the message got mixed because if you Americans had just reduced saturated fat and replaced it with mono and polyunsaturated fats we wouldn't have this problem it seemed to get replaced by sugar was that one of the big things that goes right he was take all the fat out and that was the mistake the question you were trying to ask when you did that study where patients were consuming in the end I think you said 25 grams of EPA and I guess I should before you answer this maybe let's go back and explain what EPA

[00:28:24] DHA and all these other things are again assume for a moment that there will be a large figure multiple figures in fact will be in the show notes will have the really detailed chemical ones but will also sort of have the cartoony one so let's assume that someone's looking at the cartoony figure that takes linoleic acid down to arachidonic acid and then the one that takes alpha linoleic acid down to EPA and then down to DHA can you can you explain what's happening there and let's start with the omega-6 one I suppose sure the left-hand side of the slide that I have in my mind and I think you have in your mind I'm probably having my mind a slide you've shared of me but we will make sure we use exactly whatever you were speaking from in memory now it's it's always done this way for some reason left hand the left hand is always the omega-6 so it starts to linoleic acid which is the an omega-6 fatty acid it's the principal omega-6 fatty acid in our diet it is an essential fatty acid in there with a capital e essential meaning we cannot make it it's very much like a vitamin can't be made from scratch and it is important for metabolism so it is an essential fatty acid hey we have to eat some omega-6 and what are the dominant sources of that pill vegetable oil soybean oil is probably what 80 percent of where we get our linoleic acid in in our diet so sunflower corn soybean cottonseed would be the big four right as my recollection yeah actually sunflower and safflower nowadays are not little Lake has been pretty much stripped out of those oils now there are what's called high oleic sunflower high oleic some safflower doesn't say it on the label but what's in the bottle has vastly changed from what it the natural fatty acid pattern but corn and soybean are still high omega-6 meaning 5060 percent of the fatty acids in that oil are little lake acid and linoleic is 18 so 18 carbons so it's 18 : two two double bonds omega-6 position so what happens is you eat that and a portion of it is glommed on to by certain enzymes in the liver that want to make a longer fatty acid and so they add two carbons and they get a 20 carbon fatty acid now and then they add the liver has enzymes that will add instead of having two double bonds that will now have four double bonds it goes through a three double bond molecule now we're at a four double bond when you get to this molecule it's an omega-6 family 20 carbons four double bonds that's called a rakha donek acid and that is a extremely important fatty acid in metabolism if your listeners have ever heard of prostaglandins this is the stuff of which all prostaglandins well most prostaglandins are made it's the substrate it's the beginning and it's terribly important throughout the body the liver can even take that molecule and make it even longer 22 carbons and add more double bonds up to five double bonds but there's not much of that around and we really don't know what it does I think the most important end point of omega-6 metabolism is to produce arachidonic acid 20 carbon 4 double bond the way you explain it like

[00:31:36] I think going back to the biochem anyone who's listening to this who's a college student or a med student or something I mean that's not rocket science right you elongate it with the elongation xym and then you further desaturate it take two of the saturations out and there you go so you go from 18 to 224 now arachidonic acid has a real bad rap doesn't it it is yes we'll get into it in detail but just is it safe to say that that's a bit misunderstood and that the binary view of arachidonic acid might not be the whole story that's safe to say alright I would agree with that we're getting very good so we'll come back to the the demonization of arachidonic acid let's go over to the right-hand side of the picture we both have in our mind that is hopefully about the same picture it is right now we have at the top instead of linoleic acid we have linoleic acid just add one end to the name and you get linseed oil it's most people are familiar with linseed oil that is rich in this particular fatty acid flaxseed oil is similar chia seed oil but are all sources of this linoleic acid it's in carbons again same length as the omega-6 cousin it has three double bonds instead of two and the first double bonds in the omega-3 position so it's an 18 Coulomb 3 n minus 3 fatty acid it also is essential in the same sense that the omegas six cousin when a lake is essential in the diet alpha this is called alpha linolenic acid is also essential we can't make it and it's important for metabolism and health and so the same game happens this eighteen did alpha linolenic assets we call it ala thank

[00:33:20] God ala is consumed and then again goes to the liver and is elongated in other words on the two more carbons are added and more double bonds are added to the molecule so it goes from three to four to five double bonds and now you have twenty carbon five double bond omega-3 fatty acid and that's called EPA the EPA stands for a cosa è icos a which is 20 in Greek Penta is five there's 20 carbons five double bonds and then we say ìno ik acid means it's a fatty acid so it's a 20 carbon 5 double bond molecule and that's EPA one of the most two most important of the quote omega-3 fatty acids that fatty acid then EPA can then be further converted to two more carbons again elongates the chain and desaturation replaced single bonds with double bonds so you end up with a 22 carbon 6 double bond molecule and that's called DHA which stands for doe cosa 22 hexa 6e Noack acid so it's a 22 carbon 6 double bond so EPA and DHA are the two when people talk about omega-3s that's what they mean those two fatty acids are the principal ones going forward just to make everybody's life easy we're gonna talk about ala alpha linolenic acid as the omega-3 that you get mostly out of flaxseed and chia seed I think are there any other sources of high high dose of ala well no not a high high dose but if you look at what's the principal source in the American diet it's soy beans soy bean and maybe canola to some extent has a little bit to some extent to some extent you know soy bean is such a it's the gorilla in the room when it comes to vegetable oils in America and it's about 7% of the fatty acids in soybean oil or ala ala goes through a number of steps adds a couple carbons desaturates a couple bonds and you have epa though I don't think you've stated this

[00:35:24] I do believe there's an equilibrium EPA and DHA can go back and forth between each other or is that mostly a one-way street we thought they kind of went back and forth but now I think we know based on a paper that was published a couple months ago it looks like EPA goes to DHA DHA does not would these to call it is gets retro converted in other words goes from a twenty two carbons six molecule to a twenty carbon five double bond molecule that's retro conversion going backwards we thought it happened we don't think it happens anymore it's more straightforward than what I used to yes my laminated sheets got to be updated so it's basically a la to EPA to DHA on the right-hand side of the page that's your omega-3 family and then for the sake of simplicity we're basically going from LA linoleic not linolenic linoleic acid down to a rack atonic acid AAA so LA to

[00:36:18] AAA is your big Omega six pathway we'll pause there for a moment with all of that said what was your state of understanding circa 1978 ish whenever you probably started this study about EPA and DHA which today we know a lot about and we'll talk about it but what did you know then I didn't know anything about it all I knew was we were using salmon oil and I don't remember at the beginning of our experiments to see what the effect of salmon oil was on cholesterol I'm not sure I even knew EPA and DHA existed a very simple-minded way we were asking the question we know animal fats that are solid at room temperature raised cholesterol levels and we know that vegetable oils plant fats basically plant oils lower cholesterol in their liquid at room temperature so we have animal and solid and we have vegetable plant and liquid so is it the liquid Ness that's important or is it the animal

[00:37:23] Ness animal versus platanus that's important in controlling cholesterol levels and so the uniqueness of fish oil as it comes from an animal but it's a liquid that's really a funny and cute way yet an elegant way to think about it right it's a two by two of solid versus liquid animal versus plant-derived and the fish oils sit in a unique part of that two by two as you said liquid but animal derived okay so that makes sense that was the question so is it the animal miss or the liquid miss of the oil that lowered cholesterol it turns out that fish oil lowered cholesterol and it's an animal fat so it's the liquid 'no statin not the source not whether it's a plant or an animal's it's the physical property of the oil that's the important thing but epa and DHA we really I mean I don't remember knowing anything about them until well into our study and I started reading the papers from the Greenland

[00:38:16] Eskimo studies and that's when I said oh these things have a PA and DHA you know about that now the average American today who is not supplementing with fish oil will get approximately how many grams of epa and DHA in their diet well let's talk about milligrams because it's about a roughly a hundred two hundred and fifty milligrams 0.15 grams per day is about the average epa plus DHA you mean a hundred and fifty milligrams combined epa and DHA yeah right it's about how much arachidonic we eat too as a matter of fact it's about the same scale that's kind of mind-boggling when you think about how much fat the average person eats right oh yeah oh yeah out of an 80 to 100 grams a day that 0.15 grams might be epa and DHA that's too bad historically was there a day when we consumed more of that or where is that in line with history certainly any culture that lived off seafood was eating more epa and DHA so let's use the okinawa as an example up until recently not including this generation which i've read have sort of fallen off the rails but if you go back a generation and beyond of the okinawa who obviously would have been consuming seafood daily how much epa and DHA would they have consumed they were probably in the neighborhood of one and a half maybe two grams that I 2000 milligrams maybe I mean the Eskimos when they were discovered by Dyer burg and bang in the 1970s documented six to seven grams a day the EPA and DHA as impressive as that is let's come back to your study you were giving 25 grams of epa and DHA to these subjects so this was there had probably been no I mean I assume that your rationale for doing this was if this doesn't show in effect we never need to study this again that's exactly the rationale do it once what was the magnitude of the reduction in total cholesterol LDL cholesterol and triglyceride that you saw in that study not to put you on the spot was something you did a hundred years ago but directionally was it significant not just statistically but clinically oh no it wasn't marked like cholesterol might have gone from 250 to 230 okay triglyceride mr i--'s went from about a hundred to 75 okay so that's a pretty big reduction in triglycerides it's so you know as a percent it yes yeah any other phenotypic changes you observed in those subjects or was that those were your primary endpoints that's all you had the budget to study you alluded to it earlier platelet function bleeding was something we looked at because that by that time yarn Dyer burg had published a paper in Lancet 1978 proposing that EPA was an antiplatelet or like a blood thinning fatty acid and that that is why it prevented blood clots and that is why Eskimos didn't have heart attacks that was the proposal and EPA had been shown by that time to be antiplatelet so we were very interested in the effect on bleeding and we saw a significant prolongation of an old fashioned test called the bleeding time test where we actually cut the skin and count how many seconds it takes to stop bleeding it didn't prolong it any longer than aspirin did so not outrageous except in one patient wasn't a patient was a college student that he had a marked drop in his platelet count we wrote a whole paper on this guy he had a marked drop in his platelet count a really prolonged bleeding time and we stopped him on the omega-3 diet because of that but everybody else had a just kind of a mild prolongation of bleeding which was an in him so the platelets were less reactive less likely to clot which is a good thing so that fit with the idea that these are protecting against heart attacks now if

[00:42:19] I did the math somewhat correctly on your salmon burger versus salmon oil distinction is it safe to say they were getting about 2/3 of their epa and DHA through consumption of salmon and about a third of it then through actual concentrate oil it'd probably be the reverse because let's say they were getting two four ounce servings a day of salmon and let's just ballpark that at two grams let's be generous say that's each one of those has two grams of epa

[00:42:48] DHA so there's four grams and then they were getting 20 grams from the liquid oil they drink was only 10 okay so I was the reverse so they're getting most of it in concentrate they're getting you know maybe a quarter of it or even less potentially through consumption of salmon going back to the Eskimo for a second do you have a sense from those studies what percentage of their total calories were fat and then how much of that was saturated versus poly and I'm guessing mono was not a very abundant source in the North Pole very high fat diets and I'd have to look it up but their diet was largely seafood and we're talking about seal blubber and whale meat and some fish this is pretty much what they ate you know Greenland you don't grow anything at least it's not until global warming comes along but for now today and they didn't grow anything so fruits and vegetables and grains were you could get them at an occasional store but fundamentally they were living a traditional lifestyle and eating what they killed out of the sea so they were probably 80% of their calories were fat and of that do you have a sense of how much was polyunsaturated versus saturated probably about maybe six or seven grams a day out of let's say let's say they ate 100 grams of fat a day so six or seven percent of it might have been the omega-3

[00:44:11] Pali Pali etc it's very little omega-6 and probably 70% of the fat was saturated huge amount I mean this is what was so amazing about the Eskimo studies because we had this paradigm that high fat high saturated fat high cholesterol course eating very high cholesterol diet because everything was from animals those are bad diets and yet the evidence which has been challenged nowadays but at the time the evidence was these Eskimos were virtually free of acute myocardial infarction of heart effects it just didn't make any sense which is why the couple of Danish investigators went over there and started studying them majored their plasma their food and they kind of discovered omega-3 fatty acids so was your conclusion from the study in 1980 that the high amounts of EPA and DHA and their diet were offsetting or protective to the high amounts of saturated fat or was your conclusion that maybe the saturated fat because it came from fish was somehow different from say dairy or land animals I mean how did you reconcile your experiment with this broader volume of data though you know they're obviously asking very different questions and looking at very different things I mean how did you begin to square those things for one thing again we didn't feed any blubber or any whale at whale meat or seal meat any of that really high so we were feeding salmon oil your subjects didn't really have a significant increase or change in macros really they were just basically adding an extra 25 grams of fat that happened to be polyunsaturated omega-3 but they weren't that largely true largely true so where do you go next bill so obviously well you've never stopped looking at polyunsaturated fats since so tell me how that study basically piqued your here's I think the interesting thing the way that played out is actually 1985 was a turning point year for omega-3 in that year in May of that year the New England Journal published three back-to-back omega-3 studies one was our study in giving very high doses of omega-3 and looking at effects on lipids and we showed huge drops in triglycerides as we were studying people some of the study I did was within normal volunteers we later did studies with people who had lipid disorders had very high triglyceride levels for example and we found they giving them fish oil just just knock the socks out of their truck instead of their triglycerides being 2,000 they were down to 250 it was a huge effect and how much epa and DHA did you have to give them that was the 18 to 20 gram we're still doing play in the same game we were still giving high doses of salmon oil so New England

[00:47:11] Journal publishes our paper it publishes the paper on kind of arthritis or inflammatory disease and it publishes a paper on kind of molecular biology cell the effects of EPA on what's called leukotrienes in inflammatory molecules it was a basic science paper but it was bang-bang-bang three papers in a row literally in the magazine in a row in May of 1985 that just put Omega threes in lights on the map and people got very excited about what we did subsequent to that instead of patients completely controlling their diet by that time we were able to because omega-3 supplements concentrated pills were now becoming available and so we did some studies just giving 18 capsules so we were giving 6 grams a day of epa and DHA in capsule form without changing anybody's diet what happened in that setting was very different in that setting where we didn't change their background fat intake just added Omega threes triglyceride still came down very nicely but the the conundrum was LDL cholesterol the bad cholesterol started to go up that was one of the downsides of the Omega 3 story because all of a sudden we published this it gets a lot of press American Heart Association and the and these fish oil companies that were just starting to advertise their product as cholesterol-lowering based on our earlier studies and others is not just us fish oil folks were marketing their fish oils and cholesterol-lowering products and then we show when we directly test them that they don't lower cholesterol in fact in some people at high dose they will raise cholesterol so FDA sends out all these letters to these companies and say you can't you're false advertising you can't say this anymore so that was what they call a gut punch to the industry at that point at the time was it clear whether LDL cholesterol alone was going up was a poby going up as well what other parameters of the of the lipoproteins were changing LDL cholesterol and april-b there were more particles how much were they going up based on just this six grams of additional EPA and they might have gone from an LDL of 120 to 140 150 that's amazing I mean we're talking about six additional grams of a very specific type of fat having that much of an impact on

[00:49:40] LDL cholesterol and presumably as you said the particle number or a poby so mechanistically what do you think was happening there that's been hard to figure out but more recent studies have suggested that there is actually in effect primarily of the DHA component on LDL receptor activity it actually can slow down the action of LDL receptors so the LDL receptors are not removing LDL particles from the blood as fast as they used to be so the blood levels go up so it's an effect on clear it's not an effect it's not an effect on production in the previous example were you saying that the part of the saturated fat issue on clearance because there's obviously a big effect of saturated fat on production but you're saying that saturated fat on clearance was altering membrane permeability and the LDL receptor was there for losing efficacy yeah right that's right I think we're current understanding of why saturated fats raise cholesterol raise LDL now here several years later we kind of begin to see evidence that fish oil and again I want to emphasize this is in people that have high triglyceride levels this is not just a normal people taking one fish oil pill this is a complete layout of that room were six grams a day of epa DHA in people with elevated triglycerides in that setting the LDL and april-b went up now there's another little wrinkle here bill which is if you're gonna take people that have triglycerides that are that high how many of them are insulin resistant or have metabolic syndrome as the underlying disease state versus how many of them are metabolically very healthy but have a hypertriglyceridemia a familial I think that's a Friedreich's and Levy Lee's type 3 but I'm probably wrong on that but how many of them are genetically seeing this high triglyceride in the context of perfect metabolic health versus metabolically ill yeah that's a good question and I'd have to look back I mean you write about

[00:51:40] Frederickson types it's not type 3 type 4 which is the isolated hypertriglyceridemia person and there's type 2b which is high triglycerides Anna you know in both of those settings the LDL cholesterol went up we were never heard of metabolic syndrome in the mid 80s we'd have to look back to you know what was their glucose level and I'm sure we measured it I'm sure we measured their blood pressure and their body weight but other metrics of the metabolic syndrome weren't even crossing our minds in those days so it's hard to say that's interesting but today the largest dose of EPA that is given pharmacologically is about four grams is that correct four grams isn't that indicated primarily for people with elevated triglycerides it's indicated for people with very high triglycerides so we got two levels of high triglycerides you've got garden-variety high triglycerides which is maybe 200 so a normal triglyceride maybe 150 yeah I mean that's not optimal but that's kind of normal 200 to 500 is what we call hypertriglyceridemia and over 500 is now very high triglycerides and there's kind of a bright white line the FDA indicated when the first omega-3 drug was approved it was Lovaza or ohmic or and it was approved by the FDA for treating triglycerides over 500 not under 500 so over 500 and it was proved at this dose of four grams a day because that's the dose that the company did the studies at they could get better triglyceride lowering with higher doses but now you're talking six or eight pills a day and it becomes totally impractical so there's a compromise let's make the dose four grams a day it does lower triglycerides and it works to some extent and so that's what the FDA approved and so FDA has now set four grams as the standard dose their product is it any different from what one buys over-the-counter that product that I was just talking about what's called Lovaza and it's now about 85% epa plus DHA it's ethyl esters you can buy over-the-counter or dietary supplement essential more accurately dietary supplements that have that much epa and

[00:54:04] DHA as ethyl esters in one pill typically you have to buy the pill is not a 1 gram pill so maybe we're going to get into this the confusion about a thousand milligrams of fish oil but a the standard drug the Lovaza drug is 1000 milligram capsule of which 850 or 85 percent is epa and DHA oh yeah no we should definitely cover that now so if you go on em is I mean I'll just share my bias talked about it before the two brands I typically recommend to patients or Carlson's and Nordic

[00:54:39] Naturals and I'm sure there were several brands out there that are quite reputable on a hot O'Connor at the New York Times wrote a story on this probably four or five years ago looking at lots of different brands of fish oil and it was looking to basically see how many of these were made at GMP standard how many of them actually had in them what they said they contain from a

[00:55:01] Content perspective what was the level of contaminant all sorts of variables but for whatever reason again those two brands I've just gotten to know and I've gotten to trust but you still have to read the label very carefully because one these are very large capsules to the entirety of the capsule is not EPA and

[00:55:18] DHA so we tend to think about how much epa and DHA we want and we then have to fit a reverse-engineer it out of the capsules if you're taking 2,000 milligrams of a fish oil and let's say 1600 of that is true epa and DHA which is 80% that's not an uncommon finding what's the other 400 milligrams it would be a mixture of some monounsaturated and some polyunsaturated get a general standard fatty acid you'd find in most foods it's just a very small fraction of what's in the fish oil particularly a fish oil concentrate now am I being paranoid about this stuff or do you think that most of these things that are sold as dietary supplements are reasonably safe or what is your view on that I don't have a problem with dietary supplements I think that the vast majority of them when they've done consumer reports testing they've done or twice in my memory their final conclusion is generally the products have pretty much as much epa and DHA as they say and with some some variation and they're free of toxins and any meaningful levels of environmental pollutants so I don't have a problem with if the challenge is if you're gonna try and get four grams a day of epa DHA which or three and a half grams is really what four capsules of Lovaza would give you because it's again 85% so you're gonna be taking a whole lot of dietary supplement of pills because most pills are not that concentrate typically nowadays you can find very highly concentrated products and it the line between a drug and a dietary supplements getting a little bit fuzzy which is something some of the the drug manufacturers are pointing out more and more loudly that there's a lot of products that are being sold as dietary supplements that fundamentally have the same chemical composition as fda-approved drugs there's gonna be a fight about this coming on but the processing of omega-3 rich oils has advanced tremendously over the last 20-30 years and they can really concentrate these take a raw fish oil which might have 30% of its fatty acids

[00:57:29] EPA and DHA and you do lots of processing to get rid of all the other fatty acids and all you have left is EPA DHA and your really highly concentrated and that's not all that different than the composition of some of these drugs it's gonna be confusing I think to the consumer bill what is our current understanding of the health benefits of

[00:57:49] EPA specifically I want to actually talk about this and then do the same thing on DHA and then do the same thing on our racket onic acid so cover these three end-products of the omega-3 and omega-6 pathways but let's come back to omega-3 because it pardon me to EPA because that's sort of where we got off on this little side tangent today is the consensus view that EPA is a quote-unquote heart healthy oil yes and yeah you could say the same it would for

[00:58:19] DHA in my view but yeah EPA is heart healthy it's it's mechanisms by which it is heart healthy are multiple and they include being converted into against some metabolites some prostaglandin type molecules that make the platelets the blood platelets less likely they get sticky and so there's a reduced it's kind of like taking aspirin without some of the side effects of aspirin so that's one of the arms of the benefit the EPA is also able to produce a whole series of molecules with that we call resolve ins like because they resolve inflammation so they're kind of anti-inflammatory in that sense they also when you an EPA becomes incorporated into cell membranes it changes the flexibility the fluidity of the membrane just because of its own physical properties and that changes the way the enzymes that live in the membranes work in such ways that makes the cellular metabolism run more smoothly I mean to try to simplify this those are really primary ways that EPA I think is heart-healthy we've only had one big study with EPA only free of DHA let's talk about that one now and then I want to come into potential risks of EPA and then I want to circle back to DHA but let's talk about the EPA only study what was the patient population what was the dose and what was the objective of the study the study was called to reduce it which was an acronym as they all are for for something reduce it was the name of the study the product was called vicita like vascular EPA the ASC EPA a company that makes the drugs called Ameren and the way the study was done they gave four grams a day of this EPA it's EPA ethyl ester so it's a very purified EPA that has a FL ester which is the typical way that they used they concentrate omega-3 years nowadays four grams a day versus the four grams of a mineral oil placebo which has had some controversy as to whether that's a real placebo or not roughly 8,000 patients who all were on statin drugs to control their cholesterol levels and they all still had triglycerides between two and five hundred roughly 150 to 500 so triglycerides were still elevated even though they were on a statin cholesterol

[01:00:48] LDL cholesterol was roughly in the 70s so there was low healthy levels of LDL they also had to have either a history of heart disease or some other risk factors and like having diabetes for example was another way you could get in so if you met that criteria that kind of patient you were given either four grams of placebo or four grams of VAS SEPA do we know what fraction of those patients were metabolically ill I assume most of them were and I know the studies only about a year and a half old right I mean

[01:01:19] I remember this when this came well it was reported in November so six months ago so why don't ya so almost a year but okay that's time I've lost track of time time flies right exactly but how many of these people were sort of metabolically super healthy but just happen to have these genetic triglyceride elevations nobody checked in the study what any kind of they may be someday they probably have blood for them and they'll check things later but as a recruitment strategy they just took people who met those criteria you you're on a statin you have triglycerides between 150 and 500 and you've got some other risk factors for heart disease and that's it and you're in what did the studies show because it sure made a lot of headlines it should have and it did it showed a 25% reduction in risk for overall cardiovascular events over about a four or five year period which is not that long and it was effective across you know myocardial infarction need for angioplasty a variety of different cardiovascular unfortunate outcomes so it was a big hit it was really for the last 15 years we've been searching for other lipid lowering drugs that or other other drugs that will improve the outcomes over statins the statins have been established in the 80s and 90s and 2000's is very a very effective and reducing risk for heart disease but there's still people even on a statin that still have events cardiac event so it that's called residual risk they have leftover risk so what do we do for that and they there's probably even ten or fifteen drugs that have been tested to try to improve upon a statin really none of them have worked without going into all the details but this one pure

[01:03:03] EPA worked and it worked great and it worked with virtually no side effects and you can take it with any other medications isn't how many drug drug interactions I think it was a big hit and well deserved I should mention the name that the trade name of the drug is Vash SEPA the generic name is called I

[01:03:26] Cosa pent ethyl two words and this spell starts with an i I cos a a Co so that is it's it's really just a flipping around of the spelling of Khosla pentanoic acid or EPA now built one of the issues with this study of course is the inclusion criteria assumes that the patients have very high triglycerides I must have received 12 emails in the span of a day from patients of mine saying hey should

[01:03:52] I be taking this to which my answer was well your triglycerides are 86 so I'm gonna go with no on that be cuz I can't infer that the mechanism by which this worked in these patients is going to have a benefit in you do you know if there's any plans to repeat that study or a study like it in a normal triglyceride population I don't I know that what's what's fundamentally being reproduced is the same type of patient but with a ETA plus DHA product why was that study done with only an EPA versus a combined well in the late 80s a EPA only drug was approved in Japan called eepa dil which is essentially that it's exactly the same thing as vas sebum in the Japanese back in the 1980s believe that it was EPA that was the active agent in fish oils so a drug company called Machida developed an EPA drug and they got it approved and they've been using that EPA drug for years and years and the jelous trial which was done published in 2007 which was a Japanese Omega 3 trial used this product called epidemic olive as

[01:05:13] SEPA and it was successful this company in Ireland with Ameren has the same molecule essentially I think they're trying to carve out a unique niche in the omega-3 world that they can get an approved drug EPA plus DHA has already approved that's Lovaza ohmic or they said well let's just try the EPA part see what that does and it works well what nobody's ever done and nobody is dumb at doing yet is the only a DHA only study what is your take on this from two standpoints the first is if you can speculate for a moment do you believe that EPA and DHA from a cardiovascular standpoint are as beneficial or have benefit in people with normal triglycerides yes I don't think they make I don't think the benefit the cardiovascular benefit comes from lowering triglycerides in fact in this study the reduce of study I just talked about with EPA triglycerides were lowered 15% maybe you know it was not a huge drop in triglycerides by any means what was the reduction in LDL C&A poby I don't recall yeah virtually no change so unlike pcsk9 inhibitors which really have had the biggest impact on residual risk and cardiovascular disease over the past five years very similar population to what you've described in 4ei more so than Odyssey where they started with patients already maximally statin eyes these patients was independent of their triglyceride level but they had to be sort of maximally sat and eyes I think they came in with an average LDL cholesterol of 74 milligrams per deciliter and in a very short period of time you know something to the neighborhood of two and a half years saw an amazing event risk reduction but the event risk reduction in reduce it was greater than the pcsk9 studies yeah it was a longer study wasn't it about five years in reduce yeah right right yeah and Fourier was like 2.2 and Odyssey was about 2.4 which again I think all of those are amazing I'm not saying that to be one up on reduce it or one down I actually just I think most people don't understand the time course of cardiovascular disease well enough to appreciate the fact that you can take a disease that is a time course disease that starts at birth and in somewhere between two years and five years actually reduce events it shouldn't happen and in fact I remember I don't know if I actually set it out loud it would be great if I did because I could go back and you know maybe someone would remember but but I certainly remember thinking for he is going to fail because not that I didn't have faith in the mechanism of pcsk9 inhibition but because I simply didn't think you could bend the arc of a disease like cardiovascular disease in two years on a group of patients who had an LDL cholesterol in the 70s that just struck me as impossible it is really quite amazing that all of these things work and in some ways it's even more amazing frankly that just pure EPA could have this effect which again I'm bringing you back to the question that I keep interrupting we start to answer I apologize why in the world would four grams of EPA reduce events especially as you said when it's not the obvious mechanism of hey we're gonna drop triglycerides which all things equal should drop a poby and by the way you're seeing a greater magnitude of event reduction than you're seeing with aspirin so the pure anti platelet effect also seems a bit counterintuitive what else do you think is going on here right right it's not enough whatever role inflammation and it's such a a slippery word that's thrown around so much but EPA definitely gives rise to molecules that are pro of resolution of inflammation so inflammation starts the EPA will will shut it down to whatever extent a cardiovascular event is is precipitated by an inflammatory event the omega-3 EPA could could participate in that it could stop it the Omega EPA could also play a role in even the control of the heart rate the heart rate variability can be reduced I'm not sure in this study they measured it we've done studies with omega-3 showing heart rate variability which is a marker of autonomic nervous system control of the heart is improved so that's another piece of the puzzle it could just be several different things that in itself they add up and they multiple and you said heart rate variability improved before that you said reduce but I think you mean improved or increased right is that correct yeah right do you recall if in reduce it they measured other cytokines inflammatory cytokines beyond the usual suspects like did they look at the all of the suite of interleukins and things like that was that published in the original study so presumably as you said they've got a bio Bank that may be able to look at other markers of what was the signature of this event reduction going down this path you just described you'd be great to see what happened to il-1 il-6 TNF you know if you look at all of these other things that could be playing a role in the inflammatory component of atherosclerosis that would be interesting to see right because then it would give more confidence that this is this has broader applicability than just people with sky-high triglycerides back again to the inclusion criteria these are not sky-high triglycerides and this is not triglycerides over 500 these are not people at risk for pancreatitis this is much more garden-variety hypertriglyceridemia I don't know in my practice bill one 150 to 500 is sky-high okay well I guess I'm used to hearing you know type you know five hundred thousand two thousand you know it's people have that but that's the place the Omega threes first got their approval in that very high triglyceride world and so when we bump it down to under five hundred to me it seems like kind of garden-variety but but you're right well but that's a fair point I mean that it's certainly representative of the US population did that study did it look at how much of that EPA converted to DHA in other words one of the advantages presumably of giving mega dose of EPA versus mega dose of DHA is you're higher up the food chain so presumably you're covering any benefit that's unique to EPA if you believe there may be one and then you're also transmitting into DHA and getting that or do you believe that all of the benefits of EPA are transmitted through

[01:11:49] DHA I think it's probably all the benefits of EPA are transmitted through EPA not through conversion it not through the conversion to DHA no no in fact when you look at a couple of a couple of papers looked at the effects of giving pure EPA four grams on on red-blood-cell DHA levels for example and DHA levels actually go down a little bit

[01:12:15] EPA goes up of course you're feeding EPA but the DHA component in the red cell membrane goes down or or another study stays the same but doesn't grow up you're not not increasing DHA tissue levels that's really interesting so in other words if EPA is being converted to DHA which I assume we still think it is it's not necessarily I mean it's just increasing the substrate pool of DHA but not necessarily the incorporation into cell membranes right right that's interesting and that actually explains I think some of what I guess I would see when I look at people's laboratory values while we're on this topic if I consumed staggering amounts of flaxseed oil by the way a friend of mine once gave me a recipe to make flaxseed tea and I a it tasted really good when I had it at her place so part of it is just it was really amazing and part of it is the recipe was so complicated that I took pride in like taking two days to make a vat of flaxseed tea that could feed a small village I was never able to get it quite right but let's assume I could get it right and I could consume a near infinite amount of flaxseed oil could that amount of ala ever give me sufficient enough substrate epa and DHA to rival what we're talking about in these supplemental doses of four grams no it's never when people have tried giving 12 grams of ala not just flaxseed oil is straight la yeah you don't even get me might take an EPA level of 1% in a red cell and maybe drive it to 2% there's two questions I have and I hope

[01:13:58] I'm going to remember the second one is there a risk that looking at the red blood cell which of course is the most obvious and easy sell for us to access the membrane in is there a risk we're missing something that's not occurring in cells that we can't access like as easily we can't look at the membrane of adipose cells or muscle cells and we typically even though it would be just as easy to look at leukocytes I assume we don't look at them at least clinically or commercially do we run the risk of just looking at one one pony here right everything's compromised so the red cell is the easiest cell type to get at leukocytes are not that easy to get at correction eta for releases or something like a clinical lab right right just a clinical lab lab setting it's very difficult red cells are thrown away by the gallon day by day just because you all you really wanted was the plasma right so you the red cells go to the bottom and you take the plasma off and they throw them away red cells are we've shown red cells correlate with quite a few other tissues in terms of the omega-3 levels so they are a good reflection of other tissues probably the only one that's the least reflective of is the brain at least in the adult it's heart and he asked the composition of the brain yeah I don't think anyone's gonna sign up for the brain biopsy so what are some of the tissues that you've seen high correlation with with RBC well what we did it originally with the heart using heart transplant patients who were being followed up every six months with a heart biopsy to see how their heart was doing of course and we were able to get their red cells and the heart biopsy and measure the omega-3 content and show the nice correlation to higher the omega-3 and the red cell the higher the omega-3 in the heart other people have done this too and you can do it animals of course yeah lots of tissue is there is there a high correlation with liver as well as myocyte skeletal myocytes right muscle and liver and yes these small intestine large intestine Wow okay we'll make sure we include all these papers bill as well in the show notes because this is that's actually something I've just been too lazy to personally go back and check it's on my list of 2,000 things I want to go and check and that's one of them is I always wanted to go back and look at what the association between RBC membrane level was and other tissues the other question

[01:16:05] I had was what are the we've kind of glossed over it because it's a little bit of a stepchild but what are some of the direct benefits if any of ala by itself because you just noted that it's not that having all the ala in the world is not really meaningful to conversion to EPA so if there's benefit to ala it needs to be through ala right we don't really know there's certainly some hints in some of the population epidemiologic studies that higher ala and takes presumably independent of epa

[01:16:35] DHA intake is associated with reduced risk for disease so that's that's a good thing I have no problem with ala I just have a problem with it being a substitute for fish oils or omega-3 long-chain omega-3 because it doesn't but ala itself I mean I don't think it's a bad idea to take ala products rich rich oils as well as take fish oils but we don't really know the mechanism but I think there's probably going to be some metabolites of ala itself and in the same sense that there are prostaglandins leukotrienes and other metabolites from epa and DHA there probably are from ala too that are doing things we don't know about it's all dark on the inside so we don't really quite know what's going on I think there's gonna be benefit but it's it's not because it's converted to EPA and DHA as far as we know and speaking of which now let's talk let's let's go down the bottom of that chain we've talked about EPA let's talk about DHA as you said we haven't had the study that takes four grams of DHA administers it in either a high low or normal triglyceride population but based on studies that have looked at high doses combined and maybe trying to contrast with high dose EPA studies plus looking at all the animal and mechanistic studies what is your best guess as to what a high dose of DHA is doing in a sense much the same thing as EPA there are parallel mirror image molecules being made what DHA s are called instead of resolving czar called protectants these are the metabolites that are very active and anti-inflammatory processes

[01:18:14] DHA will improve platelet function make platelets less sticky the same way that EPA does we did different mechanism for the same outcome DHA is probably better at actually lowering triglycerides and raising HDL than EPA is so there could be actually a lipoprotein benefit there although DHA does raise particularly in people or hypertriglyceridemia taking fairly high doses of DHA there will be an LDL raising effect whether that's a bad thing or not nobody knows but it's been observed and that's one of the differences between an EPA only product and a EPA plus DHA is there have been folks who've been trying to say that the

[01:18:58] EPA plus DHA products are not good for you because they have DHA which can raise LDL but I think that's a big stretch and this is a lot of caveats but nevertheless that's part of some marketing programs now which I find unfortunate the DHA is certainly if you look at biology at the membranes of any of our membranes red cells or heart DHA is by far the most common much higher levels of DHA like the red cell 85% and 15% if you look at the total of epa plus th yeah I usually think of it in terms of absolute so I know I was looking at my labs from my drawing my labs every once in a while I think the last check was a few weeks ago and my my red blood cell

[01:19:41] EPA level was about 2.2 percent and DHA level was about 8 percent so it's a comparable to what you're saying for a total of about you know a little over 10 percent 10 to 11 percent at what point do you worry is it too high we really haven't seen any adverse effects in higher doses and there are major international bodies that are saying up to 5 or 6 grams a day of EPA DHA is don't no problem and five or six grams of EPA would give you what level in the

[01:20:11] RBC the highest level I've ever seen in RBC's about I've had a patient who was just taking this stuff by the truckload and which means he was probably taking about three grams a day maybe four I'm not sure but you know was sitting there at about 16% EPA plus DHA and the red blood cell is that we have seen higher but that is very that guys flying 99.9% percentile we've seen people over 20 who are not taking fish oil which is pretty so there's some interesting biology what do you think's going on in there how is that happening they're just eating a lot of fish or this particular lady I'm thinking of was when we interviewed her said yeah sheets babies fish once a week you know some salmon but it's not like she's not doing anything eskimo and she wasn't taking a supplement she was a woman of Indian East Indian extraction and drank a lot of the thing that really stood out she drank a lot of kefir liquid yogurt but what in the world that would have to do with omega-3 I have no idea so we don't know what happened to her why she's that way and there's other people that have been up that level if I think it's just genetic I mean that's that's a cop-out word I know I know it is funny but I was just about to say the ubiquitous cop out of genetic but I've absolutely seen patients who eat one serving of fish a week and need four mega EPA DHA and it's the same brand so it's not a brand issue they'll take a you know mega dose four capsules a night of the big stuff and you might get them up to 7% and then I've seen other people who eat fish twice a week and they walk around at 9% you're seeing this as well and you're equally stumped by it Yeah right yeah we published a paper recently looking at in something like 3500 people that are submitted blood to us and have told us how much oily fish they eat and whether they take a supplement or not that's all we asked and we found out that the group that has the 50/50 chance of an eight percent omega-3 index we're eating free reported eating three oily fish meals a week and taking a supplement but below that the chances of having eight percent or diminish two minutes but there's even within the category of people that were not taking any supplements and eating maybe 101 fish meal a week there were some people that had 8% it's just they're real outliers there's a tremendous variability in the level in the blood compared to what's in the diet bill just based on your knowledge around this and

[01:22:43] I we haven't fully finished the DHA stuff so with that caveat do you have a recommendation for physicians or patients who are monitoring EPA and DHA levels and red blood cells for a target I mean the lab that I use I think gives a range of 8 to 10 percent is ideal do you have a view on this we think and what we call the omega-3 index which is

[01:23:07] EPA plus DHA in red cell membranes our target is 8 to 12 percent just that's a range we think is the healthy range average American is around 5% maybe four or five percent twice as high as normal I've seen people at 2% which are obviously people who don't supplement and don't eat fish but I've also seen people who don't supplement donate fish and they're at five to six percent which again comes back to this sort of question of of the role of genetics and in driving this so let's come back to

[01:23:38] DHA for a moment a few years ago there was certainly a little bit of hoopla around the neuroprotective benefits of DHA what is this state of the art and science around that particular question so it begins with the observation that the brain and the retina which is really just an extension of the brain or very rich in DHA virtually no EPA in the brain beginning with that you had the logical conclusion is the DHA is important in the brain and the eye because they're there people have then tried to jump to the conclusion that therefore if you give more DHA you're gonna get better brain health and better eye health well that's not necessarily panned out particularly like in depression studies that's the most clear area at the moment where folks have tried to give high DHA products to try to affect depressive symptoms and they don't really work the products that seem to work to actually have an effect on depressive symptoms are ones that are richer in EPA and the

[01:24:40] DHA and you know when so you look at a meta-analysis like a compilation of lots of different studies the positive ones are the ones that are richer in EPA but there's no EPA in the brain the logic was that if the meat of the brain has got DHA and at the actual physical flesh of the brain is DHA with in DHA should be given and it would be beneficial but that's that's not a logical assumption I think what's happening is EPA is probably providing some unique and anti-inflammatory effects in in the brain circulation that's affecting because we don't understand depression at all but it's somehow affecting the expression of depressive symptoms like DHA doesn't I can't say that DHA is the brain omega-3 and EPA is the heart omega-3 I don't think that's true I don't think we can at this point say one of them is better than the other for any given system they come together in nature in all fish that provide that contain epa and DHA has both of them it's not 50/50 it's usually sixty forty or forty sixty in in terms of ratio epa and DHA so i think that's the best thing to do is to get both of them at this point for any condition all conditions because you've done a PhD in nutrition i'm going to ask you a nutrition question if you recommend fish for people to eat if someone says look i want to get as much of the epa DHA as I can through my food intake as opposed to supplement intake then being mindful of fish that contain toxins particularly mercury what's the best yield for safety and then high quantity of epa DHA

[01:26:20] I mean salmon seems to be at the top of that intersection right is there other fish you'd put there sardines herring mackerel almost all their oily fish are gonna have high epa levels so simply because they have high oil does it have fat in their flesh and their tissues there's really only about four or five fish that are because the mercury have a mercury concern and their fish that are really very rarely eaten tilefish swordfish king mackerel and shark so those are the ones that everybody agrees that pregnant women lactating women should not eat because they affect neuro development of the brain there's anecdotal stories of people eating vast amounts of tuna and getting high levels of mercury and sure i'm sure that can happen but by and large albacore tuna for example is twice as much epa and DHA is chunk light tuna it's more expensive so it's a great source of epa DHA it has more mercury than chunk light tuna has I think people get that balanced way out of whack they're far more concerned about meniscal amounts of mercury and they will forgo the good benefits of EPA and DHA and a food like like albacore tuna white tuna because they're afraid of the small amount of a toxin the benefits of eating fish even if there's some mercury in it far outweigh the downside of the mercury yeah I probably need to go a little further down this rabbit hole but but again this is another example where I've seen amazing individual variability I've seen people who eat three servings of tuna a week who have a mercury level below 10 you know on a laboratory assay like LabCorp where the upper limit of normal is 15 and there are people that walk around at 10 so they're perfectly fine and they're eating tuna three times a week and then

[01:28:14] I've seen people who consume tuna twice a month and they're right at the upper limits there's a lab called Quicksilver that we use to further scratch it a little bit and look at the inorganic and the organic but one of the things we've learned through that is clearance matters a lot in fact clearance seems to matter at least as much maybe not surprisingly as intake so the the

[01:28:36] Quicksilver test looks at the hair urine blood it basically quantifies how they're clearing inorganic and organic and then you get a sense and then you're measuring organic and inorganic so you're getting a sense of is this coming in through food is this coming in through you know the environment but yeah it's another one of those things that's complicated I mean I my general rule and advice to patients is is sort of salmon and small baitfish is sort of open field running and if you're gonna go haywire on tuna which I could do I could eat tuna every day I love it so much I don't you're probably best to at least measure your levels but to your point maybe we don't know exactly what the toxicity curve looks like it's it's worth exploring I do want to come back to something else on the omega-3 broad front which is there are a handful of studies I sort of I've seen one of them but I believe there are others I think one of them was the Honolulu Heart Study or something about this has got to be over 20 years old now that actually looked at a reduced amount of lung cancer in smokers who had high omega-3 levels am I getting that right I've not seen that I'd like to see that but I've seen papers recently they're looking at smokers as some of the adverse effects of smoking seemed to be mitigated by a high omega-3 intake sort of the same idea it's the same idea yeah and maybe

[01:30:01] I'm just not remembering the study correctly but I it sort of goes down this theme of there was a protective benefit of high amounts of epa and DHA let's pivot back over now to the other side of the axis so we talked about linoleic acid or LA as an essential fatty acid I believe you said we get the lion's share of it from soybean and corn oil correct right linoleic acid you described through the process of elongation desaturation ultimately comes arachidonic acid how did it RAC atonic acid get such a bad name is that is that

[01:30:38] Albury see that we have to thank for that well partly Barry partly Bill Lansford Lee Artemis samaa palace the way I look at it is if we think back to the 1960s and 70s we had this thing called the P to s ratio in oils I'm do you remember that pollito saturates right for heart health you want to eat high P to s ratio foods oils the ratio mentality was that was the idea and that made sense we want less saturated fat more polyunsaturated fat was good for your health good for your heart we move a couple decades in now we have the omega sixes in the omega 3s and we know that they eat the L little lake and ala and make three side compete with each other for enzymes to metabolize up to other EPA's and arachidonic and so it's a competition there so people like ratios black and white you know black at white hat arachidonic acid does give rise to several or many in pro-inflammatory compounds didn't no question it's a good thing it's what it's supposed to do the concern is does that get out of whack and does it go on and on and on and never get resolved but so arachidonic got this black hat idea it's the pro-inflammatory woman and an epa and

[01:31:53] DHA or the anti-inflammatory one so list is doing omega-6 to omega-3 ratio i have a lot of problems with a ratio i think it doesn't make any sense partly because it presumes that the omega sixes actually are bad and they really aren't the evidence now coming out from large meta analyses where people are and we were part of this study where they looked at plasma linoleic acid levels or blood linoleic acid levels omega-6 levels in the blood and arachidonic levels in the blood and they they measured it in thousands and thousands of people and they followed them for the development of heart disease and diabetes over between five and thirty years and a very clear signal that the higher the level of linoleic acid meaning the more you eat that's the only way you can raise it is by eating more the higher the level of linoleic acid the blood the lower the risk of heart disease the lower the risk of myocardial infarction the lower the risk of diabetes and arachidonic acid levels were unrelated to either of those outcomes it was neutral it wasn't higher or lower it didn't make any difference so what's the correlation between arachidonic acid level and linoleic acid level and what's the correlation between arachidonic acid level and ingested linoleic acid virtually none even though we know arachidonic can be made from little like a so only less than 1% of the lentil lake we eat gets conveyed into arachidonic very little of it's made made it and you may have already said this and I was too busy trying to think about something you previously said but just as a la conversion to EPA is virtually irrelevant is that a similar statement for LA conversion to a the same idea when the people have given you no radioactive tracers and a measured how much actually goes from LA to a a very good less than a percent very little say and people have also looked at you know if you give a huge dose of

[01:33:54] LA in the diet and then you measure the effect on a plasma arachidonic no effect if you completely strip the diet for you know weeks and weeks of LA Iraq and I levels don't go down this doesn't respond so rack adonys very tightly controlled and it's not driven by a linoleic acid while we're on the subject of ratios bill one of the other ratios that people like to talk about is the ratio of AAA to EPA and AAA to DHA do you put that in the same category of helpfulness as total omega-3 to total omega-6 or it's a little bit better one of the problems with the total omega-6 to omega-3 is it doesn't define what the fatty acids are right because the omega-3 can be dominated by ala which is what it is that number could be dwarfed by how much is epa and DHA correct right and the same on the omega-6 side there's seven different omega-6 fatty acids you throw into that recipe which one we talking about and so that's a problem the fact that you can have the same ratio of EPA or of omega-6 to omega-3 with very high levels of omega-6 and omega-3 or very low levels of omega-6 and omega-3 same ratio doesn't make any sense and it's very hard to the other problem is its presumes that the omega-6 is bad and the omega-3 is good I love a quote I read somewhere then what's it said the guy said what's the point of the amazing so maybe through ratio it's good vs. good so why are we doing this eh-eh EPA ratio is is better because at least defines which fatty acids you're talking about that's good I don't think it's any more informative it leaves out

[01:35:43] DHA completely which i think is unfortunate again it's a ratio that presumes arachidonic bad and I don't think we can presume that because the Ragged donate is not only made into pro-inflammatory it's made into anti-inflammatory molecules to what drives that balance first of all what are the top two or three things that drive the pool of arachidonic acid and then secondly what are the top two or three things that drive its destination either pro or anti-inflammatory that's tough to say I don't know what controls arachidonic levels substrate levels to begin with that's that's kind of amazing right some that you make the tissues get incorporated with certain amount of arachidonic and the body likes a certain level and it's released from membranes when you have a stressor of some kind and you make prostaglandins and but there are like a hundred different metabolites you get made from these molecules and you it's almost virtually impossible to study all them in vivo together you can take one particular metabolite and sprinkle it on a cell in a test tube and see what it does and then write a paper on it but it may have nothing to do with reality because in reality you've got a hundred different molecules all banging on the door fighting with each other one balancing the other it's it's an incredible dance that you can't replicate outside of the body and people draw these conclusions about this fatty acids bad and that fatty acids good based on really naive views I think of the complexity of the biology what's most of compelling is let's look at blood levels of fatty acids and who's actually having diseases who's getting sick I mean I don't care about looking at metabolic charts and what pathway intersects with what pathway or competes that's swell but at the end of the day if omega-6 levels are high and that's associated with reduced risk for diabetes and heart disease that's a very powerful testimony to meet the omega sixes are good when you say omega-6 in that situation is the bulk of it made up through LA or is it a proxy metric of LA plus a a la because that's what we eat again we eat you know on average we eat maybe fifteen grams a day of LA and we eat about a tenth of a gram a day of arachidonic you have a bit of a contrarian view of the sort of plant oils the the canola's the SAP flowers and the sunflowers etc many people view these as sort of unhealthy oils do you view any of those oils when consumed in the quantities that Americans consume them as unhealthy I thought you were going to say people when you talk about canola and olive oil people think those are great is there mono they're mono rich oils well yeah that's actually funny the canola and the safflower at least in its original form and olive oil are virtually indistinguishable by mac by fatty acid composition well canola and olive yeah but in a safflower was like 77% linoleic acid originally and now it's down to like 15% right and isn't it largely boosted in omega monounsaturated no mo Meghan I don't see right they call them high mono

[01:39:06] Y mono staff and high mono sunflower and I think those are a problem I'm sorry to see that happening I know what's happening because partly because the mega six fatty acids are unstable or more likely to go rancid so they like to get rid of them which led to the whole trans fatty acid thing but we're not gonna go there so we're reducing omega-6 levels in our oils which is going to reduce them in our blood which in if the evidence is pointing the right direction that's going to show lead to an increased risk for these major diseases listen there a day when we really didn't have much omega-6 in our diet sure isn't it a relatively recent thing like more than a few hundred years ago wouldn't we have only been consuming saturated and monounsaturated fats primarily in addition to EPA's and DHA right right we didn't live very long either well is that really true though I mean the mortality curve had more to do with infectious diseases infant mortality and things like that but we certainly weren't dying the chronic diseases either do you are you suggesting that the addition of plant seed oils is protective against the things that were killing us or are we surviving despite them I don't know what the case is I know that people have shown huge increases in linoleic acid intake over the 20th century they do that with the intent of scaring people look at how unnatural this is but then you look at death rates from heart disease heart disease rates as the levels of LA go up they seem to go down although it's so hard to look at another problem with that type of data is that you know you superimpose the use of statins and advanced cardiac life support and defend smoking yeah so I I think it's very difficult to do that but if we look at the literature as far as what we can say I mean it seems that we're on more stable ground saying that

[01:41:04] EPA and DHA are probably protective I'm still at a bit of a loss as to what to say about omega-6 I mean on a personal level I just find them kind of disgusting if I'm gonna be brutally honest like I just think they're disgusting oils like I think they taste like crap oh but but that's just my taste right like I just I think canola safflower sunflower corn oil they just taste gross to me but I think that's because I've just acquired a taste for saturated fat and monounsaturated fat over time oh well yeah that could be it most it is oil it's incorporated in salad dressings well that's one point like even like I don't know the last time I had a salad dressing out of a bottle because it just tastes disgusting relative to being able to put real olive oil on and by the way we should actually say most the time when you buy olive oil you're not really getting olive oil right I mean it's a very very diluted hot little hill so but assuming you're getting real olive oil which actually has kind of a strong taste to it away you go I don't like to get too far down the omega-6 pathway other than to say I don't think it's the evil that people think it is and the problem is that we need to get more epa and DHA in our diet not necessarily get all hung up on omega-6 yeah it seems to me that that's the bigger place to move the needle is if you can increase the epa and DHA in your diet the body's ability to buffer high amounts of LA seems impressive is that a fair statement I don't know about the second half I don't know that needs to be buffered maybe buffer is the wrong word again I think I use this term of like a reducing function or you know a capacitor like in a circuit it just seems like you can have people like I consume virtually no when none of those seed oils like meaning I probably consume 1/10 of what the average person does because I again I just don't eat many processed foods and I don't I don't have any of those oils like I don't have salad dressing or any of those oils in my home so they're gonna sneak in a little bit somewhere but I'm serving them in high amount eats animal products sure exactly so you're gonna you're gonna get them you know through those things but if you look at my blood levels my RBC levels and compared them to someone who's eating literally 10 times the amount I'm eating we might only differ by 10 or 20 percent that's what I mean by there's sort of this huge buffer capacitance function to it whereas on the EPA DHA level it seems that what you eat matters a heck of a lot more in the output is that is that a fair especially your cells respond to

[01:43:47] EPA and DHA much more strongly than they do to changes in do you think there is clinically a role for looking at the AAA to EPA and AAA to DHA levels can we infer anything from that I prefer the omega-3 index yeah just look at the EPA DHA total to me that's the problem the problem is the lack of epa and DHA if you get those up your racket on it levels will go down that's the best way to lower if you want a lower arachidonic is to take fish oil and so you'll your ratios will change you can change ratios all day long by just changing the denominator and what I don't like about AAA EPA ratio or omega-6 to omega-3 is it distracts people from the real problem which is the lack of epa and DHA it lets them run and say okay well I can I can fix my ratio by eating less than mega six and not eating more omega-3 that doesn't help whereas if you just look at the omega-3 index EPA DHA that's your focus it's too low fix it raise it up everything else will settle out what do you think is the best case for and against the notion that I mean the reduce it study in addition to at least one or two other studies makes a pretty compelling case that you don't have to eat fish to get these benefits you can get the supplements I know that prior to a year ago when reduce it came out there was still a piece of me that wondered did you have to actually eat the fish and is the consumption of fish itself and the epa DHA level that rises with it more of a proxy for some subtler thing that we're not measuring is the omega-3 content of fish and hence of your blood levels really just a marker of fish intake and there's nothing really beneficial in fish other than omega-3 that's really doing the good work or so even complements it yeah so so even if you posit that the EPA and the DHA are part of the benefit from eating fish is there something else in the fish or other things that one would eat with it that augment or transduce that benefit that you could be missed and I got it reduce it now makes that question much less likely or makes the answer that question being yes much less likely but just one

[01:46:08] I want to round that out and make sure that you haven't forgotten anything you wanted to talk about there I agree with you I think it can be done with we prefer to deal with this if possible but there's a lot of challenges with that not only just personal taste and cost and but ecological issues so yeah you can do it from EPA and and I think you can do it from EPA plus DHA supplements

[01:46:26] I think we need to talk about the other study though the vital study which was reported out the same meeting as reduce it and it was widely reported it was not done in people who have high triglycerides it was done in normal relatively healthy Americans in about 20-25 thousand of them what was the dose that was used it was one Lovaza capsule so 850 milligrams of epi DHA yeah and that study didn't find a difference did it well that's depends on how deeply you want to look in the study if you just want to read the let's crime very end point yeah well my take on that well who cares what my take is that tell us your take but starting with the dose you're not a standard doctor but the typical doctor his take on it is it didn't work because that's what the press said that's what the abstract said because they were looking for an effect of less than one gram a day of epa and DHA and they were looking at a composite endpoint of four or five different elements of cardiovascular disease stroke a non-fatal stroke stroke non-fatal heart disease a composite endpoint which three of the elements maybe were not affected but one effect one was affected tremendously it was a heart attacks were significantly you know 20% reduction in heart attacks and 20% reduction in fatal heart attacks were one of the findings I mean that's impressive for 850 milligrams a day it's amazing to me that you can even do that now and they found that NP if you look at people who report eating less than 1.5 fish meals a week there was a significant staff it on the primary endpoint of cardiovascular disease both taking just one capsule Lovaza there was some really positive stuff in this study but it was buried in the press headlines as fish oil don't work without any cabbie if you exclude the composite metric and you just look at the CH D metric how did the magnitude both in absolute and relative risk compared to reduce it this is one of the things I like doing to sense check studies which is kind of do my own analysis of them and say well like that again an example would be comparing

[01:48:44] Odyssey and Fourier and saying well based on the fact that one came in heavily Statten eyes the other was not heavily Statten eyes durations are about the same where would we be fooled versus not fooled on this can you do that sort of analysis between these two studies as well and say did they at least have a dose response with respect to the reduction in MI for example yeah that's a good question never looked at it that way I've never broken it down done the math that way I know that there was a nine or ten percent reduction in maybe there's twenty percent I can't remember at the moment of risk for heart disease but again these were not people at high risk so your absolute risk reduction was pretty small relative was pretty big but also the dose was very low yeah so you had normal triglyceride low risk people on one fifth of the dose so it's very hard to compare those two studies give a sense of what they were really trying to find out was the goal of that study does a low dose of an easily accessible supplement matter in people who are healthy I mean I assume that's at the most basic level that was the question first primary prevention study really that's been done so they they wanted to use the you know it's planned ten years ago and at that time one gram of Lovaza okay so they didn't use a supplement okay they use Lovaza at pharmaceutical but they just used one one gram instead of the four grams indicated by the fda and they've yeah they were looking at cardiovascular disease and cancer I mean it was a huge thing in primary prevention so they've got they found no effect on cancer and they found in their composite endpoint and no statistically significant significant but if you look at certain elements of the composite they were strongly benefited 20% I trying to think of there's a 20% reduction in MI that's what sticks in my mind do you think the most important takeaway from that is if you believe that the study had a methodological in achill and statistical significance one would want to move forward is the bigger knock on that study the dose the patient population that was studied or the composite endpoint all of those together can conspire to have a neutral study when you there really are some good effects that are overlooked I mean what people don't balance is the the extreme safety of these products and cheapness we're looking at something even one capsule Vasia it's cheap completely safe it doesn't interact with anything and if it there's even a hint of benefit why wouldn't you promote it mm-hmm do you think that if a person's listening to this and they're deciding hey this has got me over the goal line as far as I should be using

[01:51:37] EPA and/or DHA is there an advantage to using the pharma grade product versus a reputable supplement company like a again I'll you the two that I like her and I have no financial ties to any of these companies just sort of like them through reputation and having read analyses of their product but like

[01:51:56] Carlson's or Nordic Naturals for example I don't think there's a substantial difference at all in quality there's a lot of omega-3 supplement companies that make very high quality stuff that they just aren't going to the trouble of going through an FDA approval to get it treated and developed as a drug but it's the same chemistry and sometimes I mean if you get the EPA covered it might actually be cheaper than the supplement the supplements are actually not that cheap they're actually on the spectrum of supplements that I take you know when you compare you know something like magnesium oxide versus fish oil I mean these fish oils are pretty darn expensive supplements it's a lot of work to get them to be that pure one thing

[01:52:36] I'd say about reduce it and back to that one again you can't buy a pure EPA dietary supplement as far as I know no I think the best we can do carlson's does make something EPA gems and it's I'm gonna get it wrong but the gist of it is it's it's sort of probably 75 to 80% epa to DHA so it's heavily skewed in a direction that's concentrating epa which is not the way it normally occurs of course but that's the closest you can get and is there anything that we haven't talked about bill on this topic that you would like to add is there any other trial that you think it's just really important that we we get to well i don't think there's necessarily a trial but i if i can just get into what i i do now over the last 10 years is I think measuring blood omega-3 levels are really important and whether it's the test we do with the omega-3 index which is red cell epa DHA or a plasma test or a plasma phospholipid test or a whole blood test whatever i just think we need to see more doctors measuring omega-3 status because it means a lot low omega-3 means something you know and you know this but i really want to encourage people to make the assessment of omega-3 status and their patients as important as measuring cholesterol your company is called a mega quant correct right right and you've been at the helm of that for about a decade right yeah this is our 10th year right yeah i tend that that tells me how much time has flown because i remember when you had just sort of started that that's a tough business to be in right because just laboratory specialty labs anything that's not sort of garden-variety off-the-shelf tends to be sort of misunderstood by the payer environment and this this tends to be a tough place isn't it yeah but we're not in the payer environment we were all cash pay are you ok got it that's where the the quests and the lab cores and the cleveland's and the boston deserve and you used to be health diagnostic lab of course back in those days so can patients come directly to you or do your tests have to be ordered by physicians people who come directly to our website and order the tests it's $50 so for $50 a patient can basically receive a kit from you that they take into it I assume it's a blood test not a saliva test or something it's a finger stick test I got it so they don't even need to go into a lab no no they just do it at home it's send it to us that's the same test that

[01:55:03] I'm getting embedded within my much broader panels I assume where I'm seeing the percent of EPA DHA or is that a different company what lab is doing it well for example what was true health diagnostics using okay true health so that yeah true health took over from health diagnostic lab and health diagnostic lab took my test so you they're using my tests I see okay do you think there are other tests out there that are directionally comparable or I mean I get you're a bit conflicted to say that there's other yeah it's a loaded question yeah there's certainly directionally comparable it's just the number don't do a plasma omega-3 test and expect see an 8 to 12 percent epa DHA plasma doesn't go that high or is very hard to get that high so plasma levels are lower numbers they correlate pretty well by and large with red cells but red cells are much more stable long-term marker of omega-3 status than plasma so I like the red cell test for that purpose so that's pretty much what we use in our research studies is red cell I'd rather see a doctor major a plasma omega-3 than not measure anything that's something that people can also get through LabCorp quest and all of this or at more generic labs I assume yeah I'm not even sure they can get at lab Corbitt quest has a plasma phospholipid assay they do what is Boston heart do do you know I think they do a whole plasma I see okay so going forward if we're not using THD will be I'll have to figure out a way to come to you directly that'd be great let's do it we've got a lot of doctors you did yeah I mean I don't know what what kind of reimbursement is being paid for these tests in the insurance world I think it's not much I was about to say I'm gonna go with the not much box on that one yeah yeah so but again these aren't tests you have to get every two weeks right I mean this is the type of test where you get it maybe once a year and you make a change and you look and see hey am i taking enough of this supplement or am i eating enough fish and yeah you're about every four months it takes about four months after you make a change your mega three intake to see it a new steady state oh okay well actually that's very interesting I'm glad you brought that up I wasn't aware it was that long actually I thought you could see it change quicker but it's the life of the red blood cell I guess to fully Tercel yeah yeah okay well that makes sense bill is there anything else that we didn't discuss on this particular nuanced and super enjoyable topic golly

[01:57:25] I think we ran down the omega-6 stuff we talked about epa and DHA alone we there is a big study that's going to come out should finish a year from now called strength that is bigger than reduce it and using the same doses reduce it but it's epa plus DHA what dose approximately so that would be four grams total the drug is called empanada or EEP anova it's from AstraZeneca it's the 13,000 patient trial virtually the same inclusion criteria as reduce it that'll be about a five-year follow-up the same as reduce it and they are gonna

[01:58:01] I'm pretty sure they're gonna get much higher omega-3 index levels then reduce it did and again their drug is four grams EPA plus some amount of DHA or four grams total it's very much like Lovaza epa plus DHA at around about eighty five percent but it's for the they're not ethyl esters they're free fatty acids they're uh none esterified and do you think that actually makes any difference well if they're much more readily absorbed because the esterified ones presumably is it like cholesterol whereas terrified variants are much harder to absorb and you risk actually not absorbing them at all well yeah that's the problem it's been shown pretty clearly that if you take an ethyl ester of omega-3 on an empty stomach the absorption is quite low almost none as opposed to taking it with food which improves the absorption quite a bit but a triglyceride based oil or a free fatty acid more to the point free fatty acid doesn't require any enzymatic conversion to get absorbed at all the triglyceride has to have and the ethyl ester both have to have enzymatic conversion and the gut well that's actually really interesting i'm glad you brought that up because is you know a lot of people these days are fasting more and more time restricting their feeding and it does pose a little bit of a problem the way I've always got around it if I don't eat breakfast which I don't a lot of the time as I sort of take my fish oil at night as close to dinner as possible but it's easier to forget that way but you're saying another way around that is if you really just want to take these things in the morning and be done with them you basically have to take one of the pharma grade versions because they're the ones that come as free fatty acids right it's only experimental time it's not experimental it's approved by the

[01:59:42] FDA but just not being marketed it's the only one that's a free fatty acid right now is this empanada the vasila and Lovaza our ethyl esters so basically it'll be about a year before we even have the option to get a free fatty acid version that's when their study will finish and I think it'll be as or more successful than then reduce it that's my guess and that will be released at the

[02:00:08] American Heart in 2020 on their clinical trials.gov website it says the studies will finish in October of next year so whether they'll be able to screen for that source we'll see yeah yeah yeah weather I don't know well maybe when that study comes out bill will have to sit down an early 21 and discuss it love to well bill thanks again this was really interesting for me personally I learn a lot talking with you about this kind of stuff I just know that this episode will be one of those episodes that a lot of people end up coming back to over and over again because it is so confusing so thank you for the historical context the overview and perhaps most importantly just the sort of nitty gritty details on the health benefits of these things oh yeah my pleasure thank you very much for inviting me I've really enjoyed it you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog at
