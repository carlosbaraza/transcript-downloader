This clip is from episode 331‒ Optimizing endurance performance: metrics, nutrition, lactate, & insights from elite performers

In this clip, they discuss:

-  Lactate Isn’t the Problem—Hydrogen Is – It’s the acid component, not lactate itself, that impairs muscle function
- Can We Buffer Fatigue? – Exploring the use of sodium bicarbonate and other strategies to manage acid buildup during high exertion
- New Delivery Methods – Hydrogel-based bicarbonate delivery may offer higher tolerance and better results than traditional oral intake
- Why Blood Lactate Doesn’t Tell the Whole Story – Measuring lactate in the blood doesn’t always reflect what’s happening in the muscles
-  Performance Impacts Are Real—But Complex – Some elite athletes can maintain higher power outputs with buffered systems, but results vary

## Transcript

[00:00:00] People ask me all the time, hey, you know, I understand, Peter, that as I my my work load increases, my production of lactate increases. And as my production of lactate increases, my capacity starts to fall off because as lactate goes up, it's buffered by a hydrogen ion or it's it's married to a hydrogen ion and that's what creates the acid part of lactic acid. Um, and it's that hydrogen ion that's causing all the trouble. It's not the lactate. We can consume, we can tolerate endless amounts of lactate tolerate and lactate is crucial in metabolism. Yeah. We just can't tolerate the hydrogen that comes with it. And it's that hydrogen that actually paralyzes the actin meosin filaments prevents them from disengaging and that's what leads to that seizing up that you feel the rigidity you feel when you're at and when you exceed your lactate threshold. So the question then becomes well can I buffer this? And everybody and their brother talks about, hey, what if we, you know, took lots of

[00:00:56] Tums, you know, anything that we get could get sodium bicarbonate into our systems. My looking at that literature, which I haven't done in a while, was that this this strategy didn't really pan out. That that that there wasn't really a great way to orally ingest enough by carb to make a difference. Obviously, intravenously you could, but that's probably illegal anyway. I mean,

[00:01:17] I don't think water would permit that. Um, but even if you weren't concerned with that and just asking the theoretical question, unless you're on a stationary bike, it's not practical to have an IV drip of bicarbonate to buffer your hydrogen. So, what is the state of buffering agents to reduce and lessen the impact of of of lactic acidosis?

[00:01:40] This is a little bit of a complicated uh domain simply unlike all the other simple domains we've been discussing today. Yes. No, the the the reason for that I've been very fortunate over the last decade to be involved in ex like edge a lot of edge case uh researches plenty that uh let's say we are maybe year we are or not maybe we are years away uh before this will be published not necessarily because we don't want to publish in it but but there just remains work to be done to understand it and for example again this is also a place where um uh where we have some indications now but where some of my colleagues they have actually also tested on larger population but Gusta's highest view actually is done under bicarbonate uh utilization not Christian but Gusta how how is it administered so so the way it was administered is that there's a company in Sweden uh called Morton uh and uh what they did uh this is actually something that is going to be studied did now also in actually in in health let's say or less in medical settings as well because it actually has some quite interesting uh applications there too.

[00:02:55] Uh but uh how this was administered is basically that it is packed in a hydrogel and this allows you to by oh so you get rid of the gastric p you would bypass the gastric pH and you get it into the intestine medicine using the same mechanism you basically pack your let's say the the the agents into a vehicle to to to deliver it where you need it uh more efficiently. So this means that we can go to concentrations that are significant. What have you seen is the difference in his lactate tolerance with and without this buffering. So this is a place again where obviously the sample size is still limited. Sure. But in him in in a in a super in a worldclass elite athlete. So the interesting thing there is that here we have two different cases and that's for example I have some athletes that have almost twice as high lactate concentration in the blood when they're using. So this is the this this is why I said this we are opening a can of uh yeah proverbial of lactate buffered worms.

[00:04:00] Yes exactly because uh we also have then to remember because then we have to come back to the technology where do we measure and what is it called again? So this brand is called Morton. Morton as in Morton salt. Uh well I mean same. Well it's it's it's it's um uh it's written M uh M R T E and Morton. Uh and they basically they are like people go crazy over the gels and everything during races. They have a gel that is actually based on the same principle. So actually without we open up that box as well. But basically

[00:04:38] Christian Gustaf sits comfortably in not eating 160 grams of carbohydrates per hour. And basically this is then quantified using isotope traces as well. So they don't only eat it and it starts packing up in the stomach they they utilize it. So this is a commercially available product. Athletes are using it. And what so do you have a sense of why some people find like Gustaf seems to find huge benefit from it? Sounds like Kristen does not. Well I wouldn't say that Christian doesn't but it depends a little bit on let's say the setting we are using it in in as well.

[00:05:06] And triathlon is inherently complex in the sense that you have three sports that you put together with very varying intensity other things that are happening there. Uh and which which makes it a little bit more complicated. And then there also is some benefits but also or let's say but can also potentially be disadvantages with it.

[00:05:23] But the benefits that also comes with it is it actually also increases your plasma volume fairly instantaneously as well simply because you you buy you're just pulling you're pulling fluid into the plasma. Yeah. But but the studies early studies that have done on this and then which will be published on this basically shows that there's a positive effect of using using bicarbonate now or using for example the morton product we we have studies now on larger population done by some of my my colleagues which indicates this um then on top of that but what I would say is that um we don't fully understand why it is like this it's a one interesting one in interesting hyp hypothesis I presented to the to to to the research group is that if because on the one side what we think is that okay this this this this this increases the buffering capacity.

[00:06:13] So we we think okay if it increases the buffering capacity then you can basically do more and then you can go more anorobic or tap more into your anorobic or glycolytic resources. Uh because one thing that we are fairly sure about is that you're never going to run out of glycogen really like you come to a certain level and the body will rather start to sense that is really really low and that's why you shut down.

[00:06:33] You don't shut down because you basically depleted every gram of glycogen in your body. Uh that's one and then there other preserving mechanisms on top. By the way that's easy to verify with a muscle biopsy at failure right? No the problem no the problem with that is that even in muscle biopsies you will see that if you basically do sampling just across one muscle. So even yeah there it's so hetrogenic that even in well trained athletes if you wanted to do it you would need to biopsy multiple times multiple sites simultaneously or even make somebody radioactive and start to do nuclear magnetic reason measurements on on people. Yeah.

[00:07:09] So, so it's it's something it's so impractical to really study that you have to go more by again coming back to for example first order principles like for example looking at gross efficiency and then calculating as as basically how much subsidy you're using basically is already involving inaccuracies to it.

[00:07:28] That's why you just have to sometimes just say okay we're going to look at oxygen consumption versus a c let's say mechanical power output and then you just say we don't care about whether that's RQ correlates to this value. You just have to have the raw values. But back to the bicarbonate bicarbonate and and so on. One way we can one way what we can observe for example is that when we we do blood gas anal analysis. So when the at least are exercising so true basically a longer protocol we are taking blood samples to look at basically the pH level in the body. And what is interesting to see there even for Christian he does not have a doubling in his lacta concentration. So

[00:08:03] Christian have almost unchanged almost unchanged uh lactic concentration in his block in his blood. And what level of exertion? Yeah. Whatever even all any given power any given power. So the interest for any given V2. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So, so the in but the interesting thing here is that um the interesting thing here that is that for uh this this is easy to think now that when an athlete has double the lactic concentration in the blood then it has to be double the contribution from the glycolysis. It's not. We have to remember we measure in the blood.

[00:08:38] This is a concentration metric and the diff the state can be completely different other places in the body. [Music]
