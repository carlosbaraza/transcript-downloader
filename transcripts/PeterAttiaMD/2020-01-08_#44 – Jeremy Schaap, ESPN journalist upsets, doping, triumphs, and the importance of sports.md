## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter thea m.d. calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic

[00:01:04] I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming

[00:01:23] I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because

[00:02:08] I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating or something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our shows members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:28] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription my guest this week is Jeremy shap one of the preeminent journalists at ESPN and a wonderful guy we spend a lot of time in this episode talking about sports obviously Jeremy has done a lot of amazing work and he's written the book

[00:04:24] Cinderella Man which is an incredible story of James J Braddock many of you probably have not heard of but I think by the end of this episode you'll understand why the story is so beautiful we also talked a lot about his most recent project which is directing a 34:30 special called 42 to 1 which is the story of the Buster Douglas upset of

[00:04:43] Mike Tyson we get into a lot of things that go beyond sports and or at least are associated with sports such as why these things matter to us what they teach us about life and the challenges that he faced following in his father's enormous footsteps and ultimately coping with his father's early death as a result of a medical error this episode could have gone on for a really long time but we kind of had a time limit on it and we had to draw it to a close earlier than either one of us would have liked but with that said I think you'll really enjoy my conversation with Jeremy chef Jeremy thanks for coming man it's my pleasure Peter thank you for having me first trip on the second subway huh I guess it's been a couple of years now I mean they've been building it since 1929 it was nice to you know I I went out of my way to get a chance to see the 72nd

[00:05:30] Street Station it was impressive not having been in New York that long I don't appreciate the morass of like nonsense oh you know by the year 2400 it should extend a little bit farther downtown I would apparently it's going all the way to Tribeca yeah and then there's the LIRR you know extension to Grand Central and yeah you know the city is always improving just sometimes very slowly so there's so many things I want to talk about on the sports front but I also realize that maybe not everybody wants to hear all this stuff but I want to start with something in boxing because you and I have something in common which is we are both completely obsessed with the history of boxing and we were talking about over dinner a few months ago I don't think I know anything that has happened in boxing from about the year 1996 forward if you asked me to rattle off one champion in one division that you're probably coincides with the beginning of some new professional endeavor or you know once you start building a family and your career and all that it's harder to be as obsessive about these things and boxing itself has let's face it lost a lot of its luster over the last several decades I'm certainly not as up on the sport as I was when I was covering it free SP on a regular basis I was a ringside reporter for some time I wrote a book about boxing history but that didn't have anything to do the contemporaries were my assignment for about ten years was being like the Mike Tyson reporter from 1995 when he got out of prison until 2005 when he retired that constituted a lot of the work that I did his last fight was against Kevin McBride Kevin

[00:07:07] McBride the Colonus Colossus yeah I'm forgettable colonna's Colossus in Washington DC and I guess I sort of I'm exaggerating a little bit I still followed it enough I mean I would even bring Kevin McBride yeah the fact that I can remember the Kevin McBride fight tells you I was still somewhat paying attention but I had an almost ridiculous obsession going back to about Jack Johnson okay so from

[00:07:28] Johnson to Dempsey to Lewis to Marciano to Ali all heavyweights yeah oh and of course I you know Robinson Armstrong like it's hard to put in words how much I obsessed over that stuff like I knew every detail of every one of their fights at one point that goes way beyond me yeah I had what you wrote about product which I'm yeah I immerse myself in the 30s and the book that I wrote about Braddock and bear it really was also kind of a primer on the first 50 years of the heavyweight division as well because those stories for me like you are just so fascinating these guys were such big stars and so many of them were outsize personalities and there was nothing else in sports that even approached the significance of the heavyweight championship of the world that was it I mean you know the middleweight champion of the world man so remember there were only eight divisions and one champion per Division one champion for division and there's something mythic about it and it always fascinated me and I grew up in the 1970s

[00:08:30] I was born in 1969 I grew up in the 1970s obviously in the sports business there was a lot of interesting stuff going on epic stuff going on in the heavyweight division my father was very much Dick Schaap very much a part of that and I remember you know being 6-7 years old I still have it this encyclopedia boxing champions just you're sitting there memorizing whether it was about Stanley Ketchel the great it'll wait or it was about the great heavyweights from you know the guys you name Dempsey and and Johnson and

[00:08:59] Sullivan there was something that always attracted me of those stories as well so you chose to dive into a really interesting story that is I think honestly without your work would be a footnote right so most people wouldn't even know who James J Braddock is were it not for the movie Cinderella Man starring Russell Crowe which of course was based entirely on your book well it pains me to disabuse you of that misimpression but I feel obligated to do so the movie was actually in the works before the book oh I didn't know the and the might just as soon many people I wish the movie was in the works before the book yes I'm taking all that back everybody know there had not been a book written about since ever really a big max baer book and not since the 30s at anyone read a book about Braddock and I decided to make it kind of a a dual biography as they are on this collision course towards this heavyweight showdown in 1935 and so let's give people a little bit of a sense of that because for me I've always liked I looked at all of those heavyweights to me the entire lineage from Sullivan to Johnson to lewis etc I mean every one of those guys seemed like a god they didn't seem like they were mortal they just there was nothing about them that seemed normal bear it was like first of all like probably the most good-looking guy I've ever seen in my life like very handsome it's hard to imagine a more handsome beautiful stunning human being and his career gets off to kind of a weird start when he kills this guy with Frankie

[00:10:25] Campbell kills Frankie Campbell in the ring and it has been about 15 years since I wrote the book but if I recall correctly Frankie died and five days later couple days later it was in San Francisco Frank it was 1930 and Bear was from the Bay Area I think Frank he was from the Bay Area as well he happened to be the older brother of Dolph camilli who would end up being an excellent first baseman in major leagues the MVP of the National League and I think 1941 for the Brooklyn Dodgers and there's an inquest I mean there is a criminal investigation because of the way in which Campbell was battered in the ring and then yeah of course all of the stuff I know about these things are from watching old documentaries and reading about it but I read that bear was never the same since after that fight first of all apparently he was just devastated by the fact that

[00:11:18] Campbell died and I mean I remember reading something that his son wrote many years later that said look my dad was he was a showman I mean he was not in this to hurt people he sort of took that as his job but to have this guy die at your hands was he was never quite the same all accounts it really did shake him and it affected the way that he approached life it affected the way that he approached his opponents in the ring a few years later he would be blamed for the death of another heavyweight ernie shaft yeah although that one's a bit controversial because I believe it was an autopsy done it's suggested he actually had meningitis and he hadn't recovered from sort of a chronic meningitis at the time that he actually does he died in the ring at the hands of another fighter whose name I'm blanking that's right you know and it's been a while I think it was Carnera oh you're right there was Primo Carnera you're right it was Remo Carnera it was at

[00:12:10] Madison Square Garden although Carnera ends up administering the blows in the fight in which shaft dies but it was a very gentle blow it was almost a jab you said it was the beating he took at a bear that had made it possible for that so all of this is to basically say when Max Baer finally beats Primo Carnera which he does in ridiculous fashion I think there was 10 knock it's a laughable laughable fight yeah yeah bear looks invincible and he'd already beaten

[00:12:40] Schmeling correct he'd already beat Phil yeah and there is no way that he was gonna give Schmeling a rematch given what was going on politically again it's it's been a wild Peter but my recollection is nobody was interested in giving Max Schmeling a rematch against Bear just because he wasn't really considered washed-up finished I mean when he beats Joe Lewis in 1936 Reba's yeah washed up and finished he wasn't even part of the discussion yeah so they decide to take a tune-up fight basically with this guy who can't possibly win right well what happens Jim Braddock has been out of the fight game he's hurt he had been a light heavyweight contender in the late 1920s he had lost his one shot two tommy Loughran who was a great light heavyweight and and at that point

[00:13:26] Braddock's entire personal situation really falls apart and his professional situation not his personal really his professional situation it breaks his hand you can't fight anymore it can't make any money the depression hits he is working on the docks across the Hudson River from Manhattan he's desperate he goes on relief which that's a welfare which at that time in Braddock's mind in the minds of a lot of people that was a kind of humiliation taking government assistance especially a guy like

[00:13:57] Braddock would been so successfully been ill he fought for the light heavyweight championship which was a big big deal in 1929 in a way that it's not now and everybody thinks he's through he's finished he's done totally kaput but the interesting thing is by doing the work on the docks because he doesn't have the money for bus fare or cab fare to get from his home to the docks he's walking every day 20 miles ridiculous he's working as a stevedore you know hauling giant bales and stuff like that even with a broken head he builds up this strength especially in his left hand he had never had a left hand before the right hand is broken so he's building strength all of these things it sounds like some kind of fairy tale or something may prepare him in a way he hadn't been prepared to seize the moment he gets the shot against an up-and-comer named John Griffin John corn Griffin on the undercard of the bear Carnera fight and he was not expected to beat Griffin he was just an opponent he was the guy who was gonna be a stepping stone for corn Griffin on his way to fighting Max

[00:14:59] Baer but Braddock is a different Braddock and he delivers against corn Griffin stunning the promoters people who had you know these high hopes for for corn Griffin whose name is still in boxing circles kind of stands for guy who couldn't get it done stepping stone it's almost like a wildly hip thing and almost exactly a year later there's 364 days later he beats beats a couple of more impressive fighters on the way sets himself up for a showdown with Max Baer for the heavyweight title which nobody gave him a shot

[00:15:33] I believe it eight or nine to one huge underdog eight nine ten to one underdog depending on who you ask which at that time was I think the most lopsided odds ever in a heavyweight championship fight of course that we're gonna come to one that's a little more lopsided in a minute Braddock is this guy who's fighting for his family he's got three little kids he's got the wife they're living in poverty they're living in poverty when this rise starts after he wins one of the fights on the way that year you know he goes back he shows up at the relief office I mean it it almost sounds like it has to be apocryphal but everybody said it really happened he shows up the relief office and return returns the running there are thirty five dollars or whatever that he'd taken on government relief and he becomes the people's hero but nobody thought he had a chance against Max Baer who looked yeah I mean

[00:16:18] Max Baer looked like an executioner and he was oh and he's a specimen we just sawed Deontay Wilder fight for the heavyweight Cheers ship not long ago at 211 pounds you know it ends up being a draw with Jerry and he's six foot seven Deontay Wilder I think six seven six six max baer six two and he weighs more and he is caught pictures of him he does not happen now he is he is ripped in a way that athletes were not right like that in that he's 250 pounds he weighs more than Deontay Wilder without being tubby and in gym Braddock's you know a former light heavyweight who somehow gets all the way up to like 192 193 something like that for the fight it's not a good fight it's a pretty boring fight in max fairs clowning his way through it he doesn't seem to be taking it seriously it's his first title defense for some reason he seemed well there are a lot of reasons why he was ambivalent about the sport we talked about Frankie Campbell and her a chef but he doesn't show up in

[00:17:17] Braddock Braddock wins pretty easily yeah and you know it is a beautiful story because again maybe it's my recollections not there but but I remember reading that leading up to the fight Braddock said I'm not losing this fight like there is no way right like he was fighting for his life his honor his family he was fighting for something much more beyond him and you don't get to see that often no he literally was I mean you don't often have in a heavyweight championship fight a guy who is bad the scent of desperation is so recently in his nostrils you know I mean if you're fighting for the heavyweight championship of the world you're probably doing pretty okay for a while at that point you've been making money on other fights you've been getting bigger and stronger you've been accustomed to success and only success and Braddock was a guy who had been broken I mean broken and there was no chance he was ever going to challenge for anything like the

[00:18:15] Heavyweight Championship again I mean impossible and this would be everything to him and he inspired so many people there were so many people pulling for him but nobody really thought that he had a chance against Max Baer who was five years younger yeah by every metric was yeah and should a warrior man you should have won the fight and then of course I think it was by that point smelling had had upset Louis which was you know that was three six that's right 1936 yeah and I think at that point Baer did have a chance I mean you could have argued he should have fought Schmeling but by that point the war was really starting to ramp up in

[00:18:50] Europe and again maybe this isn't true maybe this is just sort of revisionist history but he had a choice to fight Louis vs Schmeling and the logical choice would have been Schmeling right because he had beat Louis but the sort of more American choice was that Braddock's choice right yes siree Braddock's choice that's right so so he fights Louis and I mean we all know how the story ends which is Louis wins and that goes on to create the most dominant heavyweight in the history of the sport 12 years champion 25 final defenses but the fight was more compelling than people expected

[00:19:22] I mean Braddock put up a better fight well as I recall he knocks down Joe Louis in the first round yeah you know it that's really he would fight one more fight after Louis which he won and then retire which he won and retired but he the thing about Jim Braddock would I think he embodies is this idea whether or not you buy into it that there is something noble about that sport and about the commitment required and about the dedication and about its code whatever that code you know the code of courage personal courage of total commitments of believing there's something honorable about fighting until you've got nothing left none of that stuff matters Matt bear that's the contrast to max bear thought this was this was show business and it was a way for him to make a buck and I think after he killed Frankie kam

[00:20:07] Bowen had a hand in the death of Ernie shaft it was kind of like I'd like to make some money I'd like to be in movies he was in movies he was starring in Hollywood movies while he was champion before he was champion getting good notices and of course moved out to Hollywood later and Braddock really felt you know what I'm going down like a

[00:20:25] Roman centurion on my back if he's taking my title Joe Lewis hungers you know damn near almost take my life he's good and that's exactly it and you know there's the story in the corner after L Lewis almost rips off his head and he's battered and bloodied and he's his coroner wants to throw in the towel and he tells Joe Gould who's his manager his best friend if the guy who's been there for everything with him he says if you throw in the towel never talk to you again and I think he meant it now today we'd say that's just silly you know Jim that's Joe Lewis that's 23 year old Joe

[00:20:58] Lewis get out of the ring but then it meant something and you're so right about Joe Lewis I mean it does break my heart a little bit today when you see people talking about this sport without an understanding of what came before like what did it mean to be Joe Lewis let's not even talk about the political and social side of it which to me is just as beautiful as what he could do athletically but when you go back and look at the film of him including his rematch with Schmeling which to me is one of the most remarkable fights ever he breaks his vertebrae he breaks one of the bones in his back in the first round in this revenge fight everything he went on to do you know bring it back to Max

[00:21:39] Baer I remember reading that after so Lewis fought bear two years later so now Lewis's champion bear is not and Lewis beats him badly but Baer finishes on a knee so you can press a very famous image in boxing where Max Baer is on his knee clearly looking like he could get up and gets counted out yeah I mean what

[00:22:01] I remember though is that bear did not want to go into the rain I think he had a hand injury dish not been in the fight at the first race and so at the press conference after one of the reporters says to bear maxie it looked like you could have beat the count and he looks at him and he says something to the effect of he you know bear always had a great way of saying stuff including his last words before he that's me but he said something to the effect of if I'm going to get executed you're gonna have to pay a lot more than $35 to see it or whatever the text right that's exactly right which is kind of the summation of everything he felt about the sport yeah and he died young which broke my heart -

[00:22:40] I mean he died he 50 right he had a heart attack 50 and and the famous line you know I had you know these things say sound to be we're so nerdy to be talking about okay we gotta be skeptical but you know he's staying in a hotel in Hollywood I think and he calls down yeah he's having chest pain and they say so no there's two lines the one line is we'll send the house doctor and he says

[00:23:01] I don't need a house doctor I need a person doctor that's right dummy and then they send somebody up and then you know this is actually it's bring it back to sort of my world of heart disease I mean you didn't have any tools to help somebody having a heart attack back then the way we do today so once someone's going down that path they're gone and by the time they did get the medical folks up to the hotel he had a second heart attack and his last words apparently were oh here I go or something to that effect this is it I'm here I go yeah he was he was a great he was a fascinating figure he was a colorful character he loses the title fight and then he fights

[00:23:34] Louis and he didn't have any interest in the fight game anymore is it a coincidence that you've written the New York Times best-selling book that describes the entire story of what we just described and then you go on to make you know one of my favorite ESPN 30 for 30 s which is 42 to 1 the parallels between Buster Douglas and James J

[00:23:54] Braddock are comical right you couldn't make it up right there the two greatest underdogs in heavyweight championship who also rose for a moment I mean that's right you know they're the two biggest underdogs but they were bigger underdogs than all those guys who lost the fights you know they're underdogs who win the fights who seize the moment and I've always loved the Buster Douglas story to me you know as I said I was born 1969

[00:24:19] I'm 49 I've seen everything you could see in sports a lot of it I've seen in person you know other stuff I've watched on TV and the night of that fight it was nighttime here in the u.s. it was the night of the slam dunk contest in the NBA I remember this like it was yesterday it was that night and it was afternoon early afternoon in Tokyo and I found out the result that night I couldn't find anywhere that had regular HBO to watch it I wanted to watch it I tried to locate regular HBO I happen to be in

[00:24:52] Hanover New Hampshire that night and I couldn't find it but somebody told me later in the night did you hear what happened just like millions of people around the world did you hear what happened to hear what happened now can't be can't possibly be could not have possibly occurred and then my mother sent me a VHS she had recorded it off

[00:25:09] HBO and watching it even a few days later in my apartment in college it was still so thrilling so exciting that it's such a great fight really it's such an incredible fight in and for Buster Douglas to rise to the occasion as he did again when the stakes were so high cannot have been higher 22 days after the death of his mother when nobody thought he had a chance when

[00:25:35] Mike Tyson looked utterly invincible there's nothing else quite like it I obviously watched it as soon as it came out and I think I'm gonna watch it again with you tonight at the screening but I had not seen the fight in about 15 years right so I watched it probably a million times at the time but I'd forgotten a lot of it and I'd forgotten the ninth round oh I'd forgotten that round you don't see those kinds of rounds in heavyweight fight no you put that in the category of round 10 of riddick bowe versus Evander Holyfield round you know round 10 you put that in the round if Hagler earns round one which was by the way that's what got me into boxing Tom Hagler turns round one

[00:26:17] April 1985 was when I decided I want to be the middleweight champion of the world that was the house luckily I chose another path but no the Douglas fight was unbelievable and and if you ever heard it you know I'm blanking on his name Teddy Atlas was on Joe Rogan I don't know a while ago and Teddy Atlas made a really interesting point he said you know Tyson's never want to fight in his life because every fight he won you know one technically the opponent was beat before they got in the ring every fight he lost is because the guy came in and wasn't afraid and

[00:26:46] Douglas was in many ways the most impressive of those because he was the first one to beat him and then of course Holyfield would go on to do it twice and then Lewis and then ultimately McBride I think those were Tyson's five losses correct yeah Wiis Williams McBride Judah Holyfield and Lewis McBride Judah

[00:27:03] Holyfield and Buster yeah but the Douglas one is a different level it's a different level because it's the first and because he gave us not only the blueprint but because it was Mike Tyson at 23 not Mike Tyson after prison not Mike Tyson at 37 it was the Mike Tyson who had annihilated Michael Spinks and humiliated Larry Holmes and and remember his previous fight to Douglas if I recall wasn't it Frank Bruno who he had obliterated the fight right before it was I think it was Frank but I'm getting mixed up now there's Carl Williams oh you're right no no you're right you're right right it was Carl Williams in July of 89 was the previous one and before that was Frank Wright and before that was Spinks right he was 37 and no 34 knockouts he got Tony Tucker had taken him the distance but it wasn't a close fight at all no and then Bonecrusher

[00:27:59] Smith had taken him the distance that's right and basically clinching the whole way there he'd gone the distance twice before quick Tillis took him the distance three of them yeah yeah it was three of them right and so it was a sense maybe some big guys could give him some trouble you know if they approached but those guys weren't in those fights those fights were not close fights there was no one who had stood up to him and who had matched him punch for punch and

[00:28:25] Buster Douglas did more than that the thing about the Buster Douglas story why I really wanted for this to be given this kind of treatment was because I've known Buster for a long time I did stories about the 20th anniversary the fight 25th anniversary of the fight and this moment for me as a young person was just so such a transcendent sports mom and I said and people don't get it they don't want to give Buster credit they want to say it was a one-hit wonder or he got lucky with a punch or that he wasn't he didn't deserve to even be in the same ring with my Tyson plus everything people thought they knew about Buster

[00:28:57] Douglas was really wrong Buster Douglas of course you know dominates that fight I mean it is an epic performance he doesn't get lucky it's not as simin in south africa Atlantic's Lewis it's not one punch it is a butt-kicking it's an ass-kicking by round three yeah like if you go back and watch that fight knowing the outcome which of course now we would all do you're not blinded by the way you are the first time you saw it live which is you're in denial you're in denial and by the way you see something's gonna happen yeah yeah didn't two of the three judges have Tyson ahead at the time of the knockout I think that's right which is like those people should be removed and my co-director went to Japan and interviewed one of them needs this is what it looked like to me but that speaks to the aura of Tyson that you could have had Tyson winning one goddamn round besides were they were a Don King yeah yeah so but you're right it's a total ass-kicking Tyson's eye is swelling shut by the third round even the eighth round where he knocks Douglas down I mean Douglas still dominated that round yeah and then the ninth round he almost takes Tyson's head bobbing that she lands in the corner you know and that's it that we did it also speaks to how tough time so we didn't know Mike

[00:30:09] Tyson had a chin we had no idea until I fight nobody had ever challenged him and I mean the beating that he took I think the people who thought Buster were going to win and there were about four of them thought that he would win because he would be able to keep his distance use his jab and Tyson wouldn't know what to do after four or five rounds that he would just kind of get frustrated and DQ himself or just fall apart physically from the exhaustion and instead Mike

[00:30:41] Tyson I mean he's in there for 40 minutes taking an epic beating an epic beating from a bigger stronger more athletic man I mean you know you could say everything in look Mike Tyson was a phenomenon what Mike Tyson did from 1985 up until that moment in Tokyo it's pretty impressive and it's pretty special it doesn't look as special now because we know the next chapter the but of course that time you know for

[00:31:08] Buster Douglas - you know Buster Douglas is a bigger guy he is a stronger guy maybe stronger is not the right word he was a more focused guy and he was a better athlete and he used all of his advantages and he marshaled all of his talents and that's what's so fascinating about the story to me is that here's a guy who had been considered an underachiever at best and a quitter at worst and by the way I gotta tell you you guys made a great point of that and the thing I guess I have a different view he was beating Tucker handily right and then he basically fails to answer a few punches and the ref stops it I'm not sure I call that quitting I mean I enjoyed you either

[00:31:49] I just don't think that was always a very unfair label bestowed on you Douglas totally unfair a guy look boxing is a cruel sport this is another reason why I want to tell this story boxing unlike other sports right here's a guy Buster Douglas who at that point when he gets into the ring with Mike Tyson right you know had fought for the heavyweight title he'd fought big tough guys he'd beaten Greg page would be a heavyweight champion he'd beaten Oliver

[00:32:16] McCall who was gonna be a heavyweight champion and yet people thought of him not as just a guy who's not Mike Tyson's spear but is a bump you know but only in boxing oh there's that quote that you guys have in the movie where what did Don King say about him he's a dog he's a dog I mean he's a quitter and he's a dog like Don King if anybody would know a dog I mean it is something but that's the way I think the average sports fan and even boxing fans talk about boxers

[00:32:44] I've said this before like if you're the 15th best left-handed pitcher in the National League again a contract for like a hundred and ten hundred and twenty million dollars maybe maybe that's a slight exaggeration eighty five ninety million dollars guaranteed and you're an all-star and people want your autograph and people say oh he's so effective and he can do that if you're the third best middleweight in the world but you're going to the bathroom nobody knows your name and it's like oh he lost that fight he's a bump you know you hear that all the time and Buster Douglas the reputation fairly or unfairly had been established in that fight again

[00:33:20] Tony Tucker when he's winning he's five rounds away I think it was a 15 rounder still at that time you're right that would have been the last of the 15 rounders thinking what 87 I think that I think it was still a 15 runner I came as May of 87 so yeah I mean Mills Lane did the right thing it was time to stop that fight because Buster is standing there just wasn't returning them you know six or seven massive I mean Tony Tucker was a good fighter

[00:33:43] Doug was a big guy he's pummeling Buster and Buster's not doing anything so the fight had to end but to call him a quitter you you get in the ring and take some of those punches from Tony Tucker yeah the other thing I remember at the time was when Douglas his mother died two weeks before the fight and I remember that getting like small news remember this fight wasn't getting that much news because this was there people are already talking about the Holyfield fight that was supposed to happen in

[00:34:08] June I think it was already a contract so and I remember thinking oh man they're gonna have to postpone the fight and he's never gonna get his shot and I remember just feeling kind of sorry for Douglas like I wanted to get paid you know I mean like it at this point it's like at least you deserve a couple million bucks because you've been through all of this there's only one point two but that's two million today yeah there were people who thought I mean you saw in the film Bruce trampled er the Hall of Fame promoter and

[00:34:34] Matchmaker who knew Buster from the time he was a little kid because he was his father's daughter he said I thought he should pull out I didn't see how he could possibly have enough focus after his mother's death to get in the ring that's how his brother kind of thought Buster said no let's go let's do this and there's something you did that was really beautiful in the film which was after one of Buster's fights he's uh I don't remember which fight it was but he's standing on the left his mom is in the middle and the dad is on the right right the interview I forget who it was it wasn't it's al Bernstein it turns out was a young Albert Albert it's barely recognized so Albertson says to his mom something to the effect of are you proud now that's not because you look old that's just you were wearing a strange suit yeah yeah and your hair was a bit darker and he says that the mom are you proud of your boy and you know you initially his mom didn't want him to take go down this path because she knew he was just a gentler soul than then her husband who was like a hard-ass and then you see in this moment how proud she is of him and you see his face it was this beautiful look on Douglass's face as he looks at his mom saying how proud she is of him and I think at that point someone basically makes the comment might have been in the narration that he was just always closer to his mom like he was really his mom the child

[00:35:56] Bruce talking and he says you know that he favored his mother I think those are the exact words he his disposition was more like his mother little pearls he was not the stone-cold killer that his father bill Douglas was in the ring and that's the contrast to of course you know Bill Douglas was not a world champion bill

[00:36:16] Douglas was not Mike Tyson he was a guy who many people thought deserved title shots and didn't get them because he could do so much damage and upset the applecart but his approach was Tyson like and he fought with the same style the same commitment in the same determination to not just win but to destroy and that wasn't Buster on a little Segway that I want to come back to the boxers who have fought with that ethos Sonny Liston Jack

[00:36:44] Dempsey George Foreman Mike Tyson there was a really interesting article in Sports Illustrated and I believe it was March of 88 so it was even before Tyson fought Spinks if I recall Larry Bird was on the cover so it was a very nondescript article and I wish I could find it because I you know I used to have every Sports Illustrated ever Wow and my mom like 15 years ago called me you know where this story's gone you know it's just gonna break your heart I had the first I had the Eddie

[00:37:13] Matthews on yeah I mean I had every newspaper clipping you could ever have on this stuff and it was boxes upon boxes upon boxes and my mom calls me like fifteen years ago and she's like look Peter do you want to come and get these things and I don't know I just was like no you can pitch him and like it's like top three shames of my life but nevertheless there is this you blame her she asked my mom mom it's my fault not yours so at least I could've had them digitally archived or something something so it's this

[00:37:45] March 7th 1988 throwaway article a Sports Illustrated just before the Tony Tubbs fight if I recall good number he fought Tubbs in Tokyo Tokyo in like fresh event at the Tokyo Dome that's right March 21st 88 or something better really good two round knockout Tony Tubbs looked like he looked like nothing the article makes an interesting point and the point was this now remember it your you know Mike Tyson is three years into the reign of terror and he looks utterly invincible and the author says you know what the flames that burn this bright burn out really quick and the author went back and said look at

[00:38:21] Dempsey this is how bright that light Shawn and then it was gone and look at Liston and look at Fraser and look at Foreman and they're like if you put Tyson in that bucket this is not a guy who's gonna have a long career he is going to implode and I remember reading that as a 13 year old going or 12 year old whatever the hell I was thinking this guy's an idiot he doesn't know what he's talking about Tyson's gonna be the champion till he's 40 like it again which of course Mike didn't even think he'd be alive till he was 30 so you just sort of think like how much does history repeat itself whereas when you look at the guys like Luis and Ali the ones that have had their really really long careers you know there's something different about it there's just something different about their ethos there they're a different type of person they're not killers and it's not to say like they're gentlemen versus killers but it's just they're artists in a way that I think some of the most destructive and feared fighters were not yeah well there's no doubt about that because if you fall in love with your right hand and the knockout in particular you're gonna get lazy and you're gonna get one-dimensional and you're gonna get exposed eventually and there are enough good fighters out there who can box who bring other skills to bear and if you've got some kind of deficiency they're gonna locate it they're gonna find it they're gonna wear you down it is one of those interesting things though those guys those destroyers you know the Dempsey's and

[00:39:53] Liston's and in the Tyson's and you know as well as I do there there are similarities and there differences also when we talk about guys like that but if you are being hailed as the destroyer as the guy who can do everything and can get it done with one punch you're not gonna be listening the same way to your trainer to Kevin Rooney or Teddy Atlas or aaron snowell the way if you've had to box you've had some challenges I mean the interesting thing about I've been talking about this a lot the last couple of months and the thing about Tyson right is that he's the heavyweight champion he's considered invincible he has this aura about him that no one has had since Dempsey so was gonna ask you about that because I just it's hard to extract that from the literature do you believe that Tyson's aura was greater than that of Foreman's and Liston's at their respective times yeah I mean I guess I'd have to go back and look I mean after Foreman does what he does to Joe Frazier and all that but

[00:40:56] I think so because you know there was just more of it and at that point he taking on all comers he there was nobody and there was more of it the fashion in which he did it so many different guys I think it was bigger I think it was more impressive with Tyson at that time and it was also his own way of speaking about things his story where he came from the kid from reform school anyway I mean you know there's similarities to wood listing but I think it's not a parallel really with Lewis because most people would tell you you know I'm gonna assume you're one of them that Joe Lewis is the greatest heavyweight champion of all time I was gonna ask you what your thought was it's certainly between Lewis and Ally right so let's say it's Joe

[00:41:40] Lewis right but Joe Lewis before he becomes champion as we earlier discussed has already lost a fight yeah he's knocked out knocked out humiliated against an older guy that everybody thought was over the hill so when he becomes champion he doesn't have that aura to Tyson as he builds a different kind of aura and he builds a different kind of championship record with that blemish from the Schmeling fight already behind him now if he doesn't have that moment with Schmeling right maybe it's a different story the fact that he had moment that more than a moment of adversity he had that huge setback to his career it was a year before he would fight again wasn't it before he would get the Braddock fight and it was no sure thing that Braddock would fight him

[00:42:26] I mean remember at this point it's been more than 20 it's been 22 years since an african-american has been allowed to fight for the heavyweight championship and there was no guarantee that in 1937 that the boxing establishments would permit it or the public would demand it it looked like he was heading that way until he lost to Schmeling and then it was like well you don't have anyone who has an execute exactly right but

[00:42:51] Braddock gives him a shot and it's part of a business deal where he gets a percentage of Louis's earnings from ten years I'm a great business deal you wonder you know ethically about the deal but anyway I don't remember exactly the point I was making but Lewis is different Dempsey I think is similar Dempsey see you know he was a destroyer and there was this cloak of did you ever meet Dempsey because he didn't let me around for a long time 1083 had a restaurant here for a very long time Jack Dempsey and apparently I mean I'm not sure about the very last years but up until into his mid-70s I mean I know that he was all there it's remarkable this isn't a guy who just had all of those knock-down drag-out professional fights I mean he fought hundreds of fights is basically a semi-pro in mining camps in Colorado and the toughest possible atmosphere you can imagine I mean a lot of it was bare fisted and no-holds-barred and I mean I can't imagine the kinds of now he was great so I don't know how much punishment he was taking but when you're a young guy come up there you're getting hit oh but to look at the Dempsey fights are some of the most amazing things you can walk remember though when he becomes champion right I mean he goes three years from 1923 1926 without defending his title he is such a big celebrity he's making so much money just off the championship and it's significance that he doesn't have to get into the rink finally you know he gets in the ring in 1926 and he loses to gene Tunney in sesquicentennial Stadium in

[00:44:22] Philadelphia and then they got the rematch year later which is still arguably the biggest sports event in the his three of the world Dempsey Tony - at Soldier Field I'd probably make a case it's the biggest sports event in its moment of all time and he loses again this one's the long-long town and all that but it's funny the two biggest sports events of all time in my book are Ali Frazier one

[00:44:44] March 8th 1971 in Dempsey Tony - 1927 in Soldier Field and the guys that we always talk about are the guys who lost those fights Ali and Dempsey not the guys who want Tony and Frazier there's a beautiful picture I once saw of Ali that morning walking in Central Park in the snow and it's sort of amazing I mean that's part of I think what makes New York such an interesting place is the history and I think the whole Atlantic City in the 80s in Las

[00:45:09] Vegas it's sort of taken away a little bit from how remarkable it is to fight in Madison Square Garden and what that would have meant like how anticipated that fight was and of course when when Tyson fought Spanx in 88 in Atlantic City most people who knew enough about the sport said look this is the most anticipated fight in the heavyweight division since 1971 I mean this is a really big deal and of course at the time that was only 16 years our holy hurt which seems Caterpie isn't crazy to me given what an eternity 16 years is when you are 16 years young yeah oh my god that was the Dark Ages or whatever it was so one question on the 42 to 134 30 did you guys even try to interview

[00:45:49] Tyson yeah so it's interesting because some people felt dissatisfied that we didn't have today's stuff from Mike we made a decision I went to talk to Mike Mike declined to take part in the process I had interviewed him in 2017 though and asked him a lot of questions about the fight and we hadn't used that

[00:46:07] I think anywhere and at one point we had a cut of the film where we had a lot of it and we had a few bites from it and we made an artistic decision essentially at that point that we wanted to see Mike only in context from the time of the fight who he was then because seeing him now with the tattoo the way that he's changed you know he's he can be very quiet and low energy it's such a stark contrast to what we're showing you of him and that it's almost jarring and everybody knows the Mike Tyson I've done nobody's done more Mike Tyson stories than me literally you know on TV anyway interviewed a more on TV that I have I would think long-form stories of Adam all that I just felt this is Buster's story people know the mike story people hear from Mike all the time we still hear from Mike all the time the more you put Mike in it from today I see you'd attracts you'd attract of it yeah and what did Mike talk about in 2017 when you interview him about that fight specifically cuz I've never really heard him talk much about that fight you eat there's so much about him and

[00:47:15] Holyfield and the men's that's been made and all those other things but what this recollection of that probably the best bite we had from that interview something like where he said look was Buster Douglas a better fighter that morning that afternoon yes does that mean that he's a better fighter than me no that's a fair point he's certainly entitled to make that point but in terms of like what happened he said I was living my life too fast I was doing crazy stuff I was this I was that you know it was in people say well that's making excuses it's like well I asked him what happened I mean whether it's an excuse or not I mean that's the truth I think in his mind I think he feels if he'd approached that fight with full commitment he would have won it but of course he's going to think that and that does not diminish what Buster Douglas did because I mean if we're gonna if we're gonna say well it doesn't count then then you know nothing counts did the Soviet team really approach the

[00:48:10] American kids in the Olympics the way they would have approached the Czechs or something like that no or the Canadian all-star team or the you know NHL all-star team no but if you're gonna say well then it doesn't count then nothing silly no in the end it everything counts that was a great line by the way with the bookie in Vegas

[00:48:29] I love that part by the way of him actually talking about the bets and you know he was like look people say that the miracle and ice is the biggest upset in sport it's not even within a country mile that that was the biggest upset in sport is there ever been Vegas odds bigger than forty two to one overcome in a heavyweight championship fight you know in any sport oh I think so you know a lot of people say well Lester city's a bigger upset because they were 5,000 won or something to win the Premier League oh yeah that's of course how could I forget that's it that's a pretty amazing example yeah but to me that's totally different there wasn't a single game that season I mean I don't know what I'd have to go back and yeah I bet there wasn't a single game that was more than four to one or five to one you know what

[00:49:09] I mean in a season lot that's a very good point ya know and every year there's somebody who wins a conference or who wins a professional league or a championship who is I think these Rams were three hundred to one that's right I mean look even the New England Patriots the first year they won the Super Bowl but all of that stuff is based on teams because we don't know how those teams are constituted Buster Douglas was

[00:49:33] Buster Douglas he was the guy who'd had six fights in stony Tucker people still thought he's 42 to 1 Leicester City the st. Louis Rams whatever you want to say nobody knew who that team was that wasn't the team that you would seem the season so it's in the single event that's still kind of unusual odds bill it was great you know the other thing that was nice to see was for me at least cuz I hadn't seen much of Buster Douglas in in many years because I remember in 95 when he was almost dead I mean five years after that fight he's in a diabetic coma 380 pounds bigger than that yeah really I mean yeah it was kind of nice to see him I liked

[00:50:08] Buster very much I've spent a lot of time with Buster over the years you know I'm always cautious about saying this he's this or he's that when by the standards of my profession I've spent a lot of time with him you know three days here two days here at dinner here or dinner there is he somebody that I've spent like a work colleague where he spent years around them I don't know but

[00:50:24] I like Buster I think he's a good guy he's a good person he has not been a self-promoter which I think has hurt him financially over the years I think his feelings have been hurt because people furlough so long have tried to diminish this victory and there's so many avid Mike Tyson fans who always want to make excuses for him who always want to discredit Buster whatever for whatever reason it is I felt like he had not been fully appreciated for the magnitude of this what do you think went wrong after

[00:50:55] Tyson why do you think he didn't show up in shape for Holyfield because on paper he should have given Holyfield a hell of a fight I think Douglas was a better fighter than Riddick Bowe I mean you could certainly make that case I mean Riddick had some great moments most some against Evander Holyfield but he was

[00:51:12] Buster was a very skilled boxer and he was a very good athlete and he was schooled in the sport and when he was fully dedicated and committed which we saw only on a few occasions it was very tough to beat I don't think anybody I don't care if it's Jack Dempsey or gene Tunney or John L Sullivan himself would have beaten him in Tokyo that day I really don't think so but after he defeats Tyson everything is just so chaotic it's the typical story we hear you know too much too fast too many people pulling at him he's in court with Don King he's in court over the long count in the eighth round all of this as we would say mishegoss is you know driving him crazy he's getting rid of the people in his camp who had made it possible for him to achieve these great heights he's got a new team in there and he signs at the time for 24 million dollars if I'd Holyfield the largest largest person in the history of sports nobody'd ever got a check like that in history sports which is like 48 million now and even after the taxes and paying out Don King and paying off his team he still got like 9 million dollars in cash like 18 million dollars today something like that and I think his motivation was gone and I think the reality of his mother's death sunk in when she died he had the fight to focus on and now he's got this complicated weird relationship at times with his father who's now like going to Don

[00:52:42] King's party when I think Buster is still suing Don King I mean there's all kinds of crazy stuff going on he doesn't I think Buster would be the first event he doesn't show up for that fight no physically mentally motivationally didn't care there's something about boxing that I guess this is part of what attracted me to it as a participant and then eventually always just as a fan and maybe I have a slightly different insight into it because I've done it but the ring is a really lonely place it's hard to put in words what the fear is like when you get in the ring and and again maybe it's just that that was just who I was and maybe there are some people who get in the ring and they're not afraid but even Tyson I remember once said anybody who gets in a boxing ring and who is not scared senseless is lying or crazy yeah my thought I don't think he was scared by the time he got in the ring against Buster I don't think my guess but you have to have a relationship with fear you you have and even if you feel like you're going to win like I mean I think anytime I stepped into a ring I felt like I was going to win I mean there are no words to describe that anxiety there's nothing

[00:53:48] I've ever experienced since no professional thing I've ever done that has put that much adrenaline into my body that borders on the point of being like you're on the verge of it being unproductive and the audience can sense that I mean for me I said you know I've seen a lot of great things in person by the time they fight in 2002 Lennox and

[00:54:07] Mike are both over the hill they're 36 years old 37 years old something like that and yet people have called it you know the last great fight the last big fight I was covering that fight I was wasn't far from did you see that beating being that bad that's what I thought I really did think so and I was working with a lot of people who thought I was crazy who thought that Mike was gonna win I think Mike was the favorite and oh my god I thought he was gonna lose no question but I didn't expect to see him beat up that badly I'd seen Mike fight a lot over the previous seven years I'd seen Lennox fight more and yeah I did I didn't see how he would beat Lennox

[00:54:46] Lennox Lewis top ten heavyweights of all time you off the top of my head without going back and looking at those two losses to McCall and Rahman which they count yeah I guess he's probably somewhere right around there and it's right around the 10 11 12 something like that so asked another way from Muhammad

[00:55:05] Ali until today who were the three best Larry Holmes let's give you Larry Holmes right okay he's got to be in there yep Larry Holmes has got to be in there Lenox has got to be in there put Klitschko in there I think yeah the question is which one or both you know I mean two pretty impressive guys who did impressive things after

[00:55:27] Lenox fights Vitali in 2003 and Vitali performs well but he doesn't win the fight and he gets a cut you know all that after that I kind of stopped paying as much attention to the heavy weights like you know they took the belts off to Germany and that we never really saw much of those fights and there were a lot of guys they were fighting who were kind of unknown entities so I'm a little reluctant to talk too much about the careers of either Klitschko brother I don't know quite how to measure them but there was a sea-change right I mean I think there was an introduction of athleticism to the heavyweight division that I don't think you saw before and I think that those cups prototype of the Lewis the riddick bowe the razor Roddick's the

[00:56:14] Klitschkos I mean there's just a different level of athleticism size and they are so big so they are so freaking but which is why it was so amazing to me to see a guy like Deontay Wilder who is still undefeated at this point after the fury fight and you know maybe he's the guy who fights Joshua maybe it's fury who knows whatever it is there's a guy who's 212 v here 212 pounds who's arguably the best heavyweight in the world arguably because we saw these guys getting 240 250 and they're gigantic the mountains the Primo Carnera size these guys you know with skill right always yes to come out just sighs yeah so you don't think you're ever gonna go backwards from that they were very tough very tough guys let's go brothers I could sit here and talk about boxing forever because it's not there's not often I get to talk to somebody who sort of thinks about it the way I do but I there were a few other things I want to talk about and and sort of one of them is your most famous interview right with

[00:57:14] Bobby Knight so you don't have to say anything good or bad about him but having never met him he just strikes me as just a deplorable human being I don't know what it is about him maybe truthfully maybe there's a part of myself I see like you know I have a really bad temper and I look at him and I think god I hope I've never done 1/100 of what that guy has done I hope I've never hurt anybody the way he's hurt somebody did you see the 3439 I did and it only solidified in my mind how much I despise him yeah my friend Robert Abbott oh it's one of the saddest ones I've ever seen it is so goddamn sad to me how many people's lives have been destroyed by him here's the thing I I knew Bob night I mean again you know I say know somebody how well I my father was a friend of Bob Knight's I had spent time with Bob night before that interview I was one of those people who appreciated his talents and he had this his quote/unquote genius quote/unquote genius and his sense of history sense of loyalty look they're good qualities there there are other people who can you know talk to you can watch the film talk about the dark side of Bob night the interview was a challenge how many days after he was fired was the interview I want to say it was 72 hours later it might have been 48 it was I can't remember exactly why did he give you that interview well I think he gave me that interview because he thought he could steamroll me and he'd known me and so was your witness this was a mm mm so your dad was still alive my dad was still alive what did your dad tell you going into that interview you know I spoke to a lot of people the night before the interview in the day of the interview because it's one of those those situations and I I was young I just turned 31 and this is the biggest thing that's going on not just in sports but in America period at this moment in time it really was and I knew I had to get it right I knew the stakes were high for me and so I I spoke to a lot of people and I'm trying to remember what my dad told me I don't remember what his advice was about the question so this or that I spoke to a lot of people who told me you know it was important of course to ask him the tough questions and not back down and I think that's what I did and that's that's what people said at the time they said you know chaps stood up tonight he didn't let the bully bully him I asked the right questions I got to the important points and I think perhaps most important because there was a moment of pique when I think he revealed himself in a way that he wouldn't often in a live television interview that that that really kind of said who he was more than anything else and so people still remember that interview it was quite easily do you think is the most memorable exchange of that interview well that's indisputable because people remember it very well we're having a discussion we're having a talk about the zero tolerance policy which is ultimately what led to his termination ultimately what led to his termination he's explained telling me how he doesn't know what zero tolerance meant and nobody ever defined it for him and he was put in a lose-lose situation whatever the exact words were and he says and the real victim here is Pat his son who was one of the assistant coaches the real victim here is Pat because Pat is going to lose his job and I feel it's my obligation at this point to point out and say Bob but Pat wouldn't be losing his job if you had behaved yourself if you had done you know what you were told to do and that's when he got angry very angry and he looked at me and he said and he glared at me he said be careful here you've got a long way to go until you're as good as your dad yeah and I said I appreciate that and moved on but that's the exchange that everybody remembers and my friend Willy wine bound producer I work with a lot he's one of the guys I talked to before the interview great journalists great interviewer and he said you know just remember he's probably gonna you know invoke your dad at some point or compare you unfavorably use that as a weapon in his arsenal and

[01:01:32] I don't really remember if it registered didn't register but I remember will did say that and of course that's what people remember but at the time for me it was like a you know kind of a career-defining moment all of a sudden it was like welcome to the big leagues so what is it like then with a father who's a legend and it's not like you decided to become a dentist or an anesthesiologist you decided to do what your dad did and that means subject yourself to constantly being compared to him and living in his shadow what did your mom say about that you know maybe

[01:02:09] I'm just getting old I don't remember a conversation about it not only not with my mother but not really with my father I mean I grew up especially when I was very young before my parents divorced like at his side I mean going to sports events with him going to the I remember on the weekends you know what I did was I went to the office with my father in the morning while he prepared sports stories and sports reports on NBC back then and I hung around the office and I read sports books it was almost like my entire life had been an apprenticeship in the business so and you weren't worried about the shadow maybe I should have been okay every gave it a second thought

[01:02:48] I know that sounds ridiculous no no it doesn't actually it's it's it's remarkable I mean I don't do anything that my dad does my dad you know he runs quarrys so I couldn't be further from what my dad does but yet in many ways I do compare myself to his work ethic right I mean like even a few weeks ago I was sort of complaining to my therapist

[01:03:09] I was like God you know I don't think I can work as hard as my dad and it's deep down it makes me feel a little bit ashamed that you know my father's never been in a bad mood he's like the most upbeat positive optimistic immigrant that ever lived tomorrow is always gonna be a better day and he can we'll come from from Egypt he can he can will his way into the world like what he wants to happen will happen and you know as a kid I never once saw my dad even in bed you know he was coming home after I was sleeping he'd be up and gone in the morning like he'd never slept in on a Saturday or anything like that so you just had this view of like this is like a Superman and of course me you know I'm different I can be lazy at times and I can get into you know a very productive person you're just measuring yourself against an impossible standard right but don't we all do that I mean oh I do I compare ourselves to that's what I'm saying is at least for me I can keep the distance between what we've done professionally so so I really can only compare myself to my father in terms of work ethic sacrifice and just general disposition but now you have all of those things to compare yourself to plus you know being on the son of one of the most legendary sports casters of all time well I think

[01:04:20] I'm just gonna go lie down on the couch you can tell me tell me how you really yeah you're right I gotta say that it really is a testament I guess to my naivete or just stupidity that I got into this business without really thinking about that and I just knew that I wanted to be in the media I wanted to work in TV I wanted to be a writer I wanted to work I wasn't sure if I wanted initially to be in sports or news I started out working in news at a local

[01:04:50] TV station here in New York and transition into sports but I'd been in sports uh that was kind of the tension wasn't was I gonna be in the media it was like what exactly am I gonna do for me that was the question and of course when I made the decision to do sports and not to do news not to do something else then of course you know I was walking right into my father's field and

[01:05:13] I grew up around a guy who I really think what's the best of what he did he was a great writer he was a great journalist he was he was great TV storyteller and I figured well if he could do it I could do it that's amazing you know I do remember reading an interview very recent actually maybe it was maybe maybe as a year ago but someone once asked you about you know lessons you learn from your father and and I would I remember you saying I'm gonna have to paraphrase it the gist of it was what it means to be fair as a reporter what fair journalism means which means you do have to ask hard questions and you do have to probe in areas that are uncomfortable but you've got to have a bit of empathy you have to be able to put yourself in the shoes of the person you're speaking with and I don't know I I feel like that doesn't exist all that much in journalism anymore does it I mean maybe it does and

[01:06:05] I'm just not aware of it and we see so many exceptions but anyway the way you described it I thought was very beautiful and you really attributed it all to your father yeah and I think he did operate in that manner it wasn't just idle talk it was what informed his his body of work and I work in a business where there are people who are all that access and they never ask the tough questions and then I work you know with people to who work with or their RP in the business I don't really I can't think of any colleagues were like this but you see it happen it's like they're tough for the sake of being tough yeah yeah exactly there is how you gonna stick just to be Integris and I think I built a reputation thirty years of the business of being the guy who does ask the tough questions and doesn't shy away and is willing to sacrifice relationships for the truth and that's important but fairness is the underpinning of everything right you know it's not just about being fair to the subject is about being fair to the audience it's about being fair to the story and fair to the truth and it seems like it's a pretty simple principle really - I think it's not like I'm a Scotty Reston here hi but I mean you know I work at the world of sports or the toy department but it's a pretty simple principle but I can't say that it's always applied we were talking about this a while ago but it's sort of hard to believe your father died in 2001 because it feels a lot more recent to me and maybe that's just a sign that we're all getting a little older time starts to travel faster because 2001 on paper is a long time ago but it's interesting because I believe his last broadcast was the Sunday after 9/11 and he actually talked about the insignificance of sport in the context of what had happened what five days earlier he would go on to have an elective hip operation a couple weeks later and one complication / medical error after another and ultimately he died you're young you're 30 at the time 3232 how hard was that oh it was on two levels right I mean I'm asking it what sounds like an idiotic question right it's no it's not hard to lose weight but it's one thing to lose somebody when they're old enough that you just expect to lose them it's another thing when someone goes into the hospital to have a procedure done and mistakes get made and they don't come out of it okay it was devastating I was extremely close with my father and we had been you know for a long time at that point there had been a period you know in my teens and my parents divorced where the relationship had frayed I mean it felt like a million years at the point when it was happening but it's probably 18 months or something like that and then you know I went out to college and then I went to the business and we were doing radio show see I mean we probably spoke once or twice a day and saw each other frequently there lived in the same place and connected by the business work for the same company I mean you know so there's the personal anguish seeing your father go through something like this and he's in a coma most of the time you know you can't communicate with him there's nothing when he goes under they put him in you know an induced coma to let him heal you never get a chance to say goodbye and 13 weeks and I see you you know what that takes out of family and the guilt like are you there every day you're not there I mean you know all of that stuff and then for it to also be playing out you know it's a public story as well people what happened in Dick

[01:09:38] Schaap what's going on how sick is he is he gonna recover yeah you know that doesn't make it any easier and this is all against the backdrop of this national calamity which had taken place a few miles south of the hospital in which he was in the intensive care unit so there is that surreal grief-stricken moment as well in the history of the city in that country so it all feels like a bad dream everything that was going on in the fall of 2001 for me you know and then you know there were moments also it's all it's made even more painful by the moments where you think they're telling you oh he's made a turn for the better he's gonna be

[01:10:16] I mean literally I think within two or three days before he died it seemed like he had suddenly recovered and they were making plans to take him out of the coma and slowly wake him up again and you know but you got to remember you know I remember having a talk with one of the doctors like you gotta understand your father's gonna be he's recovering but he's not gonna be the same guy he's gonna have to go to a rehab facility for awhile you know strength back and this and that but he's gonna be back I mean and then all of a sudden was like and I don't even you know honestly I don't remember what happened in those two or three days after that I mean I remember what happened I remember being there when he died but I don't remember how it went from so hopeful and optimistic to over very quickly so it was very hard on seven levels is there anything about that collective experience meaning the loss of your father which is I mean literally superimposed on 9/11 that made you revisit your connection to sports did you ever go through the phase of oh my god I'm devoting my life to a game versus no wait a minute Sports is an amazing substrate for metaphor for life like how did you go through that thought process I mean I remember very vividly having a discussion I don't know if he remembers but having a discussion with

[01:11:35] Keith Olbermann during the baseball playoffs that year and we were so this is a few weeks after 9/11 with my father in a coma in the hospital and we weren't talking about that we were talking about 9/11 and Keith who at that time was still working in sports I think it Fox Sports at that time Keith's a very smart guy friend of mine smart guy he was telling me like we can't be in sports anymore everything is over everything we've known has changed everything nothing will ever be the same the country is going to be under constant I mean there was all you know he's saying you know get out of sports now because nobody's gonna care about sports anymore and I remember not being able really even in that moment process were you saying but it certainly made sense it's how we felt at the time as a country like everything was discombobulated we know where we stood anymore in some regards but for me personally I remember having that discussion but I don't remember that being a moment where

[01:12:31] I saying myself I want to get out of sports I want to do something different I I'd had those discussions a few years before that people at ABC News about maybe transition I remember I wanted to go I had a meeting up there one point where I said you know I I don't want to work at sports anymore I want to transition I want to go cover the war in the Balkans or something like that and like no we don't want you to get killed over there something like that and I wasn't qualified but no I I don't remember reassessing my relationship with sports in that moment except I did have an immediate reaction to the whole idea that sports was gonna make everything better and if the Yankees won the World Series which they went ended up losing that it was this that it would be this moment of catharsis or something like that I thought it would be a few minutes of catharsis what do you think today many years later right we're already we're back in the swing of things what do you think is the most important thing that following sports as a spectator as a fan does for us because in many ways what people like you do is you provide a narrative that gives us who don't know as much a nuanced understanding again just even to me like you probably won't find a bigger

[01:13:47] ESPN 30 for 30 fan than me like there might be two I haven't seen but I love that type of deep exploration the story behind the story behind the story what do you think that does for people outside of the obvious which is teaches you about a sporting event well I think that there's a greater appreciation now for sports is something more than the toys or the toy department when we cover it that you know it's not just tribal it brings us all together right I mean I travel all over the country

[01:14:19] I travel internationally a lot you can have discussions with sports with people anywhere and it's you know in a lot of ways it's gotten harder to have discussions about other things as we know and and sports can be divisive as well so so there is the sense that it is this lingua franca right some guy I don't know I'm sitting next to on a plane we could have a four-hour discussion because you can't you don't want to talk about religion or politics and yeah there are too many things you can't talk about anymore there's that and we just like talk about sports - we like sports and sometimes we overlook like the physicality of it how much watching just the remarkable way that athletes use their bodies and their minds we sometimes lose appreciation for that there are so many things about sports that can be edifying and also for me I've used sports as a platform to tell stories about other things going on in the world that transcend sports about societal issues about cultural issues about crises of sexual abuse homophobia whatever they are I mean a lot of the stories that I've done over the years

[01:15:23] Sports is a starting point it's a hook and then it's about something bigger and sports does that in a way right that other things don't because so much of us are interested in sports you know there's a reason why Jackie Robinson breaking the color line in 1947 is one of the most important moments in the annals of the civil rights struggle why that's a watershed moment there's a reason why Muhammad Ali refusing induction is a watershed moment whether you agree or disagree with him sports touches us in a different way in a touch a society in a different way in title nine which wasn't just about sports we see mostly through the prism of sports when we talk about equality for women and the way in my father's lifetime that the emergence of the african-american athlete was I think the big story you know in a lot of ways last 40 years the emergence of the female athlete the empowerment of the female athlete has been the big story and sports is usually

[01:16:27] I'm not gonna say always but seems usually to be in the vanguard you know when where society is going you see at first happening in sports now in some ways Sports is old-fashioned and and resistant to change and there plenty of examples of that as well I mean we could talk about golf clubs and that kind of stuff but sports has marked change and it's drawn our attention to issues and I did a story about out camp anise on the 30th I guess it was a 25th anniversary at the time of you know his infamous

[01:16:56] Nightline interview where he said blacks lacked a necessity used to be coaches and general managers and I interviewed Ted Koppel and Ted Koppel told me I mean Ted Koppel the greatest television newsman I would argue of the last 50 years the guy you know he said the one episode of Nightline the one edition of

[01:17:19] Nightline he gets asked about the most is the al campanis episode where he was so great in that moment and he was so fair but persistence and tough and you know it but my point is that that moment it sparked the discussion about a lot more than coaches in the NFL or whatever I know you know so Jeremy you reported on a ton of stories in sports and again I'm a fan of many of them but has there ever been one that you've done where in retrospect you look back and you feel you made a mistake yeah you know I'm not sure if I would characterize it as a mistake and it's complicated but I was the guy covering the home run chase in 1998 for

[01:18:01] ESPN with Mark McGwire Wow you know so I was there I saw I think 20 of the 70 home runs he had in person and I dipped in a couple times early in the season to do stuff when he was on a great pace I think but I'd really picked it up in September I think when he had that crazy September so does that mean you interacted with Maris's family as well

[01:18:24] I never interacted with Roger Maris's family no but I was there when he broke the record when he hit 60 I mean I was there I think for every home run from 52 to 70 well and there had been the story that summer about the andro and the locker which now seems like I don't know if it was a red herring that he was planting or you know if that's the right way to put whatever it was but looking back now of course 20 years later or even five years afterwards I wish I approached that story with more skepticism do you think you were just so caught up in the moment like you couldn't believe is what happening you know it was funny because of course it wasn't as if it wasn't out there in the ether you know people were talking about steroids people had talked about them with him going back you know years before but the subject was kind of taboo the Andros story seemed to put everything arrest like oh he's not doing steroids that are yeah it's understand ion which at the time was a supplement that was basically legal right and question became well maybe it is legal you shouldn't be using it and the guy was prying and I certainly didn't say vouch for him and say he's clean or anything like that but in the absence of evidence that he was cheating we just kind of bought the story and I wish I'd been more skeptical because I don't know what I could have expressed the time and

[01:19:49] I'm not letting myself off hook it was the entire national media there was nobody expressing at any skepticism everybody was celebrating this everybody was so excited about the home run chase and Sammy and Mark and all that I was around Sammy too but not the way that I was around mark I was covering mark every day for like a month plus I wish I'd been more skeptical now because everything I saw was fake was all fake it doesn't mean anything anymore you know I saved the newspaper with Mark at 62 I'm like wow I saw something really his story in the whole country was I mean you would have thought that you know he'd landed on the moon so I wish I approached that with more skepticism later when I covered cycling and I covered the Tour de France so I covered Lance Armstrong's last two Tour de France victories and that I covered his comeback as well I did ask the questions as I recall you know I asked them Lance how does anybody do this without being on EPO or where I mean I asked the questions but again after he's denies it there was great reporting there was some great reporting being done by David

[01:20:58] Walsh at the London Times he got sued the London Times lost a million pounds I believe I'm sure they've got back more in spades right yeah going after him so I asked the questions but it was kind of like everybody else asking the questions but not digging deep enough to get to the truth which was that Lance was cheating too in some ways it's a bit sad I've always had a soft spot in my heart for

[01:21:19] Roger Maris because he's sort of a footnote to this story but in some ways you could make the case he's still the homerun King and in that sense that to me is where and I'm probably biased but I find the cycling quote unquote scandal to be less upsetting because it really was a uniform playing is everybody doing it I mean you couldn't be a GC contender between 91 and 2010 without being protocols were too good get into effect yeah whereas we do tend to forget what

[01:21:48] Mickey Mantle did and what I mean Mickey Mantle as if he's in a different league cause he's so loved but Maris sort of gets forgotten in a way and when you think of that season when he hit 61 and how hated he was trying to do it and chase down Babe Ruth's record like I don't know I just have this soft spot in my heart for this guy oh you know and then that phony stuff with

[01:22:10] McGwire and Sosa paying tribute to Maris his family at the time I mean that now we look at and it's upsetting this was Roger Maris his legacy that record the 61 and it was stolen from him I and I think that's a fair way to characterize it look a lot of guys were doing it now the counter-argument which again I think the counter against a reasonable one is hey the pitches we're also doing it and the pitchers were harder to hit off and does that normalize it does that equalize it well the evidence of course is that it didn't normalize it enough because the the obvious way to Lodi which yeah and it's not just its magnitude you're the doctor you understand this stuff just because they're both using it doesn't mean that it's as beneficial to the pictures as it is to the hitters and we saw that well that's interesting because when you think of it that way and and I can see why in hindsight you know and I've actually had this discussion with Lance which was I actually believed Lance was clean until and this might make me sound like a dope Alpe d'Huez nope because this is so silly you can do the math and justify on a watts per kilo you you could say look given what he did in 93 as a world champion in Oslo like the stuff that he would say back then yeah he the world champion you know but well but even doing the numbers like you look at the watts per kilo that on the watts per kilo incline when it became clear to me that he absolutely had to be doing this was when when Tyler Hamilton came out because Tyler Hamilton was the first guy that came out that I thought was truly believable I don't know there's I don't know Tyler I've never met him but he just struck me as so credible and when Tyler basically spilled his beans and that's when you realized how ubiquitous it was because prior to Tyler like you could make the case ma'am not everybody's doing it but when Tyler came out and said oh no no no we're all do also this stuff with the andreas it was frankly it I remember thinking that well why would they be lying

[01:24:01] I mean they've I the position is I remember it was they were compelled to testify to tell what happened in that hospital room they didn't volunteer they weren't selling books they weren't doing anything like that they were asked under oath what happened what was the conversation because Lance was getting sued and they said you know he had done steroids and so it was easier for me to dismiss that because I always thought Betsy had a little bit of a different agenda I thought deep down Betsy was more pissed that Frankie had done these drugs behind her back I always thought there was something going on there right I just didn't see why they would lie in rows I always thought Betsy kind of wanted to be in the limelight more but to me Tyler was the most credible cyclist to come forward and everybody who was covering it and I was there for three summers if you'd ask them your life's at stake what's the bright answer here you know the lady or the tire like so yeah yeah we said he's doing it yeah they're all doing it he's doing it but we didn't have the proof yeah I mean water couldn't bust them the Cycling

[01:25:06] Federation couldn't bust him the French couldn't bust him the Spanish couldn't bust them they had a very sophisticated almost clownish Lee also brazen it in some ways you know they were so good at concealing it and they were so aggressive about going after anybody who questioned them but we all fought and I will say this though it is really chaps my ass that those seven years have no champion and yet you look in the years before in the years after and there's a champion I mean to me that is ridiculous and I this'll be there's a lot that's ridiculous this will be the single most unpopular thing I'll ever say I'm sure I absolutely believed Lance Armstrong deserves his yellow jerseys back because if you're going to take his away you better take away Pantani's you better take away Ulrich and you better take away Bjorn Rees and probably Miguel in

[01:25:54] Duran and you know me need to take away some of my wrong no no none it is ridiculous that's not right that doesn't make any sense it's totally crazy well and they certainly took away Floyd's yes but then they gave it to the guy right behind right I mean it's so ridiculous yeah so well anyway no that's

[01:26:11] I can I can see how now with the benefits of hindsight and you feel foolish for having been swept up into it we all do right I mean we feel like yeah and at the same times like well you asked the question you get your kind of same response from Lance you know why would I do that why would I put that in my body you know and everybody was so swept up in the story the redemption story the comeback story the survivors story it was stuff I think it's interesting today to look at cycling because to be honest with you

[01:26:42] I'm too far away from the sport and the numbers and they're still very concealed in what they do but I still think there's something going on I just don't know what it is me neither what's the most interesting story you think that's out there that isn't being told yet in sports there's so many stories that I think we don't pay attention I mean their big issue stories obviously the head trauma story is the biggest I think the biggest or in the last 20 years in sports that's a story that's still obviously in the news all the time that is being covered are you surprised it hasn't had a bigger impact I mean or maybe it hasn't I just

[01:27:18] I'm not aware of the metrics but I would say it's had big impact I mean youth participation tackle football in certain parts of country plummeting and if that happens it's a time question until college football starts to decline and they've college football declines then what does the NFL look like in 20 years and that's the million-dollar question right like it does football have an existential problem does it find a way to change the nature of what it's been for so long in a way that will alleviate concerns about the long-term effects of head trauma does it become more regionalized where we see it in certain parts of the country where people say this is part of what we do there's part of our culture and we reject the narrative that it's going to destroy the brains of those who play we don't know we don't know I mean of course what we do know is that everything changes when you're in the moment it seems like nothing will change the NFL will always be number one football will always be the most popular sport you know that's probably how it felt to fans of baseball 60 years ago or to fans of boxing and we see in the 1930s are fans of harness racing in the first decade of the 20th century but what we do know is everything changes is is head trauma going to be what changes the way we consume football or is it only going to change the way that participate in football there's a decline in participation necessarily lead to a decline in fan interest in viewership the other thing I have learned is not not only does nothing stay number one and everything changes but no one can see the future

[01:29:00] I mean nobody is good at seeing the future with anything those who can many just get lucky and they don't do it a lot or they'd be in Vegas we're now New Jersey yeah I'd love to know what you think is this story that's not being told yet because I I mean I think about it a little bit from my lens and one of the things that I find interesting is why drugs will always exist in some sports and why some sports seem relatively free of drugs because I think drugs would help any athlete in any sport I mean I can't think of a sport in which a drug a performance-enhancing drug won't make a difference and yet there are some sports that are relatively clean like swimming if you look at the United States in Australia the two most dominant no there are certainly countries that have had lots of cheating but I do believe and I don't

[01:29:47] I don't think history will prove me wrong but it could I don't think that Australia and the United States have a doping program in swimming and yet they're you know the two most dominant countries but yet if you look at other Olympic sports I mean I am convinced the track and field is always going to be full of growth hormone because you know it's undetectable right that's the story

[01:30:06] I was going to say is the biggest story when she brought up drugs is that human growth hormone is undetectable so when we talk about guys who are clean we talk about female athletes who are clean we really don't know what we're talking about yeah because HGH is effective it does work it makes a huge difference and they say their tests that detect it but they really don't right you can test for its byproducts but it's not like testosterone if a person takes exogenously Ostrom you can look for pear molecules you can look for epi testosterone and if that's not rising at the levels of test run you know they're taking it exhaustion see and you can look at other hormones that get suppressed when you take testosterone so if you're taking testosterone exogenously from outside the body the pituitary hormones that tell the body to make it luteinizing hormone follicle so measurement they go down yeah there's lots of ways but no I think human growth hormone I don't have a lot of experience with it even clinically know how effective it is but I think it's used pretty rampantly my intuition is that that is certainly in most sports got to be the drug of choice right now and I think from my standpoint the interest is do we have any sense of what the long-term harm is which I don't pretend to know yeah I don't either obviously well we've got to get to this thing tonight don't we do we do we have to get there we have to we got about a mile and a quarter to cover so in it's rush hour in New York we're gonna walk there faster than we're gonna go last question what is your favorite 34:30 that you weren't involved in making well

[01:31:38] I'm not involved give me three we're not even ranking them if you want just give me a few of your 34 30s that you know I it's an answer I think a lot of people give I thought the Escobar is the too Escobar's oh that's great I thought that was always show heartbreaking yeah I was at that game at the Rose Bowl you were at that game it was 1994 before I remember that vividly do you buy that if

[01:32:01] Pablo Escobar was still alive Escobar would not have been killed you know it's been about nine years since that came out I don't remember my feelings I don't even remember was that the conclusion that was drawn being I don't even remember if that was the conclusion drawn from the thirty four thirty or if it was just my conclusion post-hoc and maybe it was like rejuvenated when I watched narcosis a few years ago and I guess I got all reminded of write everything in

[01:32:24] Escobar's life and sort of the weird sense of loyalty that he had like he was sort of this evil guy with a with like a good streak in him and would he have you know I don't know I wondered yeah I thought that was really powerful and well done I thought the night show was really really well done as well that's a very recent one there been so many last year alone there was the two bills thing oh the two bills was pretty darn good it's interesting yeah those guys well you know one of the ones that I loved watching even when it came out cuz it came out so Bo Jackson when I was a kid like that was my prime I couldn't say that when I was in that one that's right

[01:33:02] I'm disqualified ya know when I go back and watch that and my wife and I were talking about this because we watched it for like a third time a year ago maybe we had that moment of are you freaking kidding me like I almost forgot how athletic that guy was like you could make the case he's the greatest athlete ever well my father said he was my father voted for him is the greatest athlete of the 20th century in the sports entry polling and and I think he had a great case it's interesting though recently I was with somebody who had played I was interviewing Matt Millen who was waiting for a new heart just got a heart on

[01:33:42] Christmas Eve he's doing well at this point I'm gonna see him again next week and Matt was telling me you know the teammate in Oakland said a funny thing is and he had teammates who said this like bo was obviously a credible track athlete incredible football player incredible baseball player but he couldn't dribble a basketball interesting and he couldn't this wasn't Madison right he couldn't catch the football you know because he was a pretty good defensive player in the outfield like he was not a good pass catcher I mean he didn't know the right technique to catch a football as a running back coming out of the backfield it was all hands and he didn't know how to use his body to catch a ball and he said I think he said you know there were guys they try to teach me I say so it's an interesting dichotomy right because he's this incredible athlete with incredible hand-eye coordination incredible strength incredible speed could have won the Olympic decathlon I think honestly if he dedicated himself to that but they're also these kind of little gaps yeah yeah which we're mind when we talk about him of course then I also think about you know what story hasn't been done yet because it's been done but it hasn't been closed I'm kind of waiting for Barry Bonds to just acknowledge the steroid use like I feel like aren't we past the point where this matters can't we just have an open and honest discussion about it and close the chapter well Sammy Sosa would tell you no I did something with Sammy this year he certainly wasn't prepared to go that far

[01:35:06] I think from Barry's perspective what does he have to gain and Barry's always had how do I put this a complicated relationship with the media and how he cares I don't think he has any interest in see I mean this isn't closure I'm gonna create a lot of enemies by saying this but I wish that Barry Bonds could just acknowledge what he did and get into the

[01:35:29] Hall of Fame and be done with it and we could acknowledge that that was the era that we were in a lot of people would find that a very controversial view but oh I don't think it's necessarily gonna work either because Mark McGwire's admitted and he's not an all of Fame yeah I know they're they're different but Barry you could make a much better case for Barry Bonds than Mark McGwire you could you know it's an interesting thing though right like I've thought about this a lot probably way too much [Music] all that and I've heard the argument many times Roger Clemens and Barry Bonds are different because they were Hall of

[01:35:58] Fame players before they started taking steroids although of course we don't know when they started taking steroids and this is based on the assumption that they did take steroids and it's hard to state that as just a fact it's more complicated than that but let's assume they did take steroids and they should be the Hall of Fame because they were these kinds of once in a lifetime once in a generation players before I said okay I get that but they're being kept out because they desecrated the record book in the minds of the voters by cheating they broke faith with the history of the game and the record book and all that they made a mockery of these hallowed numbers which means so much in baseball not other sports and nobody says well Joe Jackson I guess a few people Joe Jackson's not in the Hall of Fame nobody would dispute the fact that he was a Hall of Fame player before the 1919 World Series you know it's like well he should be in the Hall of Fame because up until the point that he participated in the fix or did not do anything to stand in its way he was a

[01:37:00] Hall of Fame player yeah 356 career hitter he's one of the greatest hitters of all time Babe Ruth I think called him a greatest hitter of all time he'd been around long enough he's got the career numbers and all that but you don't make the argument well okay but let's put him the whole thing because of what he did it's it's what you did at that moment that disqualifies you yeah these are such tough questions and for the sake of time

[01:37:20] I'm not going to take us down the path of cycling which is another sport where I think you can't do grand tours without drugs and we've had a period there was a 20-year period from trial at 91 to 2011 2010 I would say when the drug use was simply comical and what do we do with those years but anyway all that said Jeremy this has been I think it will be the shortest podcast

[01:37:42] I've ever done but that's only because we have this time we're gonna have to do it again then yes I mean we'll do around to Molly but no this has been super interesting and I just think that I have a complicated relationship with sports sometimes I feel guilty for caring sometimes I feel like why do I care so much about this why am I not caring more about something else that quote-unquote matters more but in the end I think why

[01:38:04] I care about sports is they are basically the substrate for some of the greatest metaphors we have in life and I think when I think about why do I want my kids to play sports it's not because I think any one of them will ever be a professional athlete it's because of what they learn about themselves in this quest there's no doubt about that and the other thing is I mean sometimes I think most people are over this but kind of the snobbish way of you know sports is one thing but the fine arts are something else or you know ballet or opera or theater are on some plane that's above sports look I'll say this there is nothing else I mean I'm a

[01:38:43] Giants fan I was at the Super Bowl Super Bowl 25 when they won that game against the bills and last second when Scott Norwood missed that kick that kind of joy you that's another amazing that might have been that was good the four falls above hello is there's nothing else I am a fan of the theater I'm a fan of the Arts I'm a fan of music you don't go to a concert or you don't go to a Broadway show or anything like that in the end of it go completely nuts the way that say for instance it's Super

[01:39:13] Bowl 25 I was going nuts or all those hundreds of thousands of other fans are going I was at the World Cup final in 98 in Paris I've been a three World Cup final games I was only one the one in France 98 were the home team one France wins its first World Cup at home and that stadium in Sandy with a hundred thousand people there's nothing else that gives us that kind of moment and that's universal I mean that's around the whole world so there's something special about sports that we've got to acknowledge I think your point about it being the Linda Frank is actually I've never thought of it that way but I think you're right it may be the greatest linga Frank of them all or as I said it incorrectly lingua franca maybe I'm saying it incorrectly you're right I think you're right well Jeremy this is a possum man thank you so much for your time and let's go watch 42 to one for me it's only the 4050 it'll only be my second okay yeah yeah you might still appreciate you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye
