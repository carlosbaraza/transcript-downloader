Erin Michos is an internationally-known leader in preventive cardiology and women’s cardiovascular health. In this episode, Erin discusses current trends in cardiovascular disease (CVD) through the lens of female biology and the observation that major adverse cardiac events in both sexes are on the rise. She walks through risk factors including LDL-cholesterol, apoB, and Lp(a) and makes the case for the importance of early preventative measures. She explains various interventions for reducing risk including a discussion of statins, GLP-1 agonists, PCSK9-inhibitors, and drugs that lower Lp(a). She goes in-depth on female-specific factors that contribute to CVD risk such as pregnancy, grand multiparity (having five or more children), oral contraceptives, menopause, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Additionally, she explains her approach with patients as it relates to the use of hormone replacement therapy and provides advice for people wanting to lower risk both through lifestyle changes & medications.

[00:00:01] foreign [Music] welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter attia this podcast my website and My Weekly Newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness full stop and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level at the end of this episode

[00:00:38] I'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to Peter attiumd.com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode [Music] my guest this week is Aaron mikos Aaron is an internationally known leader in preventative Cardiology women's cardiovascular health and cardio obstetrics she's an associate professor of medicine in the division of

[00:01:02] Cardiology at Johns Hopkins school of medicine The Joint appointment in the department of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health she's also the director of women's cardiovascular health and the associate director of preventative Cardiology with the Johns Hopkins Center of prevention of cardiovascular disease this is an episode that covers a topic that is obviously valuable to understand given that atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death worldwide and while as a topic we've covered in detail in the podcast before

[00:01:31] I think it's an important episode because we focus this conversation around cardiovascular disease and lipids specifically through the lens of female biology we discussed the prevalence of ascbd in females as they age the importance of making interventions early in life the risk of ascvd over the course of Lifetime as opposed to the traditional view which is to only really consider 10-year risk we then probe the ins and outs of CBD lipids and various lipid lowering medications across a female's lifetime including the premenopausal state changes during the perimenopausal state pregnancy and menopause and Beyond we also touch on a number of other subjects that affect a female's risk of ascbd specifically polycystic ovarian syndrome contraceptives glp-1 agonists nutrition metabolic Health familial hypercholesterolemia statins stress HRT and more so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with Dr Aaron mikos [Music] thanks so much for making time Aaron look forward to this discussion we have a lot to talk about but before we do it there's one thing I wanted to just check going through your bio I realized when did you do your residency in medicine because you also did that at Hopkins correct yes so I've been at Hopkins 22 years I did residency 2000 to 2003 and then stayed on for Cardiology fellowship and then joined the faculty so I've been on faculty over 15 years now I did my general surgery there I was there from 01 to 06 which made me realize the probability we haven't passed each other somewhere in the emergency room during residency is exceedingly low right

[00:03:14] I'm sure we must have interacted because I was there all during that time overlapped with my residency and my fellowship I always am amazed when I run into people who I know I was there within there are certain medicine residents I remember very well but just by coincidence you're always in the ER together but obviously it's a huge program so when you went into medicine did you know you want to do Cardiology then to

[00:03:43] miss them the first one so I didn't really know what a career in medicine would be about so I started out my undergrad studies at Northwestern as a molecular biology major through that I interacted with so many pre-med students who are my classmates and their enthusiasm about entering the field was really contagious and I was doing a lot of bench science which is really a good experience I think anybody entering science and medicine should have some bench lab work experience but I began to long for more direct clinical research with direct patient exposure so kind of late I switched to being pre-med kind of my last year of undergrad and applied actually to both a PhD in medical programs and then when I started medical school I really fell in love with

[00:04:26] Cardiology even as a medical student before Medicine Residency I have a real interest in diet and nutrition and exercise and lifestyle and we think that over 90 percent of cardiovascular disease is due to preventable modifiable risk factors and there's you know so much we can do for prevention and this is why I really love being a preventive cardiologist so when I entered Medicine

[00:04:48] Residency I already had my eye towards Cardiology Fellowship you did the full three years of medicine and then you did three years of cards I did four years of cards oh you did so no I I was on the slope you're in the slow track I did three years of residency which is standard and then our Cardiology fellowship program was four years because we emphasized research so

[00:05:08] I did two years of research on a t-32 program and cardiovascular epidemiology and that's where I got my Master's in health science you said something at the outset that I completely agree with and I feel like sometimes I'm banging my head against the wall trying to make this point you said correct me if I misquote you but something to the effect of 90 of cardiovascular disease is preventable when you consider modifiable risk factors is that kind of the gist of what you said yeah that's the data from the inner heart study that 90 percent of action risk was due to preventable risk factors one of the things I tell my patients is that both in the United

[00:05:51] States and globally ascvd is the leading cause of death in fact I was surprised somewhat recently like in the last year to realize how much bigger the Gap is between ascvd and cancer globally than in the U.S it's number one in both but you know when you look at the entire world I believe it's about 18 and a half to 19 million deaths attributed to ascvd versus about 10 or 11 million to cancer it's almost 2x Delta and when you take into account what you just said that between smoking hypertension and controlling APO B you could basically turn that into a disease that would barely rank on the top ten does it surprise you that this doesn't get more attention yeah surprises me and I'm also really concerned that we're reversing these Trends you know the first Statin

[00:06:37] Lovastatin was approved in 1987. after that along with efforts and smoking cessation and blood pressure treatment there was a significant decline in cardio a master's use mortality in men during this time unfortunately CBD mortality was rising in women until around the year 2000 when this came to attention that we need to prevent cardiovascular disease in women's as well and after that time there was dramatic decline in cardiovascular disease mortality in women and continued decline in men but unfortunately in recent years we are no longer making these strides in progress anymore in fact we're no longer even stagnated there's been a Frank uptick in cardiovascular's East mortality in both men and women due to the epidemics of obesity and diabetes and cardiometabolic diseases and that cardiovascular disease mortality is on the rise in younger women and when you look at rates of change the fastest growing heart disease death rate is in middle-aged women age 45 to 64. so this is a particular group that needs more focused attention so we really need to double down on our preventive efforts and it's really disheartening to see that we're no longer making the progress that we used to so if these Trends are not overturned you know heart disease is set to overtake cancer as the leading cause of death in younger women as well I'm really glad you made that point because when you look at with these things called in our practice we have these things called Death bars which is just an analysis that shows mortality sliced and diced in different ways but you know sometimes a graph just says things in a way that it's harder to describe in words and one of the things that does emerge from this analysis is that in middle age cancer is still the biggest killer and of course overall cardiovascular disease is and in old age cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disease dominate but what you said is very distressing if indeed now cardiovascular disease would

[00:08:33] Eclipse cancer in even middle age so overall I'm focused on women's health so cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in women you know women more often fear breast cancer which is a terrible disease my mother had breast cancer but far more women are likely to die of cardiovascular disease than cancer but notably you know in younger individuals under the age of 65 cancer is still the leading cause of death in women but one of my studies that we published in the European heart Journal we track death rates in younger women under the age of 65 in the U.S looking at CDC Wonder data over a 20-year period from 1999 to 2019 and we showed during this time that actually cancer mortality has been declining in younger women which is a good thing but since 2010 heart disease mortality is no longer declining and it's actually rising in these younger women at 0.5 percent per year so it's actually narrowing the gap between cancer deaths and heart disease deaths and the younger female population as well so if these Trends are not overturned as I mentioned you know heart disease is set to overtake cancer as the leading cause of death in younger women which is really discouraging considering that we have so many more tools now for prevention and what was also really disheartening I don't know if you saw this American Heart Association survey that was published in 2021 but the

[00:10:00] American Heart Association has sent out surveys over the years to women about their awareness of heart disease being the leading cause of death in women and back in 2009 you know 65 percent of women reported that they knew that heart disease was the leading cause of death but in 2019 the more recent data 10 years later only 44 percent of women reported that heart disease was a leading cause of death in women they're more likely to report cancer as a leading cause of death so this lack of awareness is worrisome and it was particularly prominent among a non-hispanic black women and among

[00:10:35] Hispanic women and also among the younger women demographic that we're talking about who arguably we could do the most for primordial prevention would be most effective if started earlier I also think there's kind of an emotional thing to this which is even if you don't pose the question directly like a multiple choice question I just find in speaking with my female patients so young female patients I think there's a greater fear of breast cancer than ascvd even though the mortality from heart disease is somewhere between 8 and 10 times greater than that of breast cancer it's amazing to think that they would be more afraid of something that has a log lower difference in mortality what do you think explains that again you can answer this both through a personal lens through the experience with your mother but also professionally given what you study you know I think there's still this lingering notion that somehow heart disease is a man's disease the problem is women have historically been under enrolled in randomized clinical trial files so we previously had limited data on efficacy and safety of Therapies in women so both women think that they're at lower risk than they really are but also clinicians so clinicians even when given the same 10-year estimated risk or burden or risk factors clinicians are more likely to perceive women to being at lower risk and this leads to under treatment and particularly you know I see this with women who have FH familial hypocolesterolemia who are under treated because on average in the non-fh population women tend to develop cardiovascular disease about 10 years later than men somehow thought that premenopausal women of reproductive years are somehow protected but we don't see this in FH FH affects one in 250 individuals it's autosomal dominant which means women are equally affected as men and it's associated with a 20-fold increased risk of CBD women with

[00:12:34] FH have an earlier onset of ascvd about 20 to 30 years earlier than women without FH and they continue to be under treated but notably in the FH population women have the same age early age of onset as CBD as men do so they are not protected they don't have this premenopausal advantage and it's still really disheartening to me to see that these women who have very high genetic risk are not being treated because of concerns about pregnancy which you can talk about are management around there but it's better to even have short interruptions in treatment than to let these women who have genetically High very high ldls be marinating in this atherogenesis for decades and decades untreated which you know Dooms them to earlier onset morbidity and mortality if not treated let's put some of these numbers to folks I don't know if these are still the correct data but the last time I looked this was sort of a directionally correct we use 65 as the dividing line between quote unquote young and old and the data basically suggested that if you consider all the people who are going to suffer a major adverse cardiac event in their life and you consider men and ask the question what fraction of men will experience their first event of The Men Who experience a major adverse cardiac event in life what fraction will experience it before the age of 65 the answer was fully half again this is to dispel the notion that cardiovascular disease is an old person disease because I don't think most people would consider someone who's 60 years old to be old by today's standards and even in women to your point who have this time shift of about one decade still one-third of women who will experience a major adverse cardiac event in their life will do so before the age of 65. those were the data about five or six years ago do you believe that that is still the case yes unfortunately you know women um

[00:14:37] but they're still at risk and they're less likely to be treated you know when you look at the data from like the Yum Mi young Cardinal infarction cohort before the onset of their myocardial infarction you know women were less likely to have been treated and perceived to be at lower risk so this is really concerning about the under treatment of women and this presumption that they're lower risk we know that smoking and diabetes in addition to the

[00:15:03] FH as I mentioned also eliminate any pre-menopausal advantage it's not only really the magnitude of LDL elevation but it's the duration of exposure so even exposure to mild or moderately elevated LDL for a sufficient number of years has increased the risk of ascbd to an earlier onset compared to individuals who have had lifetime low LDL and so by waiting to treat individuals until later of life you know you've left atherogenesis you know atherosclerosis propagate unchecked during this time time is never too late to implement prevention but prevention is better implemented when started earlier yeah there's two ways I try to explain this to patients and usually at least one of them works so sometimes patients will come in with some recollection of calculus and you can remind them about the area under the curve and the integral and you can sort of explain that an enormous driver of atherosclerosis is indeed exposure to apob on my podcast the listeners are very astute they understand that we're really talking about APO B which includes of course LDL but also pldl Etc and we say look it's really the time is the x-axis and apob concentration is the y-axis you want to minimize the area under that curve and to your point that means starting earlier and lowering apob or LDL cholesterol more and the longer you wait the more it puts the burden on you to really lower that apob so if that doesn't resonate I think the other way that resonates with people is to think about saving for retirement which is in an Ideal World you'd start saving in your 20s and you wouldn't have to save an enormous amount if you were saving in your 20s but you'd be chipping away at it and building up your coffers and generating a slow and steady incremental return and letting the effective compounding take its toll of course if you wait until you're 40 or 50 you're going to have to be more aggressive in your savings and you're going to also require a higher rate of compounded return if you want to have the same amount when you retire and of course if you wait until you're 60 it doesn't mean that you can't have some sort of financial Independence in your 70s but boy you've got to really sock away a lot of money and you've got to really hope for some pretty impressive returns in the stock market and so usually somewhere between those two explanations people start to understand what you're saying and what people like Peter Libby have said which is it's time exposure to apob do you get the sense that it also works that way with blood pressure and some of the other really clear causative agents for ascvd yes you know you wouldn't take someone who has a younger adult who has a stock blood pressure of 160 and say oh you know your 10-year risk is low in the next 10 years because you're only 30. so you know we're not going to treat you we're going to let this high blood pressure continue on and damage your arteries and cause you know silent vascular damage no you would treat a 30 year old who have elevated blood pressure so this problem with these 10-year risks in younger adults is that yes younger adults are going to have a lower short-term risk over the next 10 years but they have a high you know lifetime risk and that we do them a disservice By ignoring these high values because they haven't crossed some kind of theoretical tenure threshold with exception of guidelines say well FH we would treat if it's above 190 but a lot of patients have mild to moderate elevated cholesterol in younger age years that is not being treated you know

[00:18:36] I tell my patients I'm not just concerned about preventing a heart attack in the next 10 years so I want to prevent them from having a heart attack over the next 40 years and so this is where we need to have much more focus on prevention and this does emphasize the role of Lifestyle as well and healthy dietary changes and really healthy lifestyle should really begin in utero you just took a real page out of Alan

[00:18:58] Snyderman's Jama paper from a few years ago where he really just took aim at this ridiculous notion of tenure risk being remotely helpful in young people one of the exercises I like to do with patients is take them to the Mesa risk calculator page and basically demonstrate for them how much it's driven by age if you go to the lowest end of that calculator which I think is 40 or 45 there's almost no variable you can put in there that gets you to a high enough 10-year risk that you would trigger treatment five percent ten year risk okay now we need to act conversely at a high enough age there's almost no variable you can put in there for which the risk is low enough in other words age is the biggest driver of risk how do you think we got here because you've clearly I think identified the jugular issue which is the time Horizon of risk and yet somehow when it comes to lipids we stick to it and yet when it comes to smoking and blood pressure we don't we treat the causative agent when we're dealing with blood pressure and smoking and yet we somehow ignore the causative agent of apob when we're talking about lipids and focus instead of time Horizon the problem is a randomized clinical trials do serve as our primary evidence base for guideline recommendations and they're very very important but you know randomized clinical trials are expensive and so you run them over a you know generally a short time period you know five years and you want to enroll high-risk people that are going to have events over the next five years you really can't feasibly do a randomized clinical trial for decades and decades and so by Nature these lower risk individuals and younger adults are not included in these trials and then it comes down to the fact that we don't have data specifically for treatment in this population but I definitely hone down on Lifestyle Changes particularly in younger adults and I think we're going to get into women's specific factors a little bit later and talk about pregnancy but High adverse lipid panel elevated triglycerides elevated total cholesterol and chronic hypertension and obesity these cardiometabolic risk factors if women are entering pregnancy at in poor cardiometabolic health which the data shows that there's been an increase in this us you know they're more likely to have these adverse pregnancy outcomes like preeclampsia and gestational diabetes that not only increase their risk of short-term complications at delivery but also impact their risk even decade or more after their index pregnancy really we need to shift

[00:21:37] Improvement in cardiometabolic health earlier in life which means in young adults and women of reproductive age I agree with that completely and I want to come back to it in more detail but I still feel like there is a double standard going back to what we talked about earlier in that we don't have a study that says not smoking if you're aged 30 to 40 is going to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease but yet there's not a physician out there that doesn't recommend smoking cessation to a person the minute they pick up a cigarette why it's because we've identified causality once you identify causality that's all that matters the same is true with blood pressure we don't have a hypertensive study that looked at people age 25 to 35 or 35 to 45 where we reduce blood pressure and showed a dramatic reduction in events because they probably weren't going to have the events in the time Horizon of the study and so the reason it's very easy for any physician to treat hypertension in a 35 year old is because they're treating the causal agent and that's where I'm frustrated Aaron is we have the same level of causality for APO B there is no ambiguity about this and yet we somehow have this double standard where we ignore the causal agent I agree with you we have overwhelming evidence that LDL is a causal factor in atherosclerosis we have data from observational studies from genetic studies from Interventional trials it meets all the criteria for a causal Factor you can just ask me to speculate you know why you know I'm not sure why that there hasn't been a greater uptick about treating in younger ages and this focus on 10-year risk score point out though in randomized clinical trials none of the randomized clinical trials enrolled people on the basis of a 10-year cut point the pooled cohort equation has never been tested in a randomized clinical fashion about treating People based on a full cohort equation cut Point versus another cut point that was never been tested you know the trials have specific enrollment criteria and they really weren't based on 10-year risk scores they were based on other factors and so this over-reliance on tenure risk scores but

[00:23:52] I will say that you have made some progress and I was really pleased I was a co-author on the 2019 ACC aha primary prevention guidelines we do acknowledge the limitations of these 10-year risk scores they can both overestimate risk in certain populations such as older adults and those with higher socioeconomic status and they can underestimate risk in other populations such as those with more social deprivation and these other unique risk factors that are not captured in these 10-year risk score and so they acknowledge this they'd still feel like you should do some kind of risk assessment as a starting point and very low risk individuals less than five percent tenure risk lifestyle may be enough and high risks individuals above 20 10-year risk you want to use your high intensity Statin to lower LDL by 50 or more but they do allow more room now for the borderline intermediate risk to consider these risk enhancing factors of which apob and light particle a are some of them but I also was really pleased that they've acknowledged these female specific factors that we'll talk more about early menopause and adverse pregnancy outcomes like preeclampsia and so the presence of these risk enhancers and those of borderline intermediate risk would favor the initiation of statins and then if there is still uncertainty about risk even after you estimate tenure risk and consider those risk enhancing factors you can get a coronary artery calcium score to help refine risk a little bit better and guide share decision making things so my practice I use a lot of coronary calcium scoring and particularly for elevated scores I'll even treat individuals similar to secondary prevention population but we know that even that doesn't work very well in the younger population that we're talking about less than 40 because it takes time for plaque to calcify and so a zero calcium score a young adult isn't as reassuring as a zero score in an older adult you know they get they might be at low risk the short term for sure but they may still have high lifetime risk we've gone back and forth in our practice about how to use calcium scores and I think come to the same conclusion you have right which is that in a young patient frankly I would say younger than 50 truthfully

[00:26:04] I don't know that a zero calcium score tells me much first of all we know that 15 of zero calcium scores are false negatives anyway if you do a CTA a CT angiogram listener you're going to see a calcification that was missed because the CTA has much finer slices than the CAC or you're going to see soft plaque in fact one series found that I think almost two percent of zero scores on cax actually had hemodynamically significant lesions on CTA even if you put aside the false positives or the false negatives rather to your point the physiology of the disease tells us that's the wrong metric to care about it's more interesting I suppose when you have perfectly clean ctas in 70 year olds with hyperlipidemia to which you can say well look clearly this person has other factors that are protective we might not understand what they are and this is a patient in whom aggressive treatment probably isn't necessary especially if they don't feel if the patient themselves doesn't want it so let's now talk about this thing that you've brought up on two occasions which I think is really important if I'm understanding you correctly which is if we think about the lack of progress or the regression in progress I guess that's been made over the past decade am I understanding you correctly that it has been less about a reduction in treatment for the preventative measures of ascvd and more about the increase in the background metabolic dysfunction or have both of these things been happening together well both of these things have been happening together in terms of treatment individuals are still under treated we see this over and over again in Registries if you look at even the highest risk patients such as those with ascbd from the gold registry in the U.S and the Santorini registry in Europe patients are not at goal with their LDL and they're under treated you know in the gold registry of U.S patients with ascbd more than two-thirds remained with an LDL above 70 and we can argue that maybe they should even have their LDL as low as 55 but we even use a threshold of 70 as the goal for initiating a non-statin therapy to a Statin two-thirds were Above This goal and over a two-year period only 17 percent had their lip glowing therapy intensified so there's this credible inertia so patients are not at goal the use of combination therapy including with PCS canine Inhibitors is very underutilized as something like six percent in this cohort and so we're certainly not treating with the tools that we have which is really disheartening but also on the backdrop of this we've all seen the U.S maps about the epidemic of obesity and along with that comes diabetes another disorders related to insulin resistance including worry some

[00:28:49] Trends with increasing maternal mortality Rising rates of gestational diabetes which is increasing worldwide and so the cardiometabolic health of the U.S population is getting worse over time and so we're shifting more morbidity to younger and younger age groups which is not a good thing at all and likely going to affect anticipated life expectancy Trends to reverse so Aaron obviously these trends that you're observing the increase in obesity the increase in insulin resistance the increase in type 2 diabetes although you didn't state it it's embedded within here the increase in nathal D and Nash the increase as you said in gestational diabetes I mean all of these things are basically growing out of metabolic syndrome You could argue now I don't know the latest stats but do you know what fraction people the United States now have metabolic syndrome I don't know

[00:29:39] I've had my head for metabolic syndrome but it's huge we know that diabetes rates are certainly going up with over 1 in 10 U.S adults having diabetes and many with diabetes don't even know that they have it so there's a latency in diagnosis so this is all really alarming Trends especially when we have a lot of therapies we can do for prevention but of course one of the most important prevention therapies I can prescribe for my patients is Lifestyle Changes even modest weight loss and a pretty significant impact on proglycerides and blood pressure reduction so it's always is important that you know we can talk about all the new exciting therapies we have for weight loss like the glp-1 receptor agonists and the Dual agonists but really you know still emphasizing healthy lifestyle from childhood is still such an important strategy for prevention so we know it's multifaceted

[00:30:30] I don't think any serious commentator on this will point to one thing and say that's the culprit for why we're seeing this epidemic but how do you rank order these things so what is the causative driver in your mind for weight loss how much of that do you think lies at the feet of lower exercise levels versus food availability hyperpalatability specific elements within the diet how do you start to disentangle this because I think without some level of granularity there it becomes difficult to say lose weight an overweight person shows up and you tell them to lose weight that's not a particularly helpful insight so in other words to prescribe something insightful we have to have some sense of what the etiology so how do you think about that first of all I'm trying to prevent or reverse the trends of obesity on a population basis and so we put too much blame on the individual but we have you know major societal and population problems with the easy access to poor quality food these highly processed foods that are extremely palatable but contain a lot of saturated fats and other additives and sugars the way our jobs are structured to be more sedentary and long commute times you know having access to Safe places to exercise and having time to do so and they increase stress levels in life I mean there's so many social determinants of Health that have led to this problem and there's huge parts of the country where there's food deserts where there's not access to fruits and vegetables or food swamps that are just really only available cheap and easy foods or these highly processed packaged Foods so as individuals we do have some responsibility for our own life choices larger issues should be placed in regulation and policy on a population level and then you know once an individual is already obese it's much harder than to lose weight we certainly talk about lifestyle changes but obesity is far more complicated there's all kinds of hormonal regulations and it's not just as easy as calories in calories out the good news for these individuals is that at least now we do have some new pharmacological agents that are beneficial in weight loss that do not have cardiovascular harm like some of the older weight loss drugs and may actually be cardiovascularly beneficial we know the glp-1 receptor agonists at least in patients with type 2 diabetes you know reduces the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and stroke and so while we do have an outcome trial ongoing right now in person who were overweight and obese but without diabetes with the glp-1 receptor agonists I'm anticipating this will also be beneficial for cardiovascular disease so we have new options to treat obesity but really trying to focus on prevention of obesity in the first place because it's certainly not feasible to treat two-thirds of U.S adults or overweight and obese the statistics are astronomical and they're astounding so we really need to focus on population interventions which gop-1 Agonist are we looking at now is it semiglutite or to zapatide so they're different so semoglotide is a glp-1 receptor Agonist and at least in patients and type 2 diabetes we have cardiovascular outcome data for the injectable the subcutaneous dose there is an outcome date ongoing for the oral formulation but we don't have that data yet so usually I prescribe the injectable form now sir septibite is the new kid on the Block it's a dual Agonist a Gip glp-1 receptor

[00:34:18] Agonist this has been approved also for diabetes although the outcome trial for diabetes is ongoing the surmount outcome trial but it also has been evaluated for weight loss and really showed dramatic weight loss you know up to 50 pounds in the highest dose which is really remarkable you know we can't compare trials head to head because they were not compared head to head but in the step trials with some aglotide there was about a 30 or so pound weight loss so traceptivide is not yet FDA approved for weight management although it will likely have this indication soon but it was it is approved for type 2 diabetes so magnetite is approved for both type 2 diabetes for reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events but it also has a separate weight loss indication for persons who are obese with BMI above 30 or overweight with a BMI over 27 in the setting of one or more obesity related cardiovascular risk factors who need additional weight management after diet and lifestyle attempts so we have new agents now which is really exciting but getting back to we need to do on a larger population to reverse the overall trends of obesity before we leave the glp-1 agonists in the Dual receptor

[00:35:36] Agonist what is your best guess as to the mechanism by which they also reduce cardiac events if it indeed is beyond weight loss in other words do you think it's all due to to the benefits of weight loss which of course bring with it an improvement in metabolic health or do you think there's something specific there that's going on and I would ask the same question eventually although we don't have to discuss it now with sglt2

[00:35:58] Inhibitors the glp-1 receptor Agnes you know I don't know that we fully understand all of the benefits on the mechanisms for benefits but we know that the benefits of reducing major adverse cardiovascular events are independent of its A1C lowering these are interesting agents that in persons with elevated glucose such as diabetes you know they lower blood glucose but in persons who don't have elevated glucose such as those who are overweight and obese who don't have diabetes you know glp ones don't cause hypoglycemia solo agents so they only lower blood glucose in a glucose dependent fashion but the benefit on base reduction which has been shown in persons with type 2 diabetes is independent of A1C lowering it may in part be related to favorable changes and other risk factors such as reduction in blood pressure and weight loss there's

[00:36:52] Improvement in the lipid panel it's being investigated also in nafld as well there may be anti-inflammatory effects there may be anti-authorscrotic effects there also may be some effects you know in the kidney we do see a reduction in albinuria with these agents as well so they're really an interesting class of drugs so let's now turn our attention to specifically the physiology of women as it pertains to lipids in ascbd so I think we should maybe to make it easier at least start with premenopausal women what's happening in a woman's body when she's 25 that's different from a man's body when he's 25 as it pertains to sex hormones and the interaction therefore with lipids and other factors that impact the simmering process of ascvd sure and first I just wanted to give sort of a broad statement I'm glad that we're having this discussion about lipids and women and ascvd and women because there are differences you know women are not smaller men or have unique risk factors even among traditional risk factors diabetes and smoking confer a greater relative risk in women than in men and then women have unique risk factors that we'll talk more about throughout their lifespan that men do not related to menarchy when earlier late and polycystic ovary syndrome and infertility spontaneous pregnancy loss parody adverse pregnancy outcomes like preeclampsia lack of breastfeeding and early menopause in addition you know chronic inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus are more prevalent in women so women having these unique risk factors that are female specific or female predominant and cardiovascular disease also can be different in women which is why we need more trials in women you know women are more likely to have ischemia with non-obstructive coronary disease from coronary microvascular dysfunction or coronary vasospasm they're more likely to have scad spontaneous coronary artery dissection and more likely to have stress cardiopathy than men so we really need more data about treating cardiovascular disease in women but let's talk about the life cycle that you alluded to in the beginning with your question estradiol is the predominant female sex hormone in women of reproductive age that seems to have the beneficial effects with lowering LDL and conferring some cardiovascular protective properties but I should mention there's actually three types of estrogen so estradiol which is the predominant one in women in childbearing age and this is the most potent form of estrogen so estradiol is E2 so estriol E3 is the main estrogen producer in pregnancy and then estrone E1 is the only estrogen produced after menopause it's also the weakest estrogen so you know starting with puberty puberty is a process that starts in the brain so the hypothalamus in the brain suddenly begins secreting gonadotropin releasing hormone or GnRH

[00:39:55] FSH and LH levels gradually increase during puberty which stimulate the follicle maturation and estrogen production and the ovaries and also the secondary sex characteristics like breast changes and changes in body composition this gets to the point where then there's the onset of menarchy or the first Menses and so this is typically you know around age 12 and it's important to note that you know I treat adult patients but why I even ask adult women about the onset of menarchy is because both early menarchy before the age of 11 and also late menarchy after the age of 17 has been associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk later in life and there's likely hormonal and adipocine and cardiometabolic imprinting that's related to this there's lots of factors related to the onset of menarchy but both social economic and environmental factors as well as genetic factors but elevated BMI is a risk factor for early onset menarchy which is why again it's important that we think about healthy lifestyle starting in childhood and I'll talk a little bit now about the menstrual cycle because many people don't know but the lipids do change throughout the menstrual cycle difference in little cholesterol you know as much as 10 to 12 milligrams per deciliter difference and so while most women of reproductive age who have lower

[00:41:18] LDL this is not probably clinically significant in terms of athergenesis it doesn't matter when thinking about the timing of measuring a lipid panel during the menstrual cycle I think that's important to note so during the menstrual cycle you have the hypothalamus is releasing GnRH which causes the pituitary gland to release

[00:41:40] FSH so FSH is acting on the ovaries to mature the follicles and that the follicles of the ovaries is what secretes estradiol and so estradiol causes the maturation of the egg and the thickening of the uterus lining and preparation for a fertilized egg implant and then the increased estradiol triggers the release of LH which induces ovulation and release of the egg and so ovulation ends the follicular phase and then after ovulation you're in the gluteal phase where estradiol with progestin prepare the womb for implantation but if the egg isn't fertilized the corpus luteum which is secreting the progesterone breaks down so this leads to a drop in progesterone level in the beginning of the menstrual period what does this mean for lipids so after men sees you know total cholesterol and LDL increase rapidly after Menses and so they really Peak during this follicular phase and then this is followed by a decline in the luteal phase which corresponds to the rise in the peak concentration of estrogen and progesterone so when estradiol is the highest in the menstrual cycle this leads to the fall and total cholesterol and LDL HDL is highest around ovulation triglycerides didn't really have a consistent pattern during the menstrual cycle so there isn't specific guidance and sorry just to make sure I understood that Aaron the difference between the peak and Nader of

[00:43:09] LDL cholesterol is about 10 to 12 milligrams per deciliter or is that total cholesterol that was total cholesterol but it mirrors the difference in LDL as well so this was a study that um published on average total cholesterol may go from 158 to 168 where LDL on average went from 97 to 102. so you know they're not dramatic changes which is why we don't worry about this too much and women of reproductive ages who don't have a lipid disorder but it's you know interesting to note but if a woman is very high risk like has ascbd and we're trying to Target these really intensive thresholds like ldls less than 70 or even lower it's useful to know that they do change throughout the menstrual cycle so while there's no specific guidance around this you know I generally recommend clinicians measure the lipid panel during the Menses so that it's ideally measured monitored and compared at the same time during the menstrual cycle so usually the Menses is easiest to Benchmark to we do that when we're concerned with as women become perimenopausal and we want to start getting a sense of what's Happening we always use day five so if the initiation of Menses even if it's spotting is day one but we always just pick day five and that way we have a really consistent view specifically of FSH and estradiol progesterone is zero at that time but the FSH and the estradiol really give us a sense of how close she's probably getting to menopause and then we correlate that with symptoms to sort of start to think about initiating HRT but that's a whole other topic which I'm sure we'll get to and in terms of lipid panel it's good to be measuring around the same time each month so if you're following serial lipid panels in a woman for a reason so timing it around day five especially if you're measuring other hormones but yeah so FSH would be at the highest during the early follicular page and then declines after ovulation where LH is low during the early follicular phase and then Peaks around an ovulation which stimulates the egg to be released at this point in a woman's life she still enjoys this for all intents and purposes decade advantage over men in terms of ascvd risk so a 40 year old woman who is still ovulating is at a cardiovascular standpoint as a 30 year old man is that directionally what we would say prior to menopause yeah I mean on average and again people are not averages you know people are individuals but on average there is a about 10-year offset of ascvd in women involving it later than men and this may be because we'll talk about when we get to menopause you know with the loss of estradiol after menopause

[00:46:00] LDL levels rise after menopause and so that women may have higher ldls a little bit later in life you know many women's tell me oh you know I've always had good lipid levels and now they're higher you know after menopause and so when we get back to what we started with about the integration of duration of LDL exposure in terms of cholesterol years they may have had lower number of cholesterol years during their child bearing years and then higher levels later in life and that might be why they have this offset but again you don't see this in FH and we don't see this as well in diabetes and so each person is an individual and so we do women a disservice when we presume that all women somehow are lower risk or protected during their menopausal years because we started out this podcast talking about that we absolutely see myocardial events not just things like scad but we see actual atherosclerotic myocardial infarction events in younger women too so they're at lower risk but not zero risk and so we take each person as an individual and then there are things we need to consider related to contraceptions and

[00:47:10] PCOS that can also affect the lipid profile as well let's take each of those then because I think they're both incredibly fascinating and highly prevalent so let's start with PCOS tell folks what it is maybe what the prevalence is what we think the etiology is and of course what the impact is on metabolic health and ultimately lipids so polycystic ovary syndrome or PCOS is the most common endocrine abnormality of women of reproductive age estimates are about 5 to 13 percent of women in the general population and it does affect women of all racnicities it's categorized sort of by this Triad of hyperandrogenism ovulatory dysfunction so irregular

[00:47:49] Menses or an ovulatory cycles and polycystic ovary morphology so just having cyst in the ovary in itself is not enough for the diagnosis you need to have these other criteria it is a heterogeneous disorder and that there are differences in risk with PCOS but really if you talk about the classical PCOS it has the hyperandrogen form this seems to be the one that is the most strongly linked with cardiovascular risk and the cardiometabolic phenotype so we really think that insulin resistance is hallmarking under the pathogenesis of this that there is molecular defects in insulin activities and PCOS that leads to impaired glucose tolerance and glucose insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia

[00:48:35] Studies have shown that about 95 percent of obese women with PCOS and about 75 percent of lean women with PCOS has insulin resistance so there is a lean PCOS phenotype you know while most women with PCOS do have an elevated body mass index not all women have an elevated body mass index but this insulin resistance is probably driving a lot of the cardio metabolic complications so elevations and blood pressure and dyslipidemia patterns so we see this the

[00:49:06] Triad of dyslipidemia with the elevated LDL elevated triglycerides and low HDL this metabolic syndrome pattern PCOS is associated with hypertension and incident hypertension and this is actually independent of BMI but obesity increases the risk and makes the risk greater and there is an association not only with increased subclinical atherosclerosis I recently published a meta-analysis where we showed that with a PCOS were twofold more likely to have coronary calcium they're also more likely to carotid plaque but they're also associated with increased cardiovascular disease later in life and the variable estimates have varied across studies and this is likely because how PCOS was defined I mean how cardiovascular disease was defined and so they're it's not quite consistent across every study but on average about 30 to 50 percent increased risk that we saw in an umbrella review of a meta-analysis of future cardiovascular risk now there's a little bit of debate about whether PCOS is causally related to CBD this excess risk that we see seems to be moral women during reproductive age once women's already after menopause having a prior history of PCOS doesn't seem to confer the same level of risk and likely because of all of the increased risk after the menopause transition with the low estradiol and the more Androgen phenotype after menopause probably outweighs or overshadows any prior risk related to PCOS but there does seem to be this long-term risk but when you look at mendelian randomization studies that does suggest that the elevated testosterone the hyperandrogen the

[00:50:49] Obesity the higher insulin levels insulin resistance and lower levels of sexual and binding globulin do appear to have a causal relationship with PCOS based on genetics and so it may be that these are the mediating factors that link PCOS us with future cardiovascular disease risk obviously there's an enormous impact on fertility our multiple pregnancies associated with an increased risk of ascvd or decreased risk based on the estrogen PCOS is associated with infertility and this is one of the Mainstay of treatment of Uma

[00:51:22] PCOS who are not wanting to become pregnant of course is oral contraceptives to kind of reduce the hyperandrogenism we recently published though a study looking at National Data of pregnancies at delivery and we did show that women you know pcosity did become pregnant you know they were at greater risk for preeclampsia and many gestational diabetes and many cardiovascular complications compared to women with PCOS so it's important to you know note that not only are they at increased risks have decreased fertility and trouble getting pregnant that once they do become pregnant they are at increased risk of cardiovascular complications and delivery so it's really important with PCOS and and that we optimize healthier lifestyle and weight management may be really important to mitigate some of the cardiometabolic risk I'm interested you know on women who are not trying to become pregnant or not pregnant glp-1 receptor agonists may be promising to help with the weight management and the insulin resistance you know we talked about that class of drugs and even

[00:52:25] Statin therapy May reduce some of the testosterone or the Androgen Associated risk so that's what PCOS but I think that you asked about parity in general so when you look at parity or the number of live births there does seem to be a j Point J shape relationship with higher parity particularly more than four or five live births being associated with subsequent risk of cardiovascular disease the reason for this is not quite known I showed in the Mesa study that women who had histogram multi-party you know were much more likely to be in poor cardiovascular health later in life at middle aged older age compared to a less porous women you know women tend to gain weight with each pregnancy but there may be also dysregulation of adipocins that sets the stage for later cardiometabolic complications and so this is why it's really important that we try to optimize

[00:53:22] Women's cardiometabolic Health before pregnancy and enter pregnancy between pregnancies to try to prevent these long-term complications so I mean I wouldn't tell a woman that they can't become pregnant a certain number of times but I would really try to work with them to try to optimize their cardiometabolic health I feel like your intuition is right there Aaron I've always found the epidemiology on number of pregnancies and disease X to be completely full of confounders such to the point that I think the Epi provides no Insight whereas I think the confounder you mentioned is the most obvious one right which is the more pregnancies a woman has the more likely you could believe believe that she's having difficulty getting back to her pre never pregnant state of metabolic

[00:54:10] Health not just weight but overall metabolic health and that would strike me as a greater risk factor again I one can't know this without randomization we're obviously not going to have that so it probably shouldn't factor into decision making now we'll mention that there are a couple studies epidemiology studies and parody history they don't ask men these questions you know they only ask them of women but there were a couple studies where they assessed number of children and men and parody is actually a risk factor for CBD and men too so this likely gets to your point about confounding by social economic factors and cultural factors education factors that might lead a family to have more children rather than less but the risk does seem to be a little greater in women suggesting that there may be some true biological effects maybe weight mediated Beyond just confounding by socioeconomic and cultural factors let's talk about the impact of oral contraceptives even outside of the case of PCOS so if you have a young woman who wants to use OCS as a form of birth control what is the impact that that if any has on her lifelong risk of ascvd via the let's just say she's going to go on it for a decade age 25 to 35 and then have kids 35 to 40 and then goes through menopause at 50 is there some impact that that decade being on an ocp has on her down the line productive age May

[00:55:39] ANS for various reasons so it's not just pregnancy prevention but maybe for treatment of menstrual cycle disorders PCOS acne there's lots of reasons why they might start oral contraceptive therapy there's the risks likely you know depends so much based on formulation and type so you know we can't link all contraceptives in one bin oral combine hormonal contraceptives the older formulations had much higher doses of estrogen and so estrogen can increase triglyceride levels it can lower LDL which is a good thing but it can increase triglyceride levels what's the net effect Aaron on APO B Because certainly the analysis I've seen suggest that once you correct for apob triglycerides below 400 milligrams per deciliter really don't mean anything obviously above that level you have to start worrying about pancreatitis but that apob was capturing that risk and it's interesting of course if you're only looking at ldlc and triglyceride it's possible that a rise in triglyceride is problematic because that could actually raise apob as you now have to obviously increase the potential number of both cholesterol and triglyceride trafficking particles I'm guessing that analysis isn't done but do you have an intuition around it

[00:57:03] change you know risk for these lipid changes with oral combine contraceptives you know I think the changes are relatively modest especially since we're using typically now the lower estrogen formulations because it's really the more estrogen that a combined oral hormonal contraceptive contains has the greater impact of increased triglycerides so I don't have that number for you because it really depends on the formulation you know it's unlikely to have much impact in most women but women who already have high

[00:57:32] Baseline triglycerides to begin with it can trigger severe hypertiglyceride anemia above 500 so this probably would not be the agent you'd want to use if your patient already had high triglycerides now the transdermal combined oral hormonal contraceptives the patch is less likely to cause clinically relevant elevations and triglycerides there's of course other types of contraceptives you know in very high-risk women with established cardiovascular disease or women who have

[00:58:03] FH who have very high LDL levels these tier one methods the long-acting reversible methods like the IUD and the implant are safe and effective for most women who even have you know are high risk who have established cardiovascular conditions you know the progesterone based ones like the marina with the progesterone releasing IUD system you know they can marginally you know lower

[00:58:29] Associated lower HDL but usually these revert back to pre-insertion Levels by one year most the time for the iuds the triglycerides and LDL and the cholesterol ratios remain pretty stable so I really don't think that the lipid changes are so much impacted by that and that's why we do tend to recommend the

[00:58:51] IED for women who have FH or cardiovascular disease that are higher at risk let's talk a little bit about pregnancy I guess there's two things I want to chat about the first is obviously what's happened happening to a woman during pregnancy so probably share a little bit more than my wife wishes I would but I sort of used myself and my wife is a guinea pig from time to time and just love checking Labs all the time during I don't know one of the pregnancies maybe it was our second child I probably checked her you know did a very thorough look at her lipids and lipoproteins and everything all the way through her pregnancy I was shocked at how much her lipids Rose during pregnancy my wife is sort of one of those people who genetically has very low burden of APO B so her Baseline LDL cholesterol is probably 60 to 70 milligrams per deciliter or HDL cholesterol might be 80 90 milligrams per deciliter so triglycerides of 40 milligrams per deciliter right so from a lipid lipoprotein standpoint she's pretty uninteresting and I want to say by the third end of second beginning a third trimester you know she looked like she had metabolic syndrome without the triglycerides but just from the standpoint of of some of the other stuff tell me what and I know we hate talking about averages but can you give me just sort of a general sense of what's directionally happening to a woman during pregnancy with respect to her lipids and lipoproteins yeah so absolutely there's changes in lipid panel which is why women with known lipid disorders are recommended to have consultation with a lipid specialist prior to pregnancy but you know even at normal pregnancies serum total cholesterol triglycerides LDL cholesterol lipoproteol a and HDL cholesterol levels all gradually increase and as pregnancy proceeds you know they Peak during the third trimester so you can have about a 25 to 50 percent increase in total cholesterol can be as much as 150 to 300 increase in triglycerides and probably you know relative increase the most and LDL increased by 66 percent and so this is normal physiologic changes because it's you know designed to promote accumulation of maternal fat stores that's going to be a source of calories for the mother and the fetus during later stages of pregnancy and lactation you know the cholesterol increase is needed for utero placental vascularization and placental steroid synthesis placental transport function these are important physiological effects but these changes when someone like your wife who started out so it's such low cholesterol levels these are generally felt to be non-athrogenic because they really do fall precipitively to pre-pregnancy levels following delivery so pregnancy is not a good time really to get a baseline lipid panel because it's not going to be representative of what a woman's typical lipid panel is but in women who have concern for lipid disorder having a baseline lipid panel before pregnancy is helpful so that you can know what to expect and women with FH you know they have the same relative increases but they're starting with such a high

[01:01:57] Baseline level that the magnitude of elevation is even greater you know I realize I've been delinquent in letting us talk shop a bit too much we haven't defined FH other than to note that it's familiar hypercholesterolemia we also noted I think the incidents are prevalence of about one in 200 but we've been a bit delinquent in giving people the magnitude of what it is can you just tell folks a little bit about uh how high a total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol a person with familial hypercholesterolemia typically has and what the lifetime risk of asebd is in that population

[01:02:35] people have women are equally affected as men so the FH pH phenotype LDL above 190 you know there are different scoring systems that you can look with additional criteria based on family personal family history of ascvd and genetic tests are available and there's apps that you can download to determine the likelihood that your patient has you know definitely a probable FH just even having the phenotype of having an LDL above 190 which is not all monogenic FH that is still associated with increased lifetime risk with a 20 to 30 year earlier onset of ascbd and females but if they have the genetic mutation you know having the monogenic mutation their increased risk is even greater than their LDL value so that's why genetic testing is really helpful not only for Cascade effects for determining the risk of their first degree relatives and their offspring but also because they have a greater risk even beyond their absolute LDL value but so 30 percent of women with an untreated

[01:03:45] FH will have a myocardial infarction before the age of 60 and this is why it's so important that we can't ignore FH we need to know FH we need to screen for FH and we need to treat FH women get the same onset as men they don't have the female advantage and they're probably because they're losing many years of Statin therapy because this concern about pregnancy women are with

[01:04:05] FH are under treated I should know that women with FH don't have an increased risk of congenital malformations or preeclampsia which is good they may have a slight increased risk greater risk from alcohol infarction so we can talk about shared decision making about treatment during pregnancy versus you know withholding for a short period of time during pregnancy and lactation but interestingly in some countries you can actually test for the mutation and cord blood and lipid levels in children with

[01:04:35] FH are similar whether they inherited the gene from their mother or the father but for contraception because of their increased risk for atherosclerosis you know we would want to avoid any higher estrogen compounds either use low-dose estrogen oral contraceptives or preferably iuds or barrier techniques especially if they're over the age of 35 to kind of avoid the estrogen oral agents even low dose and consider the

[01:05:02] IUD for contraception so of course most people with FH we don't really know the genetic cause of this you know last I checked there were probably more than 2500 different genetic mutations that produce that phenotype so this is an interesting point that there's still value in looking in other words just having that phenotype how many of the genetic drivers of FH do we know and contribute to that very interesting point you made which is identifying that specific genetic driver carries with an even greater risk than is embedded within the LDL when I see patients clinically for evaluation of FH I do send them they're willing for genetic testing you know trying to discern whether they have the monogenic FH from a mutation in the LDL receptor or apop or pcsk9 of course polygenetic risk can have a similar phenotype to FH we certainly want to reduce their lipids so this comes up you know because we're talking about pregnancy and you know there had been some concern for so long about you know avoiding statins in pregnancy you know for a while had that category X and so this actually led to overabundance of caution with just not treating women of reproductive age with statins at all because of fear that they might accidentally become pregnant and that we really of course do them a disservice if a third are going to be at risk for an MI before the age of 60 if they have FH and we don't treat especially because now you know we have more data suggesting you know of duties of women who did become pregnant while on statins that did not show the teratogenic effects and so statins are probably not teratogenic you know we don't have a ton of data here which is why we still have some caution which most women who are planning a pregnancy you know we do generally still stop the statins during conception during pregnancy and during breastfeeding as shorter term interruptions is better than you know not treating them for decades and decades but with the removal of the fungus warning label by the FDA this does give us some more flexible options so in patients at very high risk such as women who've had a recent acute coronary syndrome as part of shared decision making we could consider using statins during pregnancy but you know we still have less data so for most women we're still stopping the statins but if they do become pregnant you know I usually reassure them and we just stop the Statin once pregnancy is become aware but I think there's a really interesting body of work now about whether statins can actually prevent preeclampsia so in the setting of preeclampsia there is this abnormal trophoblast Invasion and this leads to impaired spiral artery remodeling so essentially what's happening is there's placenta ischemia and this sets off a whole Cascade of adverse hormonal on anti-inflammatory markers so we have this increase in escalate one and a decrease in placental growth factor there's you know this increased sensitivity the Angiotensin II there is other inflammatory and oxidative stress and this sets the stage not only for complications during the pregnancy like preeclampsia but also is likely contributing to vascular damage that increase a woman's risk you know long term after delivery so statins are being you know investigated for preeclampsia prevention because we know in animal studies they can decrease escalate one they can improve endothelial function they can decrease inflammation and oxidative stress so they seem promising there was one study that was published where they gave women for pregnant who are increased risk of preeclampsia pravastatin starting at 35 weeks gestation and didn't show any benefit in preventing preeclampsia but this isn't really surprising because it was just given way too late you know if you know anything about the pathogenesis of preeclampsia you know preeclampsia can generally start after 20 weeks of gestation so you likely would have to intervene you know much earlier in the process so there is a randomized clinical trial I'm going now I'm rolling about 1500 women who are high risk because of a prior history of preeclampsia and they're starting the

[01:09:17] Statin pravastatin versus placebo earlier around 12 weeks of gestation so right after the first trimester the primary outcome is going to be a proportion that developed preeclampsia or patina loss and maternal death and they're looking at other things like preterm delivery so it'll be really interesting to see those results we don't have those results yet but it may be a whole pendulum switch from this absolute avoidance of statins during pregnancy to maybe actually using statins for preeclampsia prevention if these this trial is successful do you think broadly we're seeing a greater Trend towards Statin I don't know phobia for lack of a better word well yes even in sort of the non-pregnant State I meant even more broad yeah exactly I meant just across all of your patients first of all I think there's some misconceptions out there that I still hear people cite this false statement that statins don't work in women in primary prevention and that's completely not true you know in the older studies they just didn't enroll enough women in trials and then primary prevention you know they're at lower risk so they're less likely to have events during the short terms of the trials but you know now we have enough trials the data is in and meta-analysis that included you know over 18 randomized clinical trials over 40 000 women have shown that statins benefit women in both primary and secondary prevention without interaction by sex so meaning and similar risk individuals women benefit from statins just as much as men in both primary prevention whether it was a 15 percent reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events as well as for every one millimole per liter or 39 milligrams per deciliter lowering of LDL and in secondary prevention a little bit greater 22 reduction as well as all-cause mortality was lower in women with statins so women benefit from statins what's the nnt on both of those

[01:11:09] Aaron I would have to get back to you from the meta-analysis I don't know offhand but of course it's Nat is going to depend on primary prevention versus secondary prevention of course the women that were enrolled in these trials were at higher risk but the important thing is that they benefited similarly to men with no effect interaction that's what I was kind of getting at was it in the ballpark of men where your primary preventions could be anywhere from 60 to 100 in your secondary preventions might be you know 30 to 50 does that sort of those numbers kind of ring a bell to me that sounds about right I just don't have that data right in front of me but that sounds about right I can look that up for you but despite the evidence clearly showing that they benefit to get back to your original question women are less likely to be offered a Statin we saw this from the Palm registry and if offered women are more likely to decline or discontinue and the usage registry women were 30 to 50 more likely to report statin-associated muscle symptoms and stop statins for this reason you know even in secondary prevention studies of individuals who have post myocardial infarction you know young women under the age of 55 were significantly less likely than men to be on a Statin you know two months after their Mi you know and these are the highest risk individuals the reason of mine women are still less likely to be on a Statin you know one of my own studies using National representative data from the medical expenditure panel survey it's way to represent U.S adults with ascbd so it's weighted represent 11 million women with ascvd women were 45 percent less likely to be treated on the

[01:12:45] Statin than with men so we know there's lots of and Aaron how much of that do you think is on the shoulders of the physician for either being ignorant or just I guess ignorant would be the only excuse not offering the Statin versus how often is the physician doing the right thing and the patient as a woman specifically is saying you know what this is not the right thing for me so the Palm registices women are less likely to be offered and so this is on the physician side we see this across all kinds of subgroups in both primary prevention secondary prevention and also whether they were treated by you know cardiologists or Primary Care you know women are less likely to be on a Statin but if offered if the clinicians do the right thing and offer women are more likely to decline or discontinue this is a combination of things you know women may still perceive themselves to be lower risk women maybe more fear adverse they also women are report more likely to have Statin Associated muscle symptoms and so this gets down to how much is real versus the nocebo effect you know is it biological differences related to women's smaller body size influenza hormones or is it that maybe women are more socialized to report symptoms or read these warning labels or you know or a possible symptom that could happen or be more concerned I mean we have overwhelming data about the safety of statins serious muscle injuries one in a hundred thousand and randomized clinical trials there's no difference of muscle symptoms between treated and Placebo but we know in real world practice you know up to 30 percent of Statin treated patients will report muscle symptoms so there's this tremendous nocebo effect in Trials like the Samson trial up to 90 percent of

[01:14:32] Statin Associated symptoms was elicited by the placebo too so patients were having symptoms on the statins but 90 of those symptoms were also elicited on the placebo so it really wasn't as more the act of taking the medication compared to the medication itself so we know the nocebo effect is real but the problem is is that this can be challenging to counsel there's a lot of medical misinformation out there and when an individual symptoms are real to them and if they're convinced they're having these symptoms you know it could be hard to break that mindset my practice is all about building trust and you know we build a relationship over time and sometimes you know I start slow or do alternative doses every other day or three times a week and trying to get individuals back on their Statin and show that they tolerate them and have them take a muscle symptom survey and show that a lot of the aches and pains that they have you know were unrelated to the Statin but the good news at least is that we're at least in an error that we have more options than we did before though all individuals who have report status Associated muscle symptoms or

[01:15:37] Statin intolerance you know really should be given a re-challenge for our highest risk patients we have other things zetamine we have the pcsk-9 Inhibitors we have glycerin bumpedoic acid and more things in the pipeline so we have ways to get to LDL goal if patients are willing to work with us and you know while these other therapies are meant to be as an adjunct to diet and lifestyle and maximally tolerated statins for some patients the maximally tolerant Statin is zerostatin and so sometimes we have to move to some of these other agents to get their LDL under control Aaron what's your Statin workflow how do you work through a patient with a Statin so my behavior on this front has evolved a little bit in part just due to experience but also in part due to the arrival of these other agents that you mentioned the big three being acetamide PCS Canon Inhibitors and most recently pepinoic acid but these days I really find myself only fiddling with about three statins truthfully and this excludes patients who show up on one already that they inherit so atorvastatin or something like that but in terms of a naive patient I would say it's really mostly two it's really rezuvastatin and then patavastatin with occasional pravastatin you can imagine obviously the order in which we do that based on symptoms and need walk me through your thinking specifically for women so woman comes in doesn't have FH family history is notable for atherosclerosis but nothing incredibly premature before the age of 60 her APO B is the 70th percentile concordant with her ldlc and after months of being your patient she says you know okay I sort of buy this thesis which is I'm 40 years old my

[01:17:25] LDL is only going to go up from here so let's start to take preventative measurements so this is true primary prevention in a relatively low 10-year risk patient and you have no reason to be concerned with anything else so what's your first line agent what dose and how do you proceed if those issues the highest risk patients we'll go back to your primary prevention patients highest risk patients with ascbd you know we want to obviously get as low as possible as quickly as possible lower for longer for faster and so we do a lot of disservice by starting these really low dose statins and they don't come back for six months to a year and then they never get intensified and patients don't get to goals so in the highest risk patients starting with a high intensity Statin if you start up front that's more likely the dose that they'll stay on and use of combination therapy early so you know just like blood pressure if it's above 160 you know we're thinking combination therapy for blood pressure and I have the same approach really for lipids for very high risk patients such as the ones with the recent coronary syndrome that you know we know what they're a starting LDL is and where we want to go and I always try to aim for at least then less than 55 optimal LDL is probably you know around 30 or lower in these patients you know if where you need to go high intestine statins will lower the LDL by about 50 percent but if you need a greater reduction thinking about combination therapy up early we have some data now about the safety of giving pcsq9

[01:18:50] Inhibitors even in the hospital setting after an acute myocardial infarction can have important changes in plaque stabilization and plaque reduction so being very intense about those treatments I want to make the plug about using combination earlier and more aggressively and at your lower risk primary prevention patient that you started with the modern intensity Statin would be fine I mean it depends on their age if it's a man over 40 or women over 50 get a coronary calcium score you know if they're above the 75th percentile I'm also thinking high intensity Statin and aiming for an LDL less than 70 which is also consideration of pcsk9 Inhibitors even in primary prevention patients if they have significant plaque you know very high calcium scores above 300 but you know in a lower risk person where we're just trying to shift them some lower and sorry just going back to that

[01:19:40] Aaron I know it wasn't my question but since you brought it up is your preferred two line out of the gate reservastatin and azetamide is that your typical starting one-two Punch

[01:19:54] they're very high risk they have astbd and they're very high risk you're going to go pcsk9 plus yeah especially if they have elevated like personal a because statins um zetamide bompanoic acid don't lower lip virtual a so if they had an ascbd event it used to be to get the pcsq9 improved that you had to be on

[01:20:13] Statin and acetamide before you could get the PCS canine approved so I used to use both just knowing that I'm going to move to pcsk9 now it's a little bit easier to get the pcsq9 approved even if you don't have a set of mine on board so these very high-risk patients because acetamide you know you can lower LDL by about you know 16 milligram per deciliter but you want to really get the

[01:20:34] LDL way down in these very high risk patients I'm moving pretty quickly to pcsq9 Inhibitors but at lower risk do you have a preference by the way between prolument and repatha you know so they were never compared head to head so they have a lock of map and all of them have had a similar 15 reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events and in their respective trials the Fourier at

[01:20:57] Odyssey trials and they had similar reduction of hypertual a as well I tend to use a I use whatever one I can get approved so it often is depends on the patient's Insurance mostly if all things you know being equal and either one being approved I probably tend to use more of a lock a map because you don't have to do the dose adjustment the sure click patent is really easy we have our nurse in our Clinic teaches patients and

[01:21:20] I have lots of patients on alarakimab as well closer in you know we're just starting getting experience with onboarding tell folks what that is so the pcsk9 Inhibitors that we were talking about the evalacumab and olorakumab are monoclonal antibodies so pcsk9 is a hepatic Protein that's involved with LDL receptor degradation and this was really interesting how quickly we moved from understanding from genetic studies all the way to translational studies and the bedside you know we know that individuals with pcsk9 genetic mutations that were loss of function these individuals had very low ldls and very low risk of cardiovascular disease of a lifetime were gain a function PCS canine at high ldls and increased CBD risk so by inhibiting this protein by inhibiting the pcsk9 it prevents the LDL receptor degradation so that there is an upper regulation of LDL receptors on the surface of the hepatocyte which leads to

[01:22:28] Greater clearance of LDL out of circulation those were the monoclonal antibodies and we have not only do they lower LDL by about 50 to 60 percent they also have some modest like virtual a lowering around 25 percent but we have two outcome trials Fourier and odyssey Warrior being in stable ascvd and odyssey and patients with recent acute coronary syndrome that show that they also reduce major adverse cardiovascular events as we would anticipate and we now have longer term data for follow-up which you know shows even after these trials end that earlier exposure to evalacabab to exposure to a lower LDL has a legacy effect with continued lower risk of events so I think that the trials were pretty short around two years and the curves were just starting to separate so I think with longer treatment you would have had even a greater reduction since we're talking about women I will just mention unfortunately both of these trials women were only about 25 percent of participants you know women start out with higher ldls for various reasons you know after menopause women tend to have higher ldls compared to men but that they had a similar reduction in LDL with pcsq9 inhibitor therapy in terms of Mace reduction there was no interaction by sex meaning that women benefited these high-risk women who either have ascvd or recent acute coronary syndrome benefited to a similar degree as men did there was no major adverse event difference between the Sexes although women are more likely to report injection site reactions so those have been available for a while and they're in the guidelines now as an add-on to statins and high-risk patients with ascbd or heterozygous FH who need additional LDL lowering I also use them in high risk primer prevention such as those with high calcium scores who need LDL lowering but in closer it is the new kid on the Block so this inhibits pcsk9 but through a different mechanism it's a small interfering RNA so it prevents the translation nation of the pcsk9 protein from being made we have data from the

[01:24:36] Orion 9 10 and 11 trials which was looking at LDL lowering showing that again you know women had higher ldls at Baseline but they had similar reduction within glycerin notably the mechanism in this little different is that you know it's a subcutaneous injection but after the first Baseline in three months it's given every six months so it's designed to be given in a clinic setting as opposed to monoclonal antibodies which people give it home and the frequency of every six months may be attractive for adherence because you give it in the clinic only one more time a year than a flu shot and you can lower LDL by about 50 percent so it may be helpful for adherence it has been approved for LDL lowering and we're starting to onboard it throughout the country in our clinics but it should be noted that we don't yet have the outcome data the Orion 4 or is the cardiovascular outcome trial that's ongoing I anticipate with a 50 reduction in LDL that this will certainly translate into a reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events but we you know don't have that data yet but these are all potential options for patients that need more intensive LDL lowering I can also mention menpadoic acid to round out the new drugs that are available this one also might be interesting in women so bendoic acid is an oral drug and so it blocks ATP Citrus liase which is an enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway so it's Upstream of

[01:26:07] HMG coase reductase which statins inhibit kind of works like in the pathway where statins work where it blocks cholesterol synthesis and so by blocking cholesterol synthesis this leads to upregulation of the LDL receptor on the surface of the liver and more clearance of LDL out of circulation but what's notable about this is that pro drug the enzyme to activate it it's only in the liver not in the muscle so it does not have the same reported muscle symptoms that have been seen with statins and also interestingly it doesn't seem to have the risk of nuance diabetes or the increase in glucose that we see with high intensity statins so alone bumpadoic acid lowers LDL about 18 percent so kind of in your range of acetamide you know a little bit more lowering if it's used as monotherapy without statins about 21 percent and

[01:27:00] Statin intolerant patients it does come as a fixed dose combination with acetamide and together with acetamine you see kind of Greater about 36 percent reduction in LDL so you're kind of getting in the range of your moderate to high intensity statins notably actually in pooled analyzes from the clear studies which were the studies looking at you know the LDL lowering effects of bentoic acid we see that an asevd and FH patients that women seem to actually have a little a bit even greater LDL lowering with bepanoic acid than men and they were more likely to achieve a 30 reduction in LDL with bumpitomic acid than men since women are more likely to have statin-associated muscle symptoms and this agent doesn't cause that this may be a good choice as an oral therapy for women who can't get their LDL control on a Statin or tolerate a Statin so just for the audience we don't have outcome data yet for this either it's been approved for LDL lowering but the big cardiovascular outcome trial clear outcomes enrolled a population with

[01:28:04] Statin intolerance and I was really pleased that nearly 50 percent of trial participants were women likely because women are more likely to have Statin tolerance so this has been closed out and we're anticipating we may hear the results maybe in March of 2023 hopefully is this secondary prevention Aaron no this is high-risk patients there have

[01:28:25] Statin intolerance so high risk primary prevention Statin intolerant yes and secondary prevention patients with Statin intolerance I got you completely off topic from our original question which was low to moderate risk low to moderate short-term risk obviously long-term risk everybody is high risk it's important to say that long time

[01:28:43] Horizon we're all high risk everybody gets atherosclerosis if you live long enough but we've got our woman whose LDL cholesterol is 130 to 140 milligrams per deciliter and she's in her 30s she gets it right she says look nothing's going to happen to me in the next decade but I'm playing the long game here I don't want to have atherosclerosis in my 80s what's your algorithm for Statin Choice out of the gate I tend to use one of the high intensity statins that can you know a bit more potent LDL lowering like atorva or razuba if they don't have CKD because it's important to note that zuba does need to be dose suggested if patients have chronic kidney disease but assuming you know otherwise healthy individuals yeah say she doesn't I use a lot of resuba in my experience they tend to have a little bit less muscle

[01:29:28] Associated symptoms psychologically the doses we do 5 10 20 you know patients feel like they're taking a lower dose when compared to the atorva you know 20 40 80. you tell patients you can't compare milligrams from One agent to another agent because they're completely different drugs people think they're taking lower drugs so lower doses so sometimes there's a lot of buy-in and I have a lot of patients refer to me because if they're a little bit Statin reluctant or Statin hesitant so again this is all in a background of lifestyle changes but if they are concerned at all sometimes I use just resume F5 it's more about buying their trust and getting them used to the idea of taking a stat and we know even in Statin intolerant patients even if we do reserve a five milligrams three times a week we still can have if again

[01:30:16] LDL lowering compared to no Statin at all so for patients that have been Statin intolerant Statin reluctant just getting them to take a low dose and then seeing a little bit is believing and so when we are getting their numbers back and making progress off often then we can adjust up there based on how things are going you know high-risk patients you know I start at the highest dose right off the bat sometimes patients want to check vitamin D and thyroid levels and coenzyme Q10 there really isn't very good data that coenzyme Q10 prevents Statin Associated muscle symptoms but if my patients want to take that because it makes them feel better with the concept taking a Statin I don't object to it but I don't actively prescribe it because there really isn't good data that it really blocks this the same thing with vitamin D there really isn't good data that taking a vitamin D supplement can prevent Statin Associated muscle symptoms but many patients you know want to take that and you know My

[01:31:13] Philosophy is if I could get them on the stat and get their LDL lowering you know I'm willing to work with them on some of these other things um really trying to get their buy-in to get them on a therapy that will lower their LDL and it's really important that I do refer them to our we have a preventive Cardiology nurse who discusses nutrition has I don't want them to think that I don't value diet and lifestyle you know we know that a lot of lipids is predominantly genetically determined but there is influence in diet and I want to emphasize to my patients that this is really a combination approach and that I do take diet and lifestyle you know very seriously as well what type of an impact do you think you can see with manipulating diet presumably mostly through the types of fats they're consuming but more broadly is there how aggressively can you use dietary manipulation especially in a woman who for whatever reason be it pregnancy or just reluctance is hoping to minimize if not avoid the use of lipid lowering medication no but 3 4 or 80 percent of

[01:32:14] LDL is synthesized by the liver so there's you know is a strong genetic component I have lots of patients that are strict vegan and do everything right and they still have high cholesterol and they get so frustrated and you know this is genetically determined and if they had a bad diet their numbers would be so much worse and so it's uh important to note all the good things that they're doing for their diet but also acknowledge that sometimes they're going to need a little help with pharmacotherapy because of the strong genetic determination but you know around the other 20 is influenced by diet so diet does matter particularly in younger adults when we're thinking about adolescents in young adults you know especially when they start earlier in life if we can shift everybody a little bit lower in their LDL by following a healthy diet really since you know early childhood if we can shift everybody lower on LDL this will reduce the total burden of years with LDL elevation so you know we counsel about reduction in saturated fats and focusing on healthier fats the polyunsaturated and the monounsaturated fats increasing fiber fruits vegetables whole grains into their diet really trying to avoid processed foods which are the worst especially processed Meats there are some patients that have already have a

[01:33:30] CBD and they don't want to take a medicine and you know at this point it's like too late you know diet's important but you already have plaque in your arteries you're pretty far along in the process and we need to do everything to prevent further progression and even reverse and we know from you know the

[01:33:47] Ibis studies that high intensity statins and significant LDL lowering can cause atheroma volume regression so it's really a combination of pharmacotherapy and lifestyle changes but for a very low risk young adult I push as hard as we can with healthier lifestyle changes you know it's sort of funny I've gone back and forth on this stuff so much Aaron and I probably sound like a heretic at the moment but I just sort of went through and reviewed as many of the

[01:34:15] Cochrane collaboration meta-analyzes as I could sort of stomach on all of the different fatty acid impacts on cardiovascular disease so if you look at the Cochrane collaboration in 2019 that looks at the role of pufas and then the one in 2020 that looks at the SFA substitution with pufa and mufa and if I came away from this with anything it's that I don't know how much any of that stuff matters once you're in energy balance in other words in the context of over nutrition I think it all is bad in the context of adequate nutrition the ambiguity in these data were enormous and you know I was left basically thinking look on the basis of predimed and the Leone heart study in addition to some epidemiology mufas probably the most important fatty acid and therefore let's just call it 50 of your fat intake should probably be mufa and you know probably after that looks like pufa is a little bit better than

[01:35:19] SFA but I certainly couldn't find a shred of evidence to suggest that aggressive restriction of SFA was in any way protective now of course the opposite which was you do see people that are consuming massive amounts of saturated fat and who have incredible hyper beta lipoproteinemia you know I think that's a clear problem but you know when I think about all of the lifestyle factors I wonder if the one that gets the least attention that has the greatest impact is stress you know because we don't have a pill for it we can offset the harm of nutrition so much easier with pharmacotherapy and yet a person walking around with simmering hypercortisolemia and the effect that that's having on their endothelium and you know their sympathetic nervous system I feel like that's the one that I wish we had a better handle on as far as how to help people because again I we don't have a pill right outside of blood pressure management we don't really have a pill for that what are your thoughts on the role of stress is such a dumb buzzword that I hate it but I really think physiologically it's problematic

[01:36:32] guidelines jacc guidelines really are talking more of a moderate fat intake diet and really a Mediterranean style pattern as you alluded to is what I recommend to my patients you know maybe I'm biased because I'm half Italian I'm married to a Greek but we do have both observational data and clinical trial data a Mediterranean style diet is pretty palatable and it's pretty easy to follow without getting too crazy and it's you know generally low in saturated fats and generally higher in the unsaturated fats lots of fruits and vegetables but it's also the

[01:37:03] Mediterranean lifestyle with increased physical activity more social connection and reduce stress and I'll add in there the importance of physical activity although exercise maybe has less impact on lipids per se than diet it has significant impact on overall cardiovascular risk with both helping with weight maintenance but also increased levels of Fitness is being more fit is one of the strongest favorable factors for lower cardiovascular risks so I definitely encourage regular physical activity as well so I do think mental health is very important that we also address you can't talk about cardiovascular health without talking about mental health and I was a co-author on the American Heart

[01:37:45] Association statement that came out last year about the Mind heart Body Connection where we really talk about both positive psychological factors and negative psychological factors both influence cardiovascular health both in indirect ways and direct ways so what do I mean so an indirect ways so individuals with more negative psychological factors like anxiety stress depression anger you know they might be more likely to have poor coping habits such as they might be eating more poorly and not getting physical activity and having more smoking or more alcohol intake you know and less follow-up with preventive interventions so sort of the indirect mechanisms where the the positive psychological factors those individuals may be more likely if they have a sense of purpose and more optimism to be you know eat healthy and exercise and take their medications and fought with preventive visits but there also may be direct mechanisms as well that stress leads to activation of the sympathetic nervous system increasing heart rate increasing blood pressure increasing release of stress hormones like cortisol that can lead to more insulin resistance more fat deposition and the visceral cavities and more low-grade chronic inflammation and we know that inflammation can also be a trigger for plaque rupture so I do think it's important that we think about the whole person and you know we can make all these recommendations about managing their lipids and things but if we don't take into account some of the challenges that they have in their personal lives and social determinants of Health you know we may not be able to effectively deliver preventive interventions completely agree with everything you said and sorry didn't mean to apply that you were suggesting a low saturated fat diet I was sort of saying that more just as broadly you kind of hear these extreme views I guess what I'm getting at building on what you would say is when I think of the Five Pillars through which we can impact a person's health so nutrition exercise sleep emotional and mental health and pharmacotherapy the lowest impact in my view on cardiovascular disease is through nutrition I think the other four trumpet all day every day and twice on Sundays I don't even think it's close and the reason I mention this and the reason I'm on my soapbox about this is I think the general public seems to think that nutrition is the most important lever in controlling the cardiovascular disease risk I see this a lot right I see the person who ostensibly is eating quote unquote a healthy diet and yet they still have these biomarkers that are horrible and or they even have evidence of clinical disease they have a calcification on their calcium score they have soft plaque on their CTA and they sort of say but look doctor I eat this you know I'm on this diet or that diet and clearly

[01:40:34] I've got it under control and I sort of want to say to them no you don't even have it close to Under Control in your diet it's not even remotely helpful at controlling this and if it is it's it's rearranging that deck chairs on the Titanic at this point those other four things are going to move the needle far more in different amounts and different people there are some people for whom I think you know the stress thing doesn't play a role and there are other people for whom I think it plays an enormous role and every time I'm in Europe I come to the same conclusion you do which is especially in amazing places like Italy which is hands down my favorite place in

[01:41:02] Europe they're way more active they eat less and they just don't give a damn like there's just a sense of it's all okay they're not so wound up the way we are and I think that counts for I don't know I think that's 90 of it right there let's shift gears for a second let's talk about LP little a it's come up a number of times and obviously the listeners on this podcast know the ins and outs of LP little a we've had a number of guests talk about it but we've never spoken about it through two lenses one is specifically through the lens of women versus men anything we need to know and also I want to now talk about the role of LP little a you already alluded to it in pregnancy you know it is an acute phase reactant in a way so you it wouldn't surprise me that LP little a goes up during pregnancy but I also want to talk about what happens after menopause if anything sure I'll talk about that and then I do want to talk more about menopause because I think we talked about menstrual cycles and pre-menopause and PCOS and pregnancy and then we didn't get to really dive into menopause so yes I want to go back that's where I want to go next so yeah I want to go from this directly into menopause and then HRT as well but I wanted to just close the loop on LP little a so lipoprotein little a so I know you've talked about this a lot but just in case there's any new listeners

[01:42:16] I'll just briefly recap it's an lvl-like particle that's comprised both of an APO B which is you know Mark of the bad moieties so it shares protein with other athergenic lipoproteins and then it also has an APO leopardy a moiety and that's what distinguished lipitel a from LDL and this APO a is kind of unique because it has these 10 subdomains of these

[01:42:41] Kringle four domains and that Kringle four two can expand 2 to 40 times and so this leads to a lot of heterogeneity in the population you know 80 or more of individuals actually carry two different isoforms of apoa you know one inherited from each parent and so it's important to recognize this heterogeneity in the multiple isoforms because this accounts for some of the differences in cardiovascular risk that we see by race ethnicity with higher hypertel a levels being seen in black and South Asian individuals compared to whites white individuals but in terms of women there are sex differences so light Patrol a generally is five to ten percent higher in women than in men but there's changes over the life course where leopardual a is relatively constant in men where in women it tends to increase after menopause so it does increase during pregnancy normal pregnancy between 10 to 35 weeks with about a doubling of the value during pregnancy and we think since the levels fall back to their pre-pregnancy

[01:43:41] Baseline after delivery that the short increase is probably not athergenic but it does rise during pregnancy so why do we you know care about Library till a well it's pro-athogenic pro-inflammatory and pro thrombotic and it's associated with cardiovascular risk and as likely for mendelial randomization studies you know causally related to both as CBD as well as calcific stenosis and even in individuals who have ldls less than 70 like in the Copenhagen general population study a librarial a above 50 milligrams per deciliter is still associated with risk of cardiovascular beds so it's still associated with risk even when the LDL is low and you really need to you know measure it because you know if you think your LDL is low you may be missing some residual risk depending on you know whether leopardy a is making up a significant component of that and so mendelian randomization studies do suggest that it is causally associated with cardiovascular risk in women but the impact of therapies and lowering electrical a and what that translates into X actually lowering cardiovascular risk you know is a little bit uncertain and right now we have apheresis for an option for patients with very high liberal a who have

[01:44:57] Progressive cardiovascular disease as we mentioned the monoclonal antibodies of a locomob and all the rakimab as well as in closer and can lower blood pressure about 20 to 25 percent and it seems that actually in those trials that individuals who had the higher leprogel a levels actually drive the greatest benefit from those therapies so it is something that you know if somebody's elevated lipitual a kind of think about moving quickly to pcsk9 if they have another indication such as elevated LDL and the reason you know why to measure it we talked about it being a risk enhancer but also because of these exciting new therapies that are being studied right now and trials the pelicarcin which is an antisensylating nucleotide targeting leopardy and opossaran which is a small interfering

[01:45:46] RNA also targeting the synthesis Electro a and there are some other ones being studied as well another small interfering RNA so we'll have to see you know there's a cardiovascular outcome trial I'm going right now for Pella Carson The Horizon trial to determine how much does lowering light virtual a actually translate into reduction in mace and that one is trial is enrolling high-risk secondary prevention population with elevated leopardual a any concern that we're going to see a rebound increase in LDL with an antisense oligonucleotide so when you knock out LP little a all of those additional ldls that would have been LP little A's just become LPL so your APO B concentration stays the same even though you've shifted the distribution from between LP little a and LDL

[01:46:36] I mean I think this is why we need the trials so with LDL there's a pretty linear relationship that we can anticipate with the degree of LDL lowering you know my one millimole per liter or 39 milligrams per deciliter with reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events being 20 to 30 and this is why therapies like menpadoic acid and glycerin got approved based on their LDL lowering properties even without outcome data because we have a pretty good sense of what lowering LDL is associated with reduced events we really don't have that data for light

[01:47:10] Patrol a other than modeling data certainly It's associated with increased risk but you know some modeling data says you know you might need to reduce cyber tool a as much as 50 to 100 milligrams per deciliter to have a meaningful reduction acbd in the short term and other therapies for example you know niacin lowers lipoportional a but was not shown to have clinical benefit into outcome studies albeit those studies didn't you know enroll based on librarcial a but you know we're not using niacin same thing with hormone replacement therapy estrogen therapy or hormone replacement therapy does lower as associated with lower librarial A

[01:47:47] Levels but we're not recommending it for the sole purpose of light Patrol a because particularly in high risk individuals with ascvd or who multiple risk factors or many years out from the menopause transition this therapy has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk so you know we really need the data we know that these agents pillow Carson and Opus iron can reduce hypertel a by you know 80 to 90 percent which is remarkable considering you know statinsic acid and xenomide you know don't lower it at all statins may even increase it you know pcsk9s only lower it by 25 so that's remarkable that we now have therapies that work in terms of lowering leverage a but what does that mean in terms of vent reduction and

[01:48:33] I think we've been burned from other studies like a c-tip inhibitor and other studies that biomarker data is sometimes not enough and that you actually have to show that it can meaningfully actually reduce risk and so maybe offsetting some of the LDL increase maybe offset any reduction in benefit the other thing I think which warrants further study is in epidemiology studies a very low liberal a levels maybe associated with increased risk of diabetes so what does that mean if you lower to very low upper delay level then I don't know so we really need the trial data super interesting I feel like Tom Dayspring recently sent me an analysis of Odyssey which demonstrated that the greater the reduction in LP little a through the use of problem the greater the reduction in mace am I remembering that correctly yeah so see individuals who experience the greatest reduction in library had greater relative at Absolute reduction in mace major adverse cardiovascular events so it seems to be that lowering leopardial a May in part be uh you know important mediator in the benefits that we see with these agents and it may just not be all due to their

[01:49:49] LDL lowering effects but maybe also due to electrical a lowering effects so that's very encouraging when we think about these new agents but you know this is modeling post-talk analysis from these trials and the pcsk9 Inhibitors also lowered LDL so when you now think about agents that really only target light Patrol a is that going to be sufficient enough to have a meaningful significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events I mean I'm hopeful

[01:50:18] I'm really hopeful because I think it's causal We Know It's associated with risk I'm really excited about the therapies in this area but got to show me the data I got to see the outcome data results well let's talk about menopause you know I'm Amazed taken us this long into a podcast to get to it because it's such an important issue it plays such a huge role in women's health whether it be dementia sarcopenia osteopenia you name it but I don't think I've done a dedicated podcast where we look at the effects of menopause on ascvd we've certainly danced around it today and we've shown our hands a little bit here which is this is an accelerator of risk can you say a little bit more about why is there anything more to it than simply the loss of estradiol leading to an increase in LDL and if so what's the actual mechanism by which that's happening yeah and we started off the program talking about hormone levels so estrogen levels start dropping during perimenopause I'm perimenopause can actually last several years before menopause menopause is one of those things you don't really know it's happened until it's after it's happened because it is officially sort of diagnosed when you haven't had a menstrual cycle for 12 months which usually happens around age 51 but earlier onset of menopause pH for the age of 45 or before the age of 40 is associated with increased cardiovascular risk you know with the primary estrogen of women of reproductive age estradiol drops dramatically and then there the changes to estrone E1 which is the weakest type of estrogen formed in the adrenal glands and other adipose tissues by the way Erin am I remembering my biochemistry correctly estrone exists in three variants or it can be converted into four hydroxy eight

[01:52:09] Hydro C and 16 hydroxy are 2 4 and 8 16 hydroxyestro does that ring a bell at all and the reason I only bring it up is I feel like one of those was more thought to be involved in the creation of breast cancer I'm not sure I can speak on that I'm mostly familiar with just the three major subtypes the E2 estradiol the E1 and the E3 among estrone types I apologize I don't know that data except that it's no worries okay it's a very weak type of estrogen and so essentially you know women after menopause really have very low levels of estrogen in fact women have low after menopause have lower levels of estrogen than men do men have higher estrogen levels because of they have much higher testosterone levels and they have increased peripheral conversion of testosterone estradiols actually men have higher estradiol levels than women after menopause do you know my other favorite stat that's a great one by the way the other favorite stat of mine is that even pre-menopause women have higher testosterone than estrogen if you actually convert the units to the same units

[01:53:12] I think some people think after menopause the ovaries are just not active anymore but that's not true actually after menopause the ovaries continue to just don't make a survival but they continue to produce endorsedinone and testosterone so they keep making androgens really up to significant amounts until age 80. and these androgens are what get converted in fat muscle tissue into estrone so I mentioned this because a lot of my research has been about sex hormone levels after menopause and we've previously shown that post-menopausal women who have higher Androgen levels who have higher testosterone to estrogen ratios you know had a more male-like pattern you know they had greater risk of developing asebd and heart failure over the next 12 years and this was even after we adjusted for risk factors like blood pressure and lipids and diabetes and we did a number of studies as well in the Mesa study the multi-ethic study of atherosclerosis but we also showed that women with higher androgens had more coronary artery calcium progression they had worse and nail filial reactivity they had increase in concentric remodeling you know all this adverse cardiovascular phenotype and also as I mentioned we started out talk about PCOS earlier but in PCOS the riskier phenotype is the hyperandrogenism state and you know testosterone and Industry known and higher LH levels in PCOS as a marker

[01:54:35] PCOS so getting back to menopause a lot of things happen related to these hormonal changes you have more visceral fat deposition in the abdomen and more insulin resistance and this leads to this dyslipidemia pattern of increased triglycerides increase LDL and decrease HDL there's more endothelial dysfunction increased blood pressure increased sympathetic tone so where a lot of cardiovascular risk in women is more linear with aging so for the most part you know blood pressure and diabetes risk tends to be more of an aging effect rather than ovary effect lipids is one thing that really seems to be an ovary effect that we do see you know relatively acute changes in the lipid panel following the final menstrual period with this rise in total cholesterol and LDL I think we alluded to earlier that it's maybe one of the reasons that women tend to have risk a little bit later in life and after menopause is because they tend to have this more dyslipidemia pattern a little bit later in life now this pattern this increased risk you know had led this whole body of work about well these changes are harmful maybe giving menopause hormone therapy would be beneficial and of course you know we did this for years my mother used to be on hormone therapy this is all you know well before the Women's Health

[01:55:52] Initiative study because we just felt that you know oh well you must give these hormones back there are favorable and unfavorable changes that we see with hormone therapy especially this combined therapy so some of the favorable therapy changes if you do give women estrogen you will lower their LDL and it can increase the HDL and as estrogen can have and are you talking about oral estrogen or topical estrogen systemic estrogen which is oral and some dermal vaginal estrogen have much stomach absorption so they're a really good option for women you know

[01:56:27] I'll talk about which women to use hormone therapy in but for women who just have the genital urinary symptoms even in women with cardiovascular disease or history of stroke or you can use vaginal estrogens safely and sometimes I think there's this concern about using them in high-risk women but you can use the vaginal estrogen so I'm really talking about oral estrogens here they dilate the blood vessels through a nitric oxide effect which you know may be all cardio protective but keep in mind estrogens also have unfavorable properties so we know that estrogens can increase CRP so women of higher CRP levels and estrogens are pro-thrombotic

[01:57:03] I mean this is why there is some increased risk with oral contraceptives particularly in women who are older every productive age and combined with smoking and also during pregnancy that estrogens can increase prothrombin decrease anti-thrombin three and we also talked about the estrogen effects with triglycerides same thing with oral contraceptives which have higher estrogen levels hormone therapy also increase triglycerides so in higher risk women particularly those that are farther out from the menopause transition or those with established cardiovascular disease these adverse changes you know may outweigh any favorable benefits and that's why probably the Women's Health Initiative who had the mean age of 63 most of these women were quite far from the menopause transition and the Women's Health

[01:57:53] Initiative also used an oral conjugated equine estrogen with progestin formulation that we saw you know an increased risk including a two-fold increased risk of venous thromboembolism so this is why you know the guidelines all changed and we don't recommend hormone therapy for the sole purpose of cardiovascular disease prevention because we have many other things we can use for prevention like statins but you know the pendulum doesn't have to swing so far away that if you look at sub-analyzes of these trials of women that were closer to the menopause transition younger women we didn't see this excess harm and so while a lot of women are quite symptomatic at menopause you know vasomotor symptoms can be very disabling for many women with the hot flashes and the brain fog in fact vasomotor symptoms in themselves when frequent or persistent are associated with cardiovascular risk and so for symptomatic women who are under the age of 60 or within 10 years of menopause who have symptomatic menopause menopausal hot flashes or night sweats you know consider a hormone therapy women who go through menopause early they don't have other contraindications menopausal hormone therapy is recommended to at least the natural age of menopause or age 51 but generally we're not recommending it if a woman's more than 10 years out for menopause or over age 65 this is where the increased risks are emerging in these trials and we want to avoid oral estrogens in women with a history of cardiovascular disease blood clots hydroglycerides gallbladder disease or higher arrested endometrial cancer particularly the oral estrogens there's probably a little bit less risk with transdermal estrogens which are still systemic but they don't have the first pass effect but I you know very work really closely with our menopause

[01:59:37] Clinic as part of doing a cardiovascular risk assessment prior to use some menopausal hormone therapy so when risk is uncertain you know I get a coronary calcium score to make sure that they don't have any calcified plaque their score is zero I feel pretty comfortable with using hormone therapy in them for treatment of their vasomotor symptoms but if they have significant atherospotic disease you know I tend to not recommend it and again if they're only having genital urinary symptoms topical estrogen is fine you know the risk it really probably depends on a lot of factors it depends on when you start the hormone replacement you know your age and initiation how many years you've been since menopause your menopause age how long you take the therapy the duration the type of therapy the dose on the route of administration and probably your incoming Health the other thing I'm hearing here Erin is this is another reason for young women women who are in their 30s for whom menopause isn't even on the radar this is another reason to be as healthy as possible and to do as much preventative work as possible because if for no other reason it gives you more optionality in menopause my calculus on this is looking at a few things and you know obviously quality of life is one bone health is another muscle mass brain health is a huge one so I'm kind of looking at it as heart health is not even on the radar because to your point we have so many better tools to reduce the risk of ascvd that we don't need to rely on estradiol as one of those tools it's basically a pea shooter and a bazooka fight when we have big big guns to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease so while we're really asking if HRT is to not hurt somebody while we let it do its bazooka-like work which is going to be on the brain bone health vasomotor symptoms eventually vaginal atrophy and things like that for which we don't have

[02:01:35] Alternatives and so to your point the difference between a 50 year old woman who shows up with a beautiful CTA that's Crystal Clear where we're going to have no ambiguity about this line of treatment versus a woman who shows up with a worrisome CTA and yeah maybe even if we go to a transdermal there's going to be more hesitation there's going to be more concern and maybe that slight increase in Risk if it exists is something we now have to weigh in the balance again it all comes back in my mind listening to you to prevention is the key it's just start early and be aggressive and all you do is give yourself more options later in life yeah absolutely the risk is in women with established cardiovascular disease so trying to prevent that plaque you know in the first place you know if there's no atherosclerosis then the the vasodilatory effects and the lowering of

[02:02:27] LDL you know may be helpful and preventing the initiation of atherosclerosis but you know women who already has disease and the slight increase in inflammatory markers and a pro-thrombotic effect you know may tip them over to having a vascular event so all in favorable about improving cardiovascular health earlier in life you know the really how we live the first half of our lives really influences our freedom from morbidity and mortality the second half of our

[02:02:52] Lives any relationship with progesterone and lipids once we get into that menopausal State obviously women who are on estrogen need to either take oral progesterone usually these days it's done micronized or we're even seeing them use progesterone coated iuds if they can't but let's just talk about this systemic progesterone does that have any bearing positive or negative

[02:03:20] uterus that may influence some of the you know again we're not using these for cardiovascular benefit but you know whether it offsets the benefit that we see from the estrogen you mentioned again something at the outside of the podcast which I think is an enormous problem in all of medicine which is the disproportionate shortcoming or shortfall rather of women in clinical trials women as subjects he said something funny earlier that's only funny because it's not true which is women are not little men do you see that changing I guess I'll just ask you to sort of think about it in your field

[02:03:56] I don't expect you to speak about it in terms of fields and oncology or things like that but when you think about cardiovascular medicine be it on the lipid side the hypertensive side all fronts of cardiovascularism medicine are we seeing a more equal I.E 50 50 distribution of patients into clinical trials today or are we still seeing it be more male focused and therefore more underpowered to understand the effective interventions on women so for background you know women who have been historically under enrolled in cardiovascular clinical trials usually only 25 to 30 percent of Trials you know

[02:04:29] I previously published analysis reviewed the literature of lipid lowering trials between 1990 and 2018 so this was just through 2018 so it doesn't reflect the more recent trials but we showed the overall representation of women was only 29 in those trials now for some things like acute coronary syndrome you know the prevalence is less common in women than in men so we benchmarked it to something called a participation a prevalence ratio where a ratio of one would be adequately representation to their prevalence of the disease in the population and we showed that you know women were underrepresented with a prevalence to participation ratio you know generally you know 0.5 or less meaning that even though if they had lower burden of disease they were still under enrolled in Trials related to this we showed also another analysis looking at cardiometabolic drugs through 2017 that had gotten FDA approval for new molecular entities and again showed women only made up like 36 percent of those trials and an editorial we wrote we looked at all kinds of different things stroke coronary syndrome heart failure hypertension and women throughout all these disease entities were under enrolled in trials some things are getting better I mean there are you know I mentioned clear outcomes which is nearly half the participants are women I think this is because it's enrolling a Statin intolerant population there was some of the glp-1 studies like rewind which study delagatide that was largely a primary prevention trial that had like 46 percent women so those were encouraging so I think there's some examples of some improvement but women still for the most part you know we still see trial after trial being published presented at ESC or aha ACC and we're like who are the women why are women continually to be under enrolled and one of the things I'm passionate about is I think that there's unfortunately an under involvement of clinical trial leadership these steering

[02:06:26] Committees of these trials have a dearth of women cardiovascular investigators there was a paper a couple years ago that looked at Major cardiovascular trials you know published in the leading journals New England Journal Jama Lancet you know only 10 percent of trial leaderships midis were women and more than half about 56 of these trial leadership committees had no female representation on the trial none of the trial steering committee were women investigators and less than 10 percent had a woman in the first or last author position and which would indicate a senior leadership position we know from other studies that the likelihood that a study will report a sex and gender-specific Analysis actually is you know increased when there's more women authors of the study and more first and last authors women I think women tend to publish more about science related to women so I do think it matters there is some data from my work and some other work from other authors that have shown a modest correlation it's not perfect but a correlation between the proportion of women authors the the trial steering committees and enrollment of women participants in trials for example we did this for afib and we showed that for every one percent increase in women authors there was a 19 higher enrollment of women participants in the trials I mean there's a lot that we can do to tackle this one of them is having more representation and by diversifying study team and investigators I think also we need to include more patients and trial designs include more women in trial designs patient-centered designs you know we hear that women are approached but often our decline participating in trials and I think women tend to be a little bit more risk adverse and this is where it's really important to provide education dispel misconceptions emphasize the benefits even if we don't know if a drug is going to be beneficial or not there's a lot of benefits with being part of a trial because you have more access to Gold Standard Care and

[02:08:24] More access to study investigators and it's really important to include women in the design and try to understand some of these design issues which may be not so obvious you know such as making sure there's no hidden costs that often people are paid for the drug or device but they're could be things related to

[02:08:43] Transportation or time off work or providing you know for child care or other responsibilities by having more flexible follow-up more pragmatic trials or having a follow-up being online or by phone or by PCP that may get over some of the barriers to enrolling women in the trials which I think can be really helpful and making sure that the study designs are not so restrictive in terms of the inclusion exclusion criteria that we shouldn't just exclude women of child bearing age if they have a plan for preventing pregnancy have an adequate contraception you know women should be eligible for these trials not to mention we actually need more trials and pregnant women too it's just so important to understand what works and what's safe and so there's a lot of barriers to overcome and this barriers need to be both with trial teams and trial designs with the funding agencies institutions and even the journals that publish these trials should be questioning well there's not enough women in the trial so we all need to do better as a randomized clinical trials is our largest evidence base and we want to make sure that something is efficacious but safe in women and that women benefit to a similar degree as men do

[02:09:54] Karen you've run how many marathons oh absolutely knowledge about it but I create marathons you know

[02:10:06] my only goal for these is just finishing as an accomplishment in and of itself are those 38 in 38 different states I'm done about 36 States and then there was a couple States like Maryland where I live that I've repeated more than once is that still a goal you still want those other 14 States yeah so unfortunately I had taken a little bit you know I set back during the covid I had four marathons planned for 2020 and they all got canceled due to covid and without a marathon on the calendar I got a little bit out of the habit of running with these long distances because I didn't really run by myself I do it for the social support with my running groups and so without people or groups to run with and then in 2021 you know the marathon I registered for was canceled as well and so I've gotten sort of out of it for a while but I it's really good that we're canceling outdoor exercise during covid because I can well it's back now so events are back so I am registered for a marathon in October next month it'll be my first marathon again in three years so I'm hoping to get state 37. which state it's New

[02:11:13] Jersey and most the East Coast but this one I haven't done yet and I've been back doing other races I just did a 12 Miler here in Baltimore Baltimore on Saturday last weekend so races are back and they're fun and I just like participating you know you don't have to be good at a hobby to enjoy it so I'll never have any age groups or probably never qualify for Boston but you know sometimes it's just the act of doing something and setting goals for yourself and I love it it's just it's fun that's fantastic well I have such fond memories of Baltimore my wife is from there so there's an additional fondness to it but
