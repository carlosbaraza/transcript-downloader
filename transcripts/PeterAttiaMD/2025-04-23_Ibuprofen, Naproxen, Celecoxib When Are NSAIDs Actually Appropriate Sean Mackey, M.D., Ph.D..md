## Transcript

[00:00:00] Um, but why don't we start with a softball like NSAIDs? How do they work? You know, everybody's heard of Advil, you know, Alie, neproxin, all of these things. What they do is a couple things. They reduce some of the inflammation. They're anti-inflammatories. So I was alluding very briefly that there are substances that can be released out in the periphery during injury that wind up that that noceptor and amplify it.

[00:00:32] Prostaglandins, histamines, cytoines, interlucans, all of that this inflammatory soup that occurs after every single surgery, every single injury that we experience. you get this inflammatory soup and it's classly classically mediated by swelling, redness, temperature increases and aspirin and a COX 2 in uh COX2 inhibitor

[00:00:56] NSAIDs do a nice job in reducing that inflammation. Now this this is where medical science I I I you're going to probably be much more informed on me informed than I am on this but medical science has been slowly shifting in its view of this. We have historically thought take these medications in an acute injury. It knocks down that inflammation and all is well and good.

[00:01:21] Well, some of the data was coming out in the orthopedic literature decades ago that people who were taking NSAIDs during total joint replacements were getting nonfusion of that joint to the bone. They were getting failures. Hm. And then more recently, there's been some question as to whether knocking down the inflammation is a good thing after all.

[00:01:46] That maybe that inflammation is part of the healing process and that by giving an NSAID aspirin, we're delaying the natural healing effect and causing more problems. So, where's the truth? This is tough. One, I don't think we have the whole story yet on the NSAIDs. Two, I'm a gray guy, meaning I don't live in black and white. And I'm also appreciated that every medical field has their own lens that they look at uh in the world. And I think we have to appreciate the complexity of the patient. Meaning if it's perhaps something minor and they can get by without the NSAID and it's not going to change significantly their level of function, then maybe not taking it will improve healing. They can't get out of bed, they can't go to work, but an naperson helps them to do that thing so that they can engage with their family, with their friends, with work. Well, then heck yes. take the

[00:02:55] NSAID, you know, if it's if it's helping with that level of functional improvement. Now, are you talking about this through the lens of acute acute pain or only through the lens of chronic pain at this point? A little of both, but I think through uh chronic pain, we start to introduce all the broader the longer term negative consequences of this, you know, impact on blood pressure, your heart, impact on your kidneys with long-term NSAIDs, particularly if you're older.

[00:03:23] Um, I remember I think it was in your book you took Vio. Yes. I loved Vio. I did too. And I still remember the day in oh god it must have been December 2001 when the FDA came down and said no more Vio. And I looked at my last bottle and I was like oh god no. I stockpiled it. I wish I did. I called up all the drug reps I knew because they couldn't like give it out and I'm like, can you just hook me up? And so I ran out a stockpile of that for a long time. And you know, this is another classic thing.

[00:03:58] If you you can cut this if it's too tangential, but you know, every field looks at the problem through their own lens. Here you had a drug that was causing um heart attacks. Well, I mean, in the world's most susceptible individuals at a relatively small absolute rate. Yeah. I've already had this discussion with Eric Toppel, which was like mistake. Net negative. Oh, is that right? Absolutely. Net negative.

[00:04:28] So, yeah, cuz I've always wondered Merks is faulted. They should have been much more transparent about this. Put a blackbox label on it and we should all still have access. Stop using the 50 milligrams. use the 25s. And you're right, don't give it in susceptible people. And I think it's a class again, the baby got thrown out with the bath water on that one. And it's a CL, you know, it's a we all do this. We look at the world through our own particular field. It's like with the latest blood pressure guidelines, the cardiologists want it really low, but it screws up the kidneys. And well, the cardiologists say, you know, save the heart, screw the kidney. And so, yeah, a great drug. Wish it was still around. Why do you think there hasn't been any drug that's come close to that? Like Celre is a joke.

[00:05:12] Like none of the none of the none of the drugs that are in the had a Vald deoxib I think it was little bit close but I think it if I remember it had a Stevens Johnson uh a bad rash with terrible consequences. I think the drug companies get scared of the lawsuits. Uh oh. So, so NSAIDs uh nuance around taking uh the the vertical do you have a version on on dose? I mean do you say 800 milligrams of uh acceto of um of ibuprofen T three times a day? 2400 milligrams would be you would tolerate that for how many days if a person needed it? Yeah. Uh you know a week to two weeks on that. Make sure you're eating food in the stomach, fluids. If you're either older, you've got kidney issues, you've got GI issues, talk to your doc first. You know, don't just go into this stuff blindly. Yeah, it is interesting that we can buy acetaminophen and ibuprofen over the counter and yet they can cause a ton of damage if not taken correctly. I mean, the ERs see people with uh acetaminophen, Tylenol overdoses, and you know, it's a cause of uh well, you know, liver failure. Liver failure. Now um let's talk about acetaminophen for a while. When I last tried to understand it, there was no clue as to how it worked. Do we to this to this day do we understand how it works? Minimally more information and I haven't in full disclosure I haven't read up on it a lot. I know it has some cylogy um one impact. A lot of it is thought to be central. Um I haven't tracked it much beyond that. I saw some interesting the side studies where it seems to have some impact in the brain around emotional uh modulation and so there's a degree of emotional blunting on acetaminophen. Now whether it translates into a real world or if it's just an experimental manipulation I don't know but but there's a nice synergy with acetaminophen and ibuprofen because different mechanism of action different organ systems are impacted so you can take less of each when you combine them.

[00:07:26] What's your take on that? I think you just said it Peter I mean you said it beautifully. I use those in combination to get the twofur uh to get that synergy. The one plus one is not two but three. So, you can take uh Tylenol. Historically, we would say up to four grams a day. Y um more recently, there's been some push to try to reduce that to two grams a day. Uh clearly, if you've got liver dysfunction, if you are drinking large amounts of alcohol, um less. Yeah. My go-to stack if I am actually in pain, like if I'm having like I uh a year ago I had um I had to get a crown replaced. Yeah. Or sorry. I had to get a a crown put on a tooth that had an old filling that broke. And it's the funniest thing because of how remarkable the teeth are at Sensation, but the crown was a little too high.

[00:08:19] Okay. Okay. So, what's the impact of that? That meant every time I took a bite, that one tooth was bearing the brunt of it. It was the last tooth I had right in front of my wisdom tooth. And I'm talking to my dentist and he's like, "Yeah, Peter, it's just too high. Just come in and let me shave a little bit of it off." Well, I didn't have the time to go in. So for two months I did not go in to get this thing shaved off. The pain was un This is how stupid I am. Like I couldn't spare the two hours to go to the dentist in a and he was willing to see me nights and weekends. This is the most accommodating dentist in the world.

[00:08:52] Everybody should have that kind of dentist. Tony Pacheco. I can't say enough about him. And um and yet I couldn't make the time. So for two months the pain got so bad that I eventually couldn't chew on that side at all. So, my point is I had to be taking something to get through the day. And the stack that worked was uh 400 of

[00:09:15] Advil, 500 of Tylenol three times a day. Okay. Took care of me. Now, let me ask you, does ibuprofen work better for you than naperson? I don't know. But the reason I prefer it is that I can line up the dosing with the obset menophen because I believe napin you only take once a day. Right. Twice a day. Twice a day. Okay. But you're you're right. I wanted something where I could do it T instead of B. Sure. The reason I ask is

[00:09:43] I find huge individual variability in responses to NSAIDs. Okay. Naperson works beautifully for me at 500 twice a day. Ibuprofen not so good. At at what dose? Uh 800 three times a day. Wow. Yeah. with food uh and water. Are there types of pains people should be thinking of where these things work especially well and other areas where yeah that's just not going to have much efficacy. I don't find it as effective in neuropathic pain. It might take a little bit of the edge off. Um no susceptive pain typically is your go-to. You're kind of your no susceptive or your no susceptive inflammatory pain. The kind of pain you'd see in a joint. Those are your typical go-to forms of back pain, particularly, you know, in acute situations, but also somewhat in chronic. And, you know, I get a lot of patients that say, "Yeah, that didn't do it for me." But if you inquire and ask questions, you find maybe it knocked it off a little. Because in our game, we're trying to knock off pieces and pieces and pieces of their pain experience. The issues with the different responses are very individually based.

[00:10:52] And I think in part it has to do with a little bit of what we call pharmacocinetics or where the drug is getting and different NSAIDs can permeate different tissues at different rates. So you're saying it maybe we should be empirical. In other words, try the neproxin, try the ibuprofen, figure out which one works. Obviously don't take them together. Obviously don't take them together, but your take-home message is spot on. Do you have a concern with people taking acetaminophen and consuming alcohol? Do you tell people to refrain from alcohol when they're taking Tylenol? I tell them no more than I I I just said a conservative, listen, don't do more than like a drink a day. You know, is that the right amount? I don't know. But if I tell them one drink a day, they'll go do two. And uh they're probably still okay with uh with that. And then I am looking in their chart just to make sure they're not drinking four or eight or and there's liver issues. What do you do? I

[00:11:48] I typically when I'm taking acetto menophen where I don't drink much anyway, I'm probably going to have four drinks in a week. Um so um meaning four days a week I will have a drink or three days a week. Um but if I am taking Tylenol, I'm just going to refrain. Um again, I don't have any evidence to suggest that that's necessary, but it's it's the precautionary principle at its finest. [Music]
