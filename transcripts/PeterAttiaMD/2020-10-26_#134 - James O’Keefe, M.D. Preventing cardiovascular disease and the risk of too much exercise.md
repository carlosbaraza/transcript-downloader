[00:00:01] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia this podcast my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness full stop and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level at the end of this episode i'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to peteratiamd.com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode [Music] my guest this week is dr james o'keefe james is a cardiologist and medical director of the charles and barbara dubock cardio health and wellness center at saint luke's mid-american heart institute an enormous practice of more than 60 cardiologists in the middle of this lovely country he is also a professor of medicine at the university of missouri-kansas city james has authored best-selling cardiovascular books for health professionals including the complete guide to ekg's dyslipidemia essentials and diabetes essentials james has also co-authored with his wife joan the best-selling consumer health book the forever young diet and lifestyle he is actively involved in patient care and research and has published numerous peer-reviewed articles which honestly i feel like i'm reading at least one every couple of weeks i came across james for the first time about nine or ten years ago when i heard him speak at a conference and frankly what he had to talk about just threw me back on my heels and since that time of course we've become friends and and james is in many ways a mentor to me with all things that pertain to preventative cardiology in this episode we talk about a lot of things starting with his background and how he made the pivot from going into interventional cardiology to now this much broader area of preventative cardiology we get into some really detailed but very accessible physiology of what the heart does how it works and therefore how it's susceptible to disease and then we kind of launch into some of the things i wanted to get to i wanted to talk about the impact of exercise on the heart both positive and negative we go into that in exceptional detail we get into the role of nutrition and specific nutrients such as sodium magnesium etc and then we round the discussion out with a sort of tour de forest discussion of many of the pharmacologic agents that some of you have probably heard of and frankly even you know this this discussion taught me quite a bit and actually invigorated my my knowledge for this space so i always enjoy talking with james and i suspect you will all enjoy this episode very much so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with dr james o'keefe [Music] james thanks so much for sitting down with me today albeit not in the same physical location which is always a shame the last time we were in the same location you you swung by my office in new york i remember it was probably about three years ago and you were kind enough to bring a recent manuscript you just published about the impact of exercise on heart disease and we had a lovely discussion i don't think we had the time for a meal that day because it was an impromptu visit but i never imagined it would be almost three years before we'd be doing our podcast which is something that from the moment i started a podcast i knew i wanted to sit down and talk with you you're also just an incredibly gracious guy who's always sending me stuff and so i i consider you one of those people and as my sort of constant educators so this is going to be an exciting episode because i'm going to be learning a lot and i know that anybody who cares about heart disease is going to be learning a lot and i don't know how you can not care about heart disease if you care about longevity yeah it's the heart of the matter for sure and yeah i think we all instinctively understand how important the heart is to our health and and i might say in the spirit of educating each other i love your podcast i think it is easily my favorite podcast i love the way you dig down into the science and really get to the heart of the matter without overhyping things and i just think you're doing a wonderful public service for improving the health of the population the other thing i'm really impressed at because a lot of my fellows and residents and kids will talk to me about what they heard on peter atiyah so your audience is particularly if i might say tuned in intelligentsia you know interested in health and well-being and i think you have a really you have really curated a remarkable audience oh thank you for that you and i first met probably 11 years ago i think i heard you speaking at a conference and it kind of blew my mind you won't remember this because it's obviously a topic you've been speaking about a lot but as the listener when it's the first time i heard about it it was kind of a gut punch so it was probably 2011 and at that time i was still a wannabe professional athlete so even though i was into my late 30s i still pretended that i was you know a professional something or other swimmer cyclist incredibly high volumes of training incredible intensity of training actually did the math for somebody yesterday and i think i was probably on my bike at least i don't know 20 to 23 hours a week with you know a third of that being at at or above threshold and you presented data basically suggesting that that was harmful potentially and that i may have actually gone too far and i may have actually set myself up for cardiac injury later in life so with that as a teaser i now want to take a step way back and talk about your journey to that among many other topics that interest you you trained as a cardiologist and just for people who don't understand what that means that means after medical school you went and did internal medicine and after internal medicine you then train in cardiology and then you went one step further and said look i want to do interventional cardiology can you tell people what interventional cardiology is yeah so that's using procedures to fix the heart whether it's putting stents in the coronary arteries or putting in pacemakers these days it's expanded to you know fixing the valves it's just the technology is just absolutely spectacular these days we can put in valves we we it's become our default uh way of replacing a valve now is through the through the artery so it's a really cool field at the time i went i trained at the mayo clinic for internal medicine and cardiology and then went down to kansas city at the mid-americart institute in 1988 to work with jeffrey hartzler who was the world's expert in interventional cardiologists he invented infarct angioplasty that is somebody who's having a heart attack he had the sort of hutzpah to you know go in do an angiogram figure out which vessel was blocked open it up with a balloon and suddenly the pain goes away at the time it was radical this is 1980 and he took a lot of heat for that nationally at the meetings but it turned out you know to be a game-changing therapy announced the it's the standard across across the world for you know uh for treating angioplasty so i went there and worked with him and started off my career and and maybe i'll back up saying you know i'm like you i love exercise it's how i calm myself down and cheering myself up whatever i mean it's just always my kids say it's i've been self-medicating my hyperactivity all my life and there's probably some truth to that and it turns out that exercise is good for adhd never had trouble focusing but certainly exercise since i was a little kid is just my mother used to her mantra to us was up in the prairie up in northern north dakota near canada she said you kids go outside and play go school play with your friends outside and and so that was kind of what i did growing up and i got into basketball and running cross-country in high school and i was just fascinated by heart so i figured out i wanted to be a cardiologist when i was 13 or 14 just because i was fascinated with the heart so back to you know through my cardiology training and then doing interventional cardiology and i did it for about a year or two and then i realized this back in the night then we're only doing balloon angioplasty so we'd balloon these dial you know dilate these these vessels up in in elective people we're having an angina and and then they'd be back in six months or a year with more blockages and just don't i mean this is not the ideal way to treat coronary disease this is a systemic disease it's highly modifiable we just need to you know focus double down on prevention and this was just when when you know prevention was blossoming you know statins came along in 86 and you know we're you know the beta blockers and and now i mean it's discontinued to blossom so that coronary disease these days even though it's the leading killer in america should be an entirely preventable medically managed disease unless you have an mi you don't need to be going in having procedures stands electively you know we have we have the tools and so it's also just the more enlightened approach i mean it doesn't pay well you know you don't get paid for prevention but it is the logical way to approach disease whether you're a physician or just a person out there who's trying to live a happy long fully functional life i mean you want to be thinking proactively and it is so effective we know what works now but you know we just have to kind of get people's attention and get them to change their habits lots of times there's a lot in there james so let's kind of go back and hash some of it out so the first thing you noted was that in its earliest renditions as a specialty interventional cardiology basically had one tool which was balloon angioplasty and so as you explained you're putting a very small catheter can you tell somebody how large a coronary artery is just to give them some scale so let's take the left main artery coming right off the aorta right before it bifurcates into the led in the circ right at that widow maker location which is named appropriately how many millimeters is that in a normal healthy 40 or 50 year old so that's typically about four millimeters four or five millimeters the left main coronary you know so not quite half a centimeter which is a third of an inch yeah so we're talking tiny tiny little little things or much yeah it was good it's even smaller than that it's it's it's probably even because an inch is 25.4 millimeters for context so it's uh four is obviously less than a quarter of that you put a little catheter that's obviously smaller than that into said vessel and that catheter is complicated enough in that it has a built-in balloon that the operator outside the body can control with a syringe by inflating it or deflating it as needed with saline so it's a really brute force method isn't it to sort of force open something that's narrowing and of course at the time you weren't leaving anything behind so the best you could do was get in there inject saline back and forth basically use the hydraulic pressure of that to try to force open what was going on and then you you left now years later obviously interventional cardiologists could leave behind something called stents so little flexible metallic things that would spring open and stay open and then there's been an entire evolution of that so folks who are interested i had a great discussion on this topic with ethan weiss if you're interested check that podcast out i don't recall which episode number it was but if you just search ethan weiss's name it'll it'll come up and we go through the history of this a little bit but more importantly something you alluded to which is kind of what the literature tells us about it which is outside of a few settings one of them being someone who is actively having a heart attack even today it's not clear there's an overwhelming benefit to putting these stents in people there's certainly a lot of economic benefit to certain parties but there's not an enormous clinical benefit outside of a you know acute mi and we can bifurcate into which types of mi etc but you know for someone who shows up asymptomatically with a blockage i don't think there's a single shred of benefit unless something has changed in the literature in the last few months that i was unaware of is that still true that's absolutely true we think of this and it's very logical which is why it's been one of the many reasons why this has been so difficult to extinguish this flawed paradigm that this is a plumbing issue you have blockages in your arteries well duh you get rid of the clog that's that simple so we've been working on that plot paradigm for 40 years now and you're right as logical that as that is it doesn't really turn out to be true if that if you have an acute coronary syndrome but the way to think about atherosclerosis is kind of like the zits we get when we're teenagers and we get these pustules filled with oxidized triglycerides and ldl cholesterol then then then they attract the monocytes and the macrophages that elute these inflammatory markers and they thin out the collagen overlying the zit and it ruptures and you know and it drains and heals if it's a particularly bad zit you end up with a an acne scar for the rest of your life that same thing happens in your arteries underneath the skin of the artery the inside skin which is the endothelium you form these zits these pustules filled with nasty yellowish inflamed and these they get hot they rupture and instead of just draining they attract thrombi because they think there's a rent a hole in the in the vessel so a thrombus forms platelets and fibrinogen and over time you know it heals if you're lucky enough and mostly most time you are this happens time and time again through decades before it gets to the point where one ruptures and then completely closes it off but in the meanwhile every time you get one of those inflamed zits the ruptures you get the growth factors stimulate the growth of the smooth muscle and the collagen and uh and if it's a really bad zit you know eventually you'll calcify and those are fossil evidence of previous badly inflamed zits if you would so this is like really everyday common stuff but we know how to prevent it but going in with a balloon and addressing one little area and by the way tearing it up even worse it works if you're having a heart attack but most of the times we can we can regress those plaques we can melt the inflammation out of there with a lot of things we can talk about diet lifestyle and exercise keeping the lipids down and triglycerides down and we can't make the acne scars go away they're there forever once you have those calcium deposits but we can pretty much make the risk go away and that's why prevention is just so effective and so instrumental well again i think you said a lot there and and and i want to go back because first of all i love that analogy i've never thought of using acne as an analogy and i think that's actually a more accessible analogy than the ones that i use so i think with with everybody listening to this i'm going to declare that i'm going to start plagiarizing that i hope you don't mind what i find interesting and i think it's important for patients to understand this is the complicated biology of both the oxidative piece the inflammatory piece and how they feed off each other and it's and it is a bit of an irony isn't it that it the body is actually trying to repair something the immune cells when those monocytes get recruited to the site of endothelial injury and and obviously when they translocate it through the endothelium and become macrophages and start doing everything that you just described which leads to this creation of thrombus we would normally welcome that response elsewhere in our body right if you were you know out in the field and you got cut that's exactly what you would want to happen you would want the immune cells to show up there to make sure there are no bacteria and then you would want those thrombo cells to come and prevent you from bleeding and so the problem is all of that stuff is happening in an area where you don't have a lot of real estate you've got a few millimeters and that's why it can obviously lead to this enormous problem the other thing you said that i think is it just can't be overstated is the understanding of what calcification means in that context i had a patient i saw this week who after some hesitation finally agreed to have a calcium scan he had very elevated lipids for a number of years but they seemed to elevate more in the previous few years he had been quite resistant to any medical management of that and frankly his other factors are really good so this is a guy who eats very well who exercises very well is metabolically very healthy so when he got the calcium score you know it was about 100 and change placing him between about the 75th and 90th percentile for age located in three vessels he was uh visibly alarmed right he said this is really bad and you know the stenosis in each of these by calcification were you know in the ballpark of 30 to 50 percent and and what i tried and i don't know if i explained it successfully enough to him was look the 30 to 50 stenosis you have in that vessel is not the issue that's a huge warning sign of what has been going on over the past decade it's telling us that now is the time to act and add other agents to our toolkit for how we're going to prevent myocardial death the analogy i use is it's like having bars on the window of a home you know it doesn't tell you that there's a break-in that's about to happen it tells you that you live in a very bad neighborhood and there's probably a break-in that took place at some point yeah it's a great way to put it and also i'm glad that and i know from our previous conversations that you're a fan of the of the calcium score we call it cardio scan we charge fifty dollars for it it's we use modern ct high speed ct scans that give these really great pictures of the coronaries with a minimal dose of radiation so men over age 40 women over age 60 i call it like the mammogram for the heart i mean everybody should have one really because you can have a lot of risk factors for like say lung cancer you might be a smoker in a family history and this that the next thing but if we do a scan and see that you're growing a tumor that's a whole different deal and that's the way this is as you point out there's a lot of people who have high cholesterol and high blood pressure bad family history just a frightening array of risk factors you do a calcium score on them and it's zero and you say well we've gotten through 53 years of life without making any hard plaque so we're not gonna like we maybe don't need to use a statin on you maybe we don't maybe we can tolerate it seems like you're doing fine on the other hand there's a lot of people who have relatively minor risk factors start growing plaque and and let's be clear your coronaries should be soft and supple and smooth like they were like when you're a baby when you're a teenager there's no calcium in the coronaries normally and you see people i think the record i've seen is thirteen thousand five hundred for a calcium score i mean i often show that residents like who put the hounsfield uh area of interest over the left main or the led and it'll be 800 to 900 then you go to their spine and it's 600 700 their arteries are more bony than their bones that's not a good thing what is the youngest person james that you've seen a legitimate speck of calcium in so something that's not an artifact of a score of one or something but where there's actual calcification yeah late teens but that's really unusual 20s you start seeing it and i might say that family history when people come in like like the patients you describe they come in and say why do i have this i'm doing everything right they said well you probably have a bad family history right yeah yeah i just said well you know if you weren't doing everything right if you were a smoker you'd probably already have had a heart attack you know so some of this is non-modifiable but more and more i mean this is a highly modifiable process gosh i almost don't know where to start but i now feel like i want to start talking about some of the exercise stuff so let's i want to come back to cardiovascular disease prevention because there's so much i want to talk with you about with respect to glycemic control hyperinsulinemia other agents that we should be thinking about beyond just lipid lowering agents and we can dip into that but i want to talk specifically about one of my favorite classes of drugs sglt2 inhibitors but before we do that let's go back to circa 2011 james o'keefe is up on stage and he puts this graph up of a j shaped mortality curve or of exercise can you and by the way at this point peter tia sitting in the audience has probably just finished a four hour bike ride and he's proud of the fact that he kept his heart rate above 172 for half of that time can you walk people through basically not that you remember that exact talk but basically the thesis it's a reverse j curve actually because if exercise were a drug it would be the best drug we have for preventing heart disease i mean for that matter for preventing dementia preventing osteoporosis depression diabetes obesity i mean it is a wonder drug if it were a drug but like with any drug you got to get the dose right say you're using carvalho one of my favorite drugs and you give somebody who has a fib or recent infarct or high blood pressure you give them carbinol but it's one milligram you don't get any benefit right on the other hand you give you give them a 120 milligrams twice twice a day so if you give them a hundred milligrams twice a day of carbohydrate it's a disaster i mean their blood pressure is going to be low they'll feel terrible i mean right they'd have a hard time getting up off the couch exactly right so it's kind of the same thing with exercise and amazingly the dose of exercise to get benefit is really small i mean most 50 of americans do no exercise if they just got off the couch and went for a walk a brisk walk 15 minutes a day they would get like a 30 reduction in serious cardiovascular disease 15 minutes a day now ideally we you know we say 150 minutes a week is sort of a lower limit benefit but the point is that early steep limb of the of the survival reverses exercise dose falls steeply your benefit goes down 30 40 50 percent but then for the last uptick the people doing the most extreme doses of exercise you start to lose some benefit and it's probably upwards of a third of the benefit so people argue well i mean no sense scaring people off of of exercise i mean it's just sort of uh an encouragement that to not exercise knowing that if you overdo it you could make yourself worse and and and to be clear it's only like 2.5 percent of americans who are probably overdoing exercise versus at least 50 percent who are under doing exercise but still it's a bit like just because 50 to well 70 percent of americans are overweight or obese and it's like saying well we don't really want to talk about the dangers of anorexia because then you know it kind of will sort of discourage people from not eating as much i mean it's the mirror image of this but the point is you can overdo exercise and you know it might be interesting as just an example i know that you swam the catalina channel like 15 years ago right yeah and i mean it was pretty amazing feat so when you're sitting here talking to me and your heart is beating probably about 45 beats a minute and pumping out about five liters a minute of blood when you're doing high intensity intervals or when you're swimming across the catholic channel that you know i mean fast great i mean you did that 20 miles in like 12 and a half i mean 10 and a half hours so actually i think cycling is a is an even more amazing place to show that because actually for the channel i would probably hey there's something about swimming where you're horizontal i think your heart rate for very short distances can obviously climb like crazy but i find on the bike you would get the highest heart rate so so for me the maximum area under the curve heart rate was a one hour time trial so so like a 40 kilometer time trial would be absolutely maximum heart rate how fast would it be going i have a slow heart rate all around so my max my my heart rate would be about 172 for for that type of a race for an hour well take it less than an hour probably yeah this exactly would take about 50 56 minutes 55 minutes maybe no that's a perfect example because it's not only high heart rate but it's exercising under a load it's like rowing you know this is you're you're you're using big muscles you know your blood pressure is also probably your systolic pressure your pulmonary pressure is probably 80 60 70 80 let's give people some metrics of normal so for obviously doctors listening to this we'll know what we're talking about but let's take a step back so let's say my blood pressure is i have pretty normal blood pressure i'm probably about a 1 15 over 75 is my normal blood pressure can you tell people what that means by the way what what do those numbers mean when you have a blood pressure checked you know this is just the pressure that is exerted to pump these five liters of blood around your around your circuit every minute it takes that pressure to you know that's the normal pressure to just kind of get that blood squirting around there and then it comes back at only like two or three or four millimeters of mercury up from the legs and and that's that's a more difficult physics problem right because you're over overcoming gravity at low pressures which is why it's good not to be obese it's good to be exercising because those muscles milk the blood back through the veins through the through the valves up to the heart and those two numbers of course referred to as systolic and diastolic the systolic is when the heart is squeezing so during the squeeze of the left ventricle the pressure at the tip of the basically in the aorta is 115 millimeters of mercury now anybody who's ever mucked around with a pressure transducer will actually be surprised at how much pressure that is that's a non-trivial amount of pressure if you've had the luxury of operating on people you know what 115 even a normal 115 millimeters of mercury's that'll squirt across the room across the room but the 75 refers to the relaxation phase of the heart it says even when the heart is relaxed and in the what we call diastolic phase receiving its blood supply there's still quite a bit of pressure in there 75 millimeters of mercury in my case because your vessels are nice and elastic so you know as it receives the bolus of blood everything expands and then when it when the air valve shuts then those vessels they rebound a little bit and and they keep the take this sort of pulse tile bolus flow and turn it to more of a laminar less bolus flow so that elasticity of the vessels are super important now you talked about my pulmonary pressures what are my pulmonary pressures sitting here right now and i'll i'll confess to you i have no pulmonary disease though i've never had a swan gans catheter placed in me so what would you assume my pulmonary pressures are oh they'd be low you know like 20 25 over 15 something like that nice and low okay so basically that's the same exercise but now you're in my pulmonary arteries instead of my systemic arteries let's just assert to me that my heart rate's 45 beats per minute and you said my cardiac output is 5 liters per minute so that means every minute my heart sends five liters of blood around my body so i love that you brought up cardiac output because i think that's the variable most people are sort of failing to appreciate how much that has to improve so when a weekend warrior like me would try to do his best one hour time trial or when the best cyclist in the world or the best runner in the world is you know doing their most exerted thing what's the variability or the range in cardiac output that we can see from best in the world to sort of weekend warrior to average conditioned person just by way of context if you look down at your hand and make a fist that's about how big your heart is this is an amazing pump so five quarts a minute i think if you were you know squeezing a bulb five quarts a minute five liters per minute yep five liters per minute it never stops and you're a good heart should have about three or four billion beats in it without ever stopping okay it's about a billion beats every 30 years which is for a math geek like you it's kind of fun to think about you know you know think about designing a lifestyle an exercise program to sort of minimize the number of heartbeats per year okay and it does involve exercise but it doesn't involve you know it doesn't involve herculean efforts of protracted exercise all right but a good athlete like you an exceptional athlete like you you go out and do that time trial that one hour time trial at 175 beats a minute under load for an hour you're pumping like 30 or 35 liters a minute think about that you know 10 gallons a minute you know like lance armstrong in those you know the professional cyclists or cross-country skiers will get up to 40 40 liters per minute you mistakenly referred to me as an exceptional athlete which even at the time i wasn't but yeah when you do talk about the exceptional when you talk about lance armstrong riding up alp dues in 38 minutes and it doesn't matter that he was on epo it really doesn't change the metrics of this 40 liters per minute of cardiac output you know to put this in perspective james i just love this so much because the only times i've ever measured cardiac output are in patients in an icu i mean i can't count the number of times i've put a catheter into somebody's lungs to measure and their heart to measure their cardiac output but it's always been in the setting of a patient under critical care and in that setting it would be routine to see two and three liters of cardiac output per minute and that's with every drug under the sun used to squeeze their heart and to think that you and i have the luxury of sitting here without a single drug to increase the contractility of our heart and we're at five liters per minute and even a couple of old guys like us could probably go out and exercise and still hit 25 liters per minute but that the best in the world can hit 40 liters per minute now let's do some math to get to that volume flow rate really their heart rate isn't making up the whole gap because cardiac output is a product of two variables the heart rate and the stroke volume can you sort of explain how those play together well right the stroke volume is you know your heart's a pump and so you know in between beats it fills so how big it can accommodate how much how much volume you can accommodate with each beat is a an important factor and i remember miguel in duran had some studies done years ago and his heart was basically twice normal size so you get the heart rate up the volume goes up your arterials and venules dilate up so that the resistance goes down and the heart is actually not just a pump but it like it rings out the blood it shortens and twists and when it's going fast and you're exercising it's basically sucking blood out of the lungs and the venous system into this and pumping out as fast as they can it's just it's just an elegant astoundingly well-designed system when it's used right and and of course that's one of the beauties of exercise you know you can feel that from you as you get into shape you can just feel yourself being more capable of this and it's just it's just intoxicating and it's one of the beauties why people get addicted to exercise but but the point is to get back to the underlying concept is that you can imagine when you're going that hard and your blood pressure is up and your pulmonary pressures are up and you're doing 25 liters a minute the soft pliable chambers in the heart that's the atria the right and left atria and the right ventricle they get distended they stretch out let's pause on that so people see why james because if my cardiac output which is the dot product of heart rate and stroke volume meaning if one goes up by two fold the other can go down by half and they'd stay the same but if the whole thing has to go up by 6x and my heart rate's only going up by 3x because 45 to 170 is about 3x you have to bring the other one up by 2x so how do you take up stroke volume that much well part of it is what you just said you can squeeze harder you can twist you can you can get every last drop out but there's no getting around what you're just about to explain to people which is you have to make that chamber a heck of a lot bigger right and you know we're designed for this through nature we designed to be very active creatures but you know most of the time if you look at tribes in the wild they're doing like 16 or 18 000 steps a day but most of that is out of sort of a comfortable walking pace lots of times they're carrying things or they might be they might be lifting chopping swimming you know whatever building and occasionally critical times in the hunt or whatever you know they might be sprinting although the younger members in the tribe would be assigned that task because they're faster runners but we're not really designed to do what you did when you were doing these like you still do you know do these really long bike rides the chambers or marathons ultra marathons you know the chambers dilate up and we have enough circulating buffers in our bloodstream because this is like an engine when you know like a exercising muscle uses fuel glucose fatty acids ketones to create energy but it throws off exhaust and when you're exercising that hard it throws off a lot of exhaust in the form of free radicals okay we have a lot of circulating buffers in there to basically neutralize those free radicals but we we deplete that after 45 to 50 minutes of high intensity exercise and there's good animal studies showing and human studies showing that diastolic function improves for the first 30 minutes of exercise and by 50 minutes or 60 minutes it starts to worsen and the endothelial function will start to worsen too after you've depleted those antioxidants after 45 or 50 minutes you start like searing the inside of your vessels those endothelial sensitive endothelial linings with high high free radical levels and you also start over taxing the heart muscle and i'm not saying it's it's not a big deal especially when you're young you know youth is you know when we're young we're so resilient that you can get away with doing this stuff when you're 15 or 20 or 25 or 30 or 35 and maybe even 40 or 45 but after 45 it starts more likely taking a toll you start seeing you know troponins will rise and and nt pro and bp will rise after really really strong efforts like like a marathon tell folks what those markers mean because anybody who's been to an er with chest pain will know what a troponin is or has taken their grandmother into the er with heart failure but for most people they might not know what those are and why seeing an elevation in those post exercise should cause us to pause yeah so troponin is one of the proteins that is unique to the heart and it leaks out of the heart and gets into the bloodstream when there's been some heart damage you know we usually associate it with like you say heart attacks where the artery closes off and the muscle is starved for oxygen and it dies downstream in that unless there's good collaterals so that really raises our eyebrows and gets us into action when we see an elevated troponin but a lot of people i mean upwards of half or more people after a marathon will have on the elevated troponin it's just the vest at that high level 25 30 liters a minute for two and a half three four hours it starts overstretching the muscles in the atria and the right ventricle particularly and it leaks into the bloodstream and again you know like i tell people if you want to run a marathon fine you know run one or two but don't make it you know it's like like climbing mount everest you know if you want to do that do it once but don't do it like three times a year you know you could do it brag about it and all that but this you know you got to move on to healthier forms of exercise because these really especially after age 40 or 45 really protracted exercise will cause this small little micro damage like over stretching and tearing because the high levels of catecholamines and high levels of free radicals that are now unbuffered and so if you're designing like i like to talk about training for longevity is very different than training for peak exercise and a car buff like you can understand that it's like if you're gonna build a formula one car to go fast powerful the most impressive performance machine ever it's going to look and perform a certain way and it's good at that but it's not going to go 500 000 miles you know it's built for power and speed and performance now like a car that's going to go 500 000 miles i don't know it might be a you know a honda accord that you're driving never more than 70 miles an hour and you keep maintaining it really well and so the point is that you have to really focus on what your goals are and our goals as an athlete is different than our goals for longevity and health and well-being you know i love that analogy and i appreciate you using it for me because you know how much i do love cars in fact i actually think i i made that comment to a patient this week using a formula one car as the reference because as you pointed out james these are cars that are built for each race effectively they'll go through three engines in a season so everything about that is meant to extract the absolute maximum performance i again i want to reiterate what you said if your goal is to win the ironman triathlon nothing we're saying here should pertain to you we're not going to tell you how to train for that that is a remarkable feat i mean when i think about what it would take to go seven hours in that heat to do what's involved in an iron man i can't fathom that there's never a time in my life when i've even approached the level of raw performance that the winner of iron man is going to take or frankly even somebody who comes in under 10 hours but swimming the catalina channel in the dark you know in in 10 and a half hours that is also a pretty remarkable feat that's way beyond what a normal person is anywhere capable of doing yeah perhaps i've never had to do all three at once so when i was growing up i was a good runner good as a maybe a stretch i was a decent you know long long long distance runner when i was swimming channels i could swim for long distances and then when i could time try like a time trial but there's something about the iron man or triathletes that can do all of those things simultaneously that's always impressed me but my point is you're bringing up the important distinction here which is at some point an individual has to decide which master they're serving are they serving the performance master or are they serving the longevity master and i think everybody goes through a difficult transition here and i see this struggle with many of my patients especially the former you know exceptional athletes or frankly not even people who were themselves exceptional athletes but people who have also become i don't know how to describe it but they've found a new sense of purpose through some of their athletic endeavors and they've done their first marathon and they've thought oh my god this is really a great thing to do because there was a purpose there was a goal there was a training plan there was a camaraderie that came through that i got to do the thing and now i want to do it again and again and again and again and they've made a lot of friends doing it too and it's a it's a it's a bonding experience and there's a lot good about that but i'll just interject my my transitions because i guess i played basketball you know competitively varsity in high school and college and then for the first two years of college anyway and then because i felt that that exercise was so important to me i made this mental note when i stopped playing varsity basketball that i would exercise pretty much every day because i knew it made me happy and healthy so then i kind of got into running then triathlons and i did short you know like short distance sprint triathlons but i hammered it i mean it trained really hard and especially during my 30s up until my mid 40s and i was pretty good you know winning like sprint distances you know and local races and stuff like that but it was just the fun of the competition and the friends and all that but then then i started noticing when i'd go out and also in the back of my mind being a cardiologist you know sort of thinking being proud and happy that you know that i'm capable of doing this you know in my in middle age but then i started noticing like when i'd go on really hard rides and do those hard intervals after i i have this sort of vague sense of like aching in my chest and sometimes i feel some like i'm one of those people maybe you are too a lot of people who are athletic you can feel like if i stop right now and be quiet i could count my pulse just just feeling every heartbeat and i could feel some activity some pvcs or some pacs or two or three runs in a row of pacs or superventricular tech party and i thought you know what my heart is not happy about this you know and and it disturbed me a little bit and i kind of checked with cardio scan i had a little bit of calcium 21 but then i started thought about i thought you know this is makes no sense i mean i'm thinking that if some exercise is good and moderate exercise is better that extreme exercise is the best there's nothing in biology like that where the far extreme it's usually moderation and especially moderation in the context of what we are evolutionarily designed to do and what i was doing for a 45 year old was out of bounds with respect to what you know my body was expecting and and so i started looking into this and talking to some of my friends and colleagues from around my practice and around the world really peter schneider and copenhagen putting together some databases and showing that in fact and this is there in plain sight all the time by the way uh path and margaret one of the godfathers of the exercise movement in his study in the newman journal of medicine pointing out in these harvard alums that that exercise improved longevity like eight to ten years but in the in the extreme deciles it's just a small group of people who were doing the most exercise per week actually lost like 38 of of the benefit conferred by the less extreme effort and and then ken cooper another one of the sort of founding fathers of the modern aerobics movement down in dallas used to say if you're running more than 15 miles a week you're doing it for some other reason besides health so they recognized and even hippocrates 2500 years ago said if we could prescribe the right dose of exercise and nutrition not too little not too much is the safest way to health i mean so this has been there right along that you know even back 2500 years ago they they recognized that it's not going to be sedentary but you can overdo it you can kill yourself with too much exercise let's go back to what you were talking about with respect to pvcs explain to folks what's actually happening with the pvc because i think this for me became the area when i where i started to pay attention just to be clear james it took me three years to fully embrace this message it was not until 2014 that i finally realized i needed to get into one camp and i couldn't serve two masters and my higher priority was going to be my longevity and that meant i was not going to do these crushing workouts anymore my workouts were going to be geared towards what makes me live longer and the data that i found most convincing were the electrophysiologic data so it was looking at athletes the incidence of atrial fibrillation in cyclists and runners who were at or above a certain volume versus normal age-matched controls and yes that's full of all the same problems and pitfalls that epidemiology was full of but when the magnitude was so big it was difficult to ignore and if i recall the magnitude was in the ballpark of about 7x in other words if you took you know retired professional cyclists and you compared them to age-matched controls and match them in any way possible these professional cyclists were seven times more likely to have atrial fibrillation does that is my memory serving me correctly or am i out to lunch on that no that's that's almost spot on but also i point out that you know the heart is very capable of healing itself almost always and so it's really these high volume athletes high volume high intensity athletes who continue to do it all right past you know like in the middle age and beyond are the ones i see these people all the time because i've written about this a lot i see patients all the time come in with afib and it's like 700 increased incidence of afib which is a really common part arrhythmia where the atrial where the rhythm arises becomes disorganized and chaotic and so it it just scoots through the av nodes you into the conduction system down in the bottom working part of the heart rapidly and irregularly and it's becoming more common all the time in america because it's common among older people obesity diabetes sleep apnea tall people too much alcohol can cause it but one of the causes that we see is in people who are over doing high intensity exercise so yeah you're right on there they cut you off or rambled too long in my question but tell people what a pvc is and why and is that an early warning sign the high catecholamine levels from protracted exercise and the high um oxidative stress and the stretched chamber causes some tearing of the myocardial fibers with protracted exercise and over time that can cause little micro islands of fibrosis in the myocardial scar tissue and so if you keep doing this like year after year decade after decade you start ending up with this stiff dilated chambers which then is the electrical milieu that is favorable for creating these rhythm problems at first things like pvcs but eventually can can lead to vt but again and afib is much more common still but but these are signs that your heart's irritable your heart's been irritated by something and in this case it's too much exercise so let's talk about perhaps one of the more sad publicly known examples of that which you've spoken about publicly which is the sudden death of micah true tell folks a little bit about who he is and what a remarkable specimen he was and what conclusions you drew from his death yeah so he's sort of the poster boy for the thing you know that you really kind of um an extreme example so micah true was a remarkable endurance runner the book born to run was written about him and he was uh kind of a hippie who sort of dropped out of society and decided just become a runner we went down to northern mexico and and ran with this tribe that has its runners in it the torah hamara indians and he would run just remarkable distances and became sort of like an example of any this he was in his 40s or 50s when this happened but but he was out for a run and he died suddenly and they did an autopsy him and he found this you know dilated scarred up heart just what we were describing you know the scarring in the atria and the ventricles especially the right ventricle intraventricular septum but the point is that he was really fit he accomplished a lot of really impressive things but it did take a toll on on his heart and now granted he was doing just superhuman volumes i mean he typically run 12 miles a day as i recall and lots of times would do these 50 or 100 mile races through the desert heat and things like that but yeah i'm not a big fan of these extreme and there's more i have a friend who who did the um seven marathons in seven days on seven continents race megan she's a really she's a good friend i've known her for a long time she's she was one of the best triathletes in in america when she was doing that 10 years ago and now she still exercises a lot although she's kind of cut back on it but if you measured what's going on with her heart during those times it's i mean it's not pretty it's like the heart suffers when we really really overdo it of course all of these data that we look at the inverted j curve a lot of the the harvard prospective study even though they're prospective they're still epidemiologic a critic of this would say look we don't have any randomized data experimental human randomized data to tell us that the dose curve to exercise is non-linear again what that means is linear means the more you do the better you get you're proposing the more you do the better you get to a point and then it actually goes down hence the inverted or upside down j what about animal models are there appropriate animal models that can be studied here if so what have they shown yeah the animal models most have done with mice but a few with dogs have been pretty much consistent with this that you do see these elevations of troponin acutely and if you keep keeping going for months or a year or two you can see these dilated chambers the with the substrate for arrhythmias and if you look at the epidemiological data in our last paper that we just published was called training for longevity we put all the major 10 big epidemiologic studies and all but two of them showed this very distinct reverse j curve so that you get this deep reduction in mortality that that plateaus off in the middle and at the very end fish hooks up it's like diet in that so you're not going to be able to prove it because these are lifelong kind of patterns that that emerge and it's impossible to randomize people to it but you know there's a lot to be said for the end of one you know you're paying close attention to your body i can tell you for me as a cardiologist and also just as a athlete and a person it was very apparent to me that if i didn't change this it was not good for my heart and let's just talk for a moment about the best kind of exercise if you just stop talking about volume and intensity but just talk about like the best kinds of exercise because this this friend of mine peter schnorr and jacob marat he's a he's a brilliant phd from denmark from copenhagen peter schnorr founded the copenhagen city heart study this is ten thousand danes that they enrolled uh 25 to 40 years ago and focus kind of like the framingham study was in america for diet and lifestyle this was like the framingham study for exercise they they sort of collected a lot of data about what people were doing for exercise and then followed him through the decades and you know the people in copenhagen i think it's the city in in the world that has the largest number of people who bike to work i mean it's just it's a flat city they have these these there's kind of really generous bike lanes and it's just really fun to watch how people bike to work but they do a lot of other things and so they collected data on eight or nine specific sports including running swimming cycling health club activities which included treadmill and all the stationary exercise machines with weight that put all that together and then there was tennis badminton soccer golf i think were the ones and so we sat down we'd done some other analysis this data showing that was the moderate dose runners that did the best for longevity during the four decades long follow-up of that but this was a more this was a different look at it and and so we said what sport is best for conferring longevity and so you know the did all the multi-variable analysis for because you know tennis players are different than than maybe cyclists or whatever but quantitative how much exercise per week and maybe you know this data but but what do you think i know it just shocked me i went over there to finally look at the data and we were sitting on a coffee table one sunday afternoon having a glass of wine and talking it over and he sort of reveals this data to me and i look at it you know it's multi-variable adjusted data and i was really like speechless i was just it just i just thought oh what a waste we spent all this time and this is nonsense so so what do you think came out as the least effective way for improving longevity compared to say sedentary population i've read this so i'll let you disclose both the best and the worst to people okay so the worst was health club activities and the best was tense followed closely by badminton soccer golf and the middle three were like cycling swimming running and that was like three to four years after life expectancy health club activities only one and a half year life expectancy added and and those social sports badminton tennis golf i mean it's easy to imagine soccer but we're like six to ten years added life expectancy multi-variable and i just thought well it's not even a sense of publishing this but then i started looking at it and thinking wait what if what if it's not so much about what hammers your body into peak fitness as well as what sort of reduces stress makes you happy is something you can do lifelong and sort of fosters personal relationships because there's a lot of studies in recent decades one by julianne holt lundstead that said the single best predictor better than smoking or diabetes or exercise or blood pressure lipids for conferring longevity was strong social support you know relationships are the key and you kind of instinctively would understand that but then i started thinking well you know particularly for us sort of like emotionally challenged gender you know males it's like we make friends at work but and we have our family but lots of times we bond by playing and and when you think about these the sports that were done playing were the ones that confer best longevity and and they're also the ones that sort of promote more social activities so i think i think we need to change our mind around about what best exercise is not about if you're training for longevity yeah take it down a couple of notches but also make sure that you have some play in your life we played as kids we need to be playing as adults even more because it's so important not all for social bonding for stress relief or at the depressant i mean i just think it's so important yeah i think my reading of that was basically look there are a lot of variables that can't be teased out of any multivariate analysis or correction but a couple things stuck out to me one was i think you're right i think what tennis and golf badminton soccer offered that running cycling and swimming didn't to the same extent on average not globally but on average is you got to combine two medicines instead of one and you know better than me that two drugs are often much better than one to control blood pressure so when you got to combine exercise with social interaction it does better than just exercise that's sort of the first thing i take away from that the second thing i take away from it frankly is the challenge of doing any sort of large-scale study where you don't have a close ability to understand the intervention and i'm very fortunate that i have a gym at home so i don't work out in gyms anymore but from the days when i used to work out in gyms i realized that if we were going to treat everybody in that gym as one cohort of everybody who goes to the quote health club we would glean very little because the difference between what people did in that gym is so enormous that the average of that borders on meaningless just as the average of what any group of individuals does is effectively meaningless because there is no ability to control for it so those are the two things that i took from that now i do want to go back to kind of something you said because i look i i think there are going to be a lot of people who listen to this who are going to be exercising more than what you put forth i think you said earlier something to the effect of look 15 miles a week of running is probably adequate if you're if running is something you enjoy doing you probably don't need to be running more than 15 miles a week well i'll tell you this right now my wife runs a hell of a lot more than 15 miles per week so here's my argument to her to run less it's and i use economic terms called opportunity cost it's like look jill i know you want to run 50 miles a week and i know if you had all the time in the world you'd run 50 miles a week but it comes at the cost of you doing not a single other form of exercise no strength training no rowing no this no that so really the argument is and this was the argument for me in cycling as well which was look one you just you're tired of spending all this time training when you you have kids that are getting older and older and you have more kids and it's there's just a cost to being away from that but but it really comes down to how can you be a more balanced athlete for life so maybe not a better athlete in a very specific sport because cycling is a very specific sport running is a very specific sport if you want to be very good at those things by definition you're not going to be very good at much else but life is a pretty complicated sport and it requires strength stability aerobic fitness and anaerobic fitness yeah flexibility i mean all of these things so you have to be able to train all of those things and unless you're retired i'm not sure how you'd want to run more than 15 miles a week if you have to be able to put effort into those other things so for me that is the prescriptive takeaway here is how do you have a portfolio approach to exercise what is your prescriptive approach to patients that i just sort of laid out mine well yeah you're right on as usual if you're spending a lot of time saying running i know a lot of patients who run or cycle like a lot i mean 30 40 50 miles a week of running and you know like an hour to a day of cycling it's like you're yeah you're getting your your aerobic fitness really high but but it's not great for your skeleton or your you know or your balance or i mean i tell people just after 30 or 45 minutes of aerobic exercise if you want to do more you know circle back home and do some yoga do some weights these things that kind of don't necessarily tax your heart the same way that the other high-intensity sports do or you know sexual activity if nothing else is exercise that again is a totally different realm that is worth investing time and energy into and and also you know is for relationship building and so yeah i think that it's a matter of being more balanced and also if you if you try to figure out the area under the curve for you know maximizing your heartbeats you want to do stuff that keeps your resting pulse low but some high intensity intervals to keep your your maximal rate your maximal capabilities high that'll develop fitness quicker than anything some high intensity interval training in a relatively short period of time but it's the sort of thing that high volumes of really high intensity exercise is just not i just don't think it's the ideal approach to fitness there's a podcast i did with indigo sun milan where we talked very specifically and in great detail about zone two zone two being defined as this area where you have the maximum efficiency of the mitochondria so you're able to keep lactate systemically below 2 millimole and just barely keep it there right so your sort of maximum utilization of glucose and fatty acid that is mitochondrial without undergoing non-ox for most people that's a lower level of activity than they're used to you know if you do popular classes if you hop on a peloton class or something you're spending very little amount of time in that zone you're spending but you're also spending very little amount of time at peak capacity sort of north of kind of zone five you're spending a lot of time in the middle and i actually think it's that in the middle time that unless you're an athlete who competes in the middle is actually some of the least important areas to be training a lot of the data looking at even world-class athletes says it's 80 low intensity 20 high intensity of course their total volume is enormous but i think they even have the ratio right and yet i think most people don't have that ratio correct and they don't appreciate how important it is to do that low end aerobic which depending on your fitness might just be brisk walking if you're a little fitter it might be again zone two level of fitness one of the things as a cardiologist people are always asking me you know so so what what should my heart rate be you know what what's my training zone and all that kind of stuff but for most people i tell them you know i wouldn't pay much attention to your heart rate i mean except for the fact that i love activity trackers and you know that they could track the pulse and stuff but i think the most important parameters about pulse are what's your resting policies we want to get that nice and low we want heart rate variability we want that to be more variable when you take slow deep breaths which is why meditation or yoga is a really good thing to add to somebody's fitness regimen but with respect to trying to you know get your heart rate maxed out it's like there's a recent study showing in middle-aged adults looking at life expectancy as a function of number of steps taken and people compared to people who are less than 4 000 steps a day people who are getting 8 000 steps a day had a 50 reduction in mortality during uh 12-year follow-up and people were getting up to 12 000 steps a day that was the peak i mean if it plateaued there above that it didn't go down further but there was a 67 reduction in mortality so like you can get pretty much the full benefit exercise with just a lot of of steps and most of those being walking i would agree that you want to add some some higher intensity interval but it doesn't take a lot i mean like if you look at running five miles of running a week will give you the longevity boost from running that's almost as good as it gets one of the questions patients ask me and i don't really know the answer i'm hoping you might is how much resting heart rate is a function of fitness versus genetics so sometimes because now a lot of our patients do use tracking devices and they often report your lowest resting heart rate overnight which would really be your true nader and i have some patients who say gosh you know mine is 57 why is it not 47 and i really don't know how much of that is their exercise versus you know look some people just have different size engines that rev at different levels for example i've always had a very low heart rate so nowadays my resting heart rate my overnight resting heart rate might be in the low 40s but when i was athletic when i was very fit i would wake up with a resting heart rate in the mid 30s so actually i have a pretty high heart rate relative to my baseline now but i've also never had a very high peak heart rate so you know i've just always thought of myself as having more of a diesel engine i have to believe that's somewhat genetic so what is your view around resting heart rate given that it is a metric people are becoming more and more aware of so for one thing females tend to have higher heart rates than males even at equivalent fitness levels and that being said resting pulse is a much stronger prediction predictor of mortality lower is better in that regard lower pulse better longevity in males than in females males with a resting heart rate above 85 is not a good place to be some of it's genetic and as people get you know into advanced years some of its disease six simon syndrome you know where your pulse just slows down because you know the engine's wearing out and they need a pacemaker but most of the time it's you know it's a function of well for instance like alcohol the the more alcohol you drink the higher your pulse will be your resting pulse stress sleep problems there's a lot of things but it's generally a pretty good marker of fitness and so like a lot of things rather than worrying about how you compare to you know your body you're working out with is how you just compare yourself to you and keep track of your pulse and you'll notice that when you get into a rhythm like for instance one of the reasons i love watching my my resting heart rate and i'm kind of like you uh it runs you know 42 44 most nights and if i get over trained or under slept i've been on call then i'd be more stressed been traveling too much it'll start raising up to you know 47 48 49 and and if you pay close attention to it and use that as feedback it's a really great way to tune your lifestyle to get into a like a cardio protective zone and it involves the right amount of exercise and the right amount of sleep and not too much alcohol and some you know plenty of down time and play and those sorts of things how much do you see patients resting heart rates improve with appropriate exercise based intervention so when you take patients who are under doing it which as you said at the outset we shouldn't lose sight of the fact most people are underdoing this drug called exercise but patient shows up with a resting heart rate of 75 who's otherwise quite healthy has a cac their score is places them at the 50th percentile they're in no grave or acute danger at all but they say dr o'keefe i'm here to get serious about this i want to you know i want to bend the arc of my life i'm 45 and this is the time to really pay attention even though there's no heart attack in the next decade of my life at all and you say look i want you to do x y and z is there an expectation that their resting heart rate is going to be 55 one day 55 only if they get really serious about you know say losing 30 pounds and getting fit from unfit um but more typically you know 5 or 10 beats per minute is not uncommon and you you're happy with that that that's a positive sign to you oh absolutely you know and and of course it goes along with their waistline coming down and their blood pressure coming down and their triglycerides lower and their a1c lower so you know these things tend to move in tandem when you kind of dial in your lifestyle and diet and exercise program to that sort of ideal zone well let's pivot then and talk a little bit about nutrition gosh there are so many places to go on this but something you've written extensively on is the relationship between diabetes and cardiovascular disease and what can be gleaned from that as a model for studying a disease so tell folks a little bit about that work well this is another thing that i sort of like paid attention to in my diet and you know back when i was in medical school in the 80s and my training in the 80s and and you know that was the time when you know the pritikin diet and like a low-fat diet was all the rage and unfortunately you know that took a long time to extinguish that but i started following that pretty closely and it was a disaster you know it's like my glycerides went from 80 to 300 and my hdl went down from 50 to 33 and i just thought you know when i was getting skinnier and you know my athletic times weren't better and in fact they were worse and i wasn't feeling that good i thought this is not the right diet how restricted were you well like for instance when i you know i was at 20 something you know so i'd go out to eat with friends and we'd be eating pizza or and i'd take off the toppings and just eat the crust you know and then and then for a while then i kind of got into the sort of keto phase and i would eat the toppings and throw away the crust and i figured yeah pizza probably just not worth eating at all so you know and i'd eat lots and lots of white rice and you know and try to minimize fat and and then i realized you know you can't generalize for one thing that's a disaster for and it's played out on a on a population wide level in america that kind of diet you know makes us fat belly fat triglycerides are up diabetes rates are up it makes you hungry all the time it is not the right diet just two days ago we published a an article in our our flagship cardiology journal in the world called the journal american culture cardiology called the pesco mediterranean diet intermittent fasting as like the omnivore's solution to the omnivorous dilemma of what to eat and we think if you put together like all the data and the guidelines and you know the observational data and a little bit of randomized data that we have that a diet that's moderately high in fat very low in refined carbohydrates like almost no added sugar and minimal white refined grains but but high in nuts and extra virgin olive oil and high in fish and seafood and high in vegetables and low in processed food and drinking mostly water tea coffee fasting for at least 12 hours each 24 hour period of time and preferably moving more like to a like a 14 or 16 hour fast per day we think this is like arguably the healthiest cardiovascular diet both for preventing diabetes but also preventing heart disease and dementia obesity and a lot of the other scourges that are so common in our society the predimed study which i'm sure i've discussed in great detail on a previous podcast though unfortunately i can't recall hopefully in the show notes if it's been done we'll make sure to link to it probably one of the most impressive diet studies with respect to cardiovascular disease prevention and you know i think the findings of that though they needed a revision based on an error in randomization the first time around were were difficult to ignore when you consider the challenges of studying primary prevention even with drugs let alone with a diet and yet to see the success of a mediterranean diet in that study that was a wake-up call for me peter that is in my opinion the most important diet study that's that's been done emilio ross was the primary investigator on that he was a co-author on this recent paper that we wrote and emilio and i have been working together on a lot of projects recently but but it was the mediterranean diet versus the american heart association diet which is that diet that we were just you know dissing that's you know the low fat sort of trending towards vegetarian diet to hide carbs um but but that showed in this group of 7 500 people followed for four and a half years that the primary endpoint which was mi heart attack stroke or cardiovascular death was reduced 30 percent but also follow-up studies showed that the dementia cognitive impairment diabetes obesity were also each of those were significantly reduced in the people that got the mediterranean diet but it's important to point out that they were specific mediterranean diets that half of the people in the mediterranean diet got a free liter of extra virgin olive oil per week that they were supposed to use up in a week and the other half got mixed nuts tree nuts that were almonds walnuts and filberts or hazelnuts so they were adding fat in the case of the nuts you know vegetable protein and when you when you do the multi-variable analysis on what correlated best it was the added fat it didn't increase saturated fat but it increased these healthy fats from these healthy foods and and as emilio likes to point out with the olive oil you know it has to be not only extra virgin but more importantly it needs to be high in polyphenols which is perceptible as this black pepper stinging at the back of your palate you need to every time you open a bottle of olive oil because it's not on the label generally the polyphenol content you taste it and it should have this this this burn 10 or 20 seconds after you swallow it in the back of your palate those are super important antioxidants that because they're dissolved in oil they seep into your blood vessels they seep into your brain and your eyes and your skin and they really correlate with good long-term health whereas there's been studies decades dr vogel and his colleagues did a study showing that olive oil was bad for you endothelium and that never made sense to me and then i realized oh they were using a like an you know antioxidant depleted not not one of these high polyphenol antioxidant olive oils so it's really important to look for those high antioxidant olive oils and then use them generously so two comments one is most people if they go to the grocery store myself included historically aren't really paying close attention to what olive oil is and boy you only need to get fooled once which is to say catch what the label says to really get upset but a lot of things that are marketed as you know pure extra virgin olive oil or anything but and i don't know how they get away with it truthfully it's it's really an embarrassment to how this stuff is regulated but it's basically a bunch of canola oil that has some olive oil in it and they they've somehow managed to lie their way into saying it's pure olive oil so you have to be careful about what you buy but because of those because of that that's the predimed study though had the intervention of extra virgin olive oil or nuts i mean we have a rare thing by the way as you're always pointing out we have first level randomized data showing that adding this to the diet will reduce heart attack stroke and cardiovascular death and and so i mean it's also you know these are delicious foods when you get used to eating them and and you know if you want to follow a high fat or a ketogenic diet it should be high unsaturated fat it shouldn't be cream and cheese and butter and red meat it should be it should be nuts and seeds extra virgin olive oil avocados and oily fish like salmon it's only those five things i mean you need to get a lot of your calories from those five things which by the way is kind of the traditional peasant mediterranean diet these weren't these were mediterraneans that were living high on the hog these are the peasants who were growing their own vegetables and tending their own olive garden and their own grapes and the red wine and that sort of thing so so how convincing do you think are the data demonizing saturated fat given that so much of it is in the context of refined carbohydrates and other things i mean again when you look at the epidemiologic data unfortunately we just don't have big enough cohorts of people who consume saturated fat absent carbohydrates or refined carbohydrates it saturated fat in epidemiology becomes a proxy for people who are probably eating a lot of other bad things so mechanistically maybe or or otherwise how do you feel about it i'm actually like what people ask me about you know what's the most important thing in the diet i don't mention getting rid of red meat or getting rid of saturated fat i mean a moderate amount of that is you know again our evolutionary history you know we ate a lot of red meat and we ate saturated fat the evil white crystal in the american diet is not salt the worst is sugar and sugar and refined carbohydrates are by far the absolute worst dietary villain saturated fat you know a little bit of butter is not going to kill you you know like like if you're a vegan there's nothing you can eat that'll be healthier for you than like a juicy steak that's not it's not overdone you know because because you're probably low in in the things like b12 and zinc and iron and high quality protein so yeah it's it's a natural food and in moderation i mean i think saturated fat excessive saturated fats not a good idea but we don't focus excessively on it but my wife joan is a really smart dietitian and like you you know we went to school until we were 32 or 33 to promote health and wellness and we got zero nothing i mean hardly an hour of training and nutrition it's just so embarrassing that it's still like that but but so you know she kind of taught me a lot of the fundamentals and still continues to teach me a lot of fundamentals of nutrition because this is an important thing and and any good dietitian will tell you that you know red meat and saturated fat are essential nutrients that they're not toxic in and of themselves so you touched briefly on salt i know you've written about not just salt but also magnesium and that's something that's also really near and dear to my heart our patients consume a lot of magnesium both in the form of oxide which we basically titrate as high as they can tolerate from a bowel function perspective and then we use you know slow mag typically just to make sure that nobody's getting any sort of cramping or anything like that but my thesis is there's a global shortage of magnesium in the human somehow we're just not getting enough magnesium now i i don't know why that's the case but my proof for that if that's too strong a word is that when you give people back on the order of two grams of magnesium a day they always feel better why is that well it's the same story with potassium peter by the way our evolutionary ancestors living out there in the wild eating wild game nuts all the vegetables and fruits we're getting like and fiber is the same way you know like five times more they were getting a lot more magnesium a lot more potassium a lot more fiber than we're getting today so when you add those things back to the diet and the best way to do it is with lots of i mean nuts are high in magnesium but i agree the other thing so basically i think it's like getting us back into sort of like an ideal range of consumption of a really important mineral i mean it's it's an important cofactor for a lot of the most essential you know sort of chemical reactions going on in our body magnesium is so it's it's really important but it's also makes me think that you know a concept that i've come to recently that i think i think you'll you'll like and you probably think this way as well but again if you look at our ancestors when they would get a bird or a mammal or a fish or a squirrel or whatever and they would cook it or buffalo for that matter and then cook it they would eat nose to tail right they'd eat the whole thing these days when we eat meat we usually muscle meat which is a very narrow sort of range of animal based nutrients one of the things when you eat nose to tail say when you're cooking the bones for example you cook them long enough to eat them you get a bunch and the skin for that matter to a bunch of collagen and you get calcium hydroxyapatite which is a form of calcium that we're meant to eat we weren't meant to eat rocks which is the standard calcium supplement it's calcium carbonate or calcium gluconate those are rocks we didn't eat rocks we ate bones and for the last 5000 years we you know we ate dairy but a lot of people have trouble you know tolerating the lactose and so we think that and the mediterranean diet really focuses on fermented dairy but getting back to like i think the other supplements that are really important is like an organic bone meal that's high in that you have to add magnesium to it because that's calcium hydroxyapatite and if you get that up to you know like a gram a day of calcium from there and then your magnesium i would agree two grams per day and then the collagen because you're not going to eat enough skin to get the collagen that we're meant to get the collagen supplement like whether it's pills or powder is really really good for hair skin and nails not to mention bones and it's also good for putting on healthy muscle and maintaining healthy muscle i mean this is like ideal protein glycine and other amino acids that by the way we're really meant to have in our diet so i think those are really important supplements to that sort of healthy mediterranean pesco mediterranean diet with the fasting i think that it's good to add because it's hard to get those kinds of minerals at those levels do you restrict sodium in any subset of your patients including maybe even those that are both hypertensive with compromised kidney function we see a lot of really sick people with you know with class 4 heart failure and bad kidney disease and whatnot and that there you have to do be somewhat careful but i virtually never tell people to do that less than 1500 milligrams of sodium and you're better off having sodium kind of in the in the medium range you know from two to three grams per day and actually a good rule of thumb for like the hit the listeners here and these generally healthy people is like eat mostly whole natural foods which are very depleted sodium pore right and then salt to taste because a lot of the healthiest foods you'll eat like vegetables nuts fish you'll eat a lot more of if you can salt it to taste to make it taste good when you add salt to those natural you know or lightly salted nuts i mean you don't need to worry about that that's good for you having some some salt in your diet when you're eating otherwise naturally healthy whole foods diet all right let's go back and talk about that drug that i'm so enamored with or class of drug there are at least two out there tell folks what an sglt2 inhibitor is besides a mouthful yeah an sglt2 inhibitor you know is a diabetic drug that blocks this sodium glucose co-transporter in the tubule in the nephron when we filter our blood through the nephron through the kidneys we pull out a lot of things you know water sodium toxins urea including glucose and then because the body is saying we're interesting reason to waste this glucose you know we need we need these calories so it reabsorbs the filtered glucose before the urine goes out so we figured they engineered a drug to block the reabsorption of that glucose that's filtered and when this drug when these classic drugs first came out seven or eight years ago i have to tell you peter ethan this is a dumb idea i mean everybody knows that glycosyria is terrible for the kidneys and this is like it may be lower sugar but in the long run it's going to be but that's the beauty of science that's why you do these big randomized placebo-controlled trials and when the first one came out the emperor reg study about five years ago like my my phone and text mess and emails just lit up with people from around the country around the world friends who are saying did you see this this can't be true keeping in mind we've been trying to prove for 40 50 years 100 years since the first diabetes drug insulin came out that controlling sugar prevented cardiovascular death and we couldn't prove it shockingly until this trial came out and it you know reduced cardiovascular death 38 it reduced uh heart failure renal failure i mean it was just an amazing thing and subsequently there's been oh a good seven mega trials now you know between three and seventeen thousand patients in each study randomized to sglt2 inhibitor or placebo that shows that in fact these are the most potent drugs for i'm not for lowering sugar they do that modestly but for for improving cardiovascular prognosis reducing heart failure and renal failure and it's just fascinating to you know speculate about about the mechanisms of action but may have something to do with ketones but the most shocking thing about this that's really blowing the lid off is is that these drugs reduce things like heart failure deaths heart failure recurrence and renal failure in people without diabetes as well as with diabetes so that really makes us wonder well that's why i take one and they're currently being studied frankly as just straight up longevity agents for exactly that reason and i'm actually my interest in this even goes a bit beyond that of metformin which has historically garnered much of the longevity attention in the diabetes medication repurposed camp because i like the mechanism of action more i like what it doesn't do again i think metformin is an amazing drug i think it's its efficacy in people with diabetes is remarkable i do have my concerns about its efficacy in very healthy people who exercise at the upper limit of what we've discussed and i think it might it might impair there i think it's too soon to say i've had lots of interesting discussions with people and we're actually in the process of designing a study now to test that but to me this is a drug that doesn't really show any evidence of impairing the benefits of exercise and yet offers through totally different mechanisms some of those cardio protective benefits so the good news as you pointed out about science is it just over time it keeps accumulating information and will get better and better answers churning away and you know but so it's so fascinating to think about how this works and i don't prescribe metformin for people without diabetes i mean it upsets your stomach it kind of makes you feel a little queasy i use it on all my type 2 diabetics but i always understand that the sglt2 inhibitor is more important it burns off belly fat when you even a non-diabetic person takes takes an sglt2 inhibitor you urinate out about 100 grams of sugar a day so we were talking about the evil crystal compound you know white the sugar this basically is like pulling the plug and draining a substantial amount of sugar from your body every day it's like following a ketogenic diet without having to follow that i mean it raises ketones in the low in your system because of the fat and and it does tap into belly fat it taps into belly fat to get the fatty acids that then turns in the liver turns into ketones so and we still don't fully understand how it works but it's an important drug class that is going to only get bigger with respect to its impact on health and longevity why do you think it hasn't shown an increase in utis or bladder cancers or things like that i mean because so seven years ago that was my thinking right which was oh interesting idea but you're gonna have a uti every week but no thanks like i don't see how that's a good trade-off and it just hasn't panned out why do you think that is it's sort of interesting because well when you think about it the utis you are getting rid of some glucose in the urine it actually the only predictable side effect that you see and it goes up especially in females is uh topical yeast infections you know fungal infections down in the groin regions on the genitalia and you know when you think about it you are putting sugar in water in warm moist places so i tell people on an sglt2 inhibitor they need to you know pay special attention to use a wet wipe after urination especially females because there's you know just more surface area there to get a yeast infection on but but it is sort of interesting that it doesn't really increase things like uti or pyronephritis or urosepsis so it may be just that it's making the system otherwise healthier you know your immune system your your kidney function your cardiovascular system maybe it's just you know you're better able to deal with that i don't know this really brings it back to this point which is you said something earlier that i think is worth coming back to when you take a patient with type 2 diabetes you take two patients with type 2 diabetes and you give one of them a lot of insulin and you give the other one not as much insulin one of them is going to have lower blood sugar than the other in the one with lower blood sugar we see less microvascular disease we see that they have fewer amputations less kidney disease lower rates of impotence basically any tiny tiny blood vessel in their body does better when their glucose goes down but if it came down on the heels of insulin going up we don't see a reduction in cardiovascular disease so why is it in your opinion that lowering glucose with more insulin does not reduce cardiovascular mortality which is so clearly tied to type 2 diabetes and postprandial glucose this is the key issue okay and you you know the answer to this is that insulin is the problem insulin is a really super important hormone that jason fong and you guys and you had a really wonderful discussion about this but insulin sort of ushers nutrients fats and glucose into cells to be burned or if you're not burning you're in a burning mode right now you're not exercising sitting around sleeping it stores them as belly fat so insulin is super important if you have type 1 diabetes in type 2 diabetes i consider it the court of last resort i mean this is an obesity hormone insulin and cortisol are the two obesity hormones you want to get somebody fat put them on insulin put them on prednisone they will get belly fat like crazy and i always felt sorry for these diabetics you know the endos would be putting them on all this insulin i'd be telling you got to get your weight down that's impossible you cannot get your weight down when you're getting a lot of exogenous insulin you're hungry all the time it causes weight gain it causes fluid retention if anything it accelerates atherosclerosis you know high insulin levels the key is low you want to you want to drive your insulin levels as low as like your pulse you want a nice low insulin levels they go up when you eat and they go right back down and the way you do that is you exercise you minimize belly fat you eat a diet like we were just talking about you get no sugar none of that easily digestible refined carbohydrates you eat a lot of fiber a lot of low glycemic fruit but more more more sort of non-starchy vegetables you eat modest amounts of lean protein and a little bit of saturated fat don't hurt you you eat a lot like 50 of your calories from unsaturated fats from those you know nuts and olive oil and avocados guacamole and salmon and sardines and trout and you will have you know this from wearing a glucose monitor i've worn a glucose monitor for a while too being non-diabetic i found it a really great behavior modification thing but when you eat that way you don't see your glucose go up at all so when your glucose that goes up your insulin doesn't go up and when your insulin stays low your vessels are happy you're not putting on belly fat we wrote an article called you know insulin is a cardiotoxic medication i mean we we want to minimize the amount of insulin unfortunately it's new these new drug classes sglt2 and hypnosis glp1 agonists that's semi-glutam doula glutam there's a couple others these two together along with metformin for diabetics amazing drugs they all lower insulin they all reduce fat belly fat and they all improve cardiovascular prognosis and by the way you know a lot of it has to do with the effect on insulin tell folks how the glp one agonists work we didn't we might as well round out that trifecta yeah so glp1 agonists work by supplying a hormone that tends to wane in people as they develop type 2 diabetes this is a hormone that tells after you eat it tells the pancreas to give a shot of insulin and when you're not eating it also tells it shuts down glucagon production in the liver so you're making less glucose gluconeogenesis when you don't need to be and that's one of the problem when you're eating this chunky diet you get these incretin levels get low you get this gluconeogenesis so you wake up in the morning even after not eating for eight or ten hours and your glucose is high because you're making glucose when you don't need to be so this basically restores a hormone that is that is low and it sort of balances out kind of lowers fasting insulin and raises postprandial insulin and increasing also slow bowel motility so that slows absorption so you don't get the big spikes in glucose and actually you know kind of makes you feel full faster so these are wonderful drugs for weight loss i'm using some of my patients now high dose semi blue type and it'll it'll lose up to 10 body weight in a very safe way i mean even in non-diabetics very safe way to get your weight down and i'll combine it with sglt2 inhibitors and non-diabetics it works it reduces cardiovascular risk people people on gop one agonist tend to complain of some when you first started and when you dose titrated every week some constipation and or nausea but does go away with time and it is fda approved for weight loss isn't it at least one of them is right it is one of them uh liraglotide is sextanda but it's a once a day drug this that you know the semi blue type will be approved uh in the next year as a once a week drug the way we use it for diabetes and at a higher dose 2.4 milligrams rather than one milligram for the top dose and you know it's shown it's just best ever wage reduction and you know it's sort of an alternative to to bariatric surgery for these you know really overweight patients and wow i didn't realize that so you're telling me that you can now take a glp-1 agonist once a week with a sub-q injection and achieve comparable levels to the normal daily injected routine because that's historically been one of the barriers better better cardiovascular reduction it reduces heart attacks throughout cardiovascular death better than the daily one the laraglia type these are also revolutionary drugs but the cool thing they're very safe otherwise you know and whereas the sglt2 inhibitors you kind of reduce heart failure and renal failure and overall cardiovascular mortality and all cause mortality in sicker people this reduces more than atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease it has a stronger effect on mi stroke and you know those ruptured plaques we're talking about at the beginning they cause weight reduction from two different mechanisms of action they improve cardiovascular prognosis from do different mechanisms of action and they really work well together it's a phenomenal combination well we can't have a discussion about medications and cardiovascular disease without talking about statins which you've written about a lot certainly would have to be in the top three most prescribed classes of medications out there you know i'm kind of a five statin guy there's a lot out there but there's probably only five that i'm that i'll use in patients and i every physician i think who prescribes these has their own little secret alchemy around it you know when they're using livolo versus prevastatin versus crestor versus lipitor etc but let's talk broadly about them as a class so obviously a type of drug that inhibits the synthesis of cholesterol which is its direct action but the money may come more from its indirect action which increases the ldl receptor on the on the liver and you're pulling that apob bearing particle out of circulation and you're having this pretty pronounced effect in terms of ldl c and apob reduction second really now only to pcsk9 inhibitors but rather than talk about that although i'm happy to hear your thoughts on that i want to talk a little bit more about the potential other benefits of statins because i think this is where most people do believe there are pleotropic benefits of statins but they're harder to quantify and i'm sort of curious as to what your thinking is on when you want to bring a statin in is it also something you use in patients whose apob might not be that high but for whom you're looking for this other benefit the latest pleiotropic effect if you will on statins as there was a study just this this week came out that people who are on statins seem to have some better sort of resistance to severe covet infection and it may be that you know the people that that get a lot of inflammation are the ones who are more likely to have a bad outcome with the covet infection but in any event they do have anti-inflammatory effects and we use them a lot and i'm always arguing with my patients about statins and uh you know they'll say have you read about these things on the internet these are like and i've pointed out to them in the history of science in the history of medicine and randomized trials there's never been a class of medications that have been so thoroughly tested in gold standard randomized placebo-controlled trials lasting after years there's like 500 000 half a million people in various randomized trials showing that if you have heart disease or especially if you've had a cardiovascular event they will help improve your prognosis they reduce mli stroke cardiovascular death probably all cause mortality high-risk people pause for one second james i agree with you completely there is no drug no class of drug i spend more time defending than statins why is that why is it that the internet is absolutely crazy with this obsession that the statin is a drug planted here by foreign operatives designed specifically to kill us yeah it's crazy it's a combination of things number one and i was kind of skeptical about this but then i started taking a stat back about you know when i was 45 and i had that calcium score and when you when i was working out hard like i wouldn't rate my like my muscles would hurt harder you know i mean like they would ache they would ache worse after a hard workout and and then so i started taking constant q10 and switched over to you know a more of a less potent one and sure enough they got better so they frequently are associated with these nuisance side effects like like muscle legs and some people swear that causes some brain fog some sort of mild cognitive impairment um but a lot of it too is you know it's sort of the nocebo effect the voodoo effect you know they read about this and you know and there's all sorts of people you know trying to capitalize on selling people alternatives to statins that being said i argue with people about statins who really need them the 55 year old just had an mri who tells me you know i'll do anything but take a set unfortunately now we do have other good options zettabyte lowers cholesterol by reducing absorption by blocking the neem and pick receptor and pcs cannot inhibits which just prolong the life of the ldl receptors both really elegant ways to lower cholesterol by removing it from the circulation without poisoning the cell's ability to make cholesterol so that's really really important and i know you were talking about the dayspring about that and i completely agree so we have an option for those people who are stating tolerant because a zeta mob and pcs cannon inhibitor they work synergistically like statins and pcs canine inhibitors or isetamide with statins but for people who have a zero calcium score who are at relatively low risk we do the mesa risk calculator or the asc 10-year risk and they're under seven lots of times they're one or two or three like it's hard to improve somebody who's got such a low risk and in them i say you know let's not get overly shook up about your ldl and let's just you don't need to stab and we can stop your sound we don't need to start it whatever and we'll focus on diet and extra lifestyle but in middle-aged people i need to see that that zero calcium score or a low calcium score to do that but yeah statins are a wonderful tool they're cheap and we use a lot of them but but we also stop a lot of them and and i think for i'd be i'd be fascinated to hear this i've thought about writing a paper on this topic because there's nothing out there in literature but you kind of touched on it on one of your sessions i think it was with uh tom dave spring that to the extent that statins do sort of impair a cell's ability to make cholesterol it does that not only in the liver that makes it mostly cholesterol but also in the brain and people say it doesn't matter about getting cholesterol too low because cells can if your brain makes its own cholesterol if it does if it needs it if it's not poisoned the hmg isn't poisoned by the statin but if it is that gets into the brain and it can't make its own cholesterol and when you look at demented people they have lipid depleted brains you know this shrunken brain i mean there's a good studies showing that omega-3 helps to keep your brain plump a high high omega-3 diet and for that same reason i have some some sense that we might be better off using non-statin approaches to lowering cholesterol like pcsk9 inhibitors omega-3 a zetta mod a good diet and other people that if we want to maximize sort of cognition and reduce alzheimer's disease down the road tom of course works very closely with with us in our practice and that's absolutely been our approach which of course puts us at odds with many of the people that are in the in the very strong pro-heart camp very organ specific camp we look at two markers of cholesterol synthesis does master all and lithosterol we monitor them very closely and there is a small body of literature that says at least in high-risk people maybe people who carry one or two copies of an apoe4 gene that very low levels of dysmostral and or lithosterol in the presence of statins may be a predictor of increased risk and we just in that situation based on all the reasons you've laid out play to the precautionary principle and frankly you know our application of that is there's probably only two patients in my entire practice that are going to walk around with a dismoster all below 0.5 because there are so many other options if we need them that we don't need to overly suppress cholesterol synthesis so only in the most high risk cases of cardiovascular disease when we have no real other options then we do we do this but otherwise you're right i mean we're incredibly liberal with the use of of zedia and i think physicians are becoming more liberal with that which i think is great coupled with frankly prevastatin's my favorite statin if i can get the results there you know it's so mild also anecdotally seems to produce less symptoms it also raises it doesn't raise glucose the way say a torvostatin or travastatin will and it doesn't increase risk of type 2 diabetes and and when you use it with a zettamod which again we have a great study uh the utopia study in primary prevention zmi reduced cardiovascular events by 30 and then we also have the improvement study that showed that if you combine it with a statin it would reduce cardiovascular events so we have really good first level evidence about a zettamine but the only thing i would disagree with you on and disagree might be too strong a word is tell you how i think about things a little bit differently is i don't look at a 10-year risk calculator that's one area where in my practice we just have to do things a bit different which means we have to deviate from guidelines because i agree with you look if if a person 10-year risk is 2 percent and their calcium score is 0 but their apo b is at the 80th percentile the textbook answer is do nothing once you've exhausted all the lifestyle modifications my view on that is if you're 40 years old and your 10-year risk is zero congratulations but i'm playing a different game right i'm really in this this camp of alan snyderman that says we have to be taking a 30 and 40-year view of cardiovascular mortality and that means i can't look at a 10-year risk calculator i have to take a longer arc and sometimes that means primary prevention is adding drug to treatment of all other variables even if the calcium score is zero but again it that's a patient's decision based on their appetite for risk and their appetite for longevity so i completely agree and you know we don't at least i don't know of 30-year risk calculators so that that calculator you're using is in your head and you know i'm sure that's a very good calculator but one point i would make is that in those kind of people and i would say myself included i don't take a stab i haven't for years i don't have a lot of risk factors but it did have a little bit of calcium when i checked it years ago so i'm sure i have more now status will accelerate coronary calcification by the way so i use zettamine with a pcsk90 neighbor in myself because it doesn't have any side effects neither of those have side effects i mean rarely rarely and they work through very elegant mechanisms that don't distort your sort of milieu of cholesterol homeostasis whether it be in the brain or or wherever i mean this is just sort of making you as if you're genetically one of those gifted people that tends to run a nice low cholesterol well that's interesting you know that's sort of where i've migrated almost i'm a low dose prevastatin plus pcsk9 inhibitor and i was thinking about doing the experiment of switching to from prevastatin over to zedia to see and the reason for me is i had a calcium score of six when i was 36 and that's in the presence of you know all the exercise and stuff now i would argue at the time my nutrition was horrible because it was a quote-unquote traditional athlete's diet of a gallon of gatorade a day or powerade that's the old athlete's added you know if you run the engine hot enough you can burn any fuel yeah but peter i would say you said you know kelson score of six when you were 36 despite your exercise i would say maybe because you know when you're swimming 20 miles over right there you know like you were hammering hammering and really intense exercise will accelerate coronary calcification yes i have actually thought about that and i repeated the calcium score in 2017 so that would have made me 44 or whatever it was zero wow now it's very interesting because as you know by the way yeah well i can't and i and i talked about this at length with bob peters who is i think bob peters and steve wolf are hands down the best cardiac radiologists in new york city um and you know so i had i had i had a cac and cta done with them incredibly low radiation by the way 2.2 millisieverts for a cta ncac and the question was hey is it an artifact when you have a calcium score go from six to zero we're just sort of missing it because there was still a little blip in the endothelium of the led in that 2017 study it just didn't register as a full calcium so so i'll probably go back in a year and just repeat the cac because i am curious the point is like even if there's a little calcium there it's really really unusual for the calcium score to go anywhere but up and usually it goes up by 25 30 a year or more with with calcification so it's kind of like we wish our investments you know like the compound interest you know it really it really can accumulate but and i'll have to say i've probably read 150 000 calcium scores in the last 20 years because because and we've probably done 600 000 in our practice and we do 50 or 60 different day so like you virtually never see that and now granted at that low level you know you kind of nipped it in the bud with your better diet and you know probably you know tapered your exercise i don't know but in any event i saw a distinctly unusual pattern of regression in a calcium score in a good friend of mine who's an executive we've been on a statin for you know decades at a calcium score of like 1200 it rather than going up no diabetes but you know it's obese and we switched them over because they have some eggs to a pcs canine inhibitor and the cement and a calcium score a couple three three years later had gone down from like 1200 i mean from no it was like 1400 but it was like two or three hundred lower you know more than the margin of error of the test that made me think you know well number one statins do tend to increase coronary calcification but i bet pcsk9 inhibitors don't and certainly that anecdotal experience and i bet i'll betcha zettimov doesn't either so i saw an abstract but i don't know if it ever made it to publication that actually suggested pcsk9 inhibitors decreased calcification that was my anecdotal experience yeah now of course i don't know what that means because in the end i don't typically rescan patients if i have a 50 year old who shows up with a calcium score of 100 i have all the answer i need to know which is we need to be way more aggressive and there's nothing i'm going to glean by rescanning you next year to find out your 120 versus 80 it will not change our management and it just discourages you know somebody who's doing their best yeah it's very discouraging to think and then you have to explain well you're on a medication that does accelerate it but it reduces your risk despite that because it's making the plaques less prone to rupture and i'm the same way i rarely the only time i increase it is people who aren't doing the same right thing they're not taking their medications or they're still smoking or they're not exercising then i'll check and say you know it's gone up from or thirteen hundred or a hundred to two hundred you know you need to get on this but the dirty little secret is that it goes up in most people but nonetheless we can prevent cardiovascular events with all these strategies we're talking about despite the journey of calcium i'm so happy to hear about what you're doing a 50 cac really at that point when you can get that level of a diagnostic test for less than the cost of a nice dinner there's really no barrier to entry and then those people that have a positive score we get them over in our cardio metabolic clinic cardio wellness clinic we have two different clinics one focusing on the glucose side of things and you know the sglt2 inhibitors and gp1 agonists and metformin and weight loss and the other one on is just standard risk factors of lipids and whatnot but but we get them plugged in and we see them two three times a year we make sure they're you know there's nothing like feedback right i know you're a big fan of getting lipids tested and test these various markers hscrp a1c you know a lot of things we we follow because when you know better you do better and people need feedback to round out our discussion on the on the pharmacologic tools where are you on the high doses of epa versus epa dha combined obviously these are becoming very popular tools in the toolkit again just at the pharmaco level also at the supplement level if you pick your supplements right how do you think about these in terms of heart health and brain health so again you know super enlightened question and this is like one at the crux of some of the most exciting stuff going on right now so omega-3 like we're talking about some other nutrients we're eating like maybe an order of magnitude less of that than what we did in our evolutionary experience some people argue or you know when we get access to shellfish and seafood is when our brain expanded you know three or four hundred thousand years ago or so that omega-3 you know like 20 of the dry weight of the brain is polyunsaturated fats and its favorite polyunsaturated fat to plug into those membranes and the neurons is a dha epa is also you know another super important omega-3 and a lot of my patients come in and they they stopped their official they stopped their omega-3 because their doctor told them oh no these don't work and as you pointed out many times in your writings and whatnot is even randomized controlled trials can be wrong can be large and wrong if you're testing the wrong people if you're using the wrong dose and a lot of those trials were done with small doses and these big meta-analyses not to mention the reduced study which recently tested the four grams of epa and people that had heart disease or diabetes with other risk factors you test triglycerides above 150. so you test the right people give them a nice robust dose and you see these spectacular results from a nutrient and a lot of the reasons doctors dismiss it is because again we don't get taught anything about nutrition we have an inherent distrust that anything doing diets or supplements is worthless and that is so untrue and omega-3 is exhibit a so the latest meta-analysis there was one just out in mayo clinic proceedings um coming out this coming week i wasn't on this but one of my best friends was chip lavi from down in ochsner this is done with some italian collaborators but it's a really good meta-analysis of all the randomized data with omega-3 and they show for every gram per day of epa dha taken you reduce risk of mr cardiovascular death and even trends towards uh all-cause mortality but the point is like a lot of studies just use one gram but if you use two three four grams you see these really remarkable like in the reduced study 25 to 30 reduction in cardiovascular events and all cause mortality even in in people especially if they have triglycerides above 150. the question about whether it's epa versus dha you know the evidence in that trial was epa but if you look at the meta-analysis you know as long as you're getting that dose of epa and dha i mean i think it's important to have some some dha in the supplement too just because again it's important for the for the membranes and our evolutionary experience would suggest we weren't just eating epa using the combination i'll tell you i agree with you completely on that and this is i put this in the category of things i can't wait to learn i mean sometimes i just get excited about the state of natural knowledge and how it continues to evolve and i i can't wait to see five years from now what we know on this question because i was a bit surprised by the combined epa dha trial i really expected that to be a favorable response especially in light of what we saw in the foreground epa visepa trial so again we just have to see where this thing goes but but i agree with you the strength trial you were talking about that's right that was halted early yeah yeah so it might be that four grams of epa in that concentrated form is the way to go in a super high risk person for cardiovascular disease but a combination of epa and dha through food oily fish as you said might be what's conferring the real benefit that's how we got it in nature i think the broader question always comes to is there a harm of higher doses of epa and dha and i i i feel very confident now that the answer to that question is no provided you're getting your product through a clean source i think the answer is no and so we have zero affiliation with any companies that produce any of these products and we had a third party do a validation of carlson's which is the one that we have preferred for our patients and we found it to be pure without contaminant and it contained what it said it contained so i'm always happy to pay that little bit of a premium for that product to at least get an over-the-counter version that's that's good so so i don't have to sort of fork over for a prescription version yeah i'm the chief medical officer for a company called cardiotabs that we you know i i don't get paid anything from them but that's kind of my goal with them too and we also source it from norway they know more about purifying concentrating detoxifying omega-3 than anybody in the world as far as i'm concerned and usually go over to scandinavia there and visit with the leaders in that just to see what their latest and greatest stuff is but yeah this is a food and i think it's it's super important not only for cardiovascular health but peter the latest data on on mental health is is really important again this is a fundamental component of cell membranes that most americans upwards of like 90 percent of americans aren't getting enough omega-3 in their diet and it correlates with depression adhd suicide cognition dementia all those things i mean this is like a super easy way to markedly improve mental health my wife john is constantly harping on this that you know there's all this violence and suicide and depression and like the basic thing to do is take a nice high dose of omega-3 every day it's harmless it's cheap and it has profound benefits and lots of times you can keep people off of off of antidepressant medications that in a like a well-absorbed curcumin with high-dose omega-3 is as good as anti or better than any antidepressant out there and and they also help to improve brain function and again your doctor won't prescribe these but these are very very effective ways to improve mood cognition and probably reduce dementia in the long run we have a paper coming out i sent you a copy of in the journal of alzheimer's disease showing that that a highly absorbable curcumin theracurement in a randomized trial the study was a tnf alpha inhibition for preventing dementia and tnf alpha as you know is this master hormone of inflammation and there's some really fascinating which we outlined in this sort of systematic review that the biologics that reduce tnf-alpha like a tannersept is the best one it's a decoy receptor for tnf alpha and so it reduces inflammation and there's multiple big studies of millions of people in databases that's all observational data but that it reduces risk of alzheimer's disease 60 to 70 percent now those are expensive biologics that sometimes can cause serious side effects but curcumin is the activity of turmeric and if you use a highly absorbed one you get some pretty impressive reductions in tnf alpha that have been correlated in small randomized trials with reduction and there's good animal models on this too i mean it's one of the most exciting things to me right now is i really think this is easily the most exciting thing ever for maintaining cognition preventing alzheimer's disease and it still needs to be flushed out but there's some very good biological plausibility behind it and some fascinating animal data human data and even some some small randomized trials you know working with richard isaacson who i've interviewed for this podcast and i'll be interviewing again shortly we've sort of put together our our in-house kind of playlist for basically once we identify patients that we deem high risk for alzheimer's disease which we we define as age over 60 a relative that has a history of alzheimer's disease or at least one copy of an apoe4 gene or some other gene such as an anti-tnf gene or tom 40 or one of these other genes that that tends to be associated with alzheimer's disease plus or minus eight poe4 we just have sort of a full court press approach and one of the things on that list is indeed theracumin for exactly the reasons you've stated i became pretty impressed with those data about two years ago and so i was excited when you sent over that manuscript last week so you noticed that richard isaacson was a co-author on that paper as was gary small from ucla who's in my opinion those those guys are two top brain scientists in the country for you know things like preserving preserving cognition so yeah i mean i think that the people who are best informed on that would agree with you on that on that approach you know i guess closing thought james is i'm just impressed by the breadth of your sort of curiosity and obsession you know again interventional cardiology is a niche sport right it's a you know you're a cath jockey at that point and you sort of left that behind and the world has become your oyster so to speak and you're now interested in the role that theracumin can play in inhibiting tumor necrosis factor in the development of dementia i mean do you ever kind of look back and reflect on the journey of your career i'll pause there before asking another question i just followed my heart and what i was most interested in and i like to joke that i mean i i'd be doing the same thing right now if i wasn't getting paid i mean i love what i do and i think of life as you know like this gift of we have our time here on earth and it's about like helping others and and making a positive difference and i'm just so grateful that we live now where where we have all these tools and like you say it's just so exciting there's all this emerging data for people who are trying to pay attention it kind of like that line from dickens was it was the best of times it was the worst of times you know there's a lot of people out there that you know suffering from all sorts of terrible things a lot of it's lifestyle related and it's not their fault i mean it's like this whole world is set up to minimize activity and maximize calorie consumption but there's also people who are paying close attention and and we have all these powerful tools and and use this information to help each other and to live not only longer but more sort of active and fulfilling and enjoyable lives so to me it's it's just a blast my last question then james would be if there's somebody listening to this who wants to go into medicine and feels or is in medicine for that matter and kind of feels the same conviction you do which is the real answer is in preventing disease and whether that's their passion is in cancer or cardiovascular disease or neurodegenerative disease diabetes whatever the case might be you know you said it at the outset nobody's reimbursing really for prevention you've got to kind of create your own path what would your advice be to somebody who wants to become a preventative oncologist a preventative cardiologist a preventative neurologist how would you advise them to craft their way well that's that's a difficult question but i can just tell you that it doesn't have to be all or nothing you know even like the cath jockeys like they say you know some of my partners are who are catholics who are very enlightened about lipids and and you know don't necessarily have to do it all the time but you need to be able to be well-versed enough to strongly endorse it and i mean i'm in a big group of 65 cardiologists with you know another 50 nurse practitioners or physicians assistants and so i can kind of carve out that niche and live there most of the time although i still around in the hospital and that sort of thing but in the future this is going to be an increasingly important part of medicine people are going to understand you know they'll pay a lot to have their life optimized not only for longevity but also for enjoying life and being fully functional and i think there's never been a time a better time to you know get interested in prevention it's just it's it's a lot of blue sky out there and a lot of promising therapies and and lifestyles and strategies that we can deploy now i've enjoyed this discussion immensely as is the case with virtually every podcast
