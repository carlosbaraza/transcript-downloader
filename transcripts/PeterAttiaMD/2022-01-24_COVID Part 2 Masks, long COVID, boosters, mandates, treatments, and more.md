This episode is a follow-up to our recent COVID-19 podcast (https://bit.ly/33Ge6l1) with Drs. Marty Makary and Zubin Damania (aka ZDoggMD). Here, we address many of the listener questions we received about our original discussion. In addition to Marty and ZDoggMD, we are also joined by Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease specialist and Professor of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. In this episode, we talk about new data on Omicron, long COVID, masks, kids and schools, vaccine mandates, policy questions, and treatments. We also discuss some of the most prevalent misinformation and spend time talking about claims made by Robert Malone. We end with a conversation about our exit strategy.

Please note: we recorded this episode on January 17, 2022, and in an effort to get it out as soon as possible, this won’t have full show notes or a video. Additionally, Monica was only able to join us for the first section of the podcast.

[00:00:01] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia this podcast my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness full stop and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level at the end of this episode i'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to peteratiamd.com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode [Music] welcome to another special episode of the drive this is a follow-up to our recent covet 19 podcast with doctors marty macri and zubin damania that episode was released on january 3rd it was very popular we received a lot of follow-up questions and requests from listeners to revisit the subject matter so for this episode in addition to being joined by marty and zubin we're also joined by dr monica gandhi monica is an infectious disease specialist and professor of medicine at the university of california san francisco she earned her md from harvard medical school did her internal medicine residency and id fellowship at ucsf she also holds an mph in epidemiology and biostatistics from uc berkeley so before getting into kind of the leia what we discussed i want to highlight a couple of things first along with the previous podcast on this subject matter this is kind of different from a traditional podcast it's more of a discussion between the group of us that format seemed to resonate quite well based on the feedback so we thought we'd revisit that along those lines we again tried to call out the distinction between fact and opinion and i think in this episode we have a pretty healthy mix of both of those things my hope is that going into this you're familiar with at least what we spoke about in the previous episode if not it might be worth going back to listen to that this episode was recorded on january 17th 2022 in an effort to get it out as soon as possible it's not going to have the most robust set of show notes and of course it will be audio only not video now with that preamble let's talk about the episode itself the things that we get into in some detail are the newest data on omicron since our initial conversation and of course we have a lot more information on omicron since that discussion talk about how viruses evolve and change over time and how that affects antibodies monica gives a great explanation of what b cells and t cells do and how antibodies work and what the implications of that are for different types of immunity vaccine and natural talk about the ideal timing and the number of vaccines for long-term immunity and how natural immunity plays into this and whether or not you should be boosted depending on those things we also discussed some of the side effects of current vaccines we get into the controversial topics of vaccine mandates masking canada's lockdowns kids in school sweden's approach to covid robert malone's recent podcast on joe rogan where zubin does a pretty good point by point discussion of where he thinks malone is off the mark and where he's potentially saying something valid we spend quite a bit of time talking about this sort of fact versus fear approach to discussing kovid and it's clear that we're still in largely a fear-based approach although it's not entirely clear to me why that's the case in fact this morning shortly before even recording this intro it's january 20th today i just saw an article that talked about how by march the united states could see an additional 50 000 to three hundred thousand deaths and the reality of it is that's simply fear-based thinking it's very unlikely we're going to see 300 000 deaths in the next 40 days so it's not clear to me why that type of language is being used and i think we try to do a good job here of bringing this back to facts as opposed to wildly extrapolated models and things like that we end this conversation again talking a little bit about the future and what the exit strategy looks like here i think it's very clear to anybody who's paying attention that we are in an endemic this is no longer a pandemic and therefore we should have strategies geared towards that so without further delay i hope you enjoy my follow-up discussion with marty zubin and monica [Music] hey guys wonderful to have you all here monica thank you so much for joining the trio and increasing the average iq of this group by 40 points we're really looking forward to this so monica as you know zubin marty and i sat down a couple of weeks ago kind of had a relatively informal discussion on the topic we couched much of what we said as this was opinion this was fact the format seemed to resonate a lot with people and the follow-up was surprising i thought it would be a one and done thought it would be this one discussion we would have put to rest as many of the misconceptions as we thought we could but the reality is people appreciated it but said look we have more questions and so we decided i guess we should do this again and we're really grateful that you could join us so where do we want to start here there's so much to get into marty you probably spend a lot of time in the last couple of days looking at some of the questions is there is there anything you want to just jump into right out of the gate sure well i think it might be worth talking about the new data on omicron that came out since our last conversation it is great having monica here i deleted my up-to-date app when i got to know monica because i just call her now and she answers all my questions that's so funny you say that marty i literally just canceled my up-to-date subscription last week as well so that's fantastic the app a lot of doctors use to look things up quickly now i just call monica big study came out on the pre-print server from kaiser southern california that looked at omicron specific cases and they found 52 000 cases of omicron none required mechanical ventilation and remember 52 000 documented means there's four or five cases out there in the community for every one that we're picking up with testing about you know roughly half maybe asymptomatic and a lot of people have tough getting access to testing so we're really looking at a population of say a quarter million people with omicron and nobody required a ventilator now there was one death in that group not through the icu and intubated but remember the test they use which is the s gene deletion is not a perfect test for omicron and it cannot pick up an occasional rare delta virus plus they didn't have absolute confirmation that anyone hospitalized was hospitalized for the virus as opposed to with the virus they looked at the presence of symptoms on their record but regardless we're looking at a net total of 154 people who were hospitalized out of say a quarter million with omicron now of those hospitalized 83 percent were there in the hospital for less than 48 hours now if you remember way back about two months ago this is exactly what the south african doctors observed early on they noticed people were in the hospital about two days instead of eight days and they proclaimed to the world this is a mild infection there is no need to panic and we basically did the exact opposite but this data is pretty compelling right now now the reason it's so important is that 98.3 of new cases of covid in the united states are omicron according to the most recent cdc numbers on december 10th it hit 73 percent now we're at 98.3 percent so we're dealing with a different virus and i personally wish it had a different name because people know it comes from the lineage of covid and we've got the raw memories of the destruction of kovid and the loss of life and how our hospitals were overwhelmed we think of it in terms of coed but it's really functioning and behaving like a different virus now you might say well look we're in an omicron wave people are still in the hospital the vast majority are people who came in with delta who were infected with delta who were unvaccinated and got dealt and remember people stay in the hospital a long time especially right now and it's very difficult to discharge a coveted positive patient to a skilled facility or rehab so that's inflating the numbers a little bit but hospitals are truly strained but it's really those who had delta if we look at the future omicron promises to be a mild virus based on all of this data question for anybody but marty it sounds like you might even know the answer already do we have a sense of how many people are in the hospital with omicron because of omicron or because that's an incidental finding along the way so somebody's in there for cancer treatment but they happen to be testing positive or they are in there because of chest pain that's related to cardiovascular disease and then of course they're coveted positive along the way so i just actually looked this up there's a bunch of hospitals in the country that report this number on a daily basis nyu for example reported 53 percent are not there for covid but they're covet positive they're incidental coveted missions jackson memorial in florida 65 are incidental covet positive cases so think of it in terms of 50 to 60 percent are incidental that latter question also depends on how highly vaccinated the region is so for example the numbers are even higher out in california for people with covet in their noses because we swab everyone so la county reported 67 which was closest to what we saw in south africa during the omicron surge which was 63 percent and it wasn't that south africa was a highly vaccinated region it's about a 25 vaccinated region there was a sarah prevalence study in sars kofi 2 in south africa that showed 79 percent of adults had asarius kovi to antibodies so meaning think of south africa with between natural immunity and vaccines as having the same degree of immunity likely as california so i think the higher the vaccinated region the higher the incidental rate is i'd like to add just to a couple of your omicron studies because they just came out yesterday hot off the press very verifying of what you just said marty one was from south africa which was really well documented what's the contribution of immunity versus the more milder aspect of omicron contributing to the better outcomes with omicron and they tried to tease this out essentially by looking at the fourth wave in south africa hopefully we can post all these links but in the fourth wave of in south africa compared to the prior three waves and essentially what this study showed that was just this week was that absolutely immunity is contributing to why in december 2021 january 2022 we're having a better outcome with the latest variant it is absolutely the contribution of immunity both natural immunity and vaccine induced estimated vaccination probably led to a 0.24 hazards ratio of a severe outcome monica can you tell folks what that mean who don't live in the hazard ratio world so there's been a great debate since thanksgiving which is when the south african scientists were amazing scientists i thought got treated not very well because they kept it going on tv saying this is more mild and then people would say uh let's wait until the uk or the us says this so was i thought really unfair and these are my colleagues because i'm an hiv doctor so i know them but they kept on saying this fundamental question became okay is omicron more mild because we have so much immunity in the population at this point january 2022 now that our t cells and b cells are attacking that sars cov2 variant takes a while for the b cells to make antibodies you may not have antibodies right away maybe if you just got boosted you may have antibodies right away if you're older but say you have the vaccines or you've had natural infection you have your t cells your b cells they produce antibodies they attack that virus they bring down the viral load quickly they make it less infectious and they help you do well with the virus and so immunity of course will help you do well this is probably what happened in 1918 when we were transitioning from pandemic to endemic had a lot of immunity in the influenza world in the world however the next question is also is omicron less virulent inherently than the other strains that we've had so far the other variants we've had so far and yes it seems to be not just based on these six laboratory studies including two in ex vivo lung transplants so this is human lung tissue and then also animal studies that show it can't infect lung cells very well six studies now but what the south africa study showed us that i just told you about is that you can distinguish they did a very good job was very good analysis distinguishing between immunity making it more mild and also having fewer less virulence and they estimate it is 25 less variable than delta above and beyond immunity so it's not just our increasing immunity in the population that's making omicron more mild but it's something to do with the virus itself likely that it can affect lung cells well and then another study that would verify what i just said again over the weekend was in young children who are less than five they are all unvaccinated by definition because we can't vaccinate those less than five we don't have it in this country it's a us-based study and also they didn't have prior covet infection so they couldn't have had natural immunity and severe outcomes in that population is already very low but severe outcomes with omicron versus delta meaning going to the er was about two-thirds less meaning going to the er or hospital as ice was about two-thirds less so omicron seems a third at least in young children i was very olympus delta so putting all these studies together you've just really made a very big point i think that omicron by itself beyond immunity is less virulent i want to ask another question about this monica because you're the expert certainly amongst all of us when it comes to viruses beyond this one marty and zubin and i actually speculated on this i think in the last episode so we kind of came up with a teleologic idea around this is it likely that as pandemics become endemics they become milder the argument we came up with is look it's evolutionarily in the best interest of this virus to become less and less virulent as it goes on and if it wants to co-exist with us indefinitely it probably shouldn't be killing us you referenced obviously the spanish flu in 1918 as it went from this deadly pandemic into basically the fluke the thing that we have every year notwithstanding the genetic drift that comes with it if you were to look into a crystal ball do you believe that the sars co v2 that we will live with indefinitely which i think there's no question we will be living with sarsko v2 indefinitely is it going to be a very mild version of this that's going to be somewhere between all the other coronaviruses and influenza it makes sense and that's been the pattern in history and it makes sense evolutionarily it's exactly what you said ebola is a really dumb virus because it kills its host and a virus that makes more copies of itself but doesn't kill a toast that's more evolutionary advantageous just like organisms want more children on the other hand i would say this and i think this is a very key point because now because this omicron is less virulent there's now been a lot of fear that well we're going to get a more virulent variant later if you have immunity to the entire virus then even if you do get a more virulent variant that arises not only in humans but from an animal reservoir you have a more virulent variant if you have immunity across the entire virus like b cells t cells antibodies which will come down with time that's okay that's what they do but b cells and t cells formed across the whole virus a lot of people have seen omicron probably 50 of people in europe it's estimated a quarter of americans probably more have seen omicron then you have the t cells and b cells to fight that new variant in the future even if it's more virulent i think that's a really key point people are really they're not taking comfort for omicron being more less virulent there's a lot of anxiety right now well okay then what's going to be the next thing but if you have immunity across the whole virus then you can fight zeta that comes out later if you've seen the virus and what omicron did is it made a lot of us see the virus i mean both the fda chief and the nih chief naya chief has said we're all going to see omicron sorry monica i just want to keep asking you questions before and turn this more into an interview of you i apologize but we'll get back to a discussion is the implication then that the immunity acquired naturally by being infected by omicron whether you've either been vaccinated or not vaccinated but you're getting some additional immunity how would you qualitatively or quantitatively assess that relative to a person who has been vaccinated but has not seen omicron a very important study and there's been multiple ones of these it shows us that if you get natural omicron infection on top of your vaccines you form broadly neutralizing antibodies against all the variants totally makes sense alpha beta gamma delta but importantly you form t cells and b cells across all the variants i mean again that totally makes sense you've just seen the whole virus it is qualitatively true i would say that if you see omicron on top of your vaccine that you have a more in-depth and in-breath immune response against the whole virus because remember the vaccines we have in this country only expose us to the spike protein of the virus of just one piece of the virus as opposed to the whole virus now then people would say hey i want nothing to do with omicron i am going to stay in my house right now and i won't see omicron one thing i've been really thinking about lately is why we don't have covaxen in this country but we don't want to go off on too much of a tangent but covaxin is a whole inactivated virion made in india and it's a more traditional vaccine it may have increased our uptake kovacsen filed for an eua 73 days ago with the fda you get to see the whole virus so if you never wanted to see the virus omicron which again it's not like people are going out and getting omicron but just living right now a lot of people are exposed but if you don't see omicron i wish the booster could be covaxin my new thing is pushing covax in and seeing why the fda isn't approving it but i don't want to go into too much of a tension but i do think that would have increased our uptake in our country because mrna vaccines got a reputation can i ask a question a follow-up on this that i don't know we know the answer to but you have the whole virus exposure covaccin vaccinated whole virus exposure natural infection omicron exposure versus a pure spike protein deltoid exposure from a mrna vaccine is there a difference in mucosal antibody immunity between those mechanisms because now we have a mucosal virus that replicates rapidly in the mucosa and viremia is not a major part of its pathogenesis until later and so that's why we prevent severe disease with blood-borne antibodies but we might be able to actually make a dent in transmission and infection in the first place if we had more mucosal defense so i'm curious your thoughts what happens is when we're exposed to the virus we do develop iga antibodies in our nose and then those go down with time or if even we're exposed to the vaccine we develop iga antibodies in our nose and those go with time so like you just said there's a great interest in mucosal nasal vaccines to help decrease transmission but it is true that if you get covaxin or you get exposure to the actual virus you develop iga against multiple parts of the virus it's just it's what it is you're just developing iga against the spike protein if you get an mrna vaccine because by definition the mrna vaccines and the antivirus dna vaccines only give you exposure to the spike protein of sarcome 2. and you know monica this makes me think back to gosh early days of vaccine call it march of a year ago was moderna first out of the gate or pfizer i can't remember they basically came out within weeks of each other and then j and j pfizer was november 9th and then moderna was november 16th there's literally a week later that's right and then j and j and astrazeneca followed shortly thereafter single dose one of the things i recall that didn't get enough attention and it was difficult to figure this out reading headlines and abstracts you had to go through the raw data was the absolute risk reduction was greater with j and j than both pfizer and moderna now again this was in the original strain not delta and that got easily missed it makes me wonder if based on what you're saying that's not surprising because the j j vaccine would have provided a more robust picture to the immune system of the virus than moderna or pfizer correct well it's interesting both johnson and johnson and astrazeneca are adenovirus dna vector vaccines they show you a different part of the spike protein which is why mixing them give you more of the spike protein anagen you see antigens across a longer piece of the spike protein but actually i think what happened with the dna and viral vectors is they produced a more robust t t-cell response than the mrna vaccines and t-cells are your long-lasting friends remember those who've got survive stars could be the first one sars from 2003 late 2002 to early 2003 there are people 17 years later that they have strong t cell immunity against sars kobe so your t cells are your long lasting arm of the immune system antibodies always come down if i had antibodies for every cold i've ever had in my body i couldn't move because i'd be so thick so antibodies will always come down but t cells are enduring and atrocities seem to produce and johnson johnson stronger t cell response i think it's maybe worth actually spending a minute on this because i think we can easily take for granted here because of our familiarity with b cells and t cells and how antibodies work mhc class works is there a way that you can maybe explain to folks the difference between a b cell and a t cell and how they work in response to viruses specifically because this is going to become interesting marty has spoken at length about the idea that if we're going to get into a mindset where your antibody levels are determining the value of your worth in society we're in for a really rough slog it's going to be weekly boosters maybe monthly boosters if we're being generous so why is that the wrong metric if you were to exclusively focus on it as opposed to understanding how the t cells work what's happening in your bone marrow like there's no reasonable person to my knowledge that doesn't agree that sars co v2 is never going away so anything we're talking about should be in the context of eternity here so why does this matter what's the difference between these b cells and t cells and how they actually kill viruses i'll explain it really fast and simply i hope which is t cells are actually the main arm of the immune system that fight viruses so for example an hiv doctor so as t cells go down people are susceptible to very severe viral infections they're cells they last for a long time they're called cellular memory and then what b cells do is they become the recipe book or the template to produce more antibodies but they have to be aided by t cells to do so and so your antibodies which are pieces of protein they will come down with time they will come down even after a boost or say 10 weeks or so but what your b cells do and we know you develop b cells to the vaccines because they've biopsied bone marrows from people that natural infection lymph nodes from people who've had the rna vaccines and you produce strong b cells in these what are called terminal centers the b cells will if they see the virus again aided by your t cells will produce antibodies directed against that sars cov2 when they see it in the future and not only will they produce antibodies but they will actually adapt those antibodies to the variant they see they see delta they'll make delta specific antibodies omicron omicron specific antibodies zeta sata specific antibodies because that's what adaptive immunity is it's like they vary the recipe based on the conditions that's what adaptive immunity means so they b cells will produce antibodies against the variant they see aided by t cells and then t cells line the whole virus and directly kill the virus itself so your t cells and b cells which are formed by the vaccines and natural immunity will last a long time and will enable us to have ongoing immunity to the virus in the future even different variants if that's lost if that very simple fact is lost then we then we can be very anxious when new variants emerge instead of feeling calm about it and knowing that adaptive immunity works b cells could last 90 years there's people who've gotten influenza in 1918 and then they found these 90 year old 100 year old people they looked at their b cells and they said oh you actually can produce antibodies directed against the influenza strain from 19 18 90 years later b cells last a long time marty just give me a quick approval status on all vaccines at the moment so the kovacsin is interesting i want to also hear a little bit about novavax but the exact status of moderna and pfizer they're off eua correct those are fully approved today are they still under emergency use authorization actually just pfizer though right i think they're still waiting for the final my beard guys are fully approved modernist still under emergency use authorization jnj what is the status of jnj in the u.s it seems to be persona non grata is that official or unofficial even cdc has sort of given a preferential guidance saying they prefer the mrna vaccines to j and j and it paul often and others have speculated that jnj really always should have been a two dose vaccine as a single dose it had a lot of promise initially but it's looking more like it should have been a double-dose vaccine and then you have the vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia issue which seems to be a class effect with the adenovirus vector vaccines because astrazeneca has it as well and so for those reasons cdc has given that preferential guidance and i think it's still under eua right monica yeah and you're totally right sputnik five also another no virus dna vector they all have this rare side effect so it got did even though i think that's interesting because it's still really rare why is it that that side effect which is incredibly rare basically led to a complete halting of the use of that vaccine whereas the myocarditis that's seen in young men specifically under 25 specifically with moderna doesn't seem to warrant the same level of consideration though by my math it's more prevalent uh concern i would speculate that it's a question of severity so the outcomes of people who get vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia can be very bad to fatal it's very rare but it is catastrophic if it happens whereas with myocarditis at least from the early series that we have generally reversible although requiring hospitalization still terrifying for parents and children but less of a catastrophic issue and then there's that whole controversy of which maybe marty and monica can speak to if well what's worse for generating myocarditis natural coronavirus infection or the vaccine and this is where data sets seem to disagree and how you interpret them who wants to take that one maybe i'm just looking at the wrong data but i'm looking at nature i'm looking at circulation this doesn't seem ambiguous to me can someone explain that that's right those studies pretty um well did a head-to-head comparison and found that the rates of myocarditis after vaccination were higher particularly with moderna and if you go to europe parts of europe they basically restricted moderna in anyone under age 30 something we haven't really talked about much in the united states there's also this interesting idea the myocarditis from vaccination may be different than the myocarditis from the infection itself there may be more delayed contrast uptake in the heart that they're noticing in the studies of the myocarditis from vaccination so there's a feeling among cardiologists that it's not the exact same apples to apples myocarditis have you guys heard that as well yeah and i will say as you know the medurana is 100 micrograms pfizer's 30 micrograms so that dose difference probably explains why it could be more seen with a moderna vaccine it's just literally a higher dose which is why like you said not used under 30 in so many countries and i think the best study on this is from canada that showed that the risk of myocarditis after the second dose is more with uh higher dose moderna and also more if you have a shorter period between your two doses which is why spacing the doses has been such a strategy in canada of eight weeks or even longer between doses we speculated on this during the last episode monica but i'm curious if you have an immunologic rationale for why the mrna vaccines were dosed at four weeks apart is there a clear rationale for why that would have been the way to do it i think it was just expediency because the trials wanted to hurry i mean we're in the middle of a pandemic so they gave fizer three weeks apart madonna four weeks apart but you know i think dr stanley plotkin wrote a clinical infectious disease article in january and he's our infectious disease site of america we name our vaccine lecture after him he really knows vaccines he was saying we need to space them out longer for two reasons one was to save more lives because if you get t cell immunity you can if you have limited supply you want to save more lives by giving people just one dose while you're and then give them the second dose later and then the second was he said that in any field of vaccinology and now this has been shown in a cell paper if you give longer time between doses you get a better response not just antibody responses increased antibody responses but fundamentally what we were talking about is we want to develop cellular memory and there's better t cell responses if you space them out the doses by eight weeks or so this was a cell paper so canada has always spaced out doses especially for the young i knew a doctor a hopkins surgeon a brown-skinned guy marty something i don't remember his last name but he was he was making this point about trying to get everybody the first shot before people got their seconds and boy he really got hammered for that i mean he was by the way this is both fact and opinion monica going back to that point if you were playing the long game so not the antibody game i kind of think of antibodies as like a vanity metric like you can brag about how high your antibodies are it's a cool vanity thing but if you're playing the really long game what would be the ideal time to give a booster to somebody who has had two shots of moderna or pfizer and i guess almost nobody would be one year out from their second shot now because these things only kind of came on board in about january and healthcare workers and high risk people were first so most people listening to this will not even have been fully vaccinated a year ago and yet many people are boosted suggesting that giving a booster in less than a year is the optimal way to boost long-term immunity but is that true based on what we know about the immune system would we be better off boosting less frequently how would we think about that we had to extrapolate on the three dose vaccines from hepatitis b vaccine human papilloma virus vaccine and the longer between the second and third doses the better i mean dr plotkin talks about this in the cid article i think what happened here with the booster is that we had a lot of the high transmission with omicron and then the idea was oh if we give the booster maybe we can bring transmission down and that's actually all i can see is why there were widespread booster recommendations as opposed to more selected booster recommendations for those who were more at risk for severe disease so i think it was an attempt to increase antibodies to bring transmission down i'm trying to think of the reason what's the efficacy of that do we have data on how the vaccine reduces transmission it will increase your antibodies and it could there was an omicron paper that in households giving a booster did decrease transmission in the household setting however i will say that in any risk versus benefit analysis and i know you spoke about this last time what you do is you decide about the boosters based usually on what it does for the patient if the patient benefits from a booster to reduce severe disease then that's when you would give a booster in how we usually do infectious disease not for this purpose of transmission because later say we get a different variant and virus goes up in the community we probably won't give booster to try to decrease transmission i don't think how long does that effect last the uk study martians have been 10 weeks the booster made the antibodies go up and then right back down after 10 weeks it's just never been done that we give boosters to decrease transmission we usually give boosters in a risk versus benefit analysis for the patients we want to make sure it's safe for the patient and then also want to make sure that it does something beneficial for the patient which in this case would be keeping them out of the hospital so older people immunocompromised people people who have medical conditions maybe everyone over 40 you know something that's helpful for the patient so if we were to speculate i won't single out any of my favorite universities but if we were to speculate based on the policies that are in place of providing boosters to healthy college kids in an effort to prevent transmission the only logically consistent thing to do would be to make sure college kids get boosters every 10 weeks for the rest of their lives because at least that way we might have some ability to reduce the transmission from college kids who would be unharmed by this virus to potentially anybody in their orbit who could be and of course that ignores what you said before which is this would be a first in class episode of putting somebody outside of the patient ahead of the patient in whom you're putting the booster is that a fair assessment i just like being logically consistent i mean i think that's one of my pet peeves in life right is like when we say things that are illogical if we're going to live in a world where we're going to make college kids get booster shots they're going to have to get them every 10 weeks of course that would never happen because we can't do that we do have to focus in on why can't we do that monica i mean says who can't we do that we're doing it now like you said it wouldn't be logically consistent and also i think it ignores and i think actually everything that's been going on over the last couple of months especially since omicron got declared ignores how well the vaccines work for the individual so the staff member the older adult who's teaching the student i think this is profoundly not recognized is how well the vaccines work for them even two doses certainly three doses if they're older martians and you'll have to tell me if i think the health care worker study in the new england journal from israel showed anyone over 50 really benefits from a third dose even in reducing severe disease so say you have a staff member say you have the teacher what the cdc showed us just in a study two weeks ago is that even the two dose vaccines your risk of a severe outcome from covet with just a two dose vaccine across the entire swath of the population your chance of dying from cohort was 0.0003 please remember that i said four zeros and then three and then there were specific risk groups that were at risk for severe outcomes they were older people over 75 with multiple comorbidities four comorbidities not only should those patients be boosted maybe even get a fourth booster but they should certainly be one way masking for themselves to help protect themselves all of that putting together means that we have underestimated that those college students if they're around vaccinated staff members and teachers those vaccinated staff members and teachers are doing great these vaccines work so well for them against what we're so scared of which was covered severe disease so i think we are underplaying the vaccines when you just put that to the logic conclusion for everyone around those college students can i ask a question because i think relating to this this peter's proposing is this hypothetical q10 weak booster that bumps up our antibodies and who and ema the european medicines agency just recently said this is probably a bad idea from an immune system standpoint but they did not elaborate so are we talking about immune tolerance from giving the same antigen again and again and again like what's the rationale against doing that they term it original energetic sin but it means that you see you keep on seeing the same piece of protein that you make the same spike protein to the ancestral strain again and again but what adaptive immunity does is allow you to produce trained immunity adapted immunity to whatever virus you see in front of them and they don't want to train the immune system to respond to the ancestral strain well it is interesting what you said zubin that the european cdc basically said specifically that repeated boosters could cause quote-unquote problems with the immune system and they clearly have some concerns there right even if they're not well how can you study something that we have not yet done i mean we're in uncharted territory we have anecdotally colleagues of mine and i seen cases that are just raised questions like new onset autoimmune diseases either immediately after the second dose or after a mild very mild infection in somebody fully vaccinated so maybe that immune system was revved up caused juvenile diabetes in an adult how often do you see that on day two of a very mild infection well maybe that immune system was all revved up now the risk benefit still favors vaccination this is not an argument to say hold off on vaccines because there's concern this is an argument to say only give boosters if there's a clinical benefit and the frustrating thing is as you alluded to peter if we would have spaced out these doses we might not even be talking about boosters to put a number behind what monica is referring to this university of birmingham study birmingham uk not alabama found that the immune response was 3.5 times greater when the doses were spaced out three months versus three weeks and that was in 175 patients over age 80. so they develop a weak immune response in general to vaccines so it's going to be even further magnified in young people that's why i got my two pfizer doses three months apart and the most frustrating question i get is i'm fully vaccinated i just got covered when do i get my booster or it's like i get those questions yeah exactly you just got the best booster of all because what that study showed us especially with vomicron but it would be true of any natural infection is that you develop profound tb and t cell b cell and broad neutralizing antibodies across the whole virus so that is the best booster of all unless you've got a covax and booster so when these b cells are re-triggered you get another process of what they call somatic hypermutation right so the b cells are constantly undergoing a mutational process to diversify and so it's almost like if you have natural exposure to vaccine and vaccine and maybe the two doses plus or minus a booster at that point you have a diversity of antibody response that should cover a lot of potential variant options correct yes i mean there's now actually four papers that show this but the most recent since in journal of infectious disease but the best one i think was in science that again if you see a variant in the future say right now we only know about the variants are mostly across the spike protein of course the omicron has 50 mutations across this entire genome just 32 is are in the spike protein that you produce antibodies directly they evolve the word adaptive truly means you adapt your own immune system to what you see i'm going to switch gears for a second and continued on the path of vaccines but again talk about it through a very polarizing discussion which is that of mandates and again i'll sort of ask everybody this question but what is the best argument in favor of mandates i'm going to be the author i'm looking for a diversity and i'm looking for arguments in favor and arguments against so tell me what the best argument is to mandate vaccination okay because zubin and i had this discussion the last time we spoke and i favored vaccine mandates and he did not and i know that one argument is that the vaccines reduce transmission and that argument with each successive variant has been lessened not just because the variants evade at least omicron invades the antibodies more even though t cells and b cells are intact but because just with time from your vaccine your antibodies decrease the transmission argument has become weaker however the reason i did support vaccine mandates is because i work in hospital and there is no doubt that the people in the icu and the people who are sick are unvaccinated adults and if our entire purpose of a lot of what we did throughout this pandemic was to save hospitals then not having hospitals have unvaccinated people when they could have gotten the vaccine allows us to work on other aspects of hospitalization i recognize this is not a popular opinion but that was my opinion until the supreme court i'm not convinced it's an unpopular opinion i seem to think that has anyone ever done a straw man poll is there a gallup poll on what percentage of americans favor vaccine mandates versus not i don't actually know the answer to this remotely i think the vaccinated are more concerned about thinking that their vaccines don't work than the unvaccinated which is a very interesting poll that was recent those who are vaccinated are more concerned about kovid than those who are unvaccinated people are more fearful they don't trust the vaccines in a way if they're vaccinated i think it's a failure of public health messaging that reminds me of an interesting anecdote i had to negotiate or mediates probably a better word mediate a familial turmoil conflict about an unvaccinated member of a family so there's a member of the family so it was the son of the family so someone in his 30s healthy did not want to get vaccinated the parents of course were vaccinated and they kind of brought me in to mediate the discussion why could i not talk their idiotic son into getting vaccinated i don't have any mediating skills but i had an insight as i was listening to the debate between them and i decided to ask a very simple question of the father who was particularly distressed at the fact that his son was not getting vaccinated and i said to him i said what do you believe is the risk that your son will be hospitalized or die if he contracts covid in an unvaccinated state i want you to remember his son was in his late 30s and is very healthy i'd like each of you to take a guess at what his response was meaning what he believed the risk of hospitalization or death could be to his unvaccinated 38 ish year old son i suspect he over estimated it at something like 50 percent or something higher any other guess i think i think i saw a survey when they looked at this that something like a quarter of people from one particular vantage point felt that the hospitalization rate was over 40 percent yeah do you ever guess monica what he thought was his son's fate yeah i mean even if he said ten percent it would be way too high he said fifty percent he said fifty percent so good guess those guys who i win i win and then i said well look and it's really funny this was one of the few times when my i actually had some emotional intelligence because i don't feel like i have a very high eq and i think my knee-jerk reaction would have been to like be you idiot how could you possibly think that don't you know the data instead i flipped it and i was like oh my god i now understand why you are so torn up about this if i thought my child was making a decision that was turning their risk of death into 50 i would turn everything on its head to prevent it and i said well let's look at the data this is actually his risk of hospitalization or death without the vaccine and this is his risk of hospitalization or death with the vaccine there's about a 10-fold difference right there's a log difference but you know it was the difference between 0.001 and 0.001 it was incredibly small but that feeds to your point monica i think which is i really wonder how many people who are emotionally full of anxiety need a little bit of a maybe like a prep course on this stuff let's just do the facts again about how deadly this thing is what's your risk going to the hospital what's your risk of x y and z you'd think that we would know that by now but i i don't think that's the case at least based on this one anecdote right you're so right that all that data is available how much lower risk you are when you're younger and it's a very interesting and different virus in the sense that young children are very low risk for severe disease which isn't true of for example influenza which affects young children in the extremes of age and it has to do with receptors and in noses of young children and also their innate immune system and how our innate immune system probably mediates pathophysiology but you're right that somehow people are so not aware of the epidemiology and i will blame public health officials also for not clearly laying it out how much more at risk you are when you're older i still blame public health officials for not even putting out this data of how vaccines really make you almost immune to the severe outcomes even two dose of covid unless you're in specific risk groups in which case those specific risk groups really must be protected and they're vulnerable i think it's a failure messaging one interesting thing i think peter kind of put his finger on it here is emotion so emotion and morality and our moral sort of taste buds so when monica says listen as doctors we see it's clear it's unvaccinated people that are suffering the most in the hospital and anything we can do from a care versus harm standpoint to ensure that people get vaccinated would be a good thing and actually so this is my personal take looking at the emotions of this for mandates if i could wave a magic wand magically and have every single person in this country that's eligible to be vaccinated vaccinated at a minimal level that prevents severe disease i would do it i would do it in an instant because i know the net area under the curve of suffering would be much much less where monica and i have a different emotional spin on mandates would be i see the emotional reactance the psychological reactants to a government that nobody trusts and a public health apparatus that people don't trust mandating something which then generates a response of you're not going to tell me to do this because i don't trust you which then damages our ability to vaccinate in the future or with future pandemics and that's why i am always nervous about the public health policy tool of mandates being spun around because i worry that it will backfire in a longer emotional way with a segment of the population that we could reach otherwise with education like the swedes they don't have to mandate anything they trust their government they've built this trust over years and the vast majority of them are vaccinated so i think we both agree that we want the best thing for the most people and then it's just a question of how to wield the policy to make it happen and i think there's something else to dig a bit deeper into that now obviously we're well out of fact and now into opinion based thought but i just can't think of too many case studies in my life and this again goes back to things i learned in the hospital marty think about all the times i mean all of us have had these discussions with patients when family members are on life support and they're brain dead and you're having these discussions about withdrawing care and if you go in there in a condescending way using guilt and shame and brute force the outcome is always a disaster i saw a quote somewhere it wasn't even talking about this it was about something else and it said like never in the history of civilization has shame and fear forced someone to do the right thing it was a little more profound than that it was more nuanced than that but that was the gist of it and and i think that's what's interesting to me is there's something about the mandate that feels very shaming and very fear-based and i'm not convinced that that strategy works and i agree with you zubin i think that if we could take every person who would be protected by this and get them vaccinated you would absolutely reduce the suffering to both the individuals and to society right to the health care system and all these other things but i don't know maybe i'm just naive i really wish it could be done with honest information and not with fear i pulled this analysis together yesterday i actually asked one of my analysts to pull these data and then i wanted to make some graphs and we'll show them to folks but i want to show you guys this i was sort of surprised at the magnitude of this so can you guys see my screen i know the listener will have to look at this in the show notes but so i had them pull up mortality data for people in the u.s under the age of 35 and i just wanted to look at four categories besides covid so motor vehicle accidents suicides homicides and drug overdoses and i looked at the data and i thought okay what's the easiest way to represent this and it turned out that just by dividing every one of those by covid mortality so you would make covid mortality unity then you could look at what the relative mortality was so if you look at this graph here what i'm basically showing you is by age group so the under 5 year olds the 5 to 14 year olds the 15 to 25 year olds the 25 to 35 year olds and the y axis is showing you how much greater that cause of death is than kovid for that individual so for example when you're looking at motor vehicle in the under five-year-olds it's like 11 times greater homicide is almost 10 times greater and drug overdose which seems hard to imagine you know they're probably accidentally taking tylenol or something is two times greater fortunately there are no suicides in that bin as you go higher as you look at now five to fourteen year olds motor vehicle accidents more than ten times greater mortality than covid suicide this is the most tragic to me in five to 14 year olds the risk of suicide is six and a half times greater than that of covid the risk of homicide is five times greater and the risk of a drug overdose is the exact same as that of covid and now you look at 15 to 24 year olds it's basically across the board 9 to 10 times greater risk of death in the united states due to motor vehicle accidents suicides homicides and drug overdoses and even in the 25 to 35 year olds where we're now seeing hey i think the adjusted number is 6.9 deaths per hundred thousand you're still seeing a drug overdose that is six and a half times higher than that and then when you look at motor vehicle accident suicide homicide they're more than two times that i guess i'm keep coming back to this thing about people are so phosphorylated about young people not being vaccinated and this comes back to my point about being logically inconsistent if we're going to be this phosphorylated about a 30 year old not being vaccinated that's fine but then i expect you to be seven times more phosphorylated about how many of them are being killed by their own hands by the hands of somebody else by drug overdose or in a motor vehicle crash isn't that the right thing to do if we're going to get so phosphorylated about a 30 year old not having a vaccine especially when we've already established with this variant and the variants that are to come it doesn't necessarily prevent transmission all that much so we're really talking about the risk to the individual i just think we need to get very upset about a lot of other things gosh that's so compelling peter i mean what you're showing is basically that motor vehicle accidents independently each separately suicide homicide drug overdoses compared to covid just blow covet out of the water not even close these are the major public health threats facing young people that doesn't mean that kovit's not a concern it just shows how we have had massive blind spots during this entire pandemic people don't just die of covid they die of depression and poverty and hopelessness and alcohol and stress and deferred cancer care and drug abuse and that is the broader perspective that's the context that i think we've lost and if you remember when joe rogan had sanjay gupta going to joke around and say on the witness stand but it was on his podcast and he pressed sanji gupta he said do you feel good that you're immune about your immunity your vaccination status do you do stuff and he started parading around yeah i think people should feel good about their immunity and i'm 50 or so i'm healthy i'm vaccinated i feel good and he said well so you're not concerned about covet and basically he said you know i'm not concerned because i'm vaccinated and then rogan points out the data that a young unvaccinated healthy child and that's an important stratification because the death and hospitalizations are significantly clustered in kids with comorbid conditions and those are the ones that should be priority for vaccination but for a healthy child the risk stratification is different and he said do you understand how your risk is still greater than that of an uh young child unvaccinated he's not suggesting we don't vaccinate kids but he's saying do you understand how parents are not that concerned just like you're not concerned and i think he was trying to elicit this sort of perspective that there's a lot of threats out there let's put them in context now i don't know who you're the um parent was that asked you that thought there was a 50 risk of their 30 year old healthy child getting vaccinated getting covered yeah for getting co was it sonia sotomayor by any chance i can't disclose my patience sorry marty okay whether it was her or somebody else the risk from covid net from the cdc's website is the risk of all people in the united states unvaccinated getting hospitalized is 65.9 per hundred thousand per week and that was roughly at the peak of delta that ended up being about one in fifteen hundred people in the population now that one person is not a young healthy 30 year old in general they tend to be the profile that monica was suggesting in other words older so we've never really talked about stratifying by comorbid condition and to answer your question i think immunity requirements make sense i think in healthcare for those who are patient-facing i don't think it's the same calculus for an accountant who's working by home for the hospital we've been sitting stagnant at 85 to 86 percent of the adult population in the united states vaccinated for a long time and what i think happened is all these discussions of the mandates hardened a lot of people and a lot of these immunity requirements do not account for natural immunity so you have a hospital system in washington state they're in tacoma and olympus it's called multi-care and multi-care laid off 55 staff for not being vaccinated and that's on top of the people who left before the vaccine requirement took in account so a lot of these people had natural immunity healthcare workers as you know especially at risk and more likely to have natural immunity so they were working on a real skeleton crew and then what happened is they got more patience as you always do in the winter viral season a lot of them with covid this skeleton crew was so short staffed the hospital asked people who called in sick with kovid to come in back and work in the hospital and this is a memo this is reporting from jason rantz where the memo is online i tweeted it the other day and it says basically even if you have symptoms if you've tested positive come back unless the symptom is fever then they told the managers hey when you assign these workers try not to assign them to people immunosuppressed if anything try to assign them to patients who have covit the covet staff take care of code patients i mean this is the insanity of blanket policies hardening people requirements that do not account for natural immunity ironically the state had this harsh few exception no exception vaccine mandate in washington state well a lot of the snow plow workers they work alone they drive a snow truck and they were fired one of the main highways in washington state then got snowed it was undrivable so the county kinatis county offers to then plow this road for the state the state should be plowing it but they don't have enough driver snowplowers so they offer to plow it the state says no you're not allowed to because your snowplow workers do not have the vaccine mandate they're not under the vaccine mandate this is the lunacy of the hardening of the positions around this mandate talk so monica i want to bring it back to you because i really do want you to help me accept vaccine mandates i respect you so much but as you can see my bias is that they're not logically consistent and they're bad policy so in light of marty's story what's the case for why we should be mandating a vaccine it's fair and i learn from everyone as i hear what i just heard i mean i definitely think recovery or having had natural infection has to always be taken into account always and so for example there's a study soon to be published they already actually published this in the med archives so i won't saying anything that we don't know that healthcare workers were equally likely to be reinfected if they had been vaccinated versus had natural immunity and severe disease was equally as protected so recovery immunity always has to be taken into account for any mandate i think that our country is unable to have nuance about covid what you just did and showed us the differential risk of code in the young and the old was so powerful and yet our country more than any other country has kept schools closed in only certain political regions have in a way restricted the young more than the old in this very strange backwards way in a way that europe didn't do without that lack of nuance maybe i was saying vaccine mandates because we seem to have unable to have non-shaming nuanced conversations in this country we will have a lot to do after this to figure out why we allowed healthcare workers to not drive the conversation about covid and we allow people who don't have a lot of expertise in a way to drive the conversation maybe that's because of social media or maybe it's politicians or political but i just know that i lived through hiv and i continued to because i'm an hiv doctor and never did someone with few credentials could drive the whole conversation so i think it's a very complex topic it's done the supreme court has only said for healthcare workers so i feel like they absolutely made a decision together that backseat mandates aren't going to be although the reality of it is the mandates are still happening i have a previous podcast guest and this person will remain nameless because i've spoke with them last week and they said that they would prefer i not tell their story with attribution they're fine with me telling the story but not with attribution this is a person who is a professor at an ivy league university who does really remarkable work i'm not just saying that because i interviewed them on the podcast i interviewed them because they do really remarkable work this individual was fired from the ivy league university for not getting vaccinated the point being is the university could have its own mandate program absent the federal government this person was fired in november of last year in 2021 i read an article today i believe said i don't get the number right this is a conservative i think it was a hundred and fifty of the fortune 500 companies in the us are going to continue with mandates even in the context of what the supreme court said so in other words i don't think this issue is over because of the supreme court it sounds like states may choose to do this i mean certainly the states like california and new york may be still deciding hey we're going to create our own mandate so i don't think this issue goes away i do want to ask you about something that i've never heard a straight answer to marty zubin and i discussed this so i don't know if you guys marty zubin have thoughts since we last spoke about it or monica you have thoughts to interject natural immunity seems to be this taboo word if you say the words natural and immunity juxtaposed it's like you're not on the covid team you're on the what do we call ourselves the covidius you're a covidian as opposed to a branch covidien is there a technical challenge in determining if someone is naturally immune again there's no other example i can think of in the entire world of virology when natural immunity isn't a good thing why is it with kovid we've decided it's irrelevant it's as though it doesn't occur is there an operational reason for that that it's too hard to measure or that somehow the antibodies when you're naturally immune are not amenable to our test kits like i know that that's not the case but i'm trying to come up with some reason why we've decided natural immunity does not count but no other place does this so it's a u.s thing europe almost every single country natural immunity is taken into account in passports and whatnot so i think we have to cut this short and say something political in the us but it doesn't happen can i speculate one thing that's been speculated before and i'm going to use a word that you would think wouldn't apply to science but it's called religion so in a way what we've done is we've created a god-shaped hole in our society over multiple years of secularization which is that's all fine but what's happened now is you have a situation that polarizes people almost the way a religion would so look at the natural immunity versus vaccine immunity it is a sanctity versus degradation issue for people of purity issues so if you're a covidien and you're in the thesis camp and you're like no vaccines are the answer we get through this through vaccine related immunity you are unclean unpure undesirable and unwelcome if you are not vaccinated if you've gotten the disease previously you already have a strike because you didn't mask up you didn't distance and you are unclean so i think people will never say that but they will feel that innately especially when it's reinforced by mass media and culture at work and so on and so forth now on the other side there's an equal religious fervor and that is the holy sacraments of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin and the conspiracy end times revelation aspect of these guys are trying to hide something from us poisoning us by injecting our holy temples our bodies with vaccines so both of the sides on this that are polarized have a religious aspect to it i think and that's why it's been so hard to understand why this is going on first of all that is a really interesting insight about the shame of having got covid early in the days right because if you're riding natural immunity from 2020 i mean you must be a filthy person right you are of low moral character if you dare had covid i mean i actually know somebody my brother i'm ashamed to admit this my brother had covid in q1 of 2020. can you believe what oh shame peter he is a filthy human being for having let himself come in contact with someone who went to florida in 2020 anyway it's just because you know what he is still my brother and i still i still talk to him yeah i think i love him i would go so far omicron is actually destigmatizing though and that's good in a way a very highly transmissible respiratory variant it can't be eradicated and like you just said at the beginning peter this is now being recognized now by almost everyone i don't think and it's not shame it's not that we weren't good enough it's not that we weren't masky enough it's a highly transmissible respiratory variant with animal reservoirs a pre-symptomatic period a long infectious period and non-sterilizing immunity to the vaccines all of that means it cannot be eradicated but it can be made endemic it can be controlled and since everyone's realized that now and now we're in this phase where people are converging and saying the same thing when they used to say different things it is the time where the shame of getting a pathogen is being destigmatized i think yeah obviously being in the hiv world i really revolt against giving shame and stigma to getting a infection we used to hate people who did that in hiv in the early 80s and now those same people are stigmatizing and shaming people who get a virus but it's okay because everything is changing now and i think there's a convergence of thought so i want to talk a little bit about masks because again i think what's nice about this group is we have different views on things and monica i know that you're going to make a good case for why people should be wearing masks so let's just start with the facts what do we know today about the efficacy both at preventing transmission and preventing the receipt of the virus whatever the right way to describe that is right protecting you versus protecting others when it comes to the following groups of masks n95 and kn95 and if there's a difference between them please tell us secondly a surgical mask third a cloth mask can you comment on those three categories of masks and in the two domains which is giving versus receiving virus so actually i've had a very consistent position on masks my first podcast with zubin was that cloth masks seem to reduce the severity of illness and then there were some nih studies that showed that actually it's probably the humidification of air when you're wearing a cloth mask that reduces the severity of symptoms however we're in 2022 the best way to reduce the severity of symptoms is to get vaccinated which one would i rather do wear a cloth mask my whole life or get vaccinated that is gone out the window because that was a very specific utility for cloth mass for the individual that's gone out the window now that we have vaccines so this is how i feel about masks now i have a very clear opinion there are certain masks that seem to work best for the individual we cannot be mandating mask mandates for the whole population anymore because transmission doesn't seem to be reduced by cloth masks doesn't seem to be reduced by even surgical mass unless you really tuck them in and double loop them and so forth that's how people use them so the bangladesh randomized controlled study of mask was reanalyzed by a group at berkeley and cloth mass and surgical mass did little for the population level but what a mask does is it one way protects you and so what i would do if i were the cdc is i would say the right masks which are n95s kn95s kf94s ffp2s double masks or even tucked and surgical masks put them on their website which they did the other day and say hey population anyone who's worried about an exposure please wear these type of masks there are some people who want no exposure to omicron there are some people who really feel protected by their vaccine and even if they have mild symptoms they feel okay about that there are some people who have no risk tolerance or some people who have high risk tolerance you can't mandate for the whole population i want my father to wear an n95 because he happens to be getting chemotherapy right now and he's 87. i want my child who's low risk and fully vaccinated i don't have risk tolerance for him so it can no longer be mandated but if you tell people the right type of mass and one way masking works then a teacher in a classroom can wear the right type of mask and the students in the classroom if a parent feels concerned they can put that mask on their student on their child and if a parent is not concerned after they've been vaccinated or even not vaccinated then they don't have to wear that mask so that's where i think we are with masks one way masking so just to be clear is the implication of what you just said monica that the masks don't prevent you from transmitting the virus to someone else my interest in cloth masks and my interest in masking were for the individual for reducing severe disease and i think we do have that data now from the nih with humidification of air however the bangladesh rct mask study which was published in science has now been corrected because the raw data got put out and so three groups looked at the raw data and it didn't look like cloth masks reduced transmission and even surgical mass actually was much less than originally said in the interpretation of the bangladesh rct in villages probably if you maybe like tucked it in and double looped it and like really sucked it to your face you can make surgical masks work better because they're polypropylene material but at this point we are this far into the pandemic we have vaccines there are some people who want to wear masks and never have a risk there are some people who don't and are okay with having a mild infection or getting exposed because they feel secure about their vaccines and i think the entire equation has changed with mass of no tolerance for my father getting exposed because he's getting chemotherapy just to be clear monica when you go and visit your father you're gonna wear a mask as well i assume i mean i can understand why he should be in the kn 95 or n95 yeah do you wear one then to go and see him i haven't seen him since he's gotten his third dose of chemo but when i see him i will see him in a couple weeks i'll either test and make sure that i'm negative before i hug him or i'll wear a good mask while i'm waiting for the test of course i can't expose he is in that category where he can have a severe breakthrough yeah so the implication is that the mask he wears a mask to protect him and you will wear a mask to protect him i will do that but the point is that in where we are with vaccines that may be my choice but it is a difference between a mandate and i'm telling you i'm in a state that mandates now so i'm really saying this very clearly if we can tell people the right type of mass to protect themselves actually his mask will protect himself i may not need to wear something because his n95 protects him just fine it's why he is right now wearing n95s when he goes out to a grocery store his masks protect him if you tell people the right type of mask there are going to be people for the next three years who wear those right type of masks for themselves everywhere they go i don't need to wear a mask to protect him i'm really pushing on this because on the last podcast i was very vocal about my personal choice which is i don't wear a mask i never wear a mask luckily i live in a state that is what can i say without offending people free and so we don't have to wear masks anywhere and very few of us choose to kids don't wear masks in schools it's just it's a free-for-all here in texas and the amount of hate mail i got for that statement was boy i was surprised by that in a cute way i couldn't believe how many people got so angry at me for not wearing a mask they must be aware of data i'm not aware of no no the data is very clear now at this point because we've had 10 years of data on masks and i have been a huge mass proponent until the vaccines came out so i was really really in the mass it's like all people would interview me about i was hoping you were going to smack me silly for not wearing a mask because i want to hear the case right i wanna no no at this point i would actually advise people to look at joseph allen's work shiradonna's work one way masking works we have vaccines anyone who wants to wear a mask should anyone who wants no exposure should and it should be specific type of mask those six that i just said and that can be for a child that can be for an adult can we recite those again okay yes n95s kn 95s ffp2s kf94s a double mask with cloth and surgical or the final option is actually a cloth mask with a surgical filter inside a filter inside that's polypropylene material that's probably the most comfortable option so a cloth mask with a filter inside those have all been studied very well they all protect the individual and if i want no exposure i can wear one of those masks i want my father to have no exposure you can wear one of those masks but if i am comfortable with having some exposure because i'm fully vaccinated then i don't have to wear that mask and that's where we should go to in this country and again i will refer everyone to joseph allen's work because he has been working on covert mitigation for this entire time and he wants one masking now and so do i so what's the group consensus on how long people will need to wear masks on airplanes and in airports and in federal buildings and in places like california california i think they're going to start unmasking in 2054 generally i will say i live here everything's changing there is the acceptance of endemicity is now being talked about at very high levels so the biden administration task force advisors wrote a piece in jama just two weeks ago it was similar to a piece i'd written in time that said you have to accept that we have to live with covet and so i think there's going to be four things that happen that are different now than before what used to happen in the world we have to protect ourselves from respiratory pathogens as a whole we're probably going to always vaccinate we need better treatments and we need more of those treatments the third thing is probably there's gonna be more attention paid to ventilation for all respiratory pathogens and then finally there will be people and there will be recommendations by the cdc that anyone who wants to mask can wear those six type of masks from now on but i don't think it can be mandated and i don't think it'll be mandated in california after february 15th nor do i think it will be mandated in travel after march or whatever date biden has said that is fantastic news to hear one may masking works it's like your vaccine protects yourself your mass protects yourself too and for those who are very concerned i'm so happy for them that we now have such good data on which mass they should wear including my father i was doing some video work last week for a documentary that i'm doing and everybody has to get a covid test right before and everyone has to be negative so you got a whole group of people that just had a pcr test that demonstrates they're negative we're all on this very small intimate set and it's one of these things where i have to talk directly to a camera which i can't do i have a real block when it comes to talking directly to a camera so the only time i can talk to a camera is when i have this thing called an interrotron which allows me to look at a person's face who happens to be sitting next to the camera so everybody on the set is in a mask except me i say to the woman who's in the entertron who i'm supposed to be looking at can you please take your mask off because the whole purpose of me being able to look at your face is to be able to read your facial expressions so that i can be speaking to you properly and she said well i don't think the rules allow me to take the mask off and i was like but everybody just had a negative pcr test i think everybody's vaccinated here as well for what it's worth why are we wearing masks oh and by the way you're about six feet away from me it was just like part of the rules of how this thing had to be done you sort of now know a little bit about my personality which is just how logically inconsistent things really are a challenge for my endothelial function via my blood pressure zubin you brought up the idea of religion i mean you brought up the idea of secularization in a society leading to almost semi-religious beliefs around different topics and masks have become one of those in this country but the data is super clear yeah i think you nailed it so peter you are an impurity there's again a dirty sanctity issue that comes up where people who are very conditioned about masks who don't see it logically feel it emotionally and they see someone without a mask and they feel like this is a dirty person coming to invade the sanctity of their body and this is how we've conditioned people unfortunately like the way monica talks about mass is how i feel about mass it's now an individual choice and it's great like for my parents who are elderly with multiple comorbidities absolutely but logical and consistency you know i have people in my studio we're now four feet three feet across from each other talking very loudly we're all vaccinated we're all comfortable with our risk even in the setting of omicron where again the great shaming mechanism has been leveled and so hopefully some of the religiosity starts to dissipate but i wouldn't hold my breath i think it's going to take some time marty do you have any sense of how many children in the united states are still being mandated to wear masks at school is it the majority or minority at this point i would say it's the majority i mean it's up to local school districts in many states but i would say it's the majority and unfortunately a lot of them are wearing the cloth masks they're getting all the downside of hiding their faces not learning how to read facial expressions all those other things and none of the supposed upside none of the benefit we talked about that brown university study that talked about significant cognitive and motor delays in children that can only be ascribed to the loss of the human connection when you look at the risk stratification in kids it's just a whole different ballpark as we've talked about and honestly we are now using policies designed around beta and delta in an era of omicron which is behaving very differently so what happens when omicron is essentially gone and now we've got a wave a year from now but it's para influenza or we have a rhinovirus wave which we have every year then what are we going to cover their faces again so they're basically covered k through 12 and then of course when they hit universities they're going to have to wear a spacesuit or something there is a study that just came out since we chatted last time maybe monica you referred to this but the proceedings of the national academy of the sciences on masks that looked at n95s with a nosepiece and 95s without a nosepiece and a surgical mask they didn't even study cloth masks i think because they recognize there's no value in it so what they found is that if you have an infected person with direct contact with somebody else for 20 minutes the risk of transmission with surgical masks was 10.4 with an n95 without a nose piece it was 4.2 percent and an n95 with a nose piece in other words a good seal 0.14 so that tells us a lot that tells us that not only if you're infected and around somebody you can significantly reduce the risk of transmitting but it also tells us that the quality of the mask matters now why are we learning this two years into the pandemic from a public policy standpoint which is the perspective i've come from and i've had to dive deep into the immunology of it but really public policy has always been my interest and what we're seeing here is a complete absence of fulfilling the role of providing data to the public by the nih and cdc so for two years with their gigantic budgets they couldn't do this basic study on masks we're learning it on the very tail end of the omicron wave i mean this is why we have so many political arguments about it and i think given where we are we need to and i would encourage people respect people with their opinion on mass if you see somebody wearing a mask don't make fun of them we need to respect each other i saw someone playing golf by themselves with two masks on my immediate reaction was that person lives with a lot of anxiety but you know what let them be we got to get away we don't want kids bullying each other we want no way that anxiety has i mean it's so deep in our society right now because of how we messaged about kovid that i feel a great deal of compassion for people who feel that degree of anxiety because facts isn't going to change their mind and we have done a fear not facts messaging instead of the facts not fear and i feel great compassion for people who are so scared right now so monica i know that we've only got you for about another 10 minutes luckily the rest of us here can keep going because there's so many other topics that people have asked about one of the things that people did ask about that i know you are an expert in and in fact your institution is now doing a clinical trial that i actually tried to get somebody into i want to talk about long covet so can you tell folks technically how we define long covid and give us any other insights you have as to what it's about what the incidence is what the potential for treatments are and anything else that you think is germane so you're right our institution i'm not in that study but our that ucsf has a great study on post-acute sars kovi to sequoia and essentially actually it's true of any severe viral infection if you have severe viral infections you can get lingering symptoms influenza included and the pathophysiology seems to be twofold one is that if you have no immunity to the virus it can go multiple places it won't stay in your body long term like hiv but it can go multiple places that's one mechanism and the second is that your innate immune response if you have no immunity to the virus can lead to inflammation that lingers luckily after vaccination two things happen or after immunity after you've had the infection before you get adaptive immune responses so quickly when you get the virus in your system like you're having a mild breakthrough infection your immune response swoops in there are actually t-cell islands in the nose despite the antibodies going down their t-cells islands in the nose your immune response actually swoops in makes that virus not go everywhere it's usually why the breakthrough infections are mild and up in the upper respiratory tract so you've just lost one pathophysiologic mechanism by being vaccinated or immune because it doesn't go everywhere and then the second is it's not your innate immune response that reacts it's your adaptive immune response so you don't have that kind of massive inflammation that can occur before immunity so there was just a study this morning in israel that those who are vaccinated don't get long covet symptoms after having a mild breakthrough in fact they have long coveted symptoms at the same rate as people who've never had covert at all there's people who have had a lot of anxiety and depression during this time understandably and that can be mistaken for long-covered symptoms i don't think i was aware of that monica you're saying that there are people who are being quote unquote diagnosed with long covet who have never had covid and it's really just a manifestation of anxiety there are some studies that what's going on in the world right now and how miserable everyone is is making people have less cognitive function because it's just a miserable time but this very good study just from this morning and essentially shows us that if you've had two vaccine doses that you have fewer long-covered symptoms than people who have never had covid so basically vaccination both brings your long-covered symptoms in check so getting vaccinated for long covid is one way to treat lung covid and then also those who have mild symptomatic breakthroughs who have been vaccinated don't seem to get long covet symptoms there's basically three studies that show this now including one from israel this morning so putting that all together the biggest fear of the fact that this virus is endemic and not going to be able to be eradicated among people who are getting mild infections are could they get long coveted symptoms and there hasn't been any evidence of that and we have had a lot of breakthrough infections through delta and now through omicron and these are very good studies that shows our adaptive immunity prevents us from getting these longer symptoms so i think that's very good news for long covid do we have a sense of what the incidence is of long covid in presumably the unvaccinated which is the majority of the people that it's being seen in it depended on if you had severe disease or mild disease so those who had severe disease this is a very good nature study you're more likely to get longer symptoms after that and it was about 30 if you had mild disease it was very low so it really depends on your severity of initial infection however at this point we have so many people who've been vaccinated and we have so much natural immunity that our long covered population is going down and we're still treating because i know this from the clinic people who had initial severe infection before the vaccines were available and the reason i'm interested in this question is as we've all noted there's still a substantial portion of the young population that's not vaccinated so marty you said about what 15 of americans are unvaccinated is that right 15 of americans over 5 years old are unvaccinated over 18 and about 20 over age 12. okay so we could do the math on that and reverse engineer what fraction of people aged 20 to 40 are unvaccinated really to me that might be one of the more potentially compelling reasons to be vaccinated if you're otherwise young and healthy is to mitigate the risk and the downside of long covet is that a fair assessment i agree i mean not only does vaccination help you not get long covet if you get covered but also it seems to be able to treat long covet because your more dysregulated immunity goes into a more adaptive and organized immunity so again i think it's profoundly important to say vaccination helps long covid either after the fact or before the fact so adaptive immunity seems to be the way to get to all roads lead to where we need to get to with this virus which is having a lot of immunity to the virus it's why before in 2020 we didn't have any immunity to the virus and we were much more nervous now in this stage of the pandemic we have so much more immunity the virus again 79 of people in south africa even though it's a 25 vaccination rate there's a lot more immunity in the world and then that relates to schools i think say a little bit more about that again this is kind of facts not fear versus fear not fax messaging you really went over for us how much lower the risk is among the young especially children for severe covet and it has to do with there's clear mechanisms by why children are less likely to get severe covet with these two receptors and their native immune response and that's true of long covert as well so all of that put together we have to refocus our ideas now on schools not being a place of fear because i think what marty just said was really significant to me that there will be para influenza rhinovirus influenza there will be other viruses that cause infections from now on and we have to think of children's holistically as the place where they need to learn i think the ill effects of school closures i think are very few people now who deny them two years into the pandemic the ill effects include mental illness anxiety depression eating disorders and learning loss and all of that put together means if i were in charge of the nation i would put my emphasis on schools because children are our most i mean any society from the beginning of history is the most precious resource so we put a lot of fear we ask children to shoulder a burden for older adults and we have the vaccines and we've had the vaccines now for a year we need to now move towards normality for children in schools you see it like harvard just said they're not going to do asymptomatic testing or contact tracing starting in the spring semester they're going to have normal college johns hopkins is still not having normal college some colleges are going normal some aren't harvard being ivy league hopefully we'll have an emphasis on others maybe joseph allen being there is helpful for the one-way masking argument if you want no exposure where you're a good mask so you're seeing things change will they still be requiring boosters they just announced over this weekend that they're going to have normal school and spring semester i'll need to see the fine print on that because i still as you can tell it's a real bone to pick with me that we're mandating vaccines in anybody but boy especially in college kids and then to mandate boosters i'm struggling yeah yeah so fair enough i will say that the idea that college students mean marty wrote a really poignant piece on this but the college students would be more restricted than all those adults in the restaurants and bars and sporting events and it would be the college students that would be most restricted it was a very poignant article and harvard of all places saying we're gonna have normal school in the spring semester and accepting that we can't eradicate a virus for me was very hopeful this weekend well monica really appreciate it thank you for making time today i know you have to run zubin and marty and i will have a lot to continue talking about and we'll try not to talk about you too much and you're crazy [Laughter] actually i will tell you that everything that we just talked about this entire podcast was based on data and i think it's good we don't use a fear or not facts approach but data is the only way to get through this pandemic we knew this in medical school the whole time but it hasn't been data driven in a lot of cases it's been fear driven so i hope we can change people's minds with the data likewise thank you monica thank you very much it was great to talk to all of you thanks monica great to see you thank you so guys one thing i want to build on that monica indirectly alluded to right which was the importance of keeping kids in school it kind of reminded me of we're going on the way back machine now but do you remember in spring summer of 2020 when sweden didn't lock down and everybody looked at sweden as though it was crazy i have not gone back and looked at swedish outcomes do either of you guys know anything about how the situation shook down i think marty has more data and i have more anecdote so maybe i'll start with the anecdote and then marty can fill in the blanks so i get a lot of messages from swedes recently got a really good detailed one of somebody who's not in healthcare but who studies this stuff in general and said remember i think a lot of this that we're talking about we have as people failed to seek context where context is absolutely crucial and so putting sweden in context you have a nordic country that actually over years has developed a relationship between its population and its government that is trusting and it took a lot of different approaches to do that there are health healthcare systems a certain way their public welfare systems a certain way and they have a certain type of population a lot of whom live in single homes it's easier a little bit to distance things like that so that all being said they took attack that said okay large events large gatherings there were rules about that so it wasn't just like letter rip in the early days but their public health officials like anders tegnal and these guys were saying listen in those days they did not know when a vaccine was coming it could have been years so they said we need to design a public health approach that's going to be a long game approach thinking years so they said we cannot shut down schools and they did not if anything for like a period of a couple weeks it was never months there early on what they found was they did have a higher mortality per capita rate than their neighbors largely because the one big mistake that was made early on is failing to protect nursing home patients who are the highest mortality highest risk in the early days after that though so 2020 in 2021 it seemed the data shifted to where actually no their excess mortality was not higher than their neighbors and they actually did quite well they continue to have trust although there was a little bit of controversy and overall they've stayed mostly open they had some businesses that suffered that the government directly stepped in and paid salaries and things like that so there was more of a social support network but they really were playing the long game and it seems like so far they've done quite well so marty what are your data points on this yeah so sweden is a fascinating case study because they took a radically different approach and while there was early criticism of their strategy nobody talks about them since that time and it turns out that their data are very impressive so the total population rate of the mortality per capita in sweden all in all cumulative this entire pandemic has been one in 663 now by comparison in the united states it's one in 387. we're talking about a radically different confirmed deaths per capita rate now that's according to statistica and if you look at where sweden falls it's around the middle but remember most of the countries in the bottom half are not reporting reliably burundi is you know one of the lowest mortality rates in the world they're obviously just not capturing a lot of cases so it's a fascinating example of what happens if you do a selective protect vulnerable people strategy and then figure out a way to continue living life now the real question is what is their excess mortality from non-covet deaths in the united states there's a suggestion that excess mortality you may have seen this report come out is somewhere in the range of 20 percent higher than the coveted mortality rate so there's been something like last year 385 000 cova deaths in 2020 but the total excess deaths that year were about 430 000 or something like that so there's some explaining to do there and no one's taken a deep dive yet we know about some very broad statistics on opioid or substance abuse tests but if you go to the cdc's websites and this is where the politics i may be playing in or just government incompetence good luck finding numbers on suicide during the pandemic good luck finding numbers on substance abuse they're very crude they're broad and they're early they're more delayed than they need to be one thing guys that this guy mentioned too is that their degree of vaccine uptake in 2021 is quite stunning they did a very good job because they already have innate levels of trust in public health officials it was public health officials like anders who were doing the messaging it was not politicians during much of covet so they did very well in 2021 probably partially because they got to vaccine they've never focused on masks and they did focus on protecting vulnerable although there was an unspoken sort of idea among their leadership it's felt that they were willing to sacrifice some old and vulnerable early on to keep society as a whole running and younger people functioning and the economy going and they never said this publicly because obviously that's a poisonous message but that was the feeling so they made these compromises that were really quite interesting and then in the long run the area under the curve of excess mortalities may well have been impacted positively by what they've done although i think it's going to take some years to really unwind what's going on everywhere many of us sort of found it morally offensive that you would take a let it rip strategy but those who defend what sweden did will actually tell you it was not really a let it rip strategy what they did is they tried to evolve the strategy based on the data and early on there was a very focused attempt to protect the elderly and the vulnerable if you went to a restaurant early on in the pandemic in the semi-open society in sweden they were distancing they were still using some mitigation so it was not a truly let it rip strategy and i think to their benefit i mean the kids have been in school throughout and they've not been masked european cdc recommends against masking people in primary school looking back there's i think some lessons there and the people who advocated for us to do what sweden has done i mean they are impartially vindicated now with some of this data last thing i think it's worth reading a line from what this guy sent me he says my 15 year old daughter spends a lot of time on youtube and when i asked her if there's anything she wants to add to what i'm telling you she immediately said that she cannot relate to the covet experience many talk about online her life is basically continued as before and i don't see any long-term effects in terms of distrust and fear that sweden is held together in a way that's very encouraging there haven't been big draconian measures or big demonstrations of discontent and families and friends torn apart due to different views so that's really quite interesting that social fabric has held together and that's important it's like we ignore that at our peril again the context of the whole thing rather than just the little fragments that people tend to focus on what's the overall context again just sort of digressing into anecdote you know i have very close friends in canada and a number of them are very seriously considering doing something i would have never imagined possible a year ago two years ago any point in time which is moving to the u.s canadians are very proud people they tend to have this superiority complex over americans you know the swaggering arrogant americans and stuff like that and but when you look at the truly draconian measures in my home province where i grew up ontario i grew up in toronto there are people that have basically said look we've historically loved canada but enough is enough they're really looking to move to u.s states that have been far more open and it's really extreme so to give you some perspective referring to a friend who had covid didn't get vaccinated kids are not vaccinated as a result of the fact that the parents had coveted but are not vaccinated and the kids are not vaccinated the kids can't play sports they're not permitted to play sports you have to think about that for a second so like what is the implication when you take kids age 12 13 6 7 8 and you say sorry your parents aren't vaccinated you haven't been vaccinated you don't get to play organized sports and of course you're wearing masks in school and all these other things and i'm sure people have heard that the province of quebec is now trying to tax the unvaccinated it's a syntax now think about that for a moment again if we're going to be logically consistent if we're going to say we're going to tax the unvaccinated boy we are going to be taxing a lot of people right i mean if your bmi is over 25 we should probably be taxing you too if you're clumsy and you're doing high-risk sports i mean you should probably be taxed for that because you're more likely to end up in the hospital anyway in going back to this example of a friend of mine do you realize that an unvaccinated person in canada cannot travel in canada so they can't get on an airplane they can't get on a bus they're only permitted to drive themselves and they still won't be allowed to cross the border you know there are countries that do stuff like this it's called sharia law very aggressive sort of fundamentalist countries that do this kind of thing based on religious belief in a way because i'm not sure we'd find data to support these activities this is now again i'll reiterate falling into the vestiges of religion and the question is i want to say something even more provocative zubin which is isn't that almost now as radical as the most radical form at the opposite end of the spectrum which is the most radical form of fascism right i mean think about what was going on in poland in the 1930s so it's the totally opposite end of that spectrum but you couldn't leave that country you would have needed to escape that country for your safety i'm not trying to for a moment to compare this to nazism i'm simply saying at some point these completely opposite ideologic things meet in terms of it's how restrictive they are yeah actually you really think about that you're in a country that can effectively be landlocked and you cannot escape you cannot leave canada it sounds like a great movie escape from canada and toronto is a post-apocalyptic flaming wreck but i could see marty starring in that the first brown like leading actor i think we need that as i remember the dean of the harvard school of public health said a canadian is essentially an unarmed american with health insurance here's where the argument falls apart peter with data what happens if that same individual that you're describing is infected with influenza or para influenza then what oh that's okay i guess right even though the case fatality yeah presumably they're allowed to get on an airplane and they could probably even get on a bus or a train and maybe they can kill people they can kill people with influenza very easily i mean this is the influence that kills so many people per year you know another thing that doesn't get a lot of attention we have so many remarkable antiviral treatments for kovid now i don't know about you guys have you guys ever had influenza the actual real deal og flu yeah yeah i've had it twice in my life it sucks it's the worst that is a bad virus and we don't really have anything too good remember tamiflu how useless that turned out to be people were stockpiling tamiflu like it did nothing influenza which is about as bad as omicron marty correct me if i'm wrong oh worse influence is worse than omicron i mean you're talking about the study 52 000 people one death i mean i haven't got omicron yet i've been trying actually super annoyed that i don't have it yet because i feel like i'm missing out on a booster shot or something but when i look at all of my patients and friends who have had omicron yeah i would say it certainly anecdotally appears far less severe than influenza and yet when you get influenza you don't have a drug that you could take if it gets really bad the way we have fluvoxamine and the other more recent pfizer and work drugs so that's another thing that doesn't really seem to get in the spirit of what can you do as an individual to protect yourself well step one get vaccinated step two have access to therapeutics step three have access to a health care system that has literally just spent the last two years doing a fellowship on how to treat this disease i think one of you said it earlier right we're operating under assumptions that are two years old an infection fatality rate of a prior virus omicron needs a pr firm because as long as it's covered people think they're using all the covet historical data and when you add population immunity and a more mild virus it does change the calculus it doesn't mean people don't get sick it doesn't mean that any of us would ever wish anyone become infected and deal with this virus nobody would want that but i'll tell you i just talked to doctors in egypt there this morning they've had a real tough time getting people vaccinated they've tried everything they're very thankful to god that omicron is what it is because it is going to confer large broad population immunity and otherwise there were just no other strategies to get there the question is how did we become so dependent on the cdc to adjudicate on every aspect of american life and we know typically they draw on data from their mmwr reports that's historical everybody is so upset at the cdc over so-called messaging in terms of i've done my five-day quarantine do i get one test or two tests do i get antigen tests or pcr tests stop let's ask the bigger question why are we even quarantining immune people who are low risk from other immune people right would we ever do this for para influenza or rhinovirus this is where we've just sort of developed this intense dependency and as long as we're waiting for the cdc to tell us whether or not we get one or two antigen tests because the sensitivity in the pre-symptomatic phase or asymptomatic phase is below 50 so after you've done your five days of quarantine you're still not getting the definitive answer so why are we having these arguments when we need to just get back to common sense which means if you've been exposed then wear a mask doesn't matter what virus if you are around someone vulnerable be careful maybe stay your distance and if you're sick stay home that is a pan viral strategy that we need to adopt for general public health hygiene that gets us away from these crazy deliberations that we're having right now it requires a culture shift too right because people have to understand that going into work sick without a mask say is really a taboo that should become a social taboo it's not something that you do it's not where we are or where we were certainly pre-pandemic one interesting thing too is this context issue there are a lot of doctors on say in the coastal cities that have been victimized i call it victimized because i'm biased i'm going to say bias now this is editorializing mask mandates kids mass mandates vaccine mandates all of this and they see a society that's actually a pretty highly vaccinated group and they're like come on guys let's stop this we need to open up why are we doing this and people like say maybe you and me marty have been messaging this more balanced message of hey some of these restrictions don't make sense now where i get pushback which i think is interesting is from doctors say in the midwest or in parts of texas or rural parts of the country who say listen these doctors skew more liberal say they're in very conservative areas and they're seeing maskless people lots of morbidity in the icu and their response is no their messaging is the opposite we need mass mandates we need to do vaccine mandates and we need to be very monolithic in a public health messaging so where you are even determines kind of how your mindset is and how you communicate and how you might see somebody like say marty mccary who's saying these things they may see that as dangerous in a setting like that whereas someone like me may go say it louder marty it's interesting i was reflecting on an extension of that theme again thinking about how we were going to be talking about this stuff today and sort of getting into some of the philosophy of it but since the last podcast came out which is a couple of weeks ago i've obviously been a little more attentive to all things related to covet in the news in the literature etc and truthfully it hasn't been good for me so my blood pressure has been running about 10 millimeters of mercury higher unfortunately most of that is just social media and again part of it is just i have this anaphylactic reaction to things that are logically inconsistent but it serves no purpose other than to hurt me but i got thinking why is that we all have an agenda and i've been really trying to understand my agenda because i have an agenda you have an agenda everybody has an agenda and i wish we could all wear t-shirts that said this is my agenda so if i'm talking to you i see your agenda and i can use that to help me interpret what you're saying i think i understand my agenda really well right my agenda because i'm not a contrarian like i'm not the guy who wants to disagree with the mainstream view just to be different sometimes i disagree sometimes i agree i think my agenda here we talked about this a little bit before is i'm worried about the integrity of the profession and the broader discipline of science i really have concern for the integrity of this and i have many friends and some patients who have completely lost faith in this profession that's my axe that's the thing i'm grinding i am very upset about what the implications of this are down the line and i think that's what's coloring for better and worse how i feel about the situation that we're in today do you guys have a sense of your agendas absolutely by the way this is the kind of self-reflection that every single person should do when they think about this because it then frames the whole conversation very differently and it involves a degree you said you have no emotional intelligence actually you just showed that you do because i'll tell you the same thing since we did the show the another couple weeks ago and honestly i've been weaning off talking about covid prior to that and you kind of reignited me thinking about this stuff and it's been nothing but suffering for me like ever since there is a feeling of like first of all now you're interested in seeing what people say about it and it becomes this agenda versus agenda and it's an unconscious sort of thing so my agenda with this from the early days has been somewhat shared with yours someone shared with marty someone shared with monica's which is trying to find a synthesis of what is the best policy versus science thing for the most people and trying to bridge across this divide of misunderstanding and division and to try to understand all these positions i call it alt middle i've started think of it as like a corpus callosum that binds the left and right hemispheres like how do we build those fibers that connect these things together and help us think rationally and my bias has always been that now the way i'm criticized for that bias so it's good so you put it on your t-shirt i'm alt middle z dog md i want to be the corpus callosum in the conversation people will attack directly and say there is no middle ground here it's mask or don't mask or it's this or it's that and that's fine but at least then we know where our agendas are and where our biases are whose hive mind has captured us that's important to understand because otherwise you'll never be able to bridge these different gaps and have some sanity and what about you marty what would your t-shirt say what's your deep dark agenda here i want us to be as open and as we can about this i would say to end tribalism because that is the most offensive thing it's not a different opinion i'll hear somebody articulate a different perspective and they'll come out entirely differently on what we should be doing or should be recommending that is okay in the context of civility in my mind and my thought is you know let's show the data on both sides to the best of our ability and let people make a decision one of the few things that will be morally offensive is the automatic tribalism the dismissal of people because of something that they thought early on and nothing captures that better than how jay bhattacharya was dismissed early on and now you see like hey the data is playing out just as he said i also feel that we made a tremendous sacrifice as a country we're living like grizzly adams i mean i was at risk of growing a ponytail we come out of this thing and you have people that are saying that was absolutely the right thing to do and we need to go back into the cave because of speculation of a more dangerous virus coming out of south africa and you want to say stop let's look at the data that sort of retreat i think many times is scientifically dishonest when i see the universities who ironically are supposed to be champions of data and scientific reason revert to these sort of primitive practices that are almost barbaric they're definitely cruel on students you want to say i remember in college they would insist that everybody at a liberal arts college take a science course so that you understand the scientific method and process right they would force these philosophy majors to memorize rocks in geology class thinking why do they have to memorize the names of rocks for their future well it's to understand the scientific mind and the scientific process and then they do this complete rejection of any open scientific debate and cancel people with different opinions to me it's the tribalism that bothers me and it's just sad to see it play out i'll say one last thing on this and then we'll get back to what people care about which is not our griping but it's more the fact stuff but i was actually really surprised at some of the hate mail i got after the last podcast now i haven't gone back and listened to it guys i gotta be honest with you i don't really have the time to go back and listen to podcasts i record so i mean i guess it's possible i came across as a racist homophobe but i don't think i did because i'm not actually racist or homophobic but some of the hate mail i got was you are a racist homophobic piece of who lives in texas how can you say the things that you are saying about first of all i'm like a brown guy like am i racist against white i mean like just tell me help me understand more where my racism is coming from these were people that just went off like they went completely off somehow my not wearing a mask and moving from california to texas which technically happened before copen but that's another story is really all a sign of i don't know misogyny racism homophobic behavior like sometimes i get upset when i get nasty comments this couldn't even upset me because i couldn't even understand i was like literally interested in this i was like wow i'm looking at the grammar of the person who wrote it like were they sane is this a person who is having you know kind of a mental break yeah like shiny yeah like anyway um i'm sure you guys experienced the same thing right marty unless you wanted to say something i have some thoughts on this and this actually relates to say the robert malone interview on rogan we're going to talk about this because i want to make sure we spend some good time on this we all get asked a lot about it so absolutely and actually this is an epiphenomenon of that interview in my mind because he talked about mass formation psychosis in that interview and this is a garbage term that he kind of made up from some crazy guy in europe but here's what's actually happening in my opinion and why you see what you're seeing peter and we're all seeing it everybody's seeing it and i don't know if i said this in our last podcast so if i have you just stop me and say you already talked about this but this is what i think is happening and others i've been talking about this in the sense making community online people who are focused on trying to figure out how do we make sense of the world in a fractured information economy and so on so david fuller at rebel wisdom and other people like that bj campbell there's an idea that individual humans actually do instantiate these higher elements of thinking we call them different things group think hive mind he actually calls them agrigores which is a demon that emerges from groups of people and their thinking and it used to be in the old days you would share information in very slow and uniform ways like whether it was mass media just a few channels or whether it's money as a way to exchange information because they're economic incentives like you build a city on a river because it's easy access to ports and so on but now with social media you effectively have turned every human with a smartphone into an addicted machine that behaves like a neuron and its neurotransmitters are likes dislikes comments shares so each of us is part of a network of people that acts again we're neurons and we instantiate through these instant connections hive mind group think tribes that marty said we're trying to reduce tribalism so this is why they even exist because instantly you can be a part of this and then be controlled by it without even knowing it and it's lubricated by social media because now the neurotransmitters like we get our dendrite receives the information from social media we process it we make a decision we send it out and what happens is whatever hive mind you're in has certain rules and it is competing against other hive minds in a way that we're not even able to access and so when you say something peter like you say you know what i don't think we should wear mask and i don't wear masks that particular hive mind that says you know what mass are important we're liberal in our political ideology and these are the rules of that we'll say okay we recognize here an imperator who left to go to texas which is a sign of disloyalty to this particular hive and he's not saying the right things about masks therefore he is absolutely evil outsider must be stopped and the people who are acting as the neuron in that network don't even know they're doing it they actually believe this but until they really introspect or they talk to you in person or something happens that breaks the spell but i think that's what's happening so the malones of the world are captured by the antithesis group think hive mind the say fouchy's eric topless of the world are more captured by the thesis hive mind and who are we in this alt middle corpus callosum hive mind we're hated by everyone that's my thinking on it well i will say this some of the messages that meant the most to me were i have been morally opposed and opposed in every manner to getting vaccinated until i heard this podcast i actually think i might get vaccinated now that's worth all the hate mail in the world and by the way i don't think the purpose of these podcasts is to hey let's make sure we figure out a way to get everybody vaccinated right it's how about we give people the information so they can make the best decision in their best interest but when someone says a buddy of mine who's the most anti-vaxxed human being in the history of civilization just got vaccinated because of that podcast i think wow that's fantastic there is hope that information can trump fear i get the same thing and i'll say this that i get a lot of criticism from hardcore vaccine absolutists in my messaging saying it opens the door you and marty mccary and vinai prasad and peter atia and monica gandhi opened the door for people not to vaccinate it's criminal and you shouldn't do it in making videos that say vaccinate and chill is irresponsible in the setting of omicron that's killing so many people and so on and so forth and again i just feel that hive minds rejection whereas we're seeing the outcome which is people are actually making reasonable decisions based on information that's non-judgey and non-shaming why i think you were effective in convincing that person to get vaccinated or the discussion was i don't think it was me i think it was just the podcast to be clear it wasn't anything i did per se i think it's the honesty i think people are starving out there for honesty on this topic that's not tribal it's not an allegiance to a party line on what we have handed down to us as an edict i think it's this very genuine humility around the data and a virus that changes and evolves and we have to change our thinking in real time so i personally think people are starving for honesty out there and data and i also get millions of comments and emails and most of them are you know thank you but like all of you i can't keep up and we've had these conversations offline but the one email or the one inquiry that i will actually carve time out of my day to have a conversation with is somebody who is on the fence about getting vaccinated spending time and just explaining things with a non-judgmental approach by the way we've been doing this as physicians our whole careers we don't mandate somebody does dressing changes that's right we don't mandate whipple procedures for patients with pancreatic cancer it's like yeah look i mean if you don't operate the odds of it killing you are x and if you operate the odds are y which are lower than x but in the short term there's this risk i mean yeah it's like physicians are very good at having naturally bayesian discussions can you imagine if you don't have this whipple procedure you won't be able to travel because they'll catch you at the tsa and you will lose your job and they'll treat you like crap when you come to the emergency room next time because you're unwhippilized if your a1c goes above seven you're not allowed to work here anymore because it demonstrates you're eating too much and not exercising enough and we can't have you in this place of work i'm sorry you just can't do it your potential future diabetes and diabetes related complications could overwhelm the health care system we want their a1c to be lower right but it's the approach is it a judgmental or a loving approach that's right you can't shame somebody into lowering their hemoglobin a1c you know what shames people into that the fact that they attract ants when they urinate that's enough spilling that much sugar in your urine we got to talk about those things all joking aside this is exactly what monica's entire career has been based on how do you message to say people at high risk for hiv you don't shame them you don't mandate they wear condoms you don't mandate abstinence it doesn't work you have conversations that are by nature bayesian here's the risks and here's our priors and how you think about it so let's get back to some fact-based insight for people where are we marty on monoclonal antibodies as a therapeutic option so let's come back to early 2022 everybody's getting omicron some people are getting a bad case of it are monoclonal antibodies effective if so which ones so two out of the three only work on the delta variant and by the way the people over the last few weeks who have been showing up in the hospital in deep trouble medically tend to be heavily skewed towards the remaining delta variant now if the cdc estimates are correct delta is 1.7 of new cases as of january 14th or so that tells us that the influx that sort of the ongoing damage that this is causing in terms of severe illness is really letting up right now just by the dominance of omicron so we only have one monoclonal that really works well so tiramab it's a gsk veer biopharmaceutical product it's a monoclonal called satirumab and that's the only one that really works well on omicron but if omicron is as mild as we're seeing that tells us we should be using it selectively in high risk individuals we don't do a good job of that in healthcare we can barely hold back throwing the kitchen sink at people even when it's excessive i mean it's just a general pattern and so what you're seeing is these industrial strength big guns like pax levitt and so tear map are being used in very low risk people sometimes people with wealth and power and access that tend to get and that's where we need to say hey wait a minute we have all these tools in the toolbox let's use them selectively and wisely based on somebody's individual risk and any emerging data on the efficacy of fluvoxamine against omicron specifically because obviously the lancet trial the jama trial were all in delta anecdotally do we know anything or has there been any way to update that insight the only thing new is some new data on lunacy at the nih because they wrote a summary of luvoxamine where they described its benefit and impact on reducing hospitalizations and survival and concluded at the end of it that there was insufficient data to recommend it which was a conclusion that should not have been derived from that summary so unfortunately now you have this sort of militaristic everyone just falls in line mentality and medicine by some physicians now many of them are creative and smart enough and they're like hey i read the studies the reduction is dramatic just because there's not an official authorization around it at the fda i'm going to use it for my patients those are the doctors we hear from those of the doctors saying thank you and that's by the way a lot of doctors maybe most and then there's some that just say well the cdc doesn't say it for me to use it or they say the nih does not officially endorsing it so they're up against that now the people who did that study have told zubin and i that they're close to what they believe might be some good news at the fda around an authorization that's just a gestalt and it's not insider information but unfortunately this is a drug that has reduced mortality among people compliant by 91 percent in high-risk coveted patients and we still have very little awareness around it as a matter of fact there was a paper that just came out on the pre-print that showed it was a survey of doctors saying basically when you get somebody with coveted what do you recommend to them what they said was kind of pathetic or sad it was vitamin d vitamin c zinc and something else that has no evidence really behind it now maybe there's some value to vitamin d who knows but i mean that's it i mean no discussion of convalescent plasma which now in concentrated form reduces hospitalizations by 50 percent that's been around by the way for two years no mention of fluvoxamine let's tell people about that so convalescent plasma was talked about immensely in march and april of 2020 when we truly had nothing on the horizon and then it kind of went away and i don't know if it went away because it didn't have efficacy and it was demonstrated or because we finally got monoclonal antibodies later that year first of all tell people what convalescent plasma is and talk a little bit about it as a therapeutic so i'm just close to it because the authors of that study on convalescent plasma early on put a piece in medpage today and i remember talking to them so this was an exciting development convalescent plasma is the plasma from someone who recovered from covid illness that's what convalescent means it means they've recovered and so the plasma is not the red cells it's not red in color it's other fluid that the red cells circulated in your blood system and that plasma contains antibodies so basically what you're getting is you're getting infused a partially intact immune system that is you're getting infused real antibodies and essentially monoclonal antibodies that pharma companies make is the same thing they're just antibodies made in a laboratory and they tend to be all one type hence monoclonal as opposed to polyclonal antibodies so in the convalescent plasma you're getting a more diverse antibody profile arguably that's better for the reasons monica just laid out so there was a lot of enthusiasm around it it's been used by the way for a century i mean there's stories from people getting infections from gunshot wounds in war getting convalescent plasma and so there's a lot of experience with it that was the one of the first levers the medical community reached for when covet hit us and so people were getting it and there was a benefit but the benefit was small i think it was a reduced hospital stays from like 13 to 9 or something like that so what you had was an announcement by trump administration officials that had a lot of enthusiasm and they used the term head of the fda at the time said there was an absolute risk reduction and the technically proper term is a relative risk reduction so people who may just hate the administration or hit anything that comes out of it just pounced including in the medical community they pounced and this is a unfair representation of the data and they just went so there was this sort of backlash was in part in my opinion politically driven so then you didn't get a lot of attention around it there was sort of this confusion and the head of the nih francis collins was asked to weigh in on convalescent plasma and he said we need a randomized controlled trial which is in my opinion kind of a cop-out here we had strong data in a non-randomized fashion because they were telling people hey we've got this do you want to try this on a trial by the way in his defense i think that's a totally reasonable answer even if done in parallel right it's like we should have an rct of this stuff yep we should but what he did is he threw water on any sort of interest in using it clinically it was a lot of it was in sort of a news media distorted but i agree so then you had pharma companies basically saying hey we're making antibodies why use convalescent antibodies but there just wasn't enough to go around and kind of lessen plasma fell to the wayside now the authors of that study had told me hey we're not using this therapy it's only 40 bucks no pharma executive gets rich off of donated plasma we need to start talking about this more well around that time another study another study critical came out and said it doesn't really work hardly as well as the original trial showed now i reached out to the study authors of the first trial that showed a benefit the new england journal and they said that study was flawed the design was flawed we need more research and trust us it's coming and they were very frustrated so they eventually published a study that came out very recently that looked at concentrated convalescent plasma concentrated suggesting you're getting more antibodies in that infusion and it showed a dramatic reduction in hospitalization a reduction by 50 well done study still nobody talks about it you don't hear about it much it's oh my gosh can you believe there's not enough monoclonal antibodies from regeneron well here's another therapy it's not getting attention the attention it deserves is it safe to say that convalescent plasma presumably has a greater diversity of antibodies than a monoclonal antibody sure yes but we don't yet know how effective convulsion plasma will be against omicron but we know obviously for understandable reasons that at least two of the three monoclonals are not effective because presumably they're no longer binding to epitopes that are sufficient to kill the virus that's right in general when you are exposed to a virus you get a more diverse antibody response or profile than you do with just a monoclonal infusion there's two reasons why people think natural immunity is stronger more effective than vaccinated immunity one is you get a more diverse antibody portfolio in the response and the other is the reason monica alluded to and that is natural immunity is based in the mucosa it's more mucosal based immunity so it's more on the front lines of defense okay so therapeutics do we want to talk a little bit about robert malone tell folks who he is zubin and why his name is on the lips of many both disciples and non-disciples or those who want to banish him from the universe yes robert malone is an interesting epi phenomenon i think of our division around this into these two churches of kovidian and covidiet and he's an interesting guy he's definitely a scientist who was involved early on in some of the work on the mrna technology in general and in particular wrapping that mrna molecule in a lipid particle and a fat particle that allows it to be taken up by cells in that case it was mouse cells looking at an hiv protein expression to work on a hiv vaccine which it turned out didn't quite work out because it didn't generate an immune response but the technology was there so he was one contributor in a vast chain of contribution that actually led ultimately to where we are now but his particular contributions and patents that he had had expired a while ago he'd given up looking at that and had moved on into different directions on dna vaccines and things like that so he bills himself as the inventor of mrna technology based on what i just said where he is a small piece of this puzzle but using that credibility and also the credibility of working as a consultant in different government entities and things like that he makes a series of claims about vaccine safety that ultimately got him banned from twitter which got joe rogan's attention and rogan then gave him his platform to say okay if you're banned on twitter what are you saying here and so there are multiple claims that he's made and i'll start by saying this i think some of the things that he said that were correct are things like hey you don't just give infinite boosters to people because that's not a good idea that we already talked about earlier he does question the financial incentives of pharma and different entities within health care to focus on vaccines and i think that's not unreasonable i think he downplays the point that there's lots of money in therapeutics too those are the main things that i think establish his credentials as a heterodox thinker now that's all and then every major point that he makes is fundamentally flawed if not a parroting of an extreme anti-vaccine position on these things and we can go through some of them unless you want to stop me and i'd like to go through some of them specifically so maybe take them in kind of a point counterpoint fashion if you will yeah so one of the things he says is that pcr is overestimating the number of coveted cases and that it's not accurate the truth is it is quite accurate it's very sensitive and it's quite specific so that's just not quite right and his point is you know we're over counting cases and so on does he provide an estimate of the magnitude by which it's being over counted i don't remember if he did but i don't recall him saying specifically he does make other magnitude estimates for example he says if we had just provided early treatments in the form of hydroxychloroquine ivermectin monoclonals etc it is a fact that we would have saved 500 000 us lives and he provides no data to actually support this that's i think an unsupportable claim based on information that we have especially since there's not evidence that hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin actually do anything that's compelling that's still being studied with ivermectin but with hydroxychloroquine it was quite clear he said that hydroxychloroquine was shown to be active against the original stars but this is a bit misleading the original sars in vitro they used chloroquine and it inhibited the virus in vitro but there are millions of compounds that will do that it was never shown to be anything beyond that so that's a misleading statement he then discusses that the spike protein that is used in current vaccines by pfizer moderna etc was never tested for safety their spike protein was never tested for safety but he then either is deliberately misleading or misunderstands the scientific process with this because that's what the clinical trials with tens of thousands of people were doing was showing oh the spike protein that we've coded for with this mrna is safe and effective in a human population so that's just not true the other thing he says that's abjectly untrue is that there were no pre-clinical or animal studies on these particular vaccines or mrna constructs and that those are findable they're all there so that's just simply not true let me see here there's a lot he made so many claims pulling up some of them here he made the claim that hospitals in particular are mischaracterizing covid cases now this is a claim that actually has some validity in the sense hospitals are paid more for coveted patients this is true so there is some incentive to code in a medical billing situation up code this is covid even though it may be like pneumonia or something else going on mi but he also has covet in the early days they've kind of looked at this and it's not clear that that was happening because to some degree there's a fraudulent component there like that's just straight up fraud so he specifically said there are gunshot victims being coded as covet patients and by the way that could be true if a gunshot wound patient has covid and if there's a greater financial incentive to take care of a covid patient you could do that it would be unethical i think it would be against the spirit of how one is to code and i guess you could argue it could verge on fraud if the billing entities are rigorous enough to say why was he admitted to the hospital and asked that question right yes that's exactly right you nailed it so it's fully within the realm of the possible but i don't think in practice that it happens at a level where it would explain anything that would move the needle on the pandemic and actually you can just look at excess mortality figures in the u.s to know that something is up it's a combination of covet and the pericovid phenomenon of our response to covet and other things that kova does by the way what was the excess mortality in 2020 and do we have 2021 data yet absolute lives lost above and beyond 2019 i don't remember the excess mortality at the end of 2020 because i'd done a show on this in the mid 2020s i looked at it in 2021 and i actually have the exact number so i almost don't want to say because i'm sure i'm gonna bastardize it i want to say it was close to 250 000 excess deaths in 2020 relative to 2019. but anyway got it sorry i've got the numbers here okay perfect 477 000 excess deaths from march 1st to december 21st 2020. so basically the 2020 number is 477 000 and 74 of them were due to covet that is match up with the covet mortality so it was 400 300 of which are coveted 385 000 recovered 477 000 total oh okay so half a million excess deaths so you can't explain this with coding if that's part of the argument yeah well beyond coding now some of it may be ancillary effects of lockdowns and so on but some of it may be even under counting of covet cases people just dying at home and not being diagnosed so there's lots of different potential explanations this sort of begs a question which is were the people who disproportionately died people who were going to die within the next two to three years and does that imply that there may be a reduction of death in 2022 2023 when a lot of the people who were going to die of natural causes of heart disease cancer and things like that the most vulnerable people who died in 2020 and 2021 basically died ahead of schedule their lives were shortened by a year or two and you'll see fewer people dying in 22 in 2023 does that matter no but it's just kind of a curious epidemiologic phenomenon right this has been discussed actually quite a bit particularly in online circles it's this dry tinder theory that you took out people that were going to they had a life expectancy like you said that was quite short and all this did was knock them over and we see this every winter in the hospital like flu that's why they say pneumonia is the old man's friend right like it's the final thing that in a very medically frail person so again what's the ramifications of it i actually think it has this ramification in the sense that how much of the overall suffering under the curve was just expedited by a year versus how much is cutting off five years ten years of quality adjusted life years that's quite high that then would justify or de-justify certain social policies that we put in place so it's a good question and i think relating to this he malone um asserts that we don't have good vaccine monitoring at all and asserts that there are lots of vaccine injuries and damage that we are not counting and he talks about vares which is really a hypothesis generating system where anybody can report and so on but he does not talk about prism or vsaf or the vsd the vaccine safety data link these are very robust vaccine monitoring systems that actually help to catch things like very rare events like the vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia of the johnson johnson astrazeneca vaccine so i think that's quite misleading to say that it's good that he's asking these questions and i think people should ask questions about vaccine safety but he's a little misleading here now where he's directly misleading is he makes the assertion that the lipid nanoparticles from the mrna vaccines concentrate in tissues such as ovaries explaining things like infertility and menstrual cycle abnormalities in women and the truth is he's the data he's citing is a rat study out of i think i forget where where they pounded these rats with super normal levels of this lipid nanoparticle mrna and they saw accumulations in various tissues but no tissue damage actually and this has not been seen in humans there are menstrual cycle abnormalities so that's where he is correct and nih has actually funded studies on this and what they're seeing is what women have reported if we'd actually listened to women that their menstrual cycles are abnormal for a cycle or two either heavier lighter they skip a period an oregon study that i think was preliminarily released with this funding actually showed that yeah this may be true at least for a period or two but then reverts back we have not seen widespread effects on fertility on that topic zubin i remember the first one of my female patients to tell me this she's an especially funny woman and she said she said we were actually it was actually in a social setting as well so we weren't like in the uh office having this discussion she said you know it's really funny it seems like i was stabbed in the vagina is that possible and i was like wow say more and she's like yeah she's like look i've never had so much bleeding in my life and that lasted for two cycles for her interesting the speculation on why this may be has been rampant some of it is just with any infection with an immune response there can be abnormalities in menstrual cycles and it's that whole hypothalamic ovarian axis thing that i wish i understood better peter i've never understood the lady parts i'm going to be fully honest my wife will confirm this but i think the fact that we take it seriously is important so i'm glad at least malone mentions that he just mentions it in combination with just the wrong thinking he mentions other things about ivermectin that are incorrect like japan recommending ivermectin for treatment of kovid they did not he says that the chinese were using hydroxychloroquine to great effect early on and use that as an example of reason of why we should be using it simply not true so things like that along those lines and those are the types of claims that are difficult because you can't counter a negative in other words if someone says look i mean it's been well known that the so-and-so hospital in china pioneered a study that then led to the mass adoption of this therapy well you can't search the anti-truth to that like it's just you can say well show me the data but when someone's rapid fire giving you stat after stat after stat it's very difficult to counter that then this is why i think many people will not they constantly want to debate so malone and others will say well we'll debate anybody but of course we want our friend steve kirsch with us who's funding some of this stuff and steve is known to do this he will just throw out what about this study what about this what about this data out of utter pradesh when you actually have days to look at the data you realize wow that's total but i i could never have responded that in real time yeah i've often thought that the only way to do a debate like that is to do it the way a court interacts which is using a discovery right so you can't present evidence in court without the opposite side seeing the data in discovery seeing the evidence and discovery so that you don't get the surprises you can surprise somebody with your interpretation or a question you're going to ask there can't be any gotcha moments with new data and i've often thought the only way you could have an honest debate in any format whether it's an awkward style debate or otherwise is to have everybody say this is the only data we're going to debate everybody can get as familiar with it as they want and now let's talk about the opposing views and the opposing ways that we might interpret this to me that would be a much more honest way that's a correct way to do it exactly and you want debate you want conversations like stifling that is a terrible the fact that malone was de-platformed on these other platforms is why he's on rogan so it actually gives people like this that and i have no idea what his motivations are right i mean you can speculate but that's all ad hominem stuff and i'm not gonna do it today but the one interesting thing other thing i'll say about malone is it's important actually when you're judging the veracity of somebody or the credibility of somebody it's important to see who they cite to right so at one point he says listen peter duesberg you guys remember peter duesberg he's a legendary guy in science because he was an esteemed virologist based out of uc berkeley my alma mater he taught a course that i took actually and he was known for denying that hiv the virus caused aids to the point where he questioned that hiv didn't fulfill koch's postulates of infectious agent and his proposal was it's gay behavior iv drug use nitrate poppers basically sin that was causing the immunosuppression and that azt and the drugs we were giving were making it worse he would say things in his german accent like azt is aids by prescription he got famous for this because he went to south africa and actually convinced the president of south africa that this might be true and it may well have cost lots of people their lives because they were slow to uptake protease inhibitors etc so malone actually cites duesberg as the esteemed virologist who was cancelled by fouchy in the early days this is not true actually duesberg continued to teach at berkeley where i took his class where he presented his ideas and we got to debate them and he was since proved remarkably wrong and in the same breath he actually associates with robert f kennedy jr who is a known sort of anti-vaccine activist not a physician so he's kind of aligned with that camp and right after rogan he went on info wars with alex jones and started talking about the great reset various conspiracies along those lines that's the deep end yeah yeah one of the other things i want to ask you about is the only term that i keep hearing from that because i have not seen that podcast is the mass formation psychosis term can you say more about what that is because i literally have no idea so the way malone describes mass formation psychosis and again i earlier in this podcast talked about what i think is actually happening with group think and these neuronal networks and the fact that it's important to understand this any human now can create information and put it out in the world and form a hive mind around it it's easy to do you don't need a mainstream position to do it now what malone is saying is the mainstream which does control major media like cnn msnbc a lot of the scientific community through funding things like that big pharmaceutical companies has created what he terms based on the work of a european psychologist i think i forget the guy's name he has created a mass formation psychosis and he parallels it to what happened with nazi germany which again when if you're resorting to the nazis you've kind of already lost the discussion but i just sort of did something like that tried to caveat it so that it wouldn't be as idiotic but i kind of made the point a moment ago that when you prevent people from traveling within or outside of their country it's within the hemisphere of the most extreme fascist threats right yes and you immunize yourself by wrapping it in reason and i think malone actually did that too where he was talking here because this is what he said i think he's correct in this sense he said the rules for having a mass formation psychosis where the population is this is what his words hypnotized into believing something to the detriment of actual truth is the following you need an isolated population where there's been isolation and dissatisfaction and again going back to nazi germany pre-war you need a sense of economic destabilization and crisis you need to kind of silo people off i forget all the things he listed but one of them is then you need an entity in authority to say we have the solution and it is one solution and that's it and so his argument is he says then really good people the german people who are hyper-educated go and do crazy things and he said now we're in a situation where the mainstream has created this mass formation psychosis where the only way out where like we're in this dangerous situation you have to lock down you have to close schools you have to shut down your way of life and wear masks and the solution is just this vaccines forget about therapeutics forget about ivermectin forget about monoclonals it's just this and this is the only way out and people start to believe it because they're so destabilized from all the other stuff happening and so they go along with the mass formation where i think he's correct is that we are all victims of group think what he ignores is that so is he and he's part of the reactionary tribe mind that says no i'm not comfortable with this and hear all the crazy things we believe so that's what mass formation psychosis is from his angle i really appreciate that by the way that was a remarkable tour de force do you recommend that people go and watch the podcast so they can hear his arguments out in full and contrast that with what you're saying or just as you did with peter mccullough where you put out a really nice podcast where you completely unemotionally went through all of his arguments and stated where you thought they were reasonable and unreasonable have you done the same thing for this podcast man i knew you were going to ask that people have been asking me to do it and i'm just honestly i'm so resistant because it's so exhausting to do but i might just do it i know vinai is writing an article on it he was asked to write a piece on it so he's going to be addressing the points point by point at some point i probably will have to do that there's a guy who did one online but he is such a thesis guy like he's so hardcore covidien it's so biased that you can't really take some of the points seriously and i think people who would believe malone will never believe this guy that's right it actually forces people to kind of dig their heels in on that yes agree so if you guys have some time there's still a few other things i want to talk about and one of them is what is the exit strategy we talked about this a couple of weeks ago which is it's always a good idea to have your exit in mind whether you're talking about war whether you're talking about an investment in a company whatever it is you're doing a vacation you should always have an exit in mind you should always have a plan for when you're going to change this thing back to the new norm so what's your reflection on that i mean i take some comfort in what monica presented to us which was that hey it might be the case that in the spring colleges are going to say you don't have to wear masks to sit in class anymore that would be fantastic for young people for every person if airplanes if the tsa and airlines say you no longer have to wear masks who's mandating that we have to wear masks in airports i don't even know who that is yeah fair enough yeah tsa they're doing enough to it so okay like do you guys think that in three months there will be no more mandatory masking anywhere in the country i think in a matter of a month or two you can have very low levels of omicron round almost nobody left who's not already had it or strong immunity and i think people are going to be so giddy to move on that the fatigue is just going to hit all-time highs and people are going to turn the page and i think you're going to see a sentiment really flip in most of the country now if you remember the opioid epidemic was nightly news every night we all were sort of in touch with it and then overnight in one day the media shifted their attention and it was almost as if within 24 hours people forgot we even had an opioid epidemic and i think there's going to be an even bigger flip pretty soon it may be something distracting and maybe other news it may be a concert in central park where people just finally feel liberated it may be a landmark event but i do think people are going to shift their attention very soon when we get to very low levels of omicron which the uk and south africa would suggest in a preview that that's about a month or two away just to push back on that marty we're gonna either have omicron come back next winter or we're going to have epsilon show up next winter and presumably case rates will be high again and mortality and hospitalizations will be relatively low but what will prevent us from backsliding into the state of panic well i think part of it's going to be geography i've really enjoyed my time in florida during the pandemic i feel like i'm just enjoying life i'm a million times happier here i don't have to get a colonoscopy to go into a restaurant in new york or anything like that so i think about all those missed polyps though marty i mean yeah there's a party that's not very good public health messaging so i think it's going to be regional i do think there's going to be a big part of the country that's going to say hey wait a minute we could be looking at a new variant in the fall there's going to be respiratory pathogens circulating this fall for sure 10 to 25 of the public is going to get some respiratory infection almost every year in perpetuity that's the way respiratory pathogens work so are we going to put up a serious guard and have this sort of anxiety that we've had with the new variant of the fall or the following fall but it's we're definitely going to see more variants or are we going to realize what monica was describing and that is the beautiful amazing gorgeous immune system of the human body where adaptive immunity will increase our protection against future variants regardless of what they are and i think there might be some anxiety but at some point people are just going to say i believe in the adaptive immunity so then what are the implications then for vaccine mandates where do we see this going let's put federal aside so there's not going to be a federal mandate but states and employers universities where is that going to go and look he's become a bit of a meme but let's look at djokovic right now i mean the guy just got kicked out of australia does not get to defend his title in the australian open i think there's two ways people are talking about this one is the rules are the rules you're not exempt and i think that's a fair statement right if australia has this rule and it applies to everyone then it should also apply to the best tennis player in the world maybe the more important question is is that a good rule to have period but i read a story today that said look he's not going to be allowed in france so he's not going to get to defend his title at the french open and if he's not going to get to defend there i mean is he not going to get to defend his title at wimbledon i mean is djokovic never going to play another major because he's not vaccinated to me until this question gets resolved there's no exit strategy where do we see this going see this is why we need to have these discussions because what is the incremental value now of mandating vaccines and vinai talks about this a lot when i preside he says how many people are actually at risk of high complications and of those how many are unvaccinated and of those how many will mandates actually reach them and the answer is probably much less than you think so instead there are these sort of shotgun mandates that affect a lot of people that really it matters much less you have these epiphenomenon like djokovic you now can't play and we're polarizing society more along these like peri-religious lines so at some point we just have to say what i think we've all been saying a little bit and monica is effectively saying which is it's now an individual choice you can vaccinate you can wear a mask or not and you can take the precautions that you need to and omicron will be the great equalizer that immunizes a lot of people and will then be on the other side of this where we don't need mandates and policy stuff we have to have those conversations but even opening your mouth about it is taboo within certain hive mind states i think it also requires a degree of thick skin peter you and i both have attested to being it's a state of suffering having to even deal with this stuff because of the amount of craziness that we see so we have to just thicken our skin and say no but we're going to keep talking about it because what's the end point what's the exit strategy i don't know why i find myself we talked about this last time having much more empathy for people who don't see eye to eye with me on vaccines who are anti-vaxx and even though i don't agree with them scientifically and i don't agree with the facts that they cite in some circumstances if not most circumstances i'm curious as to what it says about me as a person good bad or indifferent that i can't imagine that you would force somebody to get a vaccine in this situation i reserve the right to say maybe one day a pathogen will come along that is so deadly for which there is no treatment for which transmission is eliminated by a vaccine and for which the vaccine is so incredibly safe where i might change my mind i might reserve the right to say you know what we're gonna have to mandate this but i can't say it with this fact set what you just did where you said this is what would convince me to do something is a key thing because i think what separates your thinking which is nuanced from say a hardcore anti-vaxx person who's just that condition say or even a provax person is there is no situation like if you ask robert f kennedy jr is there any example that you have of a vaccine that's done some good and i was part of this documentary that he was involved so i've seen this it's not been released he says something to the effect of i don't know if i can even point to anything it's like well so there's nothing that would convince you there's no status that's tough then you're talking about a real belief-based thing instead of a like you said before peter strong convictions loosely held like what would dislodge that conviction i think when you know how the sausage is made when you see the decision-making at say a state government level that is requiring a 25-year-old forest ranger to get a booster who's thin and already had coveted and you see the absurdity of how they've brushed over the data how there's this bandwagon effect how the leadership has been dismissive of some of the data and cherry picking the other day when you have that back knowledge that's what makes it particularly difficult to watch to address your point peter because you see intrinsically this attitude of you're stupid don't ask questions just do it and it's like hey wait a minute that's not how i'm wired so i do worry about another pandemic that has a case fatality rate not of two tenths of one percent which is probably retrospectively what it's panning out to be with covid to an infection with a case fatality rate of five percent spanish flu had a case fatality rate of two percent ebola has a case fatality rate of 50 percent what happens when we get a virus with a case fatality rate of truly 10 as we were worried about from the early reports of china and we are acting like this sort of dysfunctional tribal big tech censored i mean we might be hosed i mean we've got to have an nih that responds in seven days with bedside clinical trials to tell us what's happening what works what's effective we cannot be ignoring some therapeutics and parading around others i mean we've got to have a completely different mindset this is going to be an unpopular and charged question but i guess we can talk about it what are the ethics of having the people at the top of the nih be both in charge of funding any academic in this country and yet also being the arbiters of what is appropriate to be said and not to be said i've spoken very privately with people who have shared this middle ground view who have said i am not permitted to speak about this i am told i cannot speak about this or i will lose my funding and my entire career is based on what the nih gives me and i've been told explicitly by the way not implicitly i have been told explicitly by my department chair if i ever say anything that counteracts the narrative of the nih i will lose my funding so we think about all the careers that are being ruined this person that i mentioned who got fired in november for not being vaccinated from a very prestigious university talk about the djokovic of the world this is a guy's legacy who could be altered by this and then you talk about people who are now being silenced and not permitted to say anything that is at odds with the narrative of their funder i mean that's very problematic to me especially within science science has a currency of objectivity it's taken the single most precious currency and said let's put that in the closet i mean look at the duesberg thing that we talked about with malone this guy peter duesberg he kept his job he's tenured professor he got to say what he wanted other people proved him wrong it was a scientific process i don't know what happened with his funding i think he was affected actually funding wise so this is a conflict i mean it's clear because it doesn't force a kind of group think in this case there's a physical effector inhibition from the group mind down to the individual neuron do not misbehave or you will lose your atp you'll lose your glucose you'll lose your source of energy and that's problematic scientific freedom is a key component of actually being able to do science because science isn't a dogma it's a process so i think your concerns about like further damaging the credibility the trustworthiness of science in the future is valid i don't know if you guys saw the movie don't look up on netflix oh man it was depressing because it was so accurate it was like wow this is exactly what would happen if we had a true existential threat humans would be so divided so untrustworthy so social media siloed and behave like jackasses to the degree that we deserve to be wiped out it's funny you say that at the end of that movie i was like well at least they had the right outcome here yeah me too yeah yeah good riddance

[02:42:57] but peter i've had so many doctors tell me exactly what you just described i've been threatened i've been bullied by my media relations department at my hospital my department chair directly told me don't put this out don't write this op-ed i've had people submit things for publication and then immediately you know insist before they're published that it be withdrawn because they're worried about how it could be perceived and often tell me marty i believe in everything that you're talking about i believe in natural immunity confers a lot of protection i believe in spacing out the second doses to save more lives and give better durability to the immunity i believe in open schools that cloth mass don't work but i can't say anything from my position keep going keep being out there and say things you get it peter i know zubin you get it and you look at this national dialogue and you recognize the one common theme people say is that their local institutions are concerned how it could be perceived so basically twitter is now the ultimate arbitrator of whether or not institutions are willing to put things out and the other thing you hear is they're worried about their nih funding and if there is one currency of academic medicine it is nih funding it is a direct requirement for every step of the promotions process and sometimes i do notice that those who tend to be more outspoken are those who are already tenured and it's not because they're just bolder it's because they have less of that concern and that is a direct conflict and we saw it with the lab leak hypothesis being discussed why can't we just all agree to have no more gain of function research there's something where there should be broad consensus and i think people are afraid to go against dr fauci dr collins that is a tremendous amount of power in concentrated in one human being dr fauci and it's even magnified because he's such a nice gentleman he's a great guy i mean if you've ever talked to him so you have this very charming very influential editor of harrison's who's on every media outlet that has an fcc license every day and he's talking controlling the narrative and so for example if he talked about fluvoxamine once this entire pandemic people would say hmm this is interesting let's take a look at it oh you know what it's on the therapeutics page of covid at the john the johns hopkins website it's on the list of recommended treatments under the university of washington medical center site he has so much influence it is too concentrated it's not that he's bad or diabolical i actually think he's very well intended i've just disagreed with him on almost every aspect of the strategy but that i think is too much concentration of power especially when he controls the nih funding dollars by the way final point i just heard from a doctor who been funded by the nih for 30 years who tells me he submitted a very elegant and extensive grant to study natural immunity got a near perfect score and it's not been funded that's the kind of thing where it's like look if you've got 42 billion dollars at your disposal at the nih that's one question that should deserve funding and to get an answer rather than say we don't know how many studies have been funded by the nih that look at disparities in covid rates marty we just put the study out my research team did put it on the pre-print server 254 studies looking at covert research on health disparities and social disparities and then there's been 254 studies on natural immunity as well right funded by nih there's one prevalent study we don't have the results to yet and it's outdated anyway and the other question is how does the virus spread and they funded four studies on that and number of grants on masks one so you had 254 grants the nih put out there on social and health disparities in covid four on how it spreads one on masks i'm all for addressing social and health disparities by the way if you agree with me you should be offended that princeton is testing people three times a week even though they're asymptomatic and triple vaxxed you talk about a disparity high-risk people in the community or can't get a test when they're sick and vulnerable and yet we're testing the hell out of these young healthy triple vaxxed people so i mean that is unaddressed but i'm all for addressing health disparities but how about knowing how it spreads because we were propagating surface transmission for way too long or actually understanding what the natural history of the disease is vis-a-vis the immune system in the people who were infected without a vaccine but yeah no no these are trite questions gentlemen any thoughts before we wrap this up we promised we were going to keep this short and we kind of failed i got to say this i'm going to defend faushi for a second from one particular entity the new york post ran a piece about fauci's finances that were disclosed and i took personal offense to this because the guy's 80. and this is what he has peter you'll appreciate this as a financially literate individual marty not so much i know marty's fast and loose with his money he's all over swiss bank accounts he's just crazy so fauci had 10 million dollars in retirement stock assets that were diversified across very boring mutual funds at age 80 something right and also a like 50 000 steak in a small italian restaurant in san francisco and this particular collection of stuff was billed as some kind of egregious wealth and conflict and all of this and i'm like dude the guy saved his money and happened to believe in the power of compounding and very generic mutual funds it's not like he owns directly like pfizer or something but i thought that was interesting i'm like man i god i hope no one ever looks at my finances because first of all they'll laugh at why i'm not rich like what is this guy doing yeah now that's an interesting point well first of all i mean that's a great example of because he's a public servant right i mean he's been a public servant his whole life it's wonderful to see that he's been fastidiously saving investing and letting the miracle of compounding do its thing in his favor and i mean i think that's the problem with both sides of this when you view him as the pope and he's so holy that any questioning of him is tantamount to treason you're equally egregious to when you just think that everything he does is horrible and when we've established that nuance is not the forte of the mob so anyway gentlemen i thank you again for this and i know we were all made infinitely better by monica's presence here she elevated the game quite a bit yes he's awesome all right guys well i keep saying we'll never do this again but i'm not going to say never so i don't think we'll be doing it for a while i think we've said all we need to say on this subject thank you peter and thanks for uh diversifying our crew with some estrogen
