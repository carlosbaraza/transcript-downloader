## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia

[00:00:09] hey lane awesome to uh be sitting down with you today at least virtually i've been looking forward to speaking with you for actually about two and a half years i know dom introduced us a long time ago we were trying to do this in person at some point and then one thing led to another it became covid and then all of a sudden i realized you don't have to be in person to do a podcast though i do wish we were in person because i i suspect this will be a really long discussion um and a great one um you know first off i just want to say one thing that i think people sometimes assume is that people like you and i have so much in terms of you know viewpoints that are vastly different and you know i spent a lot of time reading your material and watching your videos and i followed your work for quite some time and i would actually say that that i there are very few things that i think you and i don't that don't don't see eye to eye on and and maybe some of those things will come up today i think they'd be very interesting um but i also think the level of nuance and sophistication you bring to the subject matter is exciting which is why i want to talk with you about so many things um but i kind of want to start by letting listeners understand a little bit about who you are and and why i think you're qualified to speak on so so many subject matters so i mean let's just talk about you know you grew up in outside of chicago if i recall actually in southern indiana so i'm from uh evansville originally so 20 minutes from illinois and five minutes from kentucky oh impressive wow um that's not often you can straddle that many uh borders right um what kind of sports did you play growing up so uh baseball was my primary one i um i played since i was five and i lettered in high school um but it was i was i would never say that sports came naturally to me it was definitely something i really had to work at um and uh that may be apparent for my baseball fishing autos out there i was a five foot ten right-handed first baseman so that's not your prototypical uh first baseman but i really enjoyed baseball and it kind of stoked my competitive fire and then i also did run country in high school as well which definitely not the sport that you would pick as the precursor to strength sports and bodybuilding but those were at the time kind of like the ones that i sucked the least at i guess it's the way i'll put it in terms of uh natural ability and um yeah the baseball was my real passion though growing up that's what i i really enjoyed was it during baseball and and you know learning to get conditioned for baseball that you kind of discovered the weight room and your talents in the weight room so i would actually say no that was more so um i was very very much uh picked on and i would say like borderline like emotionally abused by my peers growing up i was a nerdy kid i had adhd i was talkative i was goofy and so when you're you know all that stuff can help you when you get older because being different is good when you're older but when you're young uh being different is not so much fun so um i got picked on a lot didn't really get much attention from girls and uh just to be quite frank i started lifting weights just to hopefully have people stop picking on me and uh and get some dates and lifting weights didn't do either of those things but i developed a passion for weight training and i wouldn't say it was something that like really really came naturally i was never like a hyper responder or anything like that um but i just i really really enjoyed it and i'd always been somebody who um in my scholastics i wouldn't say things really came that easy to me either because probably a little bit because of my adhd but i was able i did find at a young age that through sheer volume of work i could overcome a lot of that stuff and so i really appreciated lifting weights i guess from the perspective of the work investment to the payoff compared to how much talent was needed seemed to be a lower threshold so it didn't you know if you're five foot ten right-handed and you're trying to pitch in the big leagues you'll be pretty limited you know now certainly there are limitations in terms of like hypertrophy and strength building but for me it just it felt more fair i guess in terms the level of work you get in versus what you see and then in terms of i think the other thing is it's very measurable if you go if you if you lifted a certain amount today and in two months you go in and you're lifting you know 10 percent more than that that's a very hard outcome there's no there's no i think i'm getting better it's like no i am getting better and so i think you know i appreciated kind of that black and white to weightlifting um you know i can sort of appreciate so many of the things that you just said um and among them is sort of an early discovery for training um for me it was um more boxing that was the thing that kind of drew me in young but but in parallel to that strength training and endurance training both became supportive pillars to boxing i was fortunate i think and that i found great mentors that you know introduced me to powerlifting when i was young they were older men that trained in a gym at the university that i trained at when i was 13 and 14 years old did you find mentors like that who kind of took you under their wing to keep you safe and also explain the sport and you know give you some common sense around training i would say the first few years no actually when i you know i um i always joke that you know i didn't i didn't we didn't have a lot of money growing up and um you know i didn't really have you know southern indiana wasn't really a hotbed of fitness for information and i'll go ahead and date myself i'm i'm 39 years old so when i started was you know you know in the late 90s and so i mean basically what you had was was bodybuilding magazines and i really couldn't afford a subscription to those either so i actually the first thing i ever did when i got into weightlifting was i walked down to my local library literally walked down to my local library and checked out books on weight training do you remember some of the books you checked out oh man i wish i did but i i don't and actually i would say like the what i do remember especially for one particular book which was it's kind of like basics of strength training or something like that it wasn't that bad actually um you know we have really advanced our understanding of weight training but you know the basics progressive overload that sort of stuff is still still relatively similar i remember the book did talk about periodization which at that time kind of was not a new concept in athletics but for weightlifting was a new concept and um so anyways like that that was kind of like my first few years was a little bit self-guided or when i had lifting classes they did offer a class on lifting in high school it was kind of just doing what whatever the football team was doing basically but obviously i still got stronger just because if you're consistent you will get stronger regardless of what you're doing and then at 19 i entered my first bodybuilding competition as a teenager and just by pure serendipity i was i wanted to compete in drug tested bodybuilding i don't have any i always have to give this caveat you know i've always been drug free in terms of anabolic steroids growth hormones you know all that kind of stuff um no performance-enhancing drugs i don't have any problem with anybody who does it as long as they compete in untested organizations that's my my caveat i always just chose to compete drug tested because i just never felt called to be mr olympia or anything like that and i you know again i don't this is my own personal ethos i'm not judging anybody who's ever done performance enhancing drugs um i just wouldn't have felt good about myself that that's that's the only thing i can say and i'm not saying that anybody who's done that shouldn't feel good about themselves i just knew i wouldn't feel good about myself so with that out of the way i was doing a drug tested bodybuilding show and pretty much the only natural bodybuilding evidence-based natural bodybuilding coach lived in my hometown and his name was dr joe klemzetsky and i reached out to him because he wrote for the natural bodybuilding magazines and he helped prep me for the show i won the teenage division and the the novice division and i was hooked of course but also um he i mean dr joe wasn't right about everything obviously but the the crux of his information and being you know being so focused on being evidence-based and um you know not necessarily buying into dogma that sort of thing that definitely did help me and just listening to him talk about you know the physiology of you know for example uh water depletion is something very common amongst bodybuilders and you know the first meeting we ever had he's like yeah i don't do that because i don't think it's a good idea and he listed out all the physiological reasons why he didn't think it was a good idea and it made a lot of sense so i but i remember listening to that thinking man i don't know any of this stuff like i would love to to know more about this and so i think meeting joe that was part of the reason that i really wanted to learn more about the human body and push more in academics and he had a phd and i think that was kind of like the first seed of maybe i want to go even further than just like an undergraduate degree or something like that so there are actually several things in there that i want to go back and revisit um i'll start with the latter you mentioned adhd were you was was school kind of hard for you and um was this a big step forward to think hey not only am i going to go to college but i'm probably going to want to do a phd to follow in this guy's footsteps not we're not necessarily following his footsteps but to really go deep into something scientific uh i think by the time i got to college i had developed really good study habits and so let me back up yeah school was difficult for me it's very difficult for me to stay focused but um i think just through sheer effect of my parents basically beating into my head from a young age you are going to college and you are going to get an education you know that sort of thing and uh you know not i don't want to sell like it was an overbearing parent sort of thing it was just they were very committed to my education but it was never like oh you need to go be a doctor or you need to go do this you need to go that it was just we want you to get educated and i wanted to get educated too i was the first person in my family even like my extended family ever even go to college and so i think the adhd made it tough at first and i never got bad grades in school but i struggled in terms of the teachers would really complain about you know how my lack of attention my lack of focus uh those sorts of things and i um so i found for me when i had to study i really had to spend a lot more time than most the students my age were doing so i took for example advanced chemistry in high school and i'll never forget this conversation we had a test coming up and i had studied for probably a total of like 15 hours i'd say for this test which in high school is a lot for a test at least for me seemed like a lot um and i remember talking to a friend of mine who got the same grade i did on the test and he was like yeah you know i studied a little bit last night and i was thinking man if i studied just last night i would have failed this test you know so it did seem like i had to do more work and it might not even be more work i just if i tried to sit down for like eight hours i remember my roommate my freshman year in college great guy he's now a head he was the head of medicine at naples general uh for several years but he could sit down for eight hours straight have complete silence and just study the whole time if i try to do that i'd get about 30 minutes of productive studying in so i had to learn to kind of break things up and i'm not saying this works for everybody with adhd but for me it worked so i i would get distracted so easily that i just stopped trying to fight that and i allowed myself to get distracted but i'd always come back so i would do 30 but no more than 45 minutes at a block i would do that and then i would take 15 minutes and i would let myself you know browse the internet or read something else or watch some tv or something like that but i would always put a timer on and i would i would go back when it was time and that seemed to really work personally for me so by the time i got to college i had i kind of had figured out what worked for me studying wise and i went to a college called um eckerd college which is a private school in st petersburg florida which was um you know in the on the the ranking it was very selective in a high quality school all this kind of stuff and so i was petrified because i'm this kid from southern indiana i've never been anywhere really and i have no idea how i'm going to stack up against you know students from other places like you know the northeast and that sort of thing so i was so petrified i studied so hard i i got uh a's i still remember this i got a's on my first 11 tests i ever had in college because i was so petrified about uh failing so i think by that point i had already had good study habits you know i did take like ritalin and adderall growing up and i do think those helped a little bit um the only i always joked like the only problem with like adderall um is whatever i was doing when it kicked in was what i was gonna be doing for the next eight hours you know so if i i remember one day i was i was looking up fantasy football rankings uh first year i ever played fantasy football and that i did that all day all day when it kicked in and i went from worst to first in fantasy football that year and uh so anyways but by the time i got to grad school i was kind of able to wean myself off that i think the last time i ever took any medication was 15 years ago and i think a lot of it you know i don't judge anybody who takes medication for it because like i said i think it did help but i think i just got to the point with my study habits where i didn't really feel like i needed it and yeah so i just think the fact that i had to struggle a little bit when i was young actually really helped me and kind of like carterized me in terms of like being able to deal with some adversity and uh i i think that's what really helped me when i went to college and then grad school so um i'm going to put on the back burner for a moment some of the stuff i want to come back to with respect to your training history and and continue down this sort of academic thread um talk to me a little bit about the decisions you made to then pursue higher education beyond a bachelor's degree and how you decided to for example pick a phd and then further decide what what what area you wanted to study so this is just like one of those things where you look back and you go wow i really stumbled into doing some of the right things having no freaking concept of what i was doing at the time so uh when i originally went to school i went for i went to eckerd because i wanted to study marine science when i was growing up i wanted to be a shark biologist like i that was my passion with sharks i still love fishing and i still love going out and and uh being in the wild with sharks and that sort of thing in fact one of my goals is to dive with a great white shark at some point did you see that uh did you see that nat geo special um that tracked or that it was based on something that happened in hawaii i think two years ago where that whale came ashore they took it this was off or off oahu they took it five miles out and they went out there to study the tiger sharks that would be feeding off it and lo and behold like the largest great white ever came up upon it oh you must see this we'll link to it in the show notes i this is one of those things where one day i was walking through the playroom and my kids were fixated on it and i sat down for two minutes to watch it and then an hour later i'm still watching it couldn't stop but it i won't spoil it for you then i'll just i'll just leave it at that and say you will go bananas watching this thing and it's it's yeah cool yeah i think i watched jaws about 8 000 times when i was a kid so um i probably will enjoy i still get excited for shark week whenever it comes up so anyway i went to eckerd for that and um i remember i interviewed at florida institute of technology as well and one of the professors there actually studied great white sharks and you know he i'm i'm very thankful for this guy i can't remember his name but he said look i'm not telling you not to do this i'm just going to be honest with you about what i do he said i've got a job that maybe 1 in 10 people in the entire world have i don't get paid great for it and it was really hard to get now i'm not saying you can't get that but what i would recommend to you is if you're truly passionate about this go do a degree in a more general science and then go specialize when you get to graduate school he said because if you start general you'll still have the base that you need for grad school um and if you're still really passionate about this you're gonna need the grad school education anyway and i thought okay well maybe that's not a bad idea um and so i actually went instead of marine science i started in biology and then my first year i had a general chemistry professor named chris novel and i actually still keep in touch with him to this day here and there and we were in lab one day and i think he really liked me like just my attitude and he said lane come here he's like i know you're doing biology he's like what you need to do is biochemistry and i was like well why do i i'm you know i'm a freshman i have no idea what i'm doing like why do i want to do biochemistry he said well let me put it to you this way he's like if you decide that you don't want to go to grad school and you have a biology degree you look like a pre-med who didn't get into med school when you go get a job when you go to get a job he said but if you get a degree in biochemistry the world is your oyster you can get any job that you'd be able to get in biology you can get with biochemistry and then some and if you want to go to grad school you have that option this and that by the way i'm not slamming on biology students out there if you love biology and that's what you want to do no worries this is just what he said uh so anyways i was like okay so i switched to biochemistry and um my second year i took organic chemistry and i had a great professor for organic chemistry it was very hard he was not easy but he was firm but fair and i i if i look back my best mentors were always firm but fair um and i got to be in the class but at the end of the semester he asked if i wanted to come do research with him over the summer and i was kind of like well why do you want me i you know i gotta be he's like you asked a lot of questions you were engaged he said grades matter but at the end of the day i want students who are passionate and work hard and i saw how hard you worked so i went and did research with him over the summer um that was my first kind of foray into research didn't get anything done because you know it's 10 weeks and it's my first experience in research so i got to deal with a lot of frustration and stuff not working but i got to do research with him for two years over the next two summers and when i got to my junior year of college i think having that idea of okay what happens next i had i had started writing articles for bodybuilding.com again that's another whole other conversation of serendipity um and i knew i was really passionate about bodybuilding because during that time like i said i'd gotten into competing and whatnot and um but i was thinking well i don't feel like i'm going to be a professional i don't feel like i really know anything i just i had crested the uh dunning-kruger and i was down in the valley you know by the way that that's such a great that's such a great point to make why don't you explain to people who don't understand what the dunning-kruger curve looks like and what it means yeah so if you look at any subject and i'm i'm generalizing very much um so if dunning or kruger listens to this i apologize if i butcher it but essentially um so the dunning-kruger curve is basically perceived knowledge versus actual knowledge and the really interesting thing is when we start in a subject since we are aware that we have no knowledge our perceived knowledge pretty much aligns with how much knowledge we have which is none but pretty quickly our perceived knowledge skyrockets it goes very very high usually after about six to 12 months of you know being involved in a particular subject and we get to this some people never get to this inflection point where it starts to come back down but eventually if you keep learning and keep learning and keep learning you realize oh wow i didn't know as much as i thought i did because i thought i knew that but then this contradicts it and so you start having this like downward turn even though you're learning more your actual knowledge is going up your perception of your knowledge starts going down and i would say my third year of graduate school was where it got to the very bottom that's where i got to the very bottom and interestingly if you look at the dunning-kruger effect you i have a friend named jeremy lincke he's a professor at ole miss and he always says once you drink from the fountain of knowledge you will thirst for the ignorance you once had and um you never your perception of your knowledge if you continue learning will never reach that initial crest that you had that first six to 12 months where you thought you had kind of everything figured out i just can't agree with that more um bob kaplan uh often says and i'm sure he's paraphrasing somebody that the the further you get from shore the deeper the water gets and again it's it's a slightly different way of saying basically the same idea and i again i what i thought i knew about nutrition 10 years ago relative to what i know today in absolute terms i know infinitely more today but in relative terms i.e the perceived terms it's basically to the point where i pretty much think i know nothing now i know that's not true but there are days when i think i actually don't know anything because to your point you're constantly looking for the example that contradicts your belief system and so you have a belief system which is well you know under this condition or this condition or these set of conditions this must be true there's always going to be an exception to that um there is something else though i think i i mean i think unfortunately social media has has created a lot of people who shout really loudly from the top of the dunning krueger that at that initial peak of the dunning-kruger curve and i'm not sure if it's just blind stupidity willful ignorance or what but i think there are a lot of people who have no interest in moving forward right and that's unfortunate but i think that makes it very difficult for people who want to learn because it makes the signal noise problem very difficult you know for example um nobody really wants to hear uncertainty like if if if someone's in the market for knowledge do you want to hear it from that person whose absolute knowledge is high their perceived knowledge is perhaps low and they caveat things that they talk about or do you want to hear that person who's nine months into their you know resurrection of knowledge and speaks like they know everything you know you we tend to gravitate more towards that person so i find this phenomenon very interesting and i just had to make sure we spent a moment on that based on your your reference we had a guy named alan levinovitz on our podcast who's a professor of religious studies but um not to get too far down the rabbit hole on that but he he's done a few books about naturalism and how we kind of even without evidence default to believing that something that's natural even though he talks about how we can't really define that is better and one of the things he talked about was if you want to look for people who know what they're talking about and it is difficult as you said because there's this sea of information out there look for people who seem unsure he's like it's he's like it's a complete paradox right because what another friend of mine greg knuckles said he said what were what if people are really good at when they talk to somebody quickly they can determine whether or not that person knows more about a subject than they do what we're really bad at is if two people have more knowledge on a subject than we do and they're in disagreement we have a lot of problem picking out who is more knowledgeable of the two we tend to just default to whatever our bias is which by the way is why debates tend to be a very unhelpful forum yeah i don't i always tell people debates favor people who could speak well debates debates tend to favor people who can speak well and at the end of the day i mean it doesn't matter what's talking about religion politics nutrition um 95 of the people are going to go with whatever their perception was before the debate and then that little five percent of the independents are are going to make their decision usually based not necessarily off evidence because i mean if you don't have a phd in something or an advanced degree you know if two people are citing studies who do who's who's who do you go with you know it's very very difficult so um yeah so just all that to say you know i didn't feel like i really knew anything is three years into my biochemistry degree even though i was getting good grades and didn't know what i wanted to do with my life i knew i wanted to be in the fitness industry like i was very passionate about bodybuilding but i had no idea how i was going to make a living doing that because at that time you know this is circa 2003 you know the people who made money in the fitness industry either you owned a supplement company you owned a gym you were a personal trainer or you know you you wrote for a publication or something like that you know um and i didn't have the capital to start a supplement company or or the wherewithal to do that and i didn't really want to be a personal trainer and so i i just kind of was like well if i go to graduate school i'll learn more maybe i won't feel so stupid and i can delay the real world a little bit longer figure out what the heck i actually want to do and hopefully i won't be in the unemployment line if i have a master's or phd and that was that was literally my logic now how did you how did you toggle between because i could see at that moment in time you choosing between two paths right you could have gone very deep down the exercise physiology path and you could have gone very deep down the nutrition path you chose the latter of course curious as to how you thought about it at the time yeah i think probably the magazine shaped some of my bias there was a lot of focus on nutrition as opposed to training and even to this day you know this could be a little bit of selection bias but i get a lot more questions about nutrition than i ever do about training and even like me like people are like i hear about 80 nutrition 20 training and i'm like listen i have a phd in nutrition i will tell you training is the most powerful thing for your health and body composition that you can possibly do you know the protein you want you can do all these modifications with your diet you want if you don't train the changes to body comp are going to be pretty minimal you know in terms of you can lose fat but you're also going to lose a little bit of lean body mass with it when you when you diet and you can gain lean body mass but you're also going to gain body fat with it you know resistance training specifically is the most powerful tool you have to change your body composition and i would actually argue your overall health as well but um at the time i was very focused on nutrition and specifically had just started kind of reading studies on muscle protein synthesis just i was always a skinny kid growing up you know i wasn't a fat kid i was i was a skinny kid growing up and so i was mostly focused on how do i build more muscle how do i maximize muscle building i wasn't really focused on how do i get super lean wait let me that goes back to a question i wanted to ask you earlier elaine we kind of glossed over the fact that at 19 you win a drug-free amateur bodybuilding contest which happened to be your first um when did you start lifting weights seriously how old were you so i started and stopped because i got my first girlfriend so i started when i was like 15 years old stopped when i was 16 because i got my first girlfriend and then i picked it back up when i was 17 almost 18 and then never dropped it out after that okay so when you go to that second pickup give me a sense of your your height your weight your body comp and then contrast that with what you looked at what you looked like at 19. so i actually remember exactly how much i weighed um i was about i was right under five foot ten i'm now five foot ten and a half so i essentially was pretty much stopped growing uh and i was 152 pounds and i remember that because the day i picked back up weight training was in november of i want to say 1998. no 1999 and it was at a bigger faster stronger seminar that came to my school because i decided to get back into strength training because my girlfriend had dumped me very shallow reasoning and they weighed us at the bigger faster stronger seminar for whatever reason i always remember that now when i started originally i was 140 pounds as a freshman i started lifting some weights but at this when i picked it up and never dropped it i was 152 pounds and then for my first show i i had peaked in the off season uh i guess it would have been two or three years later two three two years two years later uh at 200 pounds um and i competed at 170 pounds probably something like that uh and i was by that time i had grown an extra half inch and was 5 foot 10 and a half and yeah so i guess it would have been about two and a half years later when i when i hit that hit that mark um and uh you know i did by the end of my high school career had gotten to be like one of the i would say bigger guys in the class but a little more muscular than other people other people started to notice but specifically my upper body because my legs were still terrible because for the first year i didn't really train them because you know leg training sucks was there a point when you just discovered you had a gift of strength you know i remember um talking to mark and chris bell and on the podcast with them i talked about these brothers that were around when i grew up they were they were an age above me so they weren't my peers but by the time i was a teenager they were in their 20s and they were always in the gym when i was there and um there were four of them and they were freaks of nature now they were also all of them taking herculean doses of anabolic steroids but i saw them both on and off steroids and the steroids simply took their god-given abilities and made them out of this world but i i mean i'll never forget one of the brothers who at the time was in residency he was doing his residency in emerging in emergency medicine so he was very he was his training volume was a fraction of what it was when he was in college he would still come into the gym between shifts narrow grip 315 for 12 cold like it was nothing you know on his way to squatting 505 for 12 like unwrapped by the way and like there was just a genetic gift that these guys had and i sort of assumed like yes they trained very hard but pretty early on they knew that they were strong and it was clear just based on the hereditary nature did you i mean your your your best totals nearly 1800 pounds correct yeah so again i don't want to for a moment take away from how hard you work because i know how hard you work but was there something that clicked in and said i'm way better at this naturally than i will be at baseball um so i would say actually no it never it never clicked at that time there was because i never had like i never had a period of time where my gains were just crazy i never really had that what happened was i saw that when i was very consistent and very steady i had very steady increases and so it was never like oh you know we i put you know 50 pounds on my bench press in six months and it's like oh this is the thing i'm i'm doing now it was just a very steady progression and i think that was actually good for me honestly because i think if i'd had a lot of success right out of the gate i might not have pushed as hard or been as consistent because it's kind of this weird paradox with me the harder something is the more i want to do it um so and i do see this as it comes naturally to people and they don't have those kind that kind of resistance early on in terms of having to overcome like plateaus and frustration and setbacks and i encountered all those pretty early on and i think having a little taste of that enabled me to push through a much bigger setbacks in the future so honestly i can't think of a time when i ever was like wow this is now i will tell you when i got to college and was training consistently and able to really eat consistently because even though you know it's calorically dense food i was trying to build muscle like that i wasn't really concerned about the fact that you know i'm eating more calories because one i was using them and two i just wanted to be bigger like i didn't care if i put on a little bit of body fat um so there was a point when i got to college where i was like you know what maybe maybe i can do this because i would look at you know some of the other uh the i'd search online to try and find any like teenage bodybuilders you know and i look at it come to find out partly delusionally because people on stage photos always look way less impressive than they actually look in person uh but i would wait way less or way more oh way less so if you see an actual like you know competitive bodybuilder in person compared to how they look on stage in the photos usually way more impressive in person in terms of their girth or uh definition muscle size muscularity everything oh that's so that's counterintuitive to me i don't really follow i mean yeah basically i i think the last bodybuilder i sort of paid any attention to was um god well let's see maybe lee haney when i was a kid growing up right yeah i paid attention to lee haney and dorian yates probably after dorian yates i stopped paying attention to bodybuilding so i didn't i i've never seen someone of that stature in person yeah it'll blow your mind it really it really does um like obviously it's extremely impressive in magazines and some of the gym photos that they take when the lighting is set up really well you can look at that and go okay that's crazy compared to even the stage photos but yeah so anyway i had this i'm looking at these other guys that are about my age and i'm like you know what he's a little bit better than me but i'm i'm kind of there you know i'm kind of kind of right there now again take my legs out of the equation because my legs were awful at the time uh but my upper body was there basically and so i was like okay well maybe this thing maybe i could be good at this right and you know come to find out i'm sure genetics are just as important in hypertrophy as they are with hitting a baseball or shooting a basketball whatever have you but at the time my mentality was this is more about work ethic and translates better and so i was more committed to putting that energy into it and as far as like strength goes and where i felt like i might have a gift honestly i think that a lot of my gift was and again this could be just hyperbole on my part i think a lot of the gift was i'm just really stubborn and i could tolerate a lot of training volume i actually today went back and looked at uh what i was doing before i went to the ipf world championships which is essentially like the super bowl for powerlifting and that was in 2015 and i i was able to get a gold medal in the squat and actually set a world squat record at the time which was 668 pounds and i weighed in at 201 and a half pounds when i hit it and like i tallied up how many sets i did that week with over 500 pounds between squat and deadlift and it was 34 sets the week you hit that lift and well sorry in the the two weeks before that so i was kind of in my overreaching phase and i just remember looking back at that thinking like how bad i wanted that um and just how much volume of work i did i think again i think i was just able to tolerate some really insane uh style training and i think my body was a little bit more resilient i think my mind was a little bit more resilient i think that helped me a lot because there was a lot of there's a lot of setbacks along the way and that was you know obviously i was in my mid-30s when i did that compared to being a teenager but there was never like a year where my squat just went you know it was always just kind of a slow steady progression and this was from the kid who had skinny legs you know what i mean and um but i had you know endured i had um two herniated discs in my neck i had multiple herniated discs in my lower back i had hip injuries you know everything you know you can imagine of lifting heavy weights and still managed to be able to go do that but i think the fact that i endured some of those setbacks really early on in my career actually like really helped me be able to you know deal with it because one of my big rants i get off on is everybody's like have more confidence in yourself and i'm i always tell people like you can't build confidence out of nothing if you failed at everything you ever tried in your entire life why would you have confidence right so i i try to tell people like look start small you know just like say i'm going to show up to like if it's exercise i'm going to show up every day this week you know regardless of how i feel i'm going to go do it or five days whatever pic pick your number okay you do that there's a just a tiny smidgen of confidence you get from that and then you you build that over time okay well i'm going to you know squat 200 pounds okay and then you hit that and then maybe you get some aches and pains okay well i'm going to rehab this i'm going to go through this and then you get through that and you get stronger right and so if you do that over time every little thing that you go through might feel insignificant in terms of what it means to you at that time but when you look back you can draw on that and i think you know i always tell people i don't think i would have had the success i did in business or um social media or um academia if i hadn't done weightlifting because that taught me so much about other things in life so i realized i went down a big rabbit hole there but um no i i i think that makes a ton of sense and um i get asked sometimes uh you know what's the most important lesson i learned growing up with respect to ultimately being successful academically and um i was not successful at all in school until my last year of high school because i didn't actually plan to go to university i wanted to become a professional boxer so that obviously there was no need to go to university um but i think like you i had an uh an unusual gift for tolerating a lot of training um and a and a surprising lack of confidence in myself which is what drove the training it was sort of an insecurity that's like the other guy's gonna train three hours a day i'm gonna train six hours a day um but when i finally did decide to go to college it actually seemed really easy compared to getting up at 4 30 every morning and running 10 miles and going to the gym this many hours and sparring this many rounds every day and doing 400 push-ups before bed every night and all of those things if you know if if you have to go from doing that to just studying four hours a day you already have the what i call that kind of a habit infrastructure and the discipline infrastructure to do that and i do think that translates so that's why i think personally i just at least with my own kids i think you know i'm delighted when they take up an interest in something whether it be you know my daughter's case music and sports um you know even if you never end up being a professional athlete or drummer or whatever it is it's really building and wiring a discipline around that which obviously you've demonstrated um give me another sense of just in terms of i'm still you have to forgive me but i just most people who don't lift won't appreciate the magnitude of the numbers you're talking about right like a 700 pound squat when you are 200 pounds and you are drug free that's the thing we have to keep re-emphasizing and and i appreciate the way you've talked about this i've read a lot of what you've talked about with respect to the use of performance-enhancing drugs and at least to me it's never come across as haughty or um you know holier than thou it's been hey look this is my choice and your only real pet peeve is people who cheat and basically enter drug free bodybuilding competitions while using drugs which is you know in a sport like bodybuilding where you truly have a choice that strikes me as nonsensical exactly but let's go back to when you're 19 how much could you squat deadlift and bench uh with clear i mean under you know and i don't mean bench where you're bouncing off your chest i mean under clear guidance and rules so the interesting thing was i was a really good bench presser in high school and as a competitive power lifter 15 years later bench press was my worst lift so i peaked early i hit a 300 pound bench press uh in high school now that was not with a pause um if i'm thinking about what i could pause probably would have been like 285 or something like that 280. um my squat i managed so i didn't really train squat that much because legs hurt and i i'm i have so my body type i have a very long femur to shin ratio as well as a shorter torso and essentially what that's going to mean is when you squat the bar must stay over your midfoot if you're going to not fall forwards or backwards and so that means that i have to lean forward quite a bit when i squat and so it's not it's not a pretty squat when i was especially when i was in high school i didn't know how to use um you know hinge correctly and use my hips and whatnot so i mean basically i was able to squat 315 fold it over as a as a high schooler so i mean that's pretty strong for a high schooler but it wasn't it was barely to depth if that and uh definitely not the way you would teach it to somebody um and as far as dead lift i didn't really deadlift in high school i don't think i i'm trying to think about if i ever actually deadlifted i think maybe sporadically maybe i could have hit three plates but i'm not sure i do know that i kind of started doing it in college and i think i hit like a 405 pound deadlift you know before i left college um and i think when i i want to say that i hit like a 385 squat when i finished college so there's no again you can see like it's not that's amazing yeah that's those are very mortal numbers right that's a that's a very slow and steady trajectory um to to obviously where you are now and it and it probably reflects um kind of muscle maturity and also technique maturity you mentioned earlier in passing that you had a couple of herniations both cervical and lumbar did any of them require surgery no and actually i you know i'm full disclosure i'm not a a pain expert or a you know an orthopedist um i think i got some really good advice to not get surgery by the initial person i saw from my neck and actually so dr joe my coach he was also a physical therapist and he said listen because so the first doctor i went to when i had my disc herniation i played rugby in college and that's where i got it from um i had two disc herniations and i had lost i remember i basically had a stinger and i couldn't even pick up a chair with my left hand in my dorm room without slipping out of my hand i lost about 40 of my strength on this left side and i mean i the first doctor i went to was like yeah you you know you probably won't get back all the strength that you you had and i remember thinking why don't you just stab me in the heart instead you know like it'd have been easier but you know i talked to dr joe and joe was like listen you know you have to understand these doctors are used to dealing with your average person who's not going to do the rehab who's not going to do the work who's not going to push themselves he said that's not you you will get back you will hit pr's in the future you know this is this is not a death sentence for your lifting career it's okay and sure enough six months later i was you know i did the rehab and i was i was hitting pr's again and then my lumbar herniations i actually saw uh stu mcgill um who is one of the more well-known experts on on lower back pain and uh you know he did an in-person assessment of me and he basically said listen you know you've yeah you've got you've got some herniations but so do about 60 of amer of all people who are over the age of 30. did you have any loss of strength going down your legs did you have any true sciatic pain or i never had radiating pain i was very localized but i mean when it flared up it was like 10 out of 10 could not get up off my floor i mean i i i tell people at my lowest point i went from literally not being able to move off my side on my floor to squatting 668 pounds you know at a point later in time what was the what was the delta between those time periods uh so with my lower back it has kind of been a little bit of an ongoing issue so the first time it really hit me was in 2015 um the first really bad incident i had was actually a week out from the arnold pro and uh i had been crushing weights and training i mean i was i was very convinced i was gonna squat like 680 or 690. i had hit 600 for five uh in training on squat i had hit uh 675 deadlift for four i mean i was smashing weights and uh the last heavy training session before the arnold so i was going to compete on the friday of the arnold classic and the friday before was my last heavy training session and i finished my squats i went to go do bench press and i still remember like i laid down i was like i feel a little tight that's weird um and it kind of progressively got worse through the day to the point when i woke up the next day i couldn't move and i was like oh my god i have to pull all this meat you know this and that and once the initial kind of inflammation went down you know a few days later i went in i was like all right basically three days before the meat i said i'm gonna go in and try to hit my openers and if i can't hit him then we're just gonna call it and i hit him i went and did the meat i actually won um just so people know what we're talking about this was a bodybuilding meet not a powerlifting meet correct no this was powerful it was so this was okay okay yeah yeah so i went in and hit a long story but i actually ended up tying the world record at that meet uh due to a an error by my coach in terms of attempt selection no hate towards my coach everybody makes mistakes but um in any case i actually did end up winning the meat and squatting 661 pounds of that meat um but then that lower back issue kind of dogged me it was never as bad as it was the the as the initial time but i had so that was the arnold's that was in march i had the world championships coming up in june and that injury kind of dogged me on and on through my training and i got to a point where i had to take four weeks off of squatting and deadlifting um and i i got i started back squatting and deadlifting with four weeks to go for the world championships um and again i don't want to belabor too long but essentially um i like i was missing weights early on in that training that that final training cycle that were like a hundred pounds less than what i needed to squat at worlds um but i you know thankfully again had so many setbacks you know early in in my lifting career that um i i just kind of convinced myself that okay well we're just going to keep showing up we're going to see what happens you know um and ended up going in and hitting a world record on squat and actually got a got a gold medal in squat got a silver medal overall um and and you know obviously did really well and then a couple years after that during training this was during a very stressful period of my life and actually they've they have shown that like stress lack of sleep all that plays into your level of pain sensitivity i i hurt my back and had some other things happen and i mean that basically got to the point where i couldn't move for a couple days um and that's when i kind of took it this was in the december of 2017 and i i took a step i had to really take a step back i took pretty much nine months off of any kind of spine loading probably excessive probably didn't need to go that long um but then built back up and in 2019 hit a 666 pound squat and a 727 pound deadlift at nationals so um you know i think i think a lot of people get injuries especially like these soft tissue injuries and they they you know hear doctors or or you know people that are operating off of pain science from you know decades ago say well just stop lifting or just stop doing whatever you know athletic thing that you do and um i don't think it's a death sentence for most people i mean if you look at especially with regards to back injuries i mean if you go mri 100 people that are over the age of 35 about half of them will have herniated discs that they don't even realize because they're asymptomatic so um i think you know obviously if you're having pain you know trying to trying to treat the source of that in terms of is it is it because i don't want to go too far down the rabbit hole because this isn't my area of expertise but well let me ask you this question in your case do you have a sense what it was about the lifts that was specifically causing the pain so you know sometimes you can actually identify what the issue is in the individual that is through an axial loading pattern driving the pain so it could be you know one of my favorite examples is right people who can't generate enough intra-abdominal pressure um or who who can't create you know who might have too much lordosis in the spine um when they're under an axial load or they can't they can't generate enough articulation between l1 and t12 right so they don't have the segmental control within the spine so they tend to they tend to generate disproportionate load at hinge points like were you able to look at yourself and say okay well like you know presumably i'm hurting i'm making this up right but i'm saying presumably i'm hurting myself under the hot you know when i'm over 500 pounds i'm not really hurting myself when i'm you know doing 405 for 10. and when i'm and this is how my form changes when i go from doing 405 to 595 and i think that's what it is that's precipitating this injury and i'm going to work on not just rehabbing the injury but modifying the form i mean was there were you able to do some sort of an analysis like that i mean lumbar flexion definitely was kind of a triggering for the pain but if we look at like the biopsychosocial model of of pain it it gets really murky because i mean they've shown that you can have tissue damage and no pain and you can have pain with very little tissue damage so i think part of it was just i had that initial injury to the disk but then i probably didn't give myself enough time to desensitize myself to that pain and just kept hammering at it and the research it's interesting the research actually shows that one of the best things you can do for low back pain is resistance training like that's actually one of the best things you can do but if you are so if you are doing it with a load that increases that pain then it's going to make it worse so i think the the the what people probably need to take away is that if you're having pain and again this isn't my area of expertise i take this from people i've learned from but modify the load and see if that reduces your pain modify the tempo modify the um the range of motion and then if none of those things do then try to modify the exercise selection and my problem was i was so dogged about i need to do squat bench press and deadlift i need to work through this pain and i made it worse for a period of time now you know like to think i'm a little bit wiser in my old age uh now i i don't just try to work through it i say okay you know if i'm having a great example is i had some hip pain that i'd been dealing with for about six to seven months and uh the way it finally got better was i said okay i'm going to stop doing full range of motion squats full speed i'm going to try and take it back to what can i do with kind of a minimal amount of pain like a two or three out of ten right something that doesn't cause pain but i can still get some work in and for me that was like above parallel pin squats so basically i'd bring it down nice and slow pause at the pins and then come up and i started out doing those and then the next week you know i'd either increase the load or i would um lower the pins and i did that for probably about six weeks and then i got to the point where okay it's not hurting as much i'm gonna try and do without the pins above parallel regular squat with tempo like three second descent right taking that that speed away from it i did that for like three four weeks pain went down and then basically got to the point where i could do a full squat with no pain and so again i'm not you know i don't have a randomized control group to compare this to it could be like if i would have just done nothing i would have gotten the same benefits who knows um but i think just because you have pain doesn't mean you you can't do something and i based on what some of the pain specialists have said you're probably better off doing something than nothing if you can because if you just take time away from training you end up d training so when you come back you're not as practice at the lifts and you might end up hurting yourself again so that's kind of the approach i take is is modifying those variables and seems to be seems to be working okay i'm you know i always tell people like this stuff's like a puzzle and i'm still you know i've spent the last few years working through some injuries and just trying to figure out okay how can i make this puzzle work so that i can be you know you know compete as an athlete again yeah i agree with that completely i think the worst thing one can do under virtually any circumstance is completely stop the activity um i i find that moving from two legs to one leg becomes a great tool in my tool kit when i'm hurting um so moving to much more split squat um you know single leg activity i mean even something even if you look at something like a leg press right so you know you're sort of an inverted doing a leg press that's an exercise where you can load up stupid amounts of weight if if i'm feeling anything that's not right there i'll happily go to a single leg where you're going to typically use not half but a third the weight at a single leg and you know all of a sudden those things that were hurting when you were doing it with two legs kind of stop hurting in my opinion you're getting virtually the same benefit potentially more because you're evening out any that wasn't right there and i've noticed that i think i can say without exception things get better again for me it also requires a very careful examination of what the root problem was i guess the last question i have for you on this very specific topic before i get into a whole bunch of other things that we're going to talk about is the overlap and or detraction between powerlifting and bodybuilding so you've competed at such a high level in these two sports that have a very clear overlap but also have a pretty different point of optimization i mean bodybuilding is a very subjective sport where it's about how you look and at the end of the day nobody cares how strong you are when you're standing on that stage conversely power lifting which of course requires a lot of strength nobody really cares how you look so both of those athletes pay unbelievable attention to how much weight they lift but they're serving a very different purpose you're one of the people who has excelled at both i've met people who are excellent at one or the other more on the power side i should say than the bodybuilding side so i'm curious as to what some of the the trade-offs are that you have to make and in sort of a hypothetical lane if you what would be the closest length of time you could have between the two if you want it to be at your best in each great great great question so i think the overlap is that the obvious one is that to look muscular you have to have a lot of muscle and um contractile tissue is what's needed to move weight right so the more there is a little bit of debate about this but the consensus is is that hypertrophy does matter for strength training so the more muscle you have the more weight you're going to be able to lift um i think that the trade-off is that bodybuilding is a much more forgiving sport insofar as exit i mean you can you can skin the cat a thousand different ways if you don't want to squat you can hack squat if you don't want to hack squat you can split squat if you it is simply about creating tension on that muscle getting the requisite volume in and progressive overload now people hear progressive overload and they think weight but progressive overload takes many forms and the major one of which is volume in particular volume load which is basically for all intents of purposes number of of hard sets number of sets that approach failure so you can do that many different ways if you if you're hurting on a certain exercise hey change it up try something different find something that you can do without pain or find something that you really enjoy right there's a lot of different ways to skin a cat when it comes to power lifting you can do some accessory movements and whatnot but you still have to do the major lifts you still have to be very well trained the major lifts otherwise you're not going to perform your best on meet day and so i think that bodybuilding in a way is a little bit more demanding mentally because the hug like if you've never if people out there listening if you've never been like insanely shredded you cannot imagine the levels of hunger and low energy that these people go through and that i have been through i'm talking about so hungry that you literally think about it from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep and then it wakes you up at night um i'm talking about such low energy i can remember one time i was like i had finished my training session i was probably a few weeks out from a show i was sitting on my couch and the remote control was probably five feet away from me and i there was a terrible show on that i did not want to watch and i watched the entire thing because i did not feel like getting up to get the remote um and that that kind of serves into like metabolic adaptation and and reductions in non-exercise activity uh thermogenesis and just give people a sense lane of how many calories a day you might be ingesting during that period of your training cycle and for how long that would last yeah so i you know my last my last show i did um i competed as a pro natural bodybuilder in 2010 so it's been a while um and i won the ifpa international the heavyweight division and then i um i ended up doing the ifpa world championships and plays top five in the heavyweight division um and it's difficult because it's like the amount of calories you start on is not going to be what you end up finishing on i think the lowest my calories got was just around 1900 now that may not sound that bad but keep in mind you know we're talking about somebody who is you know probably over 185 pounds of lean body mass you know quite a bit of lean body mass and training how many hours per day two hours a day you know minimum um so i mean that was pretty much all i had energy for you know i'd go in in the gym and train for two hours and that would be all she wrote you know and i i i'd muster up i can remember going in and doing a cardio session one night i got on the elliptical i started going and the only way i can describe this is it felt soul-sucking um and i went for what i felt like must have been 40 minutes and i looked down at the clock and it said three minutes three minutes and i just remember thinking how can i do this um i mean like so tired that like um or even like i would stand up and i would get lightheaded because my blood pressure was so low you know it's a very so i think bodybuilding is very difficult in that that that doesn't leave you right power lifting is difficult in that it beats your body up but once you're done at the gym other than your like rehab work and some other stuff i mean you can kind of leave it at the gym you know so they're really difficult sports but for for slightly different reasons you know again bodybuilding is more forgiving in that it doesn't really matter what exercises you do as long as you get in enough right um and you can kind of skin that cat multiple different ways i mean we've we've seen bodybuilders be successful through every different methodology you know dorian yates never squatted i mean he talked about it he only did leg press right leg press and leg extensions um whereas ronnie coleman you know squatted you know tons of weight so um i i think that the the appeal for me for bodybuilding was that mental challenge you know basically how much could you suffer um and then the appeal in powerlifting was this is not subjective i mean it is a little bit subjective because you could argue squat depth is subjective you could argue that deadlift lockouts are right but far far less subjective far less subjective and i mean i've had that you know the order of the the competition is you get three attempts on each lift and it goes squat bench press deadlift and it's progressive meaning if you pick a weight and you miss it you can't go down so you can only go up um but i've been i've been in those big meets where it comes down to the very last deadlift and it's like either you pull it or you don't and that determines if you win or not i mean i've had that experience it's unbelievable um and so to me i probably preferred that only because i'm i'm doing what i trained to do right like in bodybuilding i'm doing something different than i trained to do what i needed to do to get to that bodybuilding stage is way different than what i'm going to do on stage whereas powerlifting i'm just doing what i've done right like this is just a showcase so now to your question how far apart could you do well in them and let me add one more question which is what order would you pick you get to pick the order of which you do the two contests and what the minimum space is to optimize both so that's going to be so individually dependent right because um you know for me um at my weight class and powerlifting 93 kilograms or 205 pounds i'm pretty lean at that body weight so what i would say is that i would probably if i was going to do this i would do a meat i i maintained this body weight with some level of effort but mostly pretty easily i would do the meat and then i would start prepping for a show and how much longer would you need after that meet how long would it take for you to be stage ready it depends on how hard i wanted to push it and and what level if i was wanting to really maximize lean body mass retention i'd probably want six months i would say um because what people don't realize is we look at like we look at these diet studies and we see how much lean body mass gets lost versus fat mass and people don't realize that a lot of this depends on how much body fat you're starting with and then it changes the curve changes so if you're somebody who's overweight or obese you don't really need to worry about losing too much lean body mass because you have such a reservoir of energy to pull from that your body doesn't really see the need to start pulling from lean body mass but if you're somebody who's it and i'll use my caliper measurements for all the internet experts out there i realized that the numbers i'm going to give you are not the true numbers but i don't care it's what i'm reference it's i'm just using it as a reference point i always have to qualify this when i get body fat numbers so i can go from fifteen percent body fat to seven percent body fat and it's extremely easy no problems i lose very minimal lean body mass from seven percent to five percent now i'm probably losing you know twenty to thirty percent of that weight is lean body mass when you get down to the like shredded area where you're just when you're literally trying to squeeze off that last little bit of body fat you might be losing just as much lean body mass as you are fat mass so for me what what what i would do and i i didn't do this years ago because i didn't even didn't even know about this tool is i actually implement a lot of what's called diet breaks so those those would be periods of eating at maintenance so basically a level of calories where you're not going to add back fat tissue but you can eat more than you did previously so i had pretty good success with this the past year because i dropped 30 pounds i went up a weight class and powerlifting and then came back down and so basically i would diet for two or three weeks pretty aggressively try to lose like a pound and a half two pounds each week and then i would take one or two or three weeks and eat just at a maintenance level of calories which for me is about 32 33 3 400. and that worked extremely well for me extremely well for keeping my strength and so if i was getting ready for a bodybuilding show i probably wouldn't use those too much if i was like coming down from a higher body fat but as i approach as i would be approaching that lower level of body fat i would be starting to put these in more and more frequently so that's why i would give myself so much time even though i'd only need to drop about maybe 12 15 pounds from where i'm at right now um i would probably spend more time at maintenance than i did in a deficit because when you get to those low levels of body fat the best way i can describe it is like if you have a wet towel when you start squeezing water comes out very easily this is this is actually almost almost a perfect example of adipose tissue because if you take somebody who's overweight obese what do you have you have a lot of free fatty acids getting released into the bloodstream you have very very expanded fat tissue so when you start you start ringing that rag out it comes off very easily but then when you get down to the ends and you're just trying to get that last little bit of water out to get the same amount of water out you have to put in monumental levels of effort compared to what you did at the beginning so i guess that's kind of a huge qualifier of why i want so much time to be able i mean the one thing that you said lane that actually surprised me and and i want to think about this through the lens of some examples because i thought we could use examples of people like you know kind of people that hypotheticals are patients of mine i i was surprised that you said going from 15 to 7 body fat could be done without much loss of lean tissue that is really impressive yeah for me um and is that is that just a function of how hard you're training at the same time um is that just something that you would attribute to your genetics because it's you know it's not due to exogenous testosterone which would obviously be one tool that would enable that kind of lean mass retention yeah so i think the first thing is um it probably depends a lot on what your body fat set point is or settling point so for those who aren't familiar body fat set point theory is essentially that you kind of have this relatively tight range of homeostatic body fat that your body will defend um and once you start to drop below that range uh it's really you really start to feel the the negative effects of caloric restriction in terms of um your hunger goes up your bmr drops your non-exercise activity thermogenesis drops your libido drops you start to have those negative side effects for me um you know i would say that my again on calipers that the low end of my body fat set point is probably around seven percent and the high end is probably around 11. and how does that correlate with dexa for you do you know how the caliper numbers correlate with dexa probably about three percent more on a dexa i would say kind of 10 to 14 is your dexa sweet spot so yep yeah something like that and in a show by the way you're below four percent is that what i would infer from what you said earlier on calipers uh the lowest i've calibered it was like just over two percent body fat um so so call it four or five percent by dexa potentially yeah probably maybe five or six yeah something like that uh and again that's something i don't really i let the internet worry about that because at the end of the day it's just about the visual aspect right although i would guess i would guess below that lane because uh as recently as 10 years ago i was 7.1 on dexa i mean repeatedly like 7.1 to 7.8 by dexa and i still remember what i looked like then nothing like what a bodybuilder looks like so i would easily believe that by dexa a bodybuilder could be four percent possible i i just i remember uh so there was a guy he's another natural bodybuilder named alberto nunez and if you ever saw pictures of this guy like i'm talking like vayne's visible vascularity in his glutes right yeah so like that yeah um and he was going he went and got a dexter done and i remember he was asking people he's like what do you think i'm gonna be and people were like oh two percent three percent and he and he was six you know on a dexter so the question is then i'd have to ask how much of that was visceral versus subcutaneous possible the other thing is people though people need to appreciate is the level of air that's in those measurements yeah you know there is an inherent level of error in those measurements but yeah that's that's that's counterintuitive for that level of what you describe in terms of vascular yeah yeah so so who knows um but i think if you are somebody who your body naturally likes to be at a little bit of a higher body fat percentage you may see some lean body mass loss you know at a similar body fat to what i am able to retain more at right so um now this is me just completely speculating because there's so little data on this because studies are just so restrictive in terms of what you can actually measure and i think that this is this is another point that people don't fully appreciate is that you know scientific studies are really big blunt instruments like you you you can you are really if you're doing a scientific study you're only supposed to modify a couple of variables if that because otherwise you just have no idea if what you're observing is due to the the variables that you want to test um otherwise you might as well just go to observational data and so they're just when it comes to this kind of stuff there's so little data out there and and so this kind of is pulling from my opinions based on some randomized control trials i've seen some case studies i've seen and some mechanistic data some animal data you know and i'm i always like to tell people when i'm when i'm kind of going out the limb because i don't want to state it as fact if i if i'm not sure if it's fact but i would say that you know the differences we see in how much people can retain with lean body mass i think part of it's due to what their natural body fat set point level is because as we exit that lower end of our body fat set point if the body likes to keep a certain level of body fat then it makes sense that it might start pulling a little bit more energy from lean tissue compared to fat tissue if it's starting to defend that body fat now there are quite a few things we can do to overcome this like resistance training right like that's a big one and i think some of the decrements we see in in lean body mass with dieting is one a lot of these studies don't don't do resistance training or when people are dieting and they're starting to feel worse because they're lower energy their training volume drops their training intensity drops and that that's probably part of it and i think the other thing is too like i will say going from like 15 to 7 on calipers i did lose some lean body mass but you know my relative strength didn't really change so what's likely is you know a lot of people don't realize lean body mass is not the same thing as muscle mass lean body mass is all non-fat tissues that's skin bone organ weight all that stuff and including your body water and a lot of i think what we see with lean body mass loss is um water gut tissue liver um those those tissues shrink in response to caloric restriction uh and so yeah i think most people don't appreciate the glycogen the amount of glycogen you can lose and how much water tracks with glycogen so you lose let's say you lose half your glycogen volume you take the mass of that multiply it by three to four that's the total mass that's lost given the water as well not to mention the plasma loss that comes with plasma contraction yeah i mean we see that like in ketogenic diet studies like kevin hall study you know there was a loss of lean body mass but even i in in you know you know me i'm very critical of of uh you know zealots and nutrition um and so when i've criticized you know ketogenic diet stuff i've even still said you know in this kevin hall study well that's most of that is probably water you know because if like you said if you lose glycogen you're losing quite a bit of water with that right well i wonder if you would agree with an observation that i have found for which i haven't found data to support but truthfully i haven't been on a huge hunt for it but it's been very empirical for me so um i've gone through various different phases of fasting um where i'm doing it for different purposes right so i'm not doing it for body composition or anything other than you know sort of ramping up autophagy so basically kind of periodic fasting for health benefits and the thing that i've noticed is and let's just use i would typically do like a seven day five to seven day water only fast each quarter and what i noticed was provided i did resistance training every single day during that fast so i dramatically changed my training because i would normally be alternating between cardio and resistance but if on those fasting days the only thing i did was resistance training and specifically i focused on the biggest lifts possible so deadlift is my favorite lift so i would even deadlift every other day and mostly just focus on the biggest muscles um i had to go a lot slower so i had to take i needed much more rest between sets but i could actually still move the exact same amount of weight so i didn't get any weaker it seemed to minimize the loss of lean mass certainly muscle i shouldn't say that i lost water weight but i did not appear to lose muscle mass my thinking was that that i was at least counter balancing the effect of mtor reduction that was coming through the nutrient pathway through a different stimulus does that and again we're going to talk a lot about mtor because of course your work in leucine ties right into my interest around nutrient sensing um does my observation fit with your uh with your observations and your experiences so we have to i always try to to put things in context right so i think if you're looking at you know losing actual contractile tissue once you've built it what it takes to maintain muscle tissue is very minimal compared to what it takes to actually build it so it does not necessarily surprise me especially because you know this gets into kind of like power of suggestion placebo your own personal feelings about stuff because you view fasting as such a positive that you wouldn't have a reduction in strength because you probably really haven't lost contractile tissue in that period of time now if i take somebody now it's important to point out that you are a i would say a well-trained person but not somebody who pushes the like your goal isn't to push the upper limit of hypertrophy would i be correct absolutely nor strength for that matter right right so and this is where some of the the misinterpretations come from what i say to people so i had this the other day um i'll say okay do i think that somebody could build strength maintain it doing that sort of thing absolutely a lot of that just comes down to boils down to being really consistent with your resistance training if somebody says to me i want to be the most muscular strongest human i possibly can be do i think that that is still the best thing that they could do no i do not but again it's important to qualify both those things because i realize that one audience even though i have more of that audience is a very small specific subsection of the actual number of people but when i say that what people hear is lane says you can't get strong fasting and i have to always say no no that's not what i'm saying you absolutely can do i think that you could get as big and strong doing that as someone who is you know consuming nutrients regularly i don't think so but we probably will never get a randomized control lifelong randomized control trial and that so i can't say for certain well actually i agree with you on that and in fact um you know when when the when we turned into the new year this year you know i went and got a dexa scan and looked at myself in january of this year and i was like god i'm kind of amazed over the last decade um how much muscle mass i've lost so i am on january 4th of this year i weighed the exact same amount that i weighed 10 years ago in may of 2011. so for all intents and purposes over a decade my body weight was unchanged i'm embarrassed to tell you how much my body fat went up right it went from about seven percent to 16 percent over a decade um so you can do the math right like it's pretty straightforward i got fatter i lost muscle now i'm not going to beat myself up too much a lot has happened in a decade right i used to train four and a half to five hours a day i now train maybe 90 minutes per day i have very different priorities my goals are totally different um but you know i talked about it with beth lewis who i work with and i was like look and she was like look we got to get some more muscle on you dude it's kind of getting pathetic so her first thing was no more fasting for a while right that was basically her first suggestion which is like we got to take a break from the monthly fasting because that's probably not helping your lean tissue and if we want that to be a goal which is is there any reason we shouldn't be able to put five pounds of muscle on you in the next year her view is i think we can do this but you can't be fasting every month for three to five days so i think that's completely in line with what you're saying which is an optimization issue um it's you know and i've heard you talk about this with respect to plant versus animal protein and it gets always taken out of context yeah i just had this discussion the other day yeah so so again i'll let you state the argument again because you'll probably do a better job stating your own words than i will uh you know stating your words for you yeah so i i kind of had this discussion with somebody who you know was saying well if you look at the randomized controlled trials you know plant versus animal just doesn't make a difference if total protein is equated and what i've said to people is okay i i understand that randomized control trials of the gold standard if we are looking at resistance trained individuals eight weeks in terms of looking at actual muscle mass is such a short period of time okay now i understand my bias is i did work in leucine i was funded by the egg and dairy councils all that kind of stuff so i'm sure the the the any uh any uh conspiracy theorists out there will have a field day but i would never tell somebody you can't build muscle with plant protein of course you can just go look at the those plant-based bodybuilders you can look at who have extremely impressive physique so obviously you can do it right now can you build just as much muscle with plant protein i think you can however it's probably going to require more planning on your port and just a little bit more attention to detail because uh because of the the factors of limiting amino acids low leucine content those sorts of things um do i think all things being equal animal protein is probably a superior form of protein i do that being said that is a small sliver of what actually contributes to hypertrophy consistent resistive resistance training and progressive overload is by far the most dominant factor but we we can barely often times not even pick out differences we know volume is important we know volume weekly set number is important we can't even pick out differences in hypertrophy sometimes with different volume protocols what makes you think we're going to pick out differences in actual hypertrophy in eight weeks from protein sources where calories and total protein are equated and so what i've said is i think the studies are probably a little bit underpowered and shorter on time to actually show the differences we want to show now that being said i'm not saying they're bad studies i'm just saying this is a limitation that's all yeah so i actually i was going to say that a second ago but i didn't want to interrupt you when you were talking about the limitations of these some of these rcts and i was going to add the limitation you just mentioned which is it's hard enough to control the variables but the other thing is the tighter you put the grip on controlling the variables by definition in a real world the shorter the study must become so you look at kevin hall's studies well kevin is doing studies at the highest level that they can be done so these are patients that are inpatients and i know this very well i'm very close friends with kevin i have a very clear understanding of how the board runs both his ward at nih and also several others around the country i've even spent time inside the metabolic chambers personally to experience this and yeah we're talking about the highest level of precision inside a chamber that does indirect calorimetry the reality of it is you can't put somebody in this situation for a year and so when it comes to going back to exercise if we think that you know the difference in a person over six months might be two to three pounds of muscle mass under perfect conditions it's going to be very difficult to tease that out in eight weeks the other thing i would say going back to protein that i've always struggled with and i want to actually get your opinion on this because this is something that i want to know how much this matters both personally and also professionally for my patients is i have to suspect at least when it comes to leucine timing must matter and i'll in a moment i'll come back to why i've been curious about this just based on what we now understand about how leucine and cestrin 2 work in triggering mtork1 so there becomes this whole other variable which is when we talk about plant versus animal does it matter where in relation to training we're taking that does it matter um you know meal timing specifically training timing and all of those other things um so so let's actually maybe use this as an opportunity to now talk about kind of your work in graduate school and and and and what it's taught you about muscle protein synthesis and the importance of leucine because i think even the most you know sort of casual observer of bro science has heard of a branched chain amino acid and you know if you click one level below a branch chain amino acid you'll know that there are three of them and one of them happens to be called leucine and people i think would gather that somehow taking those things is good for muscle but my guess is that's about the level at which most people stop understanding it so let's talk about what is muscle protein synthesis what is the role of leucine and and i also want to even dive deeper into that which is how does the body preserve leucine what do leucine levels look like during the course of a day in response to a meal a fast etc great question so um muscle protein synthesis is basically what it sounds like it is the the synthesis of muscle proteins um from amino acid substrates and you know you can separate it in terms of like what you look at and research you can you can do what's called mixed muscle protein synthesis which is what we did which is where you're literally taking the entirety of a muscle and you're grinding it up and you're homogenizing it and then you're you're basically using in the studies we used stable isotopes to assess this we used d5 phenylalanine which is basically a deuterated uh one of the hydrogens on the phenylalanine is deuterated and you can basically you're looking at how much of that label gets incorporated into the the mixed muscle of the of the or sorry the mixed muscle versus how much is in the precursor pool which is the intracellular fluid and that rate divided by a time factor will tell you what the rate of muscle protein synthesis is and on a kind of a more broad level protein synthesis starts in your dna because your dna codes for those proteins that are going to be synthesized so for example let's say you go and you would do a resistance training session we know that in response to resistance training you have an increase in muscle protein synthesis that resistance training is triggering something uh it's probably a cascade of things that are telling your dna we need to adapt to this stressor so we are going to increase the transcription of these you know specific dna sequences to the messenger art and i'm really really abbreviating this because you can get the introns extrons mrna degradation all this kind of stuff but it gets trans uh transcribed to an mrna sequence which is then read by a ribosome and that ribosome based on the mrna is going to bring amino acids in and hook them together to build these new proteins so in the case of you know let's say you go and you you do resistance training you know myosin actin these contractile proteins you're going to need those as part of your um adaptation to that stressor and so those are going to be some of the things that are going to be built during muscle protein synthesis now my work specifically was uh in in animals and i'll tell you why and you kind of alluded to it earlier so we actually i have a um a research review that's going to be coming out my website one of the things i'm very proud of is we have a 50 page guide on how to read research and we have a venn diagram in there and in the venn diagram we have highly controlled high subject number long duration and what you find is the only way you can get all those to overlap is if you do animal studies so if you want if you want tightly controlled and a high subject number it's going to be really short in humans if you want um long duration uh and and tightly controlled it's going to be very few subjects if you want you know you can kind of get the gist of it so for i decided i wanted to do animals because i was more kind of interested in finding out the mechanisms of this stuff um and so you know you can do one of the reasons i liked using rats was one they're a good model for human protein metabolism a lot of the stuff in rats has then been validated in humans there are some differences but i can teach a rat i can teach a rat to meal feed meaning they eat discreet meals i can get them to eat what i want them to eat and then i can measure what i want to measure and i can poke and prod them and do all that kind of stuff as long as it's okay with the aya cook which is basically the irb for for animals um and so what what we were interested in was what you kind of talked about like how important is leucine because at that time the you know the mid 2000s there had been quite a bit of work done by my advisor dr don lehmann as well as the penn state group which was leonard jefferson and scott kimball looking at okay we know if we give purified solutions of leucine they increase mtor activity and we see an increase in muscle protein synthesis but one what does that mean for complete meals where you have protein carbohydrate and fat what does it mean in the context of different protein sources and then what does it actually even matter for uh tissue weights right like do you actually actually see differences in in in actual tissue and so one of the some of those work we did was one we looked at the duration of muscle protein synthesis in response to a complete meal um and that was really interesting actually that was one of the things i was dead wrong about what i thought i was going to see versus what i actually saw and so we saw like even with weight so whey protein which is thought of as a fast protein um basically we saw an increase in muscle protein synthesis that peaked at 90 minutes post meal and then by 180 minutes or three hours had gone back down to baseline which has since been validated in humans that that's about what we see in humans as well now now elaine let me just ask you a question there for a sec before you go further um do we have a sense of after the training stimulus ends how long that transcriptional stress is in place to continue muscle protein synthesis provided enough substrate is available in other words when do we become substrate available oh substrate limited i'm sorry so this is really interesting because it's so hard to assess because so part of the reason that this stuff is so hard to measure is in humans you basically have to have a steady state in order to measure muscle protein synthesis because there's certain assumptions you have to make about the isotope that you're you're using to assess it the precursor pool and the the actual protein bound label and so that requires what we call a nutritional steady state so if you want to assess like muscle protein synthesis in response to exercise you're going to found that yeah but let's say you could give somebody an intravenous infusion of all amino acids so i guess there'd be two questions right we start with one question which is we don't care which amino acid is but we'll give you enough of all of them so that you're not going to be limited by a given amino acid and then we're just going to give you an iv infusion so the second you finish the highest stress workout we just keep running it out and then we're tracking over time muscle protein synthesis that would be one experiment that would be interesting and then the second one would be playing with which amino acids are the most important there does that kind of make sense so we kind of have a pretty good idea of like the time course of muscle protein synthesis in response to an exercise bout okay when it comes to mixed muscle protein synthesis okay okay so so i'm gonna make a very important caveat here in a second and it appears to be pretty similar for uh or sorry so the peak so that the change percentage is about it increases it's different from study to study but um about 100 to 150 percent increase in muscle protein synthesis that p that that peak is about the same for trained versus untrained but the untrained duration lasts much longer so it it's still not back to baseline in studies by 48 well some studies it's back to baseline at 48 hours in other studies there's still a statistical difference at 48 hours so we think basically in untrained people it's about 48 to 72 hour response the interesting thing is in trained people that initial robust response comes back down about 10 to 12 hours and at 24 hours is basically not different from baseline so this is now that's for mixed muscle protein synthesis now here's the rub for myofibrillar protein synthesis because you can separate that out during your analysis so we're talking about actual contractile muscle proteins because mixed muscle protein synthesis included includes all cytoplasmic proteins mitochondrial proteins all these sorts of things the myofibrillar protein synthesis they actually don't know how long it lasts because they've only assessed it up to 16 hours post and so far neither group has returned to baseline although they have assessed the area under the curve and it's it's greater area under the curve for untrained versus train now the rub on that is if we look at i know you're asking about nutrient availability no yeah we'll keep going with this point though um the rub on that is none of these are addressing the other side of protein balance which is protein degradation now what's really interesting is during the first approximately six weeks of resistance training you don't see much hypertrophy in people who are training you see strength improvements but you don't really see hypertrophy and what's really interesting is in the initial kind of phases of training you have an increase a robust increase in muscle protein synthesis but you also have a very robust increase in protein degradation and so the thought process is because this is such a big stressor a massive stressor if you've never resisted trained before i mean everybody knows like the first time they went did a leg workout you couldn't walk for like a you know a few days after that you have to completely it's almost like your muscles doing a complete overhaul of those of those proteins and so you have such a robust degratory response because there are so many damaged proteins or or proteins that need to be i guess improved then it's almost like you're you're doing this protein turnover feudal cycle um kind of remodeling and then what we see is after six weeks that at the end of six weeks that increase in degradation goes way down and that's actually i mean again i can't say for certain but that coincides with when we start seeing the big improvements in hypertrophy so so all things equal sorry to interrupt all things equal if a person is consuming roughly the same amount of protein during that phase and their training volume and intensity is roughly the same is it safe to say during that first period you described they are going to be in a negative nitrogen balance uh versus a neutral potentially nitrogen balance like if you were evaluating them with a nitrogen cart like how are you would that show up as uh nitrogen excretion in that first phase or are they recycling so probably probably not probably not it's probably going to be pretty they're probably going to be nitrogen positive a little bit um but here here's where this stuff gets so so complicated because we know that in muscle protein synthesis about seven out of every eight amino acids used to create a new protein are recycled from degraded proteins so when we look at okay exogenous amino acids or exogenous dietary protein and we think about it as muscle building building i think most people think about okay i'm eating this protein and this is going to get incorporated into my tissue and that's what's going to make me big and strong and it's a lot more complicated than that in fact about the most amino acids you can deposit in muscle tissue if you let me back up if you look at somebody who added 50 pounds of muscle tissue in a year right that's a ton of muscle even for somebody on steroids i think we can agree that's a ton of muscle when you account for the fact that muscle tissue is about 70 water in about 30 protein you're basically looking at about 10 grams of amino acids deposited in muscle per day it's very underwhelming oh i'm sorry sorry that'd be for about 25 pounds of muscle a year i think uh still extremely impressive sure but but there are two different points there that i want to get at the first point is the one you're making which is no matter how much muscle mass you put on your it's never going to be impressive relative to the amount of amino acids you took in there's a second point you're making which i find even more interesting potentially which is the actual fate of the ingested amino acid and how much is being recycled versus not so the analog here but you're going to love this lane i didn't even think this would come up and i know you're going to love it you want to know my favorite thing that drives me nuts about people when they just rave about a ketogenic diet is the differentiation between re-esterification lipolysis and fat oxidation so here's the example right if you're on a ketogenic diet and you're mainlining fat you can very easily gain weight because if you're ingesting so much fat that it exceeds your ability to oxidize fat regardless of where that fat source is being oxidized meaning endogenous versus exogenous it doesn't really matter and in fact a ketogenic diet can still produce a ton of fat oxidation without oxidizing the endogenous source that you want to oxidize in the first place and by the way a lot of the triglyceride contained within the adipocyte gets recycled so it can be liberated as free fatty acid and then be re-esterified with glycerol back into it so actually it becomes kind of a nice analogy here 100 i just don't think i knew it was true on the amino acid side as well yeah so you're you're making an analogy that is i don't know if i've ever used it before but it's it's bet it's bang on i mean there's differences of course but um i think a lot of this boils down to people think of metabolism as like on and off switches and it's like that's think about like dimmer switches like nothing people think like when you're losing fat that means that fat burning is ramped up and you know fat storage is all the way down at zero no you are always burning and storing fat simultaneously um same thing you are always synthesizing protein and degrading it at the same time now it's the relative rates of each that are going to determine if you deposit versus uh lose fat or protein so so let me then bring it back to that analogy because i just did a podcast on this with bob kaplan recently and we talked about it in terms of fat flux so we talked about three states a person who is in neutral fat flux so they are neither gaining nor losing fat tissue negative fat flux and positive flat flex so you're either gaining fat mass losing fat mass or maintaining the same and we talked about it through the lens of um de novo lipogenesis re-esterification lipolysis nope none of that says anything about oxidation that's happening outside and that can feed into substrate pools what we then talked about was how many hormones are regulating these different steps so what happens when insulin goes up and down what happens when epinephrine goes up and down when norepinephrine goes up and down when hormone-sensitive lipase goes up and down when cortisol goes up and down testosterone lipoprotein lipase etc so in other words these are all regulated hormonally some of them outside the cell so insulin obviously is acting outside the cell uh you know lpl is outside the cell hsl inside the cell etc tell me about the hormonal regulation on the same unit of muscle the most obvious difference of course is that testosterone works inside the cell right so let's start with testosterone but then i want to i want to talk about all of the hormones that impact this specifically i want to make sure we at least touch on cortisol and estradiol at some point but let's start with testosterone because it plays such an important role in that transcriptive drive yeah so i think the one thing i want to say before we before we start on this is keep in mind that when we're talking about all these hormones and this goes for fat tissue or muscle tissue what you are seeing on the surface in terms of the actual outcome is the result of the summation of all of those signals right so people get hung up on say insulin or they get hung up on leucine or they get hung up on you know one particular thing and then they get confused when they see a paradoxical outcome right so a great example of that is uh kevin hall's study on fat loss looking at um you know where they showed that insulin was 26 percent higher but those people actually ended up losing like an i would call it a non-significant greater amount of actual fat mass than people who are on a ketogenic diet people say well how can that be true right and it's like okay well you gotta remember that insulin is just one input it's it's not the only input and the same thing goes for building muscle and muscle tissue so with regards to testosterone what's interesting about testosterone is uh i actually reviewed a study recently where yeah the study by stu phillips that looked at androgen receptor density yeah so that's which by the way i still don't understand something which i'm hoping you can explain why would androgen receptor density be higher in someone getting exogenous testosterone you would think that someone taking exogenous testosterone would have a paradoxically negative response and that they would down regulate androgen receptors i'll let you maybe go back and explain it from the beginning because the listener might not be familiar with the the thesis of the work yeah so essentially you know when you have um uh when testosterone gets into the cell it's converted and then that end product binds with the androgen receptor and then it can attach to the dna increasing transcription of different proteins right so so basically you're ramping up your capacity for amongst other things increasing muscle proteins that's different than how leucine acts nutritionally because leucine is a signal also that happens inside the cell but it's more of a short-term signal now to answer your question specifically the what i've seen proposed is that when you have enough testosterone available what tends to happen is the androgen receptors upregulate to meet the demand for metabolizing that testosterone and that the kind of the regulation of the excess testosterone think about the negative feedback loop functions more so on like luteinizing hormone and and the good ads and that sort of thing right yeah so i i if i had to hazard a guess that would be my guess that the the regulation in terms of trying to tamp that down because think about if you're not getting exogenous testosterone if you're not getting exogenous testosterone then there's probably not that same negative feedback regulation loop and so i always hate it when people go well it makes sense because there's tons of stuff in metabolism you say well it makes sense that it ends up not working out in the study but to me it would make sense that the muscle might increase its androgen receptor density to meet that testosterone load or that free testosterone load so long as you're not having so much testosterone that's not negatively feeding back to the gonads and limit or reducing luteinizing hormone or increase increasing aromatization those sorts of things and i will straight up say i am not a testosterone expert so i could be getting this stuff dead wrong but i think the more to the point of stu phillips work is that muscle growth appears to be mostly intrinsically regulated and i think in the late 90s early 2000s what people were really focused on was systemic what they thought was systemic regulation of muscle growth right your your systemic levels of testosterone igf-1 and even like the acute responses like we know for example resistance exercise will increase testosterone you know for 30 or 60 minutes and it used to be thought well that is what's that is what's driving these responses of hypertrophy and through a few elegantly designed studies a lot of them by stu phillips we know that that's probably not the case that this is probably an effect of tension now what's interesting about muscle growth is if we're going to have that tension that's driving muscle growth there has to be a translation of that contractile force into a chemical signal so we call that mechanotransduction right and so this is where i know you we had talked about it a little bit earlier mechanogrowth factor probably comes in so igf-1 systemic igf-1 and growth hormone are not anabolic to skeletal muscle people don't realize let's let's pause here because this is i want to make sure people understand what we're talking about and this is such an important topic i don't want to rush it so let's let's go back to the beginning and assume that the listener here doesn't fully understand where growth hormone comes from right and where it what it does in the liver what igf does so so let's um let's go back and explain you know the endocrine versus well we'll get to the endocrine versus autocrine function of igf but but uh just back up two steps with where you are lane and um sure yeah so we know that like growth hormone increases in response to certain things like fasting um resistance training exercise in general um sleep potentially sure sure all those things right and people kind of looked at that as okay well we should be aiming to increase growth hormone for these things and we know that growth hormone increases the liver production of igf-1 and igf-1 has always been thought of as kind of like the master hormone that is increasing muscle mass when they look at studies even where they give exogenous growth hormone what you see is you see an increase in lean body mass but not an increase in skeletal muscle mass so the increase in lean body mass is completely accounted for by an increase in body water and connective tissue so now you can argue there might be some benefits to connective tissue and that's what and i would argue organ weight as well right i mean we see we see we see we see liver hypertrophy and other other things like that as well so when it comes to growth hormone i actually had an article about this years ago on my site about how growth hormone was an anabolic and i got a lot of bodybuilding dogma people getting really upset about that because they don't understand and this is pervasive even amongst scientists people who don't understand the concept of a localized response versus a systemic response or people who don't understand an acute response versus a chronic response we're going to talk about this with respect to cortisol as well and import signaling i'm not sure so growth hormone not anabolic to skeletal muscle uh and the growth hormone response to exercise appears to be mostly substrate driven that it's that growth hormone probably increases as a response to exercise to increase lipolysis to liberate free fatty acids for use uh uh as an energy substrate now here's where people get confused the igf-1 the autocrine igf-1 that is released by the muscle tissue itself in response to mechanical tension is very anabolic so let me just explain for a moment to people the difference between endocrine paracrine and autocrine so the endocrine function of something is when a hormone gets released and its effect is all throughout the body so you know insulin is a great example right so the pancreas the beta cell releases insulin insulin goes and acts on all sorts of cells in the body paracrine is when something when a hormone gets released and it only impacts the cells right next to it and autocrine is on itself as you would guess now going back to what you said earlier the i the one way we explain this to patients is igf-1 is the integral of growth hormone so if you want to get a sense of how much growth hormone is floating around to a first order approximation you get a sense of how much igf somebody has you get a sense of how much igf is being produced by the liver and to your point that's all systemic or what we would really think of as an endogen an endocrine igf now what you're about to talk about is something that you know frankly never really gets talked about yeah so igf-1 autocrine or paracrine igf-1 that gets released by the muscle tissue itself is also called mechano growth factor and that is very anabolic to muscle tissue but again it's a very localized intrinsic response and it makes sense from to me again here we go it makes sense from a teleological perspective if you place a stress on a particular muscle tissue like your your legs it does not make sense to me that your arms will grow because you may not need your arms like if you're if you're uh i don't know if you're a tribe and you're having to climb something in the whatever you know you're using your legs much more than your arms muscle tissue is an energetically expensive tissue to maintain it takes more energy more atp more calories it is a feudal cycle meaning that to maintain it you actually have to increase synthesis and breakdown because you're having more proteins that are misfolded and whatnot that need to be broken down that whole thing takes more energy and so that's why we tell people if you want to be able to eat more calories hey build some more muscle because to maintain that takes more so it does not make sense from a evolutionary perspective because evolution doesn't care if you're jacked it cares if you can live long enough to pass on your genetic material it does not make sense that you would build a different tissue in response to a localized effect of training and that we we see that we see that if you train your legs your arms don't get bigger we know that um and if you train one leg the other one doesn't get bigger right in fact some of the best resistance training studies are where they use unilateral training and the person's non-trained leg serves as the own individual's control because you're accounting for genetic variations by doing that so yeah and then we have another probably component of mechanotransduction is probably phos phosphatidic acid so phosphatic acid is stored in the z disk of the skeletal muscle which if you look at a all right let's back up let's remind people how actin myosin work and then where the z disc fits in because i i forgot you and i got so into the weeds i i it was my bad i should have reminded us that we should go back and as okay that's good it's fun for me so uh the contractile unit of a muscle tissue is what's called a sarcomere and if you look at a sarcomere you kind of have these two ends which are called z discs and in between you have actin and myosin which overlap and then for lack of a better term when you contract it's basically actin and myosin hooked together and pulling okay now i'm again i'm really generalizing and i'm sure there's an exercise physiologist out there who's you know going to throw up their lunch hearing me describe it that way but for all i feel that's a reasonable comparison now each sarcomere is separated by the the z disk okay the z disk is where something called phosphatic acid is stored and if you were going to try to transfer a mechanical signal to a chemical signal it makes sense that you would store this stuff in the z disk because that is where a lot of that mechanical tension is going to be felt so in response to that mechanical tension again based on mechanistic studies we believe what happens is that causes phosphatic acid to be released and phosphatic acid is a stimulator of mtor so we think again that these two things are some of the more major regulators of mechanotransduction um in terms of how muscle actually gets built and then of course you know we have other regulators um you know testosterone doesn't really regulate mtor that i'm aware of it you know works more on the transcriptional level we have things like insulin affects mtor although it doesn't seem to be a powerful enough signal to actually impact muscle building if insulin has an effect it's probably more so on the protein breakdown side of things in fact there if you look at studies looking at carbohydrate ingestion we don't really see increases in muscle protein synthesis so if you just give pure carbohydrate even up to like 100 grams of glucose even though you get a pretty good rise in insulin it doesn't seem to affect muscle protein synthesis but it does seem to inhibit protein degradation in fact there was a study in resistance training i think out of bob wolf's lab in like 2004 and they did what's called av balance so arterial venous balance is where basically you're infusing a stable isotope and you're looking at essentially how much of that label is going into the muscle and then how much is coming out right and so you can determine the net balance and if you take a biopsy as well you can determine the fractional rate of protein synthesis and then by basically subtraction can determine what breakdown is so what they saw was when they gave a large amount of carbohydrate to people who had resistance trained they went from a negative protein balance to almost uh to be or sorry they went from having uh an increase in muscle protein breakdown to basically back to baseline and muscle protein breakdown and synthesis didn't change now now lane if you did that in combination with protein would that be a better strategy to hit it at both ends where you would reduce degradation and increase synthesis and is that an argument for combining carbohydrate and protein after a resistance training as opposed to just protein so here's where it gets very complicated because there probably is some degradation that is needed in order to remodel and actually make things better um however really we need to go to kind of the hard outcome studies so there's only really two studies i know of that examined like a protein and calorie equated low carbohydrate diet versus a protein-calorie equated non-low carbohydrate diet it was it was ketogenic so they measured blood ketones and saw they went up um and this was i think 12 weeks is by somebody vargas was the author okay and they did see less lean body mass accrual in the ketogenic diet group now they still increase lean body mass that's important to note um but the group that was getting carbohydrate or more carbohydrates had more lean body mass now the caveat to that is carbohydrates have make you store glycogen so was it just water or was it contractile tissue now in the second study they did see a difference in uh like one rep max squat and i think bench press as well so that kind of suggests that perhaps there is something different in terms of actual contractile tissue but this is an area that's going to need to be studied a lot more and again i don't want anybody to straw man what i'm saying i'm not saying you can't build muscle in a ketogenic diet you absolutely can you can probably build a really good amount of muscle but can you build as much as if you're including carbohydrate possibly not and it may have something to do with carbohydrates effect or insulin's effect on blunting muscle protein breakdown the other thing i'll add to that again based on my experience and you've probably talked about this with dom is i think one of the challenges of studying ketogenic diets is the length of time it takes to adapt to them i i went on a ketogenic diet in may of 2011 as an experiment and i was committed to doing it for 12 weeks and uh i mean five weeks in i had i was so miserable my wife was like what are you doing and why and you know all the standard mistakes i was making and and the first being i made no reduction in training volume and i was already training at the level of a maniac right so i mean ridiculous training volume and i made zero reduction in it and i was i mean just staggeringly and upsettingly miserable and at 12 weeks i finally crested the first hill which was the aerobic hill so at the time it was cycling and swimming were the two sports and i at 12 weeks i just got to the point where i could get my aerobic base back to where it was 12 weeks earlier but anaerobically i was nowhere near what i was 12 weeks earlier i won't put you on the spot and make you guess but if i were going to make you guess how long do you well first of all i decided to stay with the diet because i became so interested in the physiology of it um and i wanted to see like what is it going to take to return back to my previous level of anaerobic fitness it took 18 months and i want to be clear this is 18 months without one day of deviation i would end up staying on this diet for three years with one day of deviation my wife's birthday i ended up having a bunch of cake but um for three years to stay on this one and you know incredibly restrictive diet it took half of that period of time just to get back to where i was anaerobically so it speaks to how difficult i think it is to study any of this stuff and and by the way was i perfectly controlling my exercise during that period of time no it's quite possible that some of those changes had to do with other variables so um i don't know i sometimes i just think this this stuff is so complicated we should we should focus on the biggest picture questions and and try to get at them but then there's times when we get into discussions like this and i'm like no these details are the most interesting part of this right especially on this side of the equation because this is this is an area i know so little about that's why i was very excited to discuss it with you yeah so i think that you know for for the majority of the audience i think that and that's why i try to provide so much context when i talk about this stuff and i i don't talk about the ketogenic diet study and also not say hey you can still build muscle on it right because i don't want people to take away lane said you can't build muscle on a ketogenic diet and then they go out and they see somebody who built a bunch of muscle and they go okay well this doesn't make sense right so i think that's why the the nuance is very important like you said we're in the details right because that's what's interesting to us because we kind of hopefully know some of the like the major things right it's the same as testosterone right you could say the same thing you'd be like do you need to take exogenous testosterone to be a bodybuilder nope look at all the examples but if your goal is to be the biggest the strongest i have news for you go and get yourself to some testosterone scipionate and get ready to start smacking a thousand milligrams every single week i mean that's the reality of it you know so um and again that that's spoken without prejudice it's simply biochemistry yeah and and anecdote plays into this and anecdote is important and i'm about to discuss yours a little bit but i always tell people like be just be be cautious with anecdote i'm not saying that your anecdote doesn't matter but what i am saying is everyone knows somebody who smoked every single day of their life till they were 90 right and lived to a ripe old age does that mean that it's okay to smoke or do we think that's the best thing for longevity we certainly do not right so when we're we're making broad recommendations we're doing that based on the consensus of the evidence but we we also need to understand that there will be outliers that fall outside that and that's where you know individualization comes in so i think one of the things that we really are struggling with right now and i've i kind of challenged the low carb community on this a while back because one of my pet peeves is i'm not saying that there's not such a thing as ketogenic adaptation or fat adaptation that may take longer what i'm saying is we need a hard metric for it we really need some kind of hard metric to explain this because if we look at things like okay let's look at blood ketones yeah it's clearly not bad yeah yeah it's clearly not blood ketones it's not lipolysis it's not i mean my only regret because and we see fat oxidation fat oxidation within six days no no it's none of the things that we understand i mean my biggest regret about the experiment i did because i'm never going to be repeating it is i wish at the time i had the thought and wherewithal to have taken muscle biopsies and collected you know ample amounts of tissue for all the future proteomics metabolomics every omic you can think of to have been done down the line it still would have only been an n of one but to me if there if that 18-month transition was something beyond psychological and let's be honest it could have been psychological too right if it was anything other than psychological i suspect the answer is far deeper than in any of the things that typically get talked about yeah so i think if i was going to explain your kind of 18 months to get back to anaerobic right so first off i think it's important to note that when it comes to when it comes to exercise there's some diverging information in terms of the ketogenic diet or low carb diet whether or not it's it's it's bad for exercise i think we can pretty conclusively say that for ultra endurance there doesn't seem to be a downside to it it also doesn't seem to be superior it kind of boils down to personal preference in what the person likes when it comes to aerobic exercise at least from what i've seen if you're under 60 of your vo2 max you're probably safe uh in terms of getting the most out of your exercise after you're fat adapted when it comes to over 70 that's where we start to get into where it becomes much more difficult to perform well or as optimally as you can on a ketogenic and of course yes if you like somebody sent me something to say well look at sean baker he's dead lifting 500 pounds for nine reps and he's 50 years old you know like how do you explain that i said okay again this is why we have randomized controlled trials because i'm not saying that he's not strong and i'm not saying that you can't get strong and that you can't do some heavy weights for higher reps what i the question you need to ask yourself is is he as strong as he possibly could have been if he was doing something different because just the sheer magnitude of resistance training consistently for a long period of time you will get very strong it doesn't matter what diet you're on you will get strong or relatively strong for what you started at so the question always has to be are we talking about can you do something or was this the best thing that you could possibly do because those are two different questions right it's like when people talk about how much protein do i need well you only need about 50 grams a day if we're talking about preventing you from being in a negative nitrogen balance but what's optimal for health or lean body mass so that's a very different question right so i think that when i guess if i could implore the listeners just always remember that when you when you see something that you think contradicts or you that you think is it doesn't fit what is the person saying are they talking about optimizing or are they talking about can you actually do this because if somebody says well you can't get strong a ketogenic diet i'd say well you're you're an idiot of course you can right i mean look at dom dom i see the man i've seen him dead lift 700 top 700 pounds multiple times with no carbohydrate intake right so it's obviously not true the other thing i always encourage people to think about on this front is the relative to what comparison which is a slight variation on what you said so i know you had a great video out there which we'll link to on critiquing the documentary game changers which unfortunately i just think was such a horrible horrible piece of propaganda and i say that not as someone who's against a plant-based diet i think much like you but someone who is very much against disgusting science and i found that to be a demonstration of utter nonsense um but you know when we wrote something about this uh one of the comments was or one of the points we tried to make was you know one of the biggest challenges of studying nutrition in general is what are you comparing it to and if you compare diet x to the standard american diet almost by definition diet x is going to look amazing because the standard american diet is such an awful diet and i i just you know i thought it was such an insincere attempt to talk about a form of nutrition that obviously has many benefits uh but but when it's done in that way it's pretty bad and and we probably won't have time to go into it today but you you i thought did such a great job of going into some of the real challenges of that uh at a level that most people didn't right like a lot of the criticisms of that movie are so obvious and easy but you actually went deep in them so we'll make sure people people um go and look at that i want to change gears for a second and come back to this cortisol thing because i think this is a very misunderstood hormone and i know you've written about this and i think it's worth getting the listener up to speed on cortisol we tend to look at this very black and white so let's give the extremes so there's something called an addisonian crisis right someone gets a bad infection they have an injury to their adrenal gland they can't make cortisol acutely they're going to die they are hands down going to die the only way to rescue that patient is to give them massive doses of hydrocortisone or hydrocortisone equivalent and that very much speaks to the medical necessity of cortisol let's look at the other extreme let's look at cushing's disease so you can have cushing's disease or cushing's syndrome where either at the pituitary gland or at the adrenal gland rampant amounts of cortisol are made and nobody would dispute the pathology of that state this is a person who develops basically a ball of fat on the back of their neck that's basically the size of a basketball excessive fat accumulation all sorts of metabolic dysregulation again nobody would dispute that that that is a problem fortunately very few people are in either of those states so right let's now talk about physiologic levels of cortisol and their impact on muscle protein synthesis and something you said earlier which i found very interesting which was tolerating pain pain threshold training resilience and things like that yeah so we're thinking about the function of cortisol at its root which is a stress hormone right so you're secreting hormones the cortisol in response to some kind of stressor um when it comes again so this is this is a great example of acute versus chronic okay when it comes to somebody who's getting very low sleep overall unhealthy lifestyle you know smoke whatever they're going to have high levels of cortisol and and that can be problematic from the or very like high levels of stress because now i think about what stress used to mean stress used to mean oh crap there's that thing that's going to kill me i need to run and so your body would produce cortisol for a myriad of different reasons part of that was just a fuel mobilization response it mobilizes glucose free fatty acids those sorts of things it's just trying to get as much fuel in the bloodstream as it can now when you when it comes to cushing's for example because or at least my best guess is and there may be studies on this i haven't looked super in detail on it my best guess is it's not necessarily that you're accumulating fat you're redistributing it right like it's going to weird places that's right the legs become incredibly thin the abdomen and the upper back become incredibly full right so you actually see this in like um people who have uh oh god what do you call it um why can't i think of the name oh liposuction okay so your adipose doesn't just sit on nothing it sits on the extracellular matrix if you do liposuction it destroys that matrix and so people go oh well you can't gain fat back but you can't gain it back there but you start if you regain it you start gaining it in very odd places and so what you're looking at is a redistribution because cortisol going back to cortisol if you have high cortisol because you're stressed constantly and your your body is still operating on genes from you know a million years ago that's telling you we're stressed must be something coming to kill us so we're going to liberate a bunch of energy into the bloodstream well well then it's still got if you're not going to use it if it doesn't get used it's got to be put back somewhere right and so now you can have it started to be deposited in strange places possibly now when it comes to exercise specifically it's a stressor exercise is a stressor it makes sense that it would increase your cortisol but people have kind of taken to say well we need to limit cortisol as much as possible so remember there used to be the oil i don't know if you remember this but it's like don't train more than an hour because at that point cortisol starts to go up starts to spike i i miss that entire memo and school of thought fortunately [Laughter] so interestingly so we've referenced stu phillips a few times now he did a study i want to say 10 years ago and looked at different hormones and how they associated with actual hypertrophy so he looked at uh sorry so the post exercise increases in systemic hormones so he looked at testosterone igf-1 growth hormone cortisol um and i think that was it guess which hormone was mostly associated absolutely cortisol hands down but of course i'm familiar with the paper but yes uh right and yeah the interpretation is again is it that cortisol is producing hypertrophy or is it cortisol is in response to the stress that is producing hypertrophy so that's again this seems paradoxical because people see an association they automatically think well there must be a cause there not necessarily at all these two things are happening in parallel so what it means is the resistance training session that is going to produce the most amount of stress the most amount of adaptation is probably going to produce the most cortisol and possibly the most hypertrophy if it's repeated right so cortisol like we know that it will impede muscle protein synthesis but again that is cortisol acts transcriptionally like testosterone it is actually a steroid hormone in fact people get confused because they're like well he got a steroid steroid injection before his you know tennis match and people like they're not test just not injecting them with testosterone they're giving them cortisol so he can go out and play because it reduces inflammation in that particular area well cortisol is more of a long-term hormone it's acting transcriptionally so it's what you need to be worried about are long-term low-level elevations in cortisol and people make this mistake with anything they make it with mtor a lot of the vegan doctors get all up in arms about mtor you know getting stimulated by leucine and that's going to give you cancer you don't understand tissue specifics and you don't understand acute versus chronic i just want to make a funny comment there i i was at a at a meeting and a very famous vegan doctor who i obviously won't name um came up to me and chastised me for the idea that i would ever suggest someone ingest five grams of leucine during a workout because of its negative effect on mtor and how that could be bad for a person's health and i just had to sit there and smile and so yeah i i just don't have it in me sometimes to tell people to shut up but yeah a lot of this is really reductionist thinking you know what i mean um and this happens for all different all different if i can switch gears just a little bit because i think this is really important for people to hear people want to isolate out nutrients as being good or bad and i would really implore people that nutrients are not necessarily good or bad context matters and what really matters is lifestyle and overall eating patterns that is what matters you cannot possibly think that in a diet where there are thousands of different nutrients that we ingest that it's one thing is causing all the problems that we're having right and this whether it's leucine or sugar or whatever because when you isolate out these things you can find mechanistic data to support almost anything you want but even things that we we think we know like i remember when i got to grad school and i was like high fructose corn syrup independently fattening it doesn't matter the calories anything like that and again do i think high fructose corn syrup is good absolutely not i think it's hyperpalatable i think people overeat it but if you look at the studies pretty closely it seems to mostly be an energy thing that it just provides too much energy now people hear that and they think it's a dismissal of it you know like that i'm condoning it or something like that and i'm not condoning it i'm just saying that if you isolate it out and you keep people's calories the same it doesn't seem to have the same effect but do people who eat a lot of high fructose corn syrup keep their calories the same of course not they eat more calories than other people they also usually eat more um you know processed foods more fats you know all that sort of thing so a great study that i think came out a couple years ago that i think really highlights this point was a study where they looked at um all i think it was cancer incidents from any form of cancer and it was in uh it was in canada 100 000 people cohort and they looked at low meat intake versus high meat intake and i think it was in quartiles so four different levels and i mean we know this if you do that what you tend to find is that meat is this meat intakes associated with cancer now the problem is people who eat high amounts of meat tend to have an overall unhealthy lifestyle in general they're less likely to exercise they're more likely to smoke they're more likely to eat processed foods because most the meat is coming from fast food that sort of thing but what was cool about this was they also compared it with the lowest to highest quartiles of fruit and vegetable intake and what they found was that at the highest level of meat intake but also that also consumed the highest level of fruit and vegetable intake they had the same risk for cancer as the lowest level of meat intake with with a high level of fruit and vegetable intake so basically what that tends to suggest is that to me we need to look at eating patterns much more so than we look at individual nutrients and that if you're looking for one nutrient to explain you know disease incidence this sort of stuff you really need to look at the whole diet and people who eat is sugar like when i say that sugar isn't inherently bad for you i mean from a purely mechanical if i take 50 grams out of somebody's diet of you know starchy carbohydrate and i just put sugar into it or you know the same equal calories from fats and i just put sugar in there do i think anything bad is going to happen probably not but that's not how people eat so i'm talking mechanistically and people think i'm making a recommendation so all that to say it's really important to understand how limited nutritional studies are and you mentioned it when you're talking about trying to pick out these really granular details you're talking about a study that's so restrictive it's really hard to generalize the results to the average person so when you look at studies that are generalizable to the average population you can't control that many variables because it has to be free living and if it has to be free living i mean it's very hard to pick out differences because dietary adherence tends to be so low so i know i went off on a really big divergent rant but you know acute versus chronic localized versus systemic you know people just don't understand that the differences and these are and this includes scientists i mean even like inflammation god a great example of this is um on the joe rogan game changers debate where john wilkes was talking about inflammation he said um you know if you're training for exercise you know and you're having higher levels of inflammation from that and then you go and eat meat afterwards like now you're compounding that inflammation and i just remember thinking you just don't understand the difference between acute versus chronic these aren't even the same types of inflammation but right like your your acute inflammatory response from exercise means nothing well it actually doesn't mean nothing it's beneficial exercise it yeah yeah so here's the crazy thing about exercise if you were an alien and you didn't know anything about exercise but you knew about human physiology and i told you hey i'm gonna make you do something that increases your blood pressure increases your heart rate uh increases your free radical production increases your inflammation you know all these different things you would go that's horrible don't do it but what is exercise it's it's like it's almost like a vaccine right you give a small you give a give a controlled dose of a stressor and your body adapts to that stressor by getting better at handling it so what do we see in people who exercise regularly they have lower resting heart rate they have lower blood pressure they have um lower levels of inflammation you know those sorts of things um and you know nutritionally i question like these studies that look at inflammatory response and response in terms of post meal injection i really go how much does that actually mean yeah i think this stuff means absolutely nothing i i think that you know when you think about the time course of something and you tell me that you measured somebody's igf-1 or igf-6 an hour after a meal and in two hours i i yeah i agree with you completely it's totally nonsense and by the way your point about exercise i think comes back to what you said when you were making that decision between nutrition science and exercise science which was look exercise probably is the best drug we have i agree emphatically with that i think that when you think about the um the hormesis that comes from exercise like i i just i don't believe we will ever be able to develop a drug that is that remarkable it is simply unbelievable what it can do no i mean look at like almost any dietary intervention unless you're unless you're okay with just small improvements to see big improvements you pretty much got to lose body fat like that that that's that's that's what the crux of it is with exercise you get massive improvements with zero loss of weight you you can see big improvements um and so you know i just implore people one of the one of the and this goes for like kind of the two opposing ends like like plant-based kind of really emphatic supporters and then like low-carb supporters i hear a lot of people they'll spend so much time you know on these granular details of diet and they say well i don't i don't resistance exercise i don't have time for it and i'm like you got time to stress over your diet on twit on twitter for two hours but you don't have time to go into the gym or just do some push-ups at home like you are missing out on the most powerful tool you have to improve your health and body composition and even like um there was a a study by wolf looking at longevity over age 65 and found a direct association the most powerful predictor of longevity after age 65 was how much lean body mass you had that was the most powerful predictor of who lived the longest after age 65 was your level of lean body mass yeah and there are lots of studies that go beyond just the sarcopenia and look at like grip strength um and and and and things like that so yeah i completely agree and i love the idea by the way of in between twitter feuds over your nutritional views you have to do some push-ups that's that could be the solution here to to this problem um i want to talk a little bit about uh i'm sorry we're just i i keep saying we're going to wrap this up and we're not but i'm sorry we're going to wrap this up at some point um one thing that i've been really impressed with in following you lane is the uh what's the right word i want to use um the the deliberate nature with which you approach things so i've seen pictures of you where i think like he doesn't even look like a human being he's so ripped and shredded and i've seen pictures of you where you look kind of chubby and you've been very clear and said i'm going through different phases i'm very deliberate about what i do this is a phase where i am adding a ton of lean mass and with it comes some body fat and right now i'm taking it off but um one you're very deliberate so nothing's haphazard and two you really emphasize the importance of consistency so how do i stay consistent because it's it doesn't take nearly as much work to preserve muscle mass once you have it but you and i talked about this with alex hutchinson on a previous podcast one of the things i fear the most for my patients as they age is any sort of injury or illness that takes them out of exercise because the deconditioning that occurs when someone doesn't do anything for a month is devastating so can you can you put some numbers to that because i believe you've spoken about this which is what is the effort required to maintain uh and i'm not talking about show you know like four percent body fat on a stage i'm talking about and again we'll use your numbers as an example you happen to be you know great to begin with but you know for you to stay at 13 14 body fat um is not the end of the world it's not a huge sacrifice but it requires being diligent still what does that mean to you and how do you advise your clients around that so there's a few layers to this um when it comes to resistance training i mean this is really just anything in life resistance training taught me so much about just life overall right so the same people who come up with bio hacks of how you can like get to your goal in 12 weeks or whatever in the financial world they're the same people who are like hey join my pyramid scheme and earn six figures from home doing one hour of work a week most reasonable people know that that's not how you acquire wealth right you acquire wealth through if if you're you know thomas j stanley's i use fiscal examples because i just find it's easier for people but 80 of millionaires are first generation self-made um and most of them got there not through getting lucky but the fact that they saved more money than they earned they were consistent and they did that for a long period of time now that is the granular mechanistic way of doing it kind of like how we talk about calories in calories out right but what it takes to get that consistency is modification to behavior right because for the same reason that somebody binges on whatever donuts chocolate cakes cookies whatever is the same reason that somebody who also knows hey in order for me to save money i need to earn more than i spend still goes out and blows 1500 bucks on a shopping spree after a stressful week right because they have a habit and an association with something and so i think people need to understand that consistency is the most important thing but to create that consistency you have to change your habits um you have to create habits i read a a review systematic review by a gal named marie schreckley and i'm going to give myself a pat in the back here for a second because she actually said that she went back to school after reading my book fat loss forever and it's what inspired her to do her phd work which is pretty awesome and she did a systematic review of looking at people who lost weight and kept it off so some of the commonalities of that and a lot of it was what you expected consistency ability to embrace challenges rather than rather than running from them or viewing challenges as part of the process i think a lot of people when setbacks occur or challenges occur they feel that that's abnormal as opposed to embracing it as part of this process but then something that was in the paper that i hadn't thought about before that i think is so critical to developing that consistency and making a change forming a new identity so the people who lost weight and kept it off said that they had to form a new identity and i really chewed on this for a while and and do you know ethan suplee no but i was i was just about to say james clear is the first person who made that point clear to me no pun intended and it of all the things in james's book that one actually appealed to me the most which was it's not about dis well i always knew it wasn't about discipline and willpower because those things are going to fade over time but this piece around and let's use exercise as the example it's going from oh i have to do this thing i have to do this thing to i'm a person who exercises i'm a fit person that's the transition that makes it easier to do day in and day out and that's probably why i've never struggled with exercise i still go with the opposite i really struggle to take a day off i think to be completely transparent i'm always going to struggle with food a little bit i haven't had the full identity switch in food but i was i think i was born with or at least it was etched in my brain when i was so young due to my insecurities around exercise so i think you said something very poignant there that's you just put in your mind this is what i do this is what i do this is part of who i am and so ethan suplee he's an actor um and he was in you probably if you've seen the movie remember the titans yeah yeah yeah oh yes yes yes i know i know who you're talking about now he lost a staggering amount of weight like almost an unrecognizable amount of weight he's jack yeah right um so i talked to him pretty frequently and uh he has a thing he puts on his instagram he's he he say i killed my clone today and i asked him about that because i read marie's paper and then i made this connection because i always wondered what he meant by i killed my clone today and i said is this what you mean that you formed a new identity that you killed the old person that you were and he said that is exactly what i mean because you could not create a new life a new identity or you cannot create a new life and you cannot have a physical and overall change in your life without fun while still dragging those behaviors behind you right let's let's take a basic example an alcoholic right if you decide if an alcoholic decides tomorrow i don't want to be this anymore you have to change everything you can't just okay i want to stop drinking no no your entire identity has been around i go to a bar i hang out with my friends after work they probably drink my family probably drank growing up that's where i learned it from now you've got to change everything you are not going to be able to be you know this new person while still dragging your old behaviors behind you and i think a lot of people try to do that when it comes to nutrition and maybe even exercise it's it's well i want things to change but i don't want to give up my you know three glasses of wine a night or i don't want to give up this or i don't want to go up there what i always tell people is like listen the great thing about nutrition is you get to pick what you sacrifice okay so for me what made it easy for me and i always tell people you should pick the form of restriction that fuel feels easiest to you i don't care what anybody else feels like for me if i'm able to eat whatever foods i want as long as i control portion size and track my calories and macros and whatnot that feels easy that is not difficult for me to maintain like a lean physique and athletic um but for other people that may be extremely tedious difficult it may feel labor-intensive to me it doesn't what feels labor intensive to me is saying okay lane you can't have you know processed food ever again or you can't have carbs or you can't have fats or whatever but for other people some people i hear it all the time say i did ex diet ketogenic diet and it felt easy i did intermittent fasting i was never hungry i felt easy cool great just don't assume that what was easy for you is going to be easy for everybody else because this you know i thought flexible dieting was going to be the solution for everybody because it was easy for me so i arrogantly assumed that it'd be that way for everybody else i think everybody goes through that that's sort of like you know you seek out your own echo chamber sort of thing right and you find these people who had the same that had the same experience as you and you just assume everybody's like that it turns out no no people are quite different so find the you get to pick the type of restriction find what feels easiest and try not to get too caught up in well this diet increases fat oxidation and insulin and like all these little things we talk about because at the end of the day if you've ever lost weight and then regained it why did it happen it didn't happen because you didn't get your macronutrient ratio perfect or your nutrient timing wasn't down it happened because you stopped being consistent with the behaviors that you implemented that's what happened and the same thing goes with exercise people tell me all the time like man lane i wish i was motivated like you i'm like ha uh i i i would say that i i love lifting weights and that makes it easier to be motivated i acquired that love through years but i don't always love it just like i'm not always happy with my spouse right like some days we fight doesn't mean i don't love her overall it just means some days we get annoyed at each other some days i'm unhappy with weightlifting i don't want to do it however i always tell people and i'm not saying you can never take a day off of course you know if you need a day off to reset whatever that's fine you just got to be careful that that doesn't turn into weeks and months and years right and here's the comparison i use i don't have to be motivated to go into training it's part of what i do just like i don't have to be motivated and pump myself up to brush my teeth do you know why because it's a very simple equation if i don't brush my teeth they're going to go to crap just like if i don't exercise my body is going to go to crap so it doesn't it is not for me it is not a question of motivation it is a question of what do i want and what are the actions that are required to get what i want and if my actions do not line up with what is needed and the amount of work that is needed it's very simple i'm not going to get what i want and it's on a fundamental level it's that simple but getting people to one buy-in and two you know get past the stage where you start you've got that honeymoon phase and everything feels good you're like yeah i'm gonna do this and then you hit your first challenge or your first setback or your scale flux actually during the the the systematic review uh participants talked about how um seeing the scale fluctuate what was a difficult thing to get over and some people would quit because they would gain three pounds when in reality they probably just had a bad weigh-in day that's why this is why i actually tell people weigh in every single day and take the average because the average is not going to fluctuate that much um so anyways no i i think i think those are just those are those are great points yeah the point of this all is that consistency is the fundamental you can do you could have any diet you could have any training system if you're consistent you're going to see results i i use this comparison i'll i'll throw it back to you on this one if i said to you peter i want you to go out and become the best three-point shooter you possibly can be you cannot get any instruction you can't read any books you can't get a coach nothing but if all you did every single day for three hours a day for 10 years was go out and shoot three pointers you probably wouldn't be in the nba but i bet you'd be pretty damn good at shooting three-pointers you know what i mean i would agree with that hopefully better than i am now because right now i'm not joking my 12 year old daughter is probably the same as me at shooting three-pointers which means by the time she's 13 she might be better than me well i think that's that's the other thing for people to keep in mind is use other people's stories for inspiration but be very careful about comparing yourself because what you need to ask yourself is can i get better try not to ask yourself can i be like x person because the answer might be no but here's the rub you'll never know unless you put in the decade worth of work right like when i started out i had people tell me why are you lifting weights you're skinny you'll never be never be jacked and then even when i got into powerlifting people were like look at how long your legs are look at how you squat you will never be good at this if i would have listened to that i never would have set a gold medal in the squad i never i never would have done that now that world record got broken and i may never get it back very good chance i'll never get it back but i got a lot farther than i ever could have imagined just through sheer consistency i did a lot of stuff wrong but sheer mass effect of work and consistency can make up for a lot of shortcomings and i think a lot of people out there have paralysis by analysis and they never just start because they're so intimidated by all the information that's out there lane we actually got through a third of the stuff i wanted to talk about today and i'm gonna make it i'm gonna make an on-the-field decision that we're gonna probably have to sit down again because i want to talk about a lot of things i want to talk about creatine i want to talk about katsu or occlusion training i want to talk about really nuanced stuff around the differences between the size of a muscle the strength of a muscle and the metabolic function of a muscle there are a lot of other things i want to go into with you and i also wanted to go a little deeper into the sort of leucine signaling stuff um but to even stretch i know i know and to go to go into that stuff superficially now doesn't do it justice um so why don't we just agree to do this again at some point sure all right man well
