## Transcript

[00:00:00] I could not agree more with you on that V2 Max is probably or still today the holy grail for understanding basically longivity or or or let's say the best marker or metric we have in order to quantify it because to to to just elaborate a little bit further on that you can also say that well V2 Max is a measure of something so we are measuring something in the end there uh but we could and to be a little bit crude you could say that okay fine you some people could say well having a good having a good heart having a good heart is a good predictor of of of longevity for example but I'm pretty sure we can find people that are in the bed and they are really sick that still have a really good heart so obviously that that then you understand that well there has to be more nuances to this than just the heart itself you can have people that has a great heart and everything looks good lungs perfect everything like this but they have neurological diseases for example all of these will limit you from reaching a high V2 Max which is again so integral it basically just encompasses all this kind of because you can't reach a high view to Max if any of these functions here are not good hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music]

[00:01:28] AA Olaf thank you so much for making time to sit down with me today um I have I'm I'm really excited about this uh episode and I'm going to try to contain my own enthusiasm such that the uh people listening to this will understand what we're talking about because um the topic we're going to go into today is really one that fascinates me to no end um but more than that you are someone who brings a level of expertise that is so high that it really allows me to um kind of engage at a level of curiosity that I rarely get to engage in and I don't think I've taken more notes coming into a podcast than I have for this one

[00:02:14] I fully expect we will not get through half of what I've written down in terms of topics that I want to explore but um nevertheless I'm going to apologize in advance to you and to everybody else for just how uh enthusiast ically I want to address the subject matter of human performance perhaps before we get into that though maybe you could just tell folks who assume let's assume you know people don't know anything about you and who you are all of um just tell them who you are what you do and the types of athletes that you work with uh okay so to try to make a liner story uh I actually grew up on a farm on the west coast of Norway uh I had to participate in uh a lot of work at the farm when I was a kid I didn't let's say against my will because I saw my my neighbors and others were playing and I would very much like to do that as well but I think in or for sure in my uh now today and already long time ago I already started to really appreciate all all the or the hardship more or less but uh fast forward fast forward I I already developed a very uh

[00:03:35] Keen interest for uh technology already as a kid and I was extremely curious I I liked to really pick things apart and and understand how things were put together uh fascinated about everything from the universe and Rockets and and so on and of course uh living at the farm you also get the possibility to pick apart a lot of machineries and other things and see how this is working working and so being with animals I I have a very strong connection with animals uh but um

[00:04:07] I I also started to develop as I started to grow a little older I started to get get very interested in more uh things that were more extreme I had an attraction towards things that were extreme so extreme sports typical were a thing that I really uh that resonates a lot with me I there are probably no extreme sport I haven't participated in on a call it on a okay level um uh but uh yeah then I uh took my degree in U electr techniques uh went on to engineering found out that um I was not cut for the for let's say 8 to four uh working style for me it was more about entrepreneurship I I like to build things innovate new things solve things that nobody have so before that that those again a little bit extreme things that basically are abstract really really fascinates me so in h in 2011 there was an event happening in my life this was after I actually started my I had started my second company we were into the mountains uh we there we were we had to use helicopter to get into the mountains uh there was a big uh or basically had yeah half my family died uh on this uh trip into the mountains uh again uh uh um it made a shift in my life uh and um I decided to um from for for various reasons I got into more into even more into sports so I was then asked to start to combine the field of exercise physiology and technology or my my strength in in technology and see whether we could start to take more of let's say more research a lot of research that typically happens in laboratory settings and or even in microbiology where you're taking out components and looking at how does it react but we very rarely are able to transform that back into humans in a way that makes us the same difference so how could we now study people use technology to study people uh especially Elites for example in the setting where they normally exercised and even use that to to continue to drive performance and then of course today uh uh two of my personal atlet or three of my personal athletes Christian Blumenfeld Gustav

[00:06:32] Eden Ken Janina and they are uh they hold all the records that are in in Tron Short Course Long course Olympic medal uh World Championship medal short course U the Iron Man world world championship 70.3 and full distance from from Kona and St George last year and um yeah it's been an incredible journey because I one thing is of course what I have contributed to with them but I really like a collaborative collaborative way of working so I learn always from them as well because I'm very curious about how they how they feel what they see how they perceive different things because there's a lot of things we can measure with data and there's a lot of things we can't measure with data still so you need also to that cont that context as well and uh mainly today I I have uh I we are actually building a company where we're scaling these components using AI so numerical models large language models into a company called enthalpy like physics of course so enthalpy and and and and and and thermodynamics there are some fundamental laws humans can't escape no matter how unique we think we are and then on the other side I work also as a coach for coaches mainly so

[00:07:46] I'm more coaching coaches at Olympic level Welter level um racing uh at the highest levels so uh yeah that's a um a long introduction uh uh yeah on me well let's start with some fundamentals because we're going to spend a lot of time today talking about Extreme Performance uh and Peak Performance around the types of sports in which you're coaching athletes so you know the triathlete is kind of a remarkable athlete in several levels the first being that he or she must be very good in three disciplines that are related but quite distinct uh different body types if you look at the world's best swimmers the world best cyclists and the world's best Runners they actually have quite different physiology depending on the distances they race and certainly different methods of training and the triathlete therefore has to be really respected because they have to be almost worldclass in each of those things to be world class in their sport um and and their physiology as a result of that is remarkable and there are so so many things that we're going to talk about today including temperature management energy expenditure energy consumption all these things that said

[00:09:07] I'm going to you know I want to make sure that the listener is able to follow where we go and we're going to get into some really serious weeds right we're going to talk about MCT Transporters for shuttling lactate out of cells and all of those things um because that's where I want to go but I want to make sure people understand the fundamentals the very basics so um humor me as we go through kind of the 101 of ATP production and utilization so um you and

[00:09:39] I are sitting here right now having a discussion and of course our body is converting all the while chemical energy into electrical energy back into chemical energy and it requires the substrates of oxygen and hydrocarbons to do that can you explain you know in a little bit of detail exactly what that process looks like for us right now as we're sitting here under obviously a very low physiologic demand so you on a very deep level or do do you want more like a high level let's start high level okay uh so um I think one of the things are Roi uh they made um there there's a really beautiful uh map call it a map made by rooch I think it's called rooch rooch Ro they are a medical supply the the the

[00:10:37] Swiss pharmaceutical company r c yeah yeah yeah exactly so they they made a really beautiful uh a really beautiful uh map which is still not exhausted we we we all we we are we are continuously learning new things that we can add to this uh map and this map is called there two map they basically distinguish between and is one that they call the metabolic pathways another one they call the signaling

[00:11:05] Pathways and on the metabolic pathways we have of course many ways that we can uh convert energy from uh so we mainly of course it's it's it's proteins it's it's fats it's carbohydrates that we are converting basically from a substrate or from the food that we we ingest and we store in our body to then basically ATP which is the main fuel source that the muscles or different muscles in the body are using or different functions the body is using in order to survive and of course to convert those substrate also into ATP also there's oxygen required but there are many many different

[00:11:45] Pathways and the problem a little bit a problem a little bit with this as well is that even though even though this is a field which we have uh studied quite a lot we are still learning more and we don't fully understand it still either and that's why very often actually to to bring it up maybe to where I think is more useful very often to work on this is that if you dig too much into some of these different things that you lose track you start to lose track exactly of how do you increase performance of somebody as well because it to to use another example today we have for example

[00:12:26] SmartWatches and other things as well that are trying to say something about a sleep and it's it's derived or infered basically from movement from your from your wrist for example and it's based on HRV but the problem is also when we looking at okay what is performance so if we say the calry so again back to thermodynamics or fundamental law on the one side humans needs to move that's what we do so we're sitting here now in the chairs we're moving around we're I'm moving my or gesticulating with my hands and these kind of things we are nodding with our heads um and all this requires energy in order to do that and that's movement you you can track this movement you can even have Quantified it in centimeters or meters or whatever over our day for each of our components or globally when we are running for example uh the distance we cover um but in order to do so obviously there's we need an energy source we need energy from somewhere and of course the currency for the muscles or for any things in your body is basically ATP but in order to create atps then basically we need we need different substrate to be broken down and in order for combustion to take place we need oxygen this is the like most people probably remember the fire triang triangle where basically you need you need oxygen you need a temperature and then we need something to combust and of course uh oxygen is probably the most practical way today of course to measure exactly how much energy are we using at any given time and then of course we can always start to break this down and try to understand how much atps uh this release or what is the energy yield from from that amount of oxygen but this is also highly diff different also in humans Some Humans will be more efficient and typically Elites are very efficient at this while while normal population would probably be less efficient at this to create energy so typical then to to round that up I would say that very often or the way that I very often to work today is to to not lose track because on the same on one side of course I have a large team around with with people that are uh extremely uh good at this one of the researchers that that I work with he was just actually now recognized as the number one researcher in the cycling world uh this year uh um but uh and they are digging a lot into everything from enatic activities to how energy is being released and so on how can we do this better but one thing that

[00:14:54] I found very much more useful is actually that we need sometimes just a black boox and we have to remember what is important there so we know we know movement is the most important part to humanity so being able to move if we can sit at work we can sit at the podcast but then basically afterwards this we still have an energy supp plusus that allows us to come home and move around with our kids and play and be kind to our wives and and help them out at home and so on that is that a situation we all feel good with that's what we all want so then the question is how do we do that so how how can we how can we track different par to understand how we can get there and this is where I think very often that looking at more of let's say humans as an engine or as as a machine where you say okay there's there's a fuel and an energy input so you look at oxygen consumption for example because this you can do with a car even with a car and then you look at okay you have power so most people will probably have a power meter but if they are cycling and a little bit more if you don't have it does really is not that important because anyway the the the output from this process will be distance per time one thing that we see also between let's say less trained people or people that are yeah or put to put another way people are putting in less volume into their training is also that very often in order to to do a certain amount of work or let's say moving a certain distance has a higher has a higher oxygen cost or basically higher calorie cost for them to move that distance distance as well so I think on the one side I'm very fascinated about breaking down things into the let's say the smaller details but the problem is that we have a limit to how much time we have available and how do how do we then make sure that we get the best or how can we then make sure that the things that we do the interventions we plan the the the changes we make to uh Our Lives how can we then quantify what it has an effect one of course is the ultimate measurement of of of this is ultimately distance per time but in order to understand what mechanism are actually happening here now we can measure of course if you have a power meter or power meter technology we can start is it biomechanically driven so are you improving your biomechanics or we can look between power so work basically and and and uh and calry is the biochemical part that is improving and we can even then decide just to say okay we blackbox it we don't necessarily need to understand it because we can see whether things are improving or not improving if it it does improve continue to do more of it if it doesn't improve then we basically say okay okay uh fine we can dig more deeper into it and that's where of course we have uh Specialists and others around us that basically are trying to understand exactly what is happening on a deeper level uh yeah so let's let's use some real examples on that and I want to just kind of synthesize what you said a little bit because it's it's very interesting so one of the first things you said is look um the metric that matters is velocity you you described it as distance per unit time but of course that's that's that's that's velocity so um if you're a runner if you're a cyclist if you're a swimmer if you're a triathlete the winner and loser is determined by velocity not power output not any other met y so um obviously there's a very strong correlation between power normalized to weight and velocity but it is not one: one and um I'll use an example um especially in a triathlon or a time trial where aerodynamics matters significantly you can have people that put out more power but they create more drag and obviously that's very true in swimming as well in running obviously there's running efficiency that can speak to energy expenditure versus velocity so velocity is

[00:18:39] King I like the way you kind of broke it down into two drivers right you can have how efficient are you at using the energy source to make the ATP what is your loss ratio there so presumably majority of that energy is lost in the form of heat uh but some of it of course is and we typically I remember used to use like a 1 to five ratio so you could sort of take the number of kogs divide by five that was approximately going to be your energy expenditure but let's come back to that because that's obviously very crude but then you said no no no look you also have to be equally focused on your mechanical efficiency that gets to what I just talked about first of all is that a reasonable synthesis of what you just said yeah and you can split that also into because here it it helps to when you look at mechanical part it's also when you look between power and velocity then you can of course say that one component is of course the biomechanical part but another part of it is also the is also the work economy or where you basically look at equipment for example so aerodynamics and other things as well so there are two two two component but but purely if you look at the human

[00:19:45] Locomotion then basically it's ex exactly like you you you break it down yeah I'm going to share with you one really funny example before we come back to this so so 10 years ago back when I used to ride a bike and and the only thing I would do was time trial that was my favorite event to do and one of our favorite I had two partners that I trained with who were both much better than me Collegiate cyclists um and we used to do this workout every Saturday which was a an 80 kilometer ride on a time trial circuit so it's you know closed off it's flat it's you know it's a I think the each

[00:20:19] Loop was maybe s or eight kilometers but here was the thing we used to do we used to not allow allow ourselves to go over two 100 Watts so we had a power meter and you know the SRM will tell you exactly what your wattage and your average wattage is so you had to keep that average watt at 200 not 2011 not 199 and each week we would see if we could get faster and faster while keeping the wattage at 200 and as you know 200 watts is not a lot of watts of course so it was not hard to hold that for the 80 kilometers but you know over the span of a year I think if I remember correctly we were able to increase our velocity from maybe I want to say like 20 and a half miles per hour to maybe 22 miles per hour which is a very significant

[00:21:13] Improvement in efficiency and I'm curious how much of that do you think we did by getting better in our CDA our coefficient of drag times frontal surface area which I I will tell you didn't require new equipment and then how much of that do you think we did metabolically in other words that we metabolically got better at turning energy into uh

[00:21:39] Power so first of all of course when you have a power meter you don't know how more metabolically say how much the Met metabolic efficiency we're missing we missed the V2 data we have no idea what oxygen consumption did in that year that's right exactly so so that part is is is is not a part of the equation but if you look at work economy then I think there are there are a couple of things here mainly of course since a power meter on a bike like the SRM only measures the let's say the net mechanical Power so it basically only measures the the component of power that actually goes in the direction that you are actually moving the crank arm Y and of course already there are two there are two components but that that we don't have to focus on that here but that's where the difference between net mechanical Power and gross mechanical power comes in of course and and and maybe I don't know maybe we touch even further on this because there are also several ways to produce 200 Watts as well because you can also have a very large intracyclic power also oh no we sorry I should make this point we the goal was to keep average power and normalize power the same so no bursts of power y yeah no but but even there actually what most people don't realize is that when basically your power meter shows 200 200 wats and you keep it super steady around 200 Watts as well um you'll actually have inside one second or one revolution for example you'll already there have a variation of uh of of power that is more that is closer to uh where you're let's say it's 200 Watts you will have a peak power production I would say probably for you because of your focus and how determined you were there probably you were sitting on the on the nicest side of it but I wouldn't be surprised for some people riding 200 watts to be pushing uh a, uh 1200 watts for example Peak throughout every single

[00:23:30] Revolution yeah so this is something this is something we already quantify by the PO meters but since we don't but since we don't have to focus on that part here because you're measuring the locomotive part of the power component then I would say there is a couple of things here that is very interesting one is of course that you say that you are already riding at the power output which is very comfortable and I think that is important in many senses when you really want to work on your work economy for here because here we also talk here we are main we have already excluded the biome mechanical part of it because since you are not looking at the difference between gross mechanical

[00:24:02] Power and net mechanical Power then we are already said okay we don't care even about the biomechanical part we're only looking now basically on let's say what is transferred into forward propulsion or velocity so in this in this sense I would say that I would say that uh but when you're running T was what I think is really important and undervalued is that as the harder we go more of our oxygen and blood will basically be prioritize towards one driving the muscles forward secondly also even more for cooling and and and you hit it pretty pretty spot on when you say there's a 20% efficiency 80% heat 20% that's what we see pretty much for

[00:24:43] Elites not for for for for for people less but as you said we'll come back to that probably so then basically basically uh when you are focusing on this I think that there are no better setting when you have when you when you ride a little bit lower power it allows you to be very Mindful and cognitive present to your movement and how you are in the bike there and everything there and this is something that I I see very often is a different between also the

[00:25:12] Specialists and the tri list as well because the St leads are much more inclined to solve task Brute Force than the Specialists are the Specialists are because it's they simply have more time on Lower intensity medium intensity and high intensities or let's say as especially lower intensities they tend very often exactly to build a better feeling better feeling for um how they're moving through the landscape more efficiently uh by doing exactly like you say you look at at 200 watts and it becomes so measurable because you can start to evaluate what is happening with your velocity as a function of that you just see okay I'm creeping down with my head a little bit and you start to feel these nuances because to to summarize it or to to not to summarize it but to maybe end uh end it a little bit here is that is that when you go to a wind tunnel one of the problems with going to a wind tunnel is that you go in there and you do something that is like a spot it's a spot picture exactly of the position that you're holding for the moment I don't know how many hours is spent into the wind tunnel but for for various purposes but obviously a part of that has been looking at aerodynamics of an athlete the problem is that the moment you take that athlete off the chair off off the bike and you putting him on the chair and you ask him to go back into the position there if he doesn't have an outline in front of him that tells him exactly the position to be in that can already start to offset any other margins that you're looking to gain from for example clothing clothing other things so in order now to revaluate clothing in on an athlete and not on a dummy or a doll but basically on an live athlete the problem with that is exactly if you go off the bike come back on again you won't have the same position unless you have an outline that you see that you're fitting yourself into and the problem with that is exactly that you haven't gotten the time to rehearse your position and actually start to feel and get aware about your whole body position in exactly that position there which is completely the contrary to when you're riding 200 Watts you're riding at a power output that allows you exactly to have that cognitive excess uh uh to to to evaluate yourself feel yourself be aware of the surroundings and everything there and you are basically programming that into your basically your backbone for that this is the position so when you go out in go out how to say in a race you have trained that position so deep into your body that you can almost do it blind because you know exactly I I I think you're spot on here all of now that we we discuss it I actually think that that whatever it is 5% Improvement came almost entirely through frontal surface area and as you said it's so relaxed I mean we're talking as we're doing this ride right it's not a hard ride which meant all of your cognitive Reserve goes into wiggling your way into how narrow can I get my shoulders what's the best position of my knees on the top tube all of that kind of stuff um so that's very interesting and it's also interesting that you point out that it's a luxury that the one sport athlete has because at the time that was the only thing I mean I swam but it but most of my energy was on the bike and um um yes I think a triathlete would have a harder time maybe justifying that do you think a triathlete would benefit however from doing some of that kind of training that seems you know sort of like junk mileage because it's so low in intensity so this is where I would differ differ uh because it becomes junk mileage when you're not mindful about about there so of course this is also where for example

[00:28:51] I know that a lot of people talk about when you do a quality or high quality or quality workout it's a high intensity work workout but basically how I basically see it instead is that low intensity medium intensity and high intensity should all be high quality all of them should be mindful workout because you can use them for different purposes so exactly when you're doing the lower intensity it allows you exactly to have the cognitive Reserve to basically if use your senses to give you better biof feedback and learn better what you can improve which you don't will have the cognitive Reserve to do when you do the higher intensity workouts because then you are exactly focusing more on Surviving uh surviving instead so uh yes absolutely it's this I think is the most um becomes most evident in in in swimming uh in in cycling we actually do see that the TR leads because the movement pattern and and other things that are very you you have a you have very few degrees of freedom when you're sitting on a on a bike so in in cycling we see that for example the best Tri in the world are on par uh are close to or on par with actually the best cyclists in the world in running this of course starts to become a little bit uh bigger difference between them s simply because now you start to allow for a little bit more degrees of freedom and swimming is of course the worst this is where you have so many degrees of freedom and so poor feedback while you so you need to have a very good spatial awareness of of your body and what you're doing there in order to to to to um uh allow you to have a or to utilize your oxygen for maximum propulsion to give you an example we were in The Flume in at tener tea tree uh so they have there not an this is not a like a counter current pool where there's a jet sitting in front of you and pumping some water to it this is a full-fledged like a wind tunnel basically water is circulated full crosssectional area around in a in in a huge uh huge uh Circle and there is basically a three three times 3 m wide 1 and A2 M deep uh 5 meter five six meter long crosssection area of water just passing through over or past you like you were in in in an endless ocean swimming in an ocean water is water quality is perfect there's no turbulence no n just pure water running past we had an athlete there sorry the athlete is able to swim in place despite not it's not so it's not like you know an endless pool where you're being blasted with a 5

[00:31:32] Mile hour current 2 feet from your face you're out far enough in the pool that it just feels like you're in the ocean and you're not moving but you're you're you're using a natural stroke so actually this is It's it looks very similar to a wind tunnel it has the honeycomb structure on the on on both on the front and the back here and then basically are some huge fans pump sitting in another po off there so it's not sitting where you are swimming but basically sitting on on a return section instead there MH so basically what happens here is that you're laying in this tank and the water is just passing so you can just set the speed here in the same way as you do with an endless pool or counter current pool so you set the speed to for example 1 Point uh 5 met per second and you just jumping and you're just swimming there and you won't whether you go left or whether you go right or forward or back the current is exactly the same here because there is no turbulence anymore so the interesting thing now is that we of course we built a metabolic uh so we we took a gold standard metabolic cart and then basically we made hoses and everything and then apparatus that allows them to use this while they are swimming so meaning you are able to measure the ventilatory rate of oxygen consumption in carbon dioxide production everything so the input basically you're measuring the fuel consumption of the car and you're looking at what what at a certain and the exhaust yeah yes exactly yeah so the thing or not on exhaust but well exhaust is measure that but also the on the back wheels basically of your car y so then so then basically when they are in in in The Flume there we know that

[00:33:03] Christian and gusta for example have a equally high or higher V2 Max than the leads swimmers in the world and now I'm not talking about where you're comparing running with swimming we have taken them and measured this in swimming and the same thing I've done also on Elite swimmers and basically where we say

[00:33:18] Christian and gusta has a higher V2 Max so a bigger engine than the best swimmers in the world the people that are winning gold in the Olympics yep so in other words when you make when you push the speed high enough to the point where they reach the maximum amount of oxygen that they're going to be able to consume which is equivalent to or linearly equivalent to the maximum energy expenditure and we always know that the bigger that number the bigger the engine they do more they are able to consume more oxygen and put more calories to work than the world's best swimmers but of course you're about to tell us they're not as fast exactly and the difference is so big that it you don't even want to you don't even want to know it so for example we had a the bronze medalist from the

[00:34:08] Olympics swimming in The Flume there he is 195 195 tall he weighs more than I think let's say around 90 kilograms or more like massive guy lot of muscles he goes into The Flume swims at the same velocity as Christian is doing and is using almost a liter less of oxygen and it should not like that at that point that was close to 25% less oxygen and what we also do know the more muscles you have in the body the more oxygen you can also consume because they have almost no muscles obviously there won't be a lot of oxygen consumption because it's the muscles mainly that are using oxygen during basically exercising so now when you have an atlete that is this massive obviously you would assume that okay he is using and also a lot of oxygen because there's a lot of muscles involved because but because he's so efficient he actually swim at the same velocity with almost 25% less oxygen consumption than the best Tri in the world is doing and that is a a little bit of little bit mindboggling but it just tells how important also efficiency or movement efficiency is into this whole equation as well I I I would argue that is only mindboggling to someone who has not swam but a as a former swimmer myself this doesn't surprise me one bit not one iota because I came to swimming late in life I'm an adult onset swimmer so I didn't swim until I was 31 years old this is almost 20 years ago and it never ceased to amaze me even when I was at my absolute fittest on the bike when

[00:35:52] I when my V2 Max was more than 5 L how people with seemingly such a lack of Fitness could destroy me in a swimming pool yeah and you know these are these people were technically so Superior that you know I could put I could consume five lers of oxygen they would consume three no comparison and that's where exactly being Mindful and H using that cognitive

[00:36:19] Reserve not to do junk miles but doing really mindful miles in the pool on the bike exactly like you did it's so important but very undervalued and and and it could have been used so much better super interesting well let's let's start talking about some of these things we've already alluded to V2 and and V2 Max um and you've already made a very bold claim which in the pool is easier to accept but let's extend it now and let's talk about what it means on the bike and on the run because people who listen to this podcast have heard me say over and over again that V2 Max is the greatest predictor of lifespan this is kind of a remarkable statement again and I and I'll repeat it because it is so profound whether you smoke or don't smoke whether you have diabetes or don't have diabetes whether you have endstage kidney disease or don't heart disease not hypertension or not all of those things play an important role in predicting the length of your life but not as much as having a very high V2 Max this rises above of every other biomarker we have to predict the length of life and the reason I argue that that's probably the case is that V2 Max is an exceptional integrator of work that is done so for the few times I have patients that will tolerate the mathematical equation I would say Loosely speaking V2

[00:37:51] Max equals the integral from T1 to T2 of work as a function of time d and we know that that work is very valuable for your health right we can quantify why it is that exercise helps you live longer why is it good for the brain why is it good for the heart why is it good for the immune system and therefore V2 Max becomes a very reproducible way to document that work and it can't be changed quickly right so it's not a cheap biomarker like vitamin

[00:38:24] D where you can just take a bunch of you know Vitamin D supplements and immediately change your vitamin D level so with all of that said when we get into the minutia of exceptional Human Performance V2 Max is not the best predictor so let's put swimming aside because it's so obvious there but why would it not be the best predictor of performance in something like cycling for example or running where the aerodynamic contribution are in the case of cycling is easier to mitigate still nowhere near as bad as swimming and where the efficiency maybe isn't as important so so where do we see V2 Max not become the most important driver of endurance performance so first of all I I could not agree more with you on that V2 Max is probably or still today the Holy

[00:39:27] Grail for understanding basically longivity or or or let's say the best marker or metric we have in order to quantify it because to to to just elaborate a little bit further on that you can also say that well V2 Max is a measure of something so we are measuring something in the end there uh but we could and to be a little bit crude you could say that okay fine you some people could say well having a good having a good heart having a good heart is a good predictor of of of longivity for example but I'm pretty sure we can find people that are in the bed and they are really sick that still have a really good heart so obviously that that then you understand that well there has to be more nuances to this than just the heart itself you can have people that has a great heart and everything looks good lungs perfect everything like this but they have neurological diseases for example or all of these will limit you from reaching a high V2 Max which is again so integral it basically just encompasses all these kind because you can't reach a high V2 max if any of these functions here are not not good so

[00:40:43] I I I I couldn't agree more with you V2 Max is the absolute best predictor uh of mostly everything uh just because that it encom encompasses all these kind of things then on to why doesn't VI to Max become a very good predictor of performance in in cycling I would argue it does but then we are also starting to reach some more limitations as well you want to have as a high view to Max as possible even as a cyclist the only problem is that we are now facing some other problems as well when you are when you are an elite athlete and that is something we call maximum sustainable energy expenditure so obviously to turn around more calories per time that's that obviously means at over time you will use more calories as well and this in order now to support growth you obviously have to input more calories also because you're burning more you need to to bring more in otherwise you are starting to run into deficit and you worst case end up with problems so feeding that let's say calorie consumption becomes crucial further the problem is that V2 Max is closely related so if we wanted to have a surrogate metric for for v2 mix we could typically do make an atlet run all out for let's say a couple of minutes one to five minutes let's say three minutes to make it simple or we can have cyclist do a three minute or four five minute but something something short not too short but absolutely not too long but like typically four minutes is a pretty good

[00:42:14] SP exactly yes exactly this is again a very good proxy to understand or as a or as a surrogate to understand of course what is your view to Max as well but then what we have to understand as well that this is not necessarily what you need in in t the France you don't need to be the best four minute 4minute athlete this is more important for a track cyclist a track cyclist that has the working time for four hour for 4 minutes then VI 2 max becomes maybe the best predictor of per performance again so it's a little bit depending on context but because we already said now there is another limitation here as well and that is the maximum sustainable energy expenditure how much energy can you expand on different let's say intensities in order to increase let's say this the the speciality of what you're going to be good at so if you are going to be best in the world at riding 160 kilm and then sprinting towards the

[00:43:05] Finish Line over a couple of hundred meters you can even not argue that it's a Sprint even but let's say you are really going fast the last last kilometers the problem with this is that if you spend most of this that energy that you have available now to increase your your V2 Max you're spending obviously less time on specializing what you're really going to be good at and and you won't find a track cyclist that you can put into T to France and think that he will win T to France and you won't find a t to France Rider that you can put on a track and become the one kilometer or or one kilometer uh winner there obviously because they are specializing on two different two different durations so simply because we have a limitation for how much energy that we can turn around per day per week and so on sustainably because that's the key here sustainably it basically means also that we have to focus more on that exactly specificity that we're looking to excel in and then yes V2 Max will still be the best predictor but not necessarily having the highest number that is maybe the the the the the the diff or let's say the the the the

[00:44:14] Nuance the Nuance to it yeah and and let's let's stay with cycling um and even keep it simple and just talk about not include the track right which is you know far more far closer to an anerobic effort uh it it's sort of on the anerobic side of a peak aerobic effort but even if you think about let's go back to the the um the the distance of the 112 mile time trial that a triathlete is doing in an Iron Man right so for the most part I mean it's there's no sprinting in there he's not sprinting at the very end in fact he's probably trying to keep that relatively constant in effort to prepare himself or herself to do the the marathon run that's following um even in that system let's go back and talk about two athletes if there are two athletes that have the same V2 Max does power at V2 Max give you another layer of insight so if let's just say Christian and Gustaf each have a V2 Max of 80 millit per minute per kilogram but one of them is doing that at 450 watts and one of them is doing it at 425 watts does that give you a new piece of information or is it still limited because that's really only speaking to a 4minute 5 minute effort yes and no um that is of course where you can blackbox of course a little bit no we we we just talk purely about V2 Maxim focus on that but of course there will be a fairly good fairly good correlation also between oxygen consumption let's say at

[00:46:01] V2 Max because you you can argue that there's really no power at V2 Max because it like as long as you are above uh what we call V2 steady state so you you have a couple of different steady state situ scenarios you have typically one that a lot of people knows about which is the maximum laced steady state but then of course above there again you have something called V2 steady state and at the moment you start to exceed over V2 steady state then basically it's just a matter of duration before you will basically elicit V2 Max but obviously the lower the closer you state your V2 steady state the lower the power you will basically outputting if you put out a too high power obviously you won't be able to reach V to Max because you will basically start um you will you will start uh um you will not be able to contract your muscles e efficiently anymore and you won't be able to bring your ventilation or oxygen consumption up to a Max but there's a sweet spot there more or less where basically any power that sits between let's say uh V2 steady state and and and a higher let's say a higher power number will elicit V to Max it's just the amount of duration that is needed in order to get there so of course this adds let's say are um um uncertainty because you need to know this you need to know this I think it's important just so the listener understands that you can't necessarily just go out and then you people start talking about power at V2 Max and their

[00:47:25] V2 Max because then suddenly people will get confused because you don't you have to know also then what what was the duration of how did you get there and yeah yeah exactly yep y um so let actually maybe let's take a a quick aside because you and I are speaking about this with such a degree of familiarity I want to make sure the listener understands how you're measuring V2 Max in the lab this is a test that I believe every human being athlete and non-athlete should have done because everybody needs to know their number and everybody needs to know where they stack up against people their age and their sex because again it is one of the most important if not the most important modifiable metric we have to speak to both the length and quality of life so if I came into your lab tomorrow to have my V2 Max measured tell me what we would do so the good thing now of course is that also V2 Max is being or let's say metabolic measurements are being democratized as well there is for example we work very closely with a

[00:48:28] Canadian company called view to master that allows you basically to put now a mask so it's like you know the old age basically when you have these big computer towers and everything today we have iPhones and Androids that basically have computational power that exceeds millions of times even what the Apollo 11 Expedition has yes so the same thing is of course happening also to to the to the metabolic uh let's say to to metabolic analyzes as well from basically being these huge towers that were basically exclusive to labs to basically where it's now being democratized and you basically have like this port super portable analyzer just sitting on your face meshing your basic your oxygen uptake but to bring to the lab setting and what happens there is that you come into the laboratory setting uh I don't work so much with relative values but a lot of people will do so obviously we going to we're going to measure your weight so we get your weight there and as you just said you mentioned Christian or let's say an elite athlete you said 80 milliters per minute per kilogram so we have normalized this to to to kilogram that's why we need to measure your weight so now when you're running uh so what we do is that depending on what kind of modality that's important to you so let say it's is running for example what you'll do is that you get on a treadmill and basically there there's a couple of different let's say ways to do this where let's say the method is pretty much the same but it can be a little bit of a different gear some people will use something that we call mixing chamber system and some people will use what we call breath to breath systems but it would basically involve basically you having either a mouthpiece in your mouth where there sits a sits a um analyzer uh or not an analyzer but it'ss a turbine with a uh sample line from it so basically when you're exhaling in this mask there or to this mouthpiece we are measuring the flow uh or how much air you are breathing in and out per time as a function of uh yeah um yeah if it's a turbine then basically we correlate it to how many how many

[00:50:32] RPMs this turbine is spinning out so now we know whether you are breathing for example 50 l or 100 L 150 L per per per minute but then of course now we only measure your ventilation we don't know anything about your oxygen consumption yet we only know something about your ventilation so then what we also have to do is we need a sample line that's that sticks in there as well that basically collects now the concentration of oxygen and carbon dioxide as well so what we then do is that because we know that the ambient Ambient oxygen condition and ambient uh ambient uh Co CO2 conditions is basically let's say 20.9% oxygen and then 0.05% CO2 more or less speak yeah roughly speaking while you are now running and you're breathing you obviously breathing in a certain amount of oxygen into your lungs and then you're consuming some of no or or let's say air into your lungs which contains basically 20.9% oxygen when that comes into your lungs parts of that oxygen far from all of it actually only closer to 25% of that oxygen you are actually actually taking up in your lungs and it's being now transported through your body and you're exhaling actually 75% roughly speaking 75% oxygen you actually exhale out again now and then basically since we are measuring now the oxygen concentration with this device we can measure we know now the delta concentration that sits between how much what is oxygen concentration when it goes in how much is oxygen concentration that goes out and since we also measure the volume of air we know we can now extrapolate that and say okay this is the amount of oxygen you're actually extracting from the there and this is how we know your oxygen consumption so why is oxygen consumption important well this comes back to basically calry and calry actually is very often people think then immediately of nutrition and and foods and these kind of things but it's actually just a unit is actually just a unit a scientific unit actually for for knowing how much energy is needed to heat water from from from 14 to 15 degrees for example a certain amount of that and then how many how much calories is needed so we could even use gasoline for this but it basically comes back to the fire triangle you need something to combust you need oxygen and you need temperature and basically when we know when you combust there's a field now I'm getting really nerdy here but there's a field so there's a field in

[00:52:55] Biochemistry uh which is called or actually not only bioch yeah well biochemistry chemistry in general which is called stomry so in stomry there we can basically look at how much H so when we have like you mentioned initially in in the call as well you talk about hydrocarbons for example but let's say carbohydrate car carbon hydrogen and oxygen and then we know how many molecule or how many atoms there are of each of these in that molecule there and then basically when we want to convert this into atps for example then we are breaking this down so for example if you look at the glycolysis we are taking for example glucose which is C6 h206 and we are breaking that down into two uh two uh pids or basically C3 C3 H5 O3 but we got two of them now but in this process of releasing atps there at the same time what happens is also we are releasing hydrogen hydrogen ions and this is actually when you feel a burning sensation in your muscles this is actually it's not the lactate it's actually this that you are feeling in your muscles la is actually a super fuel it's it's a if the muscles get access to both lactate and and and glucose it will actually use lactate as a preferred

[00:54:05] Source before even glucose but then basically because C3 h503 basically lacks one hydrogen molecule now as long as you have an excess of this then basically you're able to bind back that hydrogen molecule in there and you get C3 H6 O3 which is laced molecule we got two of them so you split one glucose molecules effectively now down to two laced molecules so this so but then basically when you're looking now when you're looking now at the the energy yield here basically we know that when you burn when you convert basically let's say from glucose to to lactive for example there is a certain amount of energy or jewels that is released in this process we can even say okay let's forget about even atps and make it even a little bit simplier what is the potential jewels that sits in a glucose molecule and then when we split this glucose molecule how many Jews are releasing in this process and basically because it says C3 or basically C6 h126 we know there are six oxygen molecules there and now we can actually calculate or we can know actually from your oxygen consumption because that's o2 molecules going in and then there comes out CO2 molecules or both o2 molecules but also

[00:55:16] CO2 molecules but what we can know now is that we can know exactly because we can use stomry and we can basically calculate how many how much Jewels has been now released in this process and that ties back to V2 Max the more oxygen you are capable of turning around per time the more calories or let's say the more fats proteins carbohydrates you are able to break down and release energy that you can use for forward propulsion in the process and that's why V2 measurements is is a Holy Grail metric because it's we can always talk about direct calry but that's so let's say call it intrusive into a process and so little um it's practical to do so indirect calry measured with V2 Max or V2 and V2 Max is is a superior method to understand how much energy are you able to release in this process and also then just to come back a little bit to your field as well medicine if you have a low view to Max it basically means also at the moment you start to have stress in your life you have infections in your lives anything like this you are utilizing a much higher percentage of that ability to to to to because to get healthy as well you need energy to get healthy as well in as well to to to yeah do whatever transporting blood around in your body or whatever so so basically an athlete that has a huge view to Max that become sick they will there's a fractional change basically or or or a relatively small change of their capacity or Reserve that is you or let's say utilized now in this process that so at the moment they release basically their training or they they they they they reduce the training volume they get a huge excess of energy or or ability to recover now U and if you quick enough to do it you won't almost get any effect or or or or um increase in infection at all because the body gets so much energy exess to help aid in the recovery process now compared to a person which has a solo V to Max that even walking up the stairs start to to to to bring them to a level where they are even yeah trying to C I think that's such a great point and I and I don't think people fully appreciate what a physiologic stress significant illness is so you know again I I won't bore people with all of the details but if you go and do the chemistry on what it takes to raise the body's temperature from 98

[00:57:48] Fahrenheit to 103 Fahrenheit that is an enormous energy cost when you you know when we look at cardiac patients when we look at any patients in the ICU and you look at the change in cardiac output that might be required to support um a systemic inflammatory response syndrome it it is profound so um I think this is

[00:58:11] AB absolutely spot-on and it really comes down to just having more Reserve I want to ask you um several questions let me try to take them in order first um you mentioned that you prefer to look at V2 Max in absolute terms so uh you know I'm guessing that you know so how much does does Christian and gustaff weigh those guys probably weigh 75 kilos so the funny thing is that uh leading into the Olympics one of the things we actually looked even at is basically what happens because we have tried to reduce the weight very conservatively by global standards even in sports to to reduce the weight because we had already ingrained in our heads from basically a past and other people saying that well uh you need to bring up your relative to

[00:58:56] Max you need to and and and and that is done very simply by reducing the weight yeah the interesting thing was we found after we had done this a couple of times and a little bit by accident because we do so much measurements is that we saw saw actually that well the relative you Max that didn't come up and the absolute

[00:59:12] D2 Max came down even more than the weight came down and these were these were they they in other words so let's just make sure people understand exactly what you said it's very important um and we should use some numbers so people understand so I'm making this up but if they weigh 80 kilg and are putting out 6 lers or their their maximal oxygen consumption is 6 lers you take 6 lers or 6,000 milliliters divided by 80 and you're going to get a big number and you're saying well gosh I mean the tried and true method here is we have to lower that body weight why don't we take that body weight from 80 kilos to 75 kilos and now 6,000 ided 75 is a much bigger number all things equal were much better the problem is it's not all things equal because that 6,000 milliliters of oxygen might have come down to 5500 milliliters per oxygen and now that ratio has actually gone down exactly so both absolute have gone down and also relative have actually gone down which is a little bit a little bit of uh I think um shocking uh because most people this is you can imagine we of course have a lot of theories of why one why this is happening but also why do people still cling to the idea of reducing so you come up to a certain level so you let's say that you were you you had hundreds of athletes to your program suddenly comes this really good like this guy that just responds or girl that just responds to to your training he goes to junior level starts to win senior level starts to win starts to go to the Championships and what whatever but now you're starting to really like have to fight fight for for for the suppos okay what do you do okay my training program is perfect that's that's something that's very easy to sometimes think or you're afraid of making changes to the program because you don't necessarily understand exactly why you got there but we have got ingrained with that okay fine let's reduce the weight now because that would be the next step now because we are not able to make you more powerful so let's start now to reduce your weight there are two things happening now or one thing is of course the things we have observed the V2 V2 Max starts to come down absolute and relative value starts to come down and sorry well does that happen because you're unable to control where you're taking the weight off so for example are you losing disproportionately lower body muscle mass which is I think disproportionately contributing to V2 Max relative to upper body no I don't I unfortunately it is more complicated than that because it is without even losing muscle mass so it is related then to Basil energy expenditure if your total body mass is coming down your basil energy expenditure is coming down that is probably altering fundamental metabolic pathways at rest that must be translating to what's happening under stress most probably yes because there this is of course something we I haven't had enough time to dive into because at the one side I'm looking more to drive performance so we sometimes there are there are some findings that we really want to understand better but we have to say okay that's going to happen in the next life or Next Period or whatever I mean an interesting experiment to do here sorry to interrupt would be to actually use doubly labeled water under the weight reduced setting compared to the previous setting obviously you could do indirect calorimetry during rest you wouldn't be able to get total energy expenditure which is what you want um and see if that drop proportionately corresponds to the drop you saw in V2

[01:02:54] Max Absolut yeah so so this is also something because you can think of it that maybe this is just a temporary phase so maybe this is just a temporary phase before before you stabilize the weight and then at some point it will start to come up again as well but it doesn't either so that's a little bit of thing here also we can we can Venture a little bit into double label water because we spent a fortune on doing several double label water per or blocks and this is it's it's a it's a nice method but it also has several pitfalls so actually what we have started to do much more of lately is exactly doing resting metabolic race so again having the portable metabolic analyzer like the V2 Master it allows is basically we do measurements before dinner we do it after dinner just to look at the the thermic effect of foods for example we do it after training to see basically what happens there and we even see that it even sometimes dips below normal normal resting levels for example even we can only theorize on why that is happening but the thing is that there's a couple of mechanism that we just need to control and we need to become even better at it but back to back to a little bit to V to Max and so why do I work on on absolute values versus relative values one of the things that we do see is that first of all

[01:04:08] Christian gusta now they they weigh 70 73 74 for Gustav and 80 kilogram for for Christian and he's 175 tall so you would almost say that hey he's stocky right 175 CM at 80 kilos he looks like a muscular guy he's not a he's not a bean P yeah exactly but you'll also see that he actually a little bit of extra fat on his body compared to what you would expect to have from an but we we we can't look at it that way because I'm not looking to build aesthetic machines performance velocity matters exactly exactly and there basically again when you when you make things relative because if you look at a power number uh so you can have two guys two guys for example that has let's say 5 watts per kilogram that over a certain they're producing five per kilogram over a certain distance but one of the guys is just moving much faster everything equal so aerodynamics would be equal everything like this but the problem is only that the raw power from a bigger guy that has 5 WS per kilogram is much higher power output which basically then with if aerodynamics are the same he will move much faster for this and this goes the same also with with V2 Max as well if you look at relative values okay that's nice to have an idea of what kind of level people are at but if you just want to look now purely at propulsion then basically you have to look at it in absolute terms instead because most of the racing that is being done today is not very hilly there are very few sports that are very hilly and of course if it starts to become very hilly then of course then you can start to say okay fine now relative values will maybe give you a better predictor of the performance than necessarily that absolute values would give um yeah so that's that's the that's the main reason that's very interesting so so um again a couple of things one is yeah in cycling especially in the tour to France you know I've heard it stated and the data for this are a bit confounded because they were based on the two decades of cycling when EO was widely used every single top cyclist was using EPO but that said I think that still normalizes it and makes it clear and basically you could look at predictions of who would win the Tour absent a strategic blunder or an accident and it was all predicated by functional threshold power in watts per kilo so if you could know how many watts a cyclist could hold for 60 minutes divided by their weight you could and you line those up in descending order all things equal that was going to be your Championship finish and of course it's never exactly equal because as I said you can make a strategic blunder there can be an accident lots of things can happen but I suppose that that doesn't surprise you given the vertical nature of the tour to France it is mostly one in vertical distance not horizontal distance exactly just to add to that also I think one problem there is a little bit when you talk about 60-minute power so you take 60 Minute power and you divide it by kilograms to make it relative I think that then you are starting to get a fairly robust metric for it the problem very often is that people use much shorter dur durations they use 8 Minute power 10 minute power and it's very different Y and then and then and then the problem if you now extrapolate that and you still call that functional tral power for example and you divide it by your weight what you don't know when you're looking at it this way is how much does how much of energy comes from oxidative phosphorization and how much come from the glycolysis for example and the shorter the duration is and you're extrapolating that up to a larger value the more dangerous it is metabolically yeah let's let's actually make sure people understand why if you're doing this analysis based on 5 minutes to your point what if during that 5 minutes 80% of the energy was glycolytic which is producing a lot of lactate and we've just described and we're going to come back to lactate lactate is great it's the hydrogen that comes with it that's going to paralyze you and so you're 80% of that energy source you will not be able to do that for 90 minutes or 60 minutes but if you push the test out to 60 Minutes you can't fake it basically you will not be able to do an 80% glycolytic effort for 60 minutes exactly so there there it becomes a really good predictor but that's what I also like when people talk about okay my 60-minute power this is my 60-minute power that's extremely precise way of describing your capabilities because then you at least you have a single point or you have two points you have a power and you have a duration that you're capable of holding in and that gives you already a fairly good idea of the level of the athlete of course if you start to have two data points now so of course now maybe there are you you ask them also what's but well what's your 5 minute's your 30 minute or yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 5 minute power for example because then you're already starting to get a slope as well so you can start to even understand a little bit what kind of characteristic that is behind this this athlete so typically a sprinter will have a higher ratio between 5 minute and 60 Minute power while a TT specialist will typically have a lower ratio between the 5 minute power and 60 Minute power obviously back a little bit to the maximum maximum sustainable energy expenditure and V2

[01:09:18] Max why it's not necessarily a good predictor always of performance when you look at these long or these endurance events uh simply because uh specif specificity becomes so important there as well but this is again yes I agree when you talk about 60-minute power and you and you and you divide it by kilogram and you're using that to compare it across atlet in two the fronts then it starts to become a at least a pretty good a pretty good metric to understand or at least if I'm going to bet my money uh it's it's it's a safer bet where you would go with the money looking at a higher number yeah when you when you go back to again because the data are most available when you actually go now and talk to cyclists like Lance Armstrong and Yan o rich and these guys and and you you they'll tell you I mean again I think today cyclists are very guarded of those data um but but back in the Heyday of oxygenated uh performance-enhancing drugs these guys were able to put out 6 and 12 watts per kilo for 60 minutes and I I I think today people believe that they're only able only right they're able to do 52 watts per kilo for 60 minutes so that's giving you a relative sense of the difference um on and off these agents I want to come back to another thing you said twice now you've alluded to less technical more portable indirect calorimetry devices than what I'm used to in the lab if I'm doing a v2x test now I was under the impression and I'd love to be corrected here that these portable devices are probably decent for measuring V2 I.E the consumption of oxygen but their accuracy is sorely lacking for measuring vco2 the production of carbon dioxide and therefore it might be a good tool for estimating V2 Max but it's not a great tool for estimating total energy expenditure which is calculated by using

[01:11:24] V2 and V CO2 and nor is it a great tool for measuring uh fat oxidation because there you must be able to look at a very accurate ratio of vco2 and V2 so are there devices out there that we could be buying that you know we could be testing ourselves on every month at home that would meet the criteria of being accurate enough in those domains yes so uh one I think the the accuracy of the devices are starting to become uh fairly good we do very often back-to-back testing between the devices of course in the laboratory setting we are using mixing chamber system which is of course is is validated against many different methods which system do you use in your lab so I am actually sticking still to a old system uh I'm which one parvo no no actually no not not a Paro I'm actually using an yagger oxyon Pro with a mixing chamber system okay um but I also really like the AEI moxes as well uh simply because it has uh some Superior

[01:12:33] Technologies uh in it compared to most of the other devices on the on the market most of the devices on the market we're not going to go into this but they're using uh most of them are using galvanic fuel cells uh to measure uh oxygen and then use infrared sensors to measure the the CO2 but one of the things that the the for example the AI moxis is doing is that it actually measures it us a sironia cell instead and sironia cell is actually one of the most sensitive cells that we have and it's you can't use for example if you want to look at the photosynthesis for example you can't use a galvanic fuel cell because it's not act or it's not sensitive enough while a c Coral cell is sensitive enough but nevertheless the same technology now sits in the portable devices so it's it's still using also the portable devices now are using galvanic fuel cells uh and we of course I mentioned the V2 master one of the benefits we have had is that we enter into a partnership with them to to advance the technology several years back I did a screening on the market of all kinds of different metabolic or portable metabolic devices what I am in need of is that I need to find a compromise it doesn't help me necessarily to find a device that is little bit more accurate than for example than the V2 Master for example if the atst doesn't want to use it because it has a rock sack and it has a lot of procedures it is's a horrible user interface and all this kind of then you then basically I bought a super nice device I'm able to get at least to measure it one or twice time but that's not where the strength of data come the strength of data comes exactly from what you say you need to measure regularly all the time there and it has to be done in a way that the atlete doesn't feel it as intrusive or invasive into their lives so tell tell me tell me a little bit about the V2 Master because I'm aware of some of the other portable devices but not this one so obviously the Hallmark of this is you're you're going to be plugging the nose you've got a mask that creates a perfect seal and therefore very clearly at a minimum can measure the air flow rate in and out correct yeah so so the thing is actually you don't need to plug your nose it actually uses a hand Rudolph mask so most in most Labs you'll very often see at least they using this blue masks more or less okay so actually so so the cool thing is that what what they did is they actually designed a device the sits actually mounts on this uh H Rudolph mask that is around in the labs and then basically what it does is the same same as you do with a metabolic C that sits in the Laboratories it has the G galvanic fuel cells because this is B made made by maybe there are five manufacturers of G of galvanic fuel cells in the world and uh basically everybody purchases from more or less these five different manufacturers there so it's the same galvanic fuel cells that sits in the view to master and then basically the main differences between this device is that they are removed the turbine and they're using the same way of measuring flow that you do in Formula

[01:15:22] One in Aerospace so they use differential pressure instead to to quantify the flow of what you're doing so basically this is a device that just sits here it's a headgear there's no wires there no nothing it's basically connects to your phone watch whatever that you have and then basically this is how you now collect your oxygen consumption so I could go out for a bike ride if I'm going to go and do V2 Max intervals and hill repeats my favorite workout is the four to five minute Hill repeat I could be wearing this thing and that's it and I come home and it's going to say if I did 10 sets it's going to tell me Peak oxygen consumption for each set you can even connect it to your garment computer you go into your garment account and you can see it there all the view so you can see your breathing frequency title volume you can see your fraction of expired O2 your V2 all the values basically combined there in the same together with your power with your velocity with your position everything there like in one place you don't need to look at one like a separate report for your V2 numbers and then basically looking at your garment numbers basically they are overlay so it's going to show me heart rate versus power versus V2 at every moment in time exactly and how accurately is it measuring V2 relative to what you can do in the lab and how about vco2 so vco2 is of course some some that's a place where we have been very fortunate because we are a little bit ahead of the curve there so we have had their device that has CO2 now for this must be soon two years I think the V2 master also does vco2 yeah in the Prototype this is probably going to be released to the market sometimes during next year then basically the whole Market will have access to it I see so so we so we also have the CO2 uh CO2 uh capabilities as well um but yes basically you can go out how it Compares with basically a metabolic card I think here there are two things to keep in mind one is of course that measure of V2 is a measure

[01:17:21] V2 so obviously they should on one side be the same but one thing Al we know that between different devices so the oxyon oxyon uh Pro for example we have the option to basically use it as a breath to breath device or we can use it as a mixing chamber device if you use this a breath to breath device then basically you're breathing straight through the turbine that's it so there's minimal resistance then of course on the other side we can use the mixing chamber system and then you have a 2.7 met long host now and I come if you want to know

[01:17:48] I can come back wise 2.7 M later on but anyway it's connected to a mixing chamber and then basically what happens here is that the the the breathing resistance now goes up a little bit and as we know also breathing is not free either your lungs in order to breathe they also need energy they need atps to contract and b or basically breathe simple as that and basically the more resistance there is to the breathing the higher the oxygen consumption obviously will be so you will actually see now for the exact same device the exact same sensor but just depending on the method they're using that there will be differences between the two machines there simple as that further when you go out and you actually do liking one thing that is important to keep in mind there is that you are creating a very high headwind most likely when you are going fast of course you can go in a hill or these kind of things and you bring down the velocity a big or to very low velocities but you put out big Power there but what we have to remember is that any system that is based on measuring flow and you now have an interference from basic flow reaching or or hitting the turbine hitting the V2 master or any metabolic device there will will most likely also start to influence a little bit the numbers there because we have to remember also that we are not really measuring uh really measuring the flow and we are not really measuring the total oxygen consumption we are infering it based on methods that are basically saying that when you are basically we see that the turbine is rotating at this uh these many RPMs per minute for example then basically we know that that correlates to a certain so there will always be a little bit of uncertainties and that's why for example when you're in lab setting where basically you have no headwind you have very controlled conditions and all these kind of things the ability to get a higher accuracy will always be higher than it is out in the field but then we know that what you do in the laboratory is still quite far from what you do out in the field because you're already starting to limit the way that you're are moving the cooling yes maybe you have a fan this but cooling will be different there are a lot of things that already are different there so the question is always do you want accuracy of what really you are looking at or do you are just looking at oxygen consumption and then you create an artificial setting which is not necessarily representable for what you're doing so it is a little bit of a give and take where basically yes you give a little bit in one place you lose maybe a little bit of let's say absolute accuracy from the device because you're introducing some more unknown variables there but at the same time you're looking at it now in real life conditions where you want to see okay what is it looking like here and you get that accuracy in there but on the compromise of Absolut let's say measurement and how much of a difference are you seeing in one of your athletes between what you're doing gold standard on an ergometer in a lab versus if you put the mask on them and you make them go and do 4minute hill repeats where the velocity is not that high but they're probably still going you know 18 to 20 M an hour up a hill pushing a massive gear to hit that V2 Max how much of a difference are you seeing in the V2 and the vco2 between the two devices so between between the lab and the portable the VO2 master so so again H then there typically when we do backtack testing there between the two devices we would see normally for Christian and

[01:21:14] Gustav ER let's say difference of maybe 50 milliliters between the two between the two devices that's it yeah yeah this that's nothing yeah exactly I thought I thought you were going to say 500 milliliters no D we you just T the device out the window then it has no value anymore no no that that that that wouldn't be acceptable okay okay so but 50 millimeters 50 milliliters of of oxygen and your your guys are putting out probably you guys have an absolute of probably six liters seven seven liters oh my God so yeah yeah so so this is this is not even this is understandably it makes a difference at their level but for someone at my level and for most of the people listening here a 50ml difference is it is nothing it's less than nothing yeah so that so these things are really this is this is so exciting to me because I was under the impression that these devices were still so far away that they were not even worth uh entertaining the use of no so one thing that of course you also start which is a little bit interesting there obviously because we use mixing chamber system that's where we come from the whole let's yeah yeah you you you'll ask the question if you think it's interesting to to to to your listeners whether they want to understand why there are mixing chamber systems and so on and so but to spare them for that for now basically what we do know is that when you have a mixing chamber system ex it's just because you have a little bit the higher resistance in a system like that typically we see also more stable breathing pattern just because they're actually be they are being reminded more about exactly how they're breeding because they feel a little bit more the resistance what you do see is as a system gets less resistance you naturally also start to see a little bit of more variation going up and down and these kind of things because even though if you look at a power meter people that are not used to ride with a power meter they only used to use heart rate and you give them suddenly a power meter the first time they get a power meter they they they they they don't understand because power goes all over the place there because they're not used to to focus on a power and it becomes almost like they're chasing a number that is almost they don't have they don't have the coordination or the skills to basically keep it and then basically find or relax around that very stable power and how to basically read it breathing is even worse breathing is even worse than power because now you're even one one order further away from performance so velocity obviously is the like the first PR first principle first order that's where exactly the performance happened power you're one step further away and this is of course a system is very responsive as well to what you do you won't necessarily see like if you suddenly get a spike you let's say you're riding 200 Watts if you went to 210 wats per second and back down to 190 to 200 wat your speed wouldn't change at all your velocity would be the same more or less but still you have the volatility there so if you now are using velocity as the gge for whether system is correct or not you always say hey this cannot be correct I went to 210 wats it should be IM immediately giving me this but again the sensitivity to Velocity how the velocity is measured is not good enough necessarily to capture the small changes that are happening intracyclic in the power production there in between there it's being smoothed out because of inertia measurement uh weaknesses and so on this gets even worse when you get to

[01:24:47] Velocity because what we know is the body exactly because of all you mean when we when we get to ventilation yeah ventil yeah yeah ventilation yeah so yeah that's good good a good clarification because exactly we are meshing on the exhaust even here and between basically we where we are doing work and basically when we are breathing in and we are exhaling out again there are so many compensating regulatory mechanism in the body that are compensating for the lack in one place and here act back and forth all the time more or less to make sure that we deliver energy as efficiently as possible to sustain that propulsion that we're doing and now when you are measuring the two here you can have a quite a bit of fluctuation in this and there are there are let's say kinetics involved here so for example one thing that people to to to give an example if you are running at let's say you're running 15 kilm per hour and you have a certain oxygen oxygen consumption now at 15 15 so I'm just making up a number let's say that you are or to use power you're riding at you're riding at a constant power to make a simple constant power of 300 watts and you're consuming now 4 half liter of oxygen if you you can still output you can still output that those did I say 300 wats yeah 300 wats you can still output those 300 watts there but if you hold your breath now what happens V2 comes down ventilation comes down or title volume and breathing frequency comes down but you start to feel that something builds up in your body you're still able to

[01:26:17] Output those 300 watts there at the moment you start at some point you either are forced now to stop or you have to start breathing in you're forced to start breathing again and at the moment you start breathing again now you have a huge depth in your body and what will happen is that basically you get a huge spike in ventilation huge spike in

[01:26:33] V2 but what you also see is that when you break this down is that obviously your the big spike comes from both that you're driving a much larger tile volume reading frequency goes up a lot but also your fraction of expired O2 so the Delta between how much of the oxygen you consuming now you are going much deeper than the 25% we said initially but then basically because there are things are not reacting extremely quickly on the exhaust part here you'll see basically that here is almost like a regul like a pad regulator that are trying to bring this back to that stable settings there and it happens okay yes your breathing comes down again but still maybe you have a high V2 and then suddenly V2 unders shoots a little bit because fraction of expire O2 comes up a little bit higher but then says oh this is not enough this is this is too little oxygen

[01:27:17] I need to increase extraction a little bit again before it comes back again and this just tells to basic that yes 300 w there but you can still have a lot of variations there just by the fact that you're sitting on the bike and you're sipping that bottle there you're holding your breath when you're sipping that bottle there that will already influence your breathing and your V2 for the next half minute on there if you are swallowing just the fact that if you start to have a lot of spit for example in your mouth and you're swallowing there you are building a miniature debt there now that you have to pay or again afterwards there so again there what we have to what one have to be careful about there I don't like standris and say you can't drink you can't swallow you can't do you have to be a machine because that's not who we are we have to look learn to look past the noise of the data by collecting a lot of data and knowing exactly what people we we are we are we are not machines well you could maybe say that we are machines as well but but there are so many things happening in between here that you can't necessarily exactly like you also say well we're much more complicated machines right I mean we tal you know you've alluded to F1 twice now that happens to be my favorite sport and as much as we can look at those cars and say they are the most remarkably engineered things with wheels that have ever been produced right everything from the engines that they build these hybrid internal combustion engines uh through the chassis and the aerodynamics again most people are shocked to learn that the aerodynamics of that car are such that it can drive upside down at 100 kph um all all of those things are remarkable I still think we're far more complex I mean hands down right because every element of that car can be modeled there is an equation that explains every piece of it whereas there is no equation to explain what you just described and by the way it's there's there's an element of Chaos in that system um one one thing that I'll I'll suggest listeners try if they have power meters and it's just a it's just a a great example of what you said so if you have a heart rate monitor and a power meter next time you're on your bike make a deliberate effort to change your ventilatory rate so vent a lot and vent a little and watch what the heart rate does even as you hold the power constant and of course this is because that CO2 is very soluble and CO2 is tracked by the brain very closely as a proxy for pH and the body is is very particular about keeping the pH at 7.4 and so as you're as you slow down your ventilation rate and hold your breath and your carbon dioxide levels rise and your pH Falls you will see that heart rate start to spike with no additional input in power output and of course the reverse is true and it's just a great example of what you said but it's one where you can sort of be the guinea pig and watch it uh and it's it's just you know I I still to this day get a kick out of playing that game to see how much I can move my heart rate just by interfering with my ventilatory rate but I can say that I think that that's also why some people become better also and others not because I think that one thing that we very often tend to lose as we get older or we go through for example different training is that we lose that ability to play and exactly going out and playing is one of the best ways to learn actually what influences and increase our awareness of that because one of the things is that I I

[01:30:57] I've I've learned um with also with Elites is that Elites are not necessarily um perfectly calibrated either they need to actually be calibrated because we have some athletes that typically if you ask them to go out and do call it a threshold workout or let's say a workout that has let's say intervals a combined duration of intervals that that are between 60 to 80 minutes and that should be fairly close to all out or let's say to to bring you to exhaustion on the the last interval you'll see that some athletes Elite athletes they um they are ending up going out too hard and they end up dropping the power towards the end some atast they go out a little bit too too light and they have to go really hard towards the end to bring it up there but both scenarios if you were able to keep it at a very calibrated or accurate level there you would see that the total amount of kilo ju you were able to accumulate on those 80 minutes or 60 or 80 minutes or whatever the length there would be would be higher than if you ended up going Progressive or worst case you end up ending up going regressive because you go too hard in the beginning and for to come down towards the end there but um what standard do you use by the way so let's let's use that as a quick example so um again I said I'll use myself because I'm trying to get as much free coaching as I can here so if I love doing my V2 Max sets on a bike on a hill and uh I have a fixed disc that I ride so it really depends on the Wind so if I have a head wind it'll take about 5 minutes um and if I have a Tailwind it could take you know 345 that's how much the wind can play a role on this hill um but basically it's not an allout effort because you want to be able to do it multiple times but it's a very hard effort followed by about a one:1 ratio of recovery and that's the workout after a warm-up it's over and over and over and over again and it's like an hour of doing that now I typically and I think this is because I've become softer in my old age I typically Ascend in power so I will typically start out at a very conservative power where at the very end

[01:33:12] I am not dead but by The End by the last one I might be doing 10% more power than on the first set and I'm absolutely at my limit what would you how would you recommend I change that would you recommend like yeah you you want that to be within 5% the whole way through or or how would you recommend that if if again the goal is maximizing that workout to maximize V2 Max and to increase the engine size yeah to maybe we should add one more Dimension to this now because I think that very often we confuse for example also when we talk about FTP just

[01:33:56] FTP and we blackbox a metric as FTP instead of saying 60 Minute power or 20 minute power whatever was really accurate with the 20 when you say 20 minute power 60-minute power you basically know that okay you can hold that power for that duration that's the maximum for example before you basically end up dropping too much and you just call it call it D very often when we talk about V2 Max is very often confused with aerobic capacity while in reality it's not it's aerobic power so basically you're measuring there you're measuring how much oxygen for for let's say for a undefined time yes we have normalizes as milliliters per minute but you can have a big range between atlet that has the same view to me some can do that for several minutes some can only do that for let's say one minute for example so now when you and and this is where the important is because we're looking for to provide signal signaling and or stimulus to the body if you go out and you do one five minute interval more or less then basically okay fine that's the stimulus that you are providing yourself there so this is about how okay you got a certain amount of time available to go out and do that V to Max session today for example let's say that's 90 minutes then basically of course now I'm now this is onedimensional because I'm not we of course we're not talking only about a single single uh workout as well

[01:35:11] I think the most undervalued thing which is not very sexy to talk about and also the most undervalued thing is that basically is consistency consistency in the training over time and that means that you need to leave a little bit in reserve there and we haven't even touched on the topic of psychology yet either because we are very much not talking about the things in physiology that we are good at measuring and these kind of things but there are also plenty of things that we are not able to measure and even the things that we like to say that we oh we are so good in stomry or are so good in understanding metabolic pathways or signaling Pathways there still things added to this where we basically understand that no we don't and then we haven't even dive into the topic of microbiome or basically how basically we are yeah it's it's a world undiscovered world that we are basically taking on now so one one of the things that is that when you're doing this exercise then I think that uh but the good thing with V2 is that of course that we're measuring a quantity we're measuring a volume of something it's much in the same way when we when we talk about power versus work so you talk about work for example So when you say to so to make this a little bit more practical So when you say that okay I want to basically do my V2 max workouts

[01:36:19] I go I go a little bit Progressive I would normally say that's a good that's a good thing to do okay because also what happens is there is a priming effect also happening in the body as well so if you go out like where you think that you maybe would be able to sustain throughout the workout you might figure out that you still are able to go a little bit higher at some point it's the opposite but we one thing that we have done multiple times over the last half decade is is that very often people think that okay when I done a VI to Max effort then basically I'm done I won't be able to repeat that I need uh two days of rest or maybe a week of rest or whatever before I can do that that's not true either we know that for example if you do a view to Max effort and then basically you give an adequate time of rest in between there you are able to go even harder on the next one now even though that was completely to exhaustion on the first one completely let say more about that so get put some time and numbers to it so I can understand what you're saying so you could take one of your athletes and what duration of an interval would you have them push to though for example here let's say that we using us old-fashioned way of quantifying V tox you just say that you do a graded exercise test so you increase the power by uh 5% for example every minute that goes there until you basically come to exhaustion yes so let's say that let's say that now that theit finishes around 500 watts and around 7 liters of oxygen and for for for The Listener that's a world those are worldclass numbers that are obscene like that's that's there's no there's you're not running into people on this street that can do that but carry on yeah and here already I haven't told what's happening before there as well because if I only took them fresh doing this then the power number would be different so again this comes back a little bit to talking about power at V2

[01:38:06] Max where this is already manipulated depending on what you've done before this as well so now basically they they do this so let's say that they last for six minutes and then they finish the last one on let's say 500 watts 500 last minute on 500 watts maybe they go a couple of seconds longer into the next one and this is also important so when you do a greater exercise test if you come to the next step now and you feel that oh this is too hard push as long as you can because every second counter because it's more work it's more work it's more oxygen consumed there strongest stimulus more or less I wouldn't advise doing this very often but we can come back to that a little bit later because I'm not a big fan of doing very often like two exhaustion workouts that you should put them in very sparingly into your program and that ties back to consistency but anyways now given in between let's say you if we give 10 minutes of rest in between now a little bit more rest in between there then basically if you do now a new V to Max you'll bring the athlete up to the same athlete we bring now to more than 7 lit so 7.1 or maybe even a little bit little bit higher and power output is also now for example comes up now maybe one more minute at one one higher powerp so now we are already at maybe 525 Watts for one minute as well and you're saying that that's happening because they've been primed by the first set to be able to do that with only 10 minutes of rest with only if it goes too long rest in between there then basically you start to lose the effect so if the if if if the duration of the rest in between there then you you are not able to draw the effect of that anymore that can be I think you could probably extend it up to 15 or maybe 20 minutes but when you get past 20 minutes then I would be a little bit I'm not so sure whether that would hold true anymore so it needs to be short and this can also come back to Big because we know also that oxygen how when we when we think about hemog hemoglobin as well the Affinity of oxygen and CO2 to the hemoglobin is also affected by the temperature of the blood or the body and and and the hemoglobin as well so this is also improving actually with a higher temperature than it is at a cola so when you get 20 minutes obviously temperature of your body will also come further down come longer down than it is at 10 minutes 10 minutes it will also come down but maybe not as much but the most interesting thing that happens also now is the r value is heavily skewed towards oxygen consumption and less carbon dioxide production you would even when you do did when when you do this you would even say that this this doesn't qualify for a

[01:40:40] V2 Maxes so the V2 so the V2 numbers now are equally high or higher but the carbon dioxide production is actually now just maybe a little bit higher than one in ourr value and normally we would say that if if you just went went by the papers or the old school books you would say that okay in order for qualify V2

[01:40:58] Max that you should for example like one of the criteria is often they say that you need to exceed an R value of 1.1 for example for it to be valid of course what what what you going to say the vi to Max Val value was higher are we not going to disqualified it was a higher oxygen consumption than it was on the previous one it's also equally more can you let's let's explain this to people because I I I we you and I already alluded to this very briefly but I we didn't make a big point of it so the re is calculated instantaneously at any moment in time as the ratio of vco2 to

[01:41:29] V2 so um let's go back to um you're you're going to put one of your athletes on the bike and he starts riding really slowly in that moment what is his he's at 100 Watts so he's he's he's not even breaking a sweat what is his re at that moment one more time which which which power 100 Watts he's just starting out the thing is that this is actually a little bit little little bit funny because here it's very easy when we look at the values when you look at R we typically look at at a ratio of concentration and we and we now already extrude a little bit of volume o of oxygen and volume of CO2 that is there and of course there's there's a requirement for a certain amount of energy to be turned around per time that's why for example if you look at lactate as let's say as an IND or as a or as a surrogate because we can again if you go back all the way to stomry and it said we already said C6 h12 06 glucose broken down to lactate and these kind of things we already know here how much CO2 that is being produced in this process there at certain ratios but since we also know the ratio between glucose and laced as well we can use that also as surrogate to have more or less the same confirmations as well or the same indications as well the difference is only at vco2 is a volumetric measurement while La is a concentration metric and concentration metrics are influenced by many other factors as well so that's why lactate can be a little bit more predictable and it's not as a good indicator as vco2 is but uh but coming back to that basically at 100 typically there you won't you won't see necessarily a very good ratio between V2 and vco2 so RR value that can actually be quite High because two things that are playing into counter your resting metabolic rate already plays a much bigger factor or a relatively larger percent of the total oxygen consumption and a carbon dioxide production now as opposed to when you start to go to higher number so the higher the number are the the smaller the percentage of the resting because when we measure V2 and vco2 we measure actually the gross oxygen and gross CO2 product we're not measuring only oxygen as a function of exercise but actually of both exercise yes and basil resing okay so now this of course is going to be heavily influenced by their diet and the carbohydrate content of their diet but I'm assuming your athletes are on a pretty high carbohydrate diet so that means yeah so that means that they're resting AR R is probably 085 to 0.9 or higher okay so that means that they get a nater in their reer when energy expenditure gets high enough that it starts to dwarf basil energy expenditure and you're really achieving maximal fat oxidation which is probably occurring at I don't know about 7 75 at a wattage that probably corresponds to 75 or 80% of their best 1hour power I'm I'm guessing that in in and about that wattage they are at maximum fat oxidation and they probably are at minimum

[01:44:39] R so actually it's even higher for endurance athletes or especially triathletes or long course triathletes because this comes back also a little bit to now we are getting a little bit deeper into it but this also comes back to why it's not necessarily V to Max a good predict of performance especially the longer the events becomes so for example to let people in on a little bit of a let's call it a secret sauce yeah yes no not Secret Sauce but secret uh and and that is that uh actually for

[01:45:07] Christian and gusta to win the World Championships in uh so uh in 20 so last year basically we had a consequence of the specialization we did V2 Max came down significantly so for from them from from them basically racing the Olympics clocking in so using relative values which is maybe a little bit more easier to relate to both of both of Christian both Christian and gusta would typically test in around let's say close to 90 milliliters per minute per kilogram but at but at Iran in order to set new records in Iran we had to bring it down to actually below 80 millit per per kilogram and you did this purely because of energy demand and energy consumption and purely because you can't sustain you can't because think of it more like a a curve more or less where you you have a curve you had you had you had to Dune the engine basically you had to bring the fuel flow rate and oxygen flow rate in the engine down to do lemon versus do a Formula One race exactly and and and and that that basically because you can't now prioritize keeping doing those five minute power surges or or micro intervals anymore because it's too far away from basically what you need in an Iron Man and you need to build more let's say towards the higher energy demands or let say higher power puts in an Iron Man the lower ones or the sustainable ones and so on and maybe even building a little bit longer as well so you basically don't have the time anymore or basically that's not right you have the time but you actually are not able to consume enough energy over weeks and months to sustain a program that allows you to both increase your V2 Max at the same time as you are building up that long duration power out let say a 4our power as well I think what would be interesting for for folks to understand is so so there's something called the wick equation which tells us the relationship between energy consumed and oxygen consumed in CO2 produced and

[01:47:19] I I don't I Used to Know It Off by heart but I think it's basically energy expenditure is 3.75 * V2 in lers per minute plus 1.25 * vco2 in liters per minute does that sound right actually I would make it even simpler because basically we know that from one milliliter of oxygen basically there's a 20 Jews there 20 jewels of energy being and then we know already as you said you already said that well uh the efficiency of the body is approximately 20 20% propulsive and 80% are thermal so you can actually do this far simp far simpler in that sense that you can just look at okay how many milliliters of oxygen you you are you consuming and multiply actually but just by 20 so at six at six lers per minute of

[01:48:07] V2 and I guess the reason you can make that simplification is by the time you're at 6 lers of V2 you can assume what vco2 is you don't have to measure it um the approximate uh let me just do the math so that's a about five that's 30 calories per minute of energy consumption 1,800 calories per hour of energy consumption at 6 lers per minute and at that point you now exceed the capacity of the human digestive system there is no means by which a human in any form can ingest 1,800 calories in an hour and actually get those calories out of the gastrointestinal system into the circulatory system into the muscles so really at this level it becomes an energetic problem as much as a problem of stroke volume heart rate and you know capillary efficiencies and and you can even you can even say that you don't even care about heart rate or stroke volume or CTIC output anyway because that's exactly back to the like what you even started with which also resonates so well with me V2 encompasses exactly that stroke quum because cardic output is just a function of V2 in the end anyway because what you really need that the cardic output is just like to to to to supply you with oxygen really it's the oxygen which is the let's say the key the key metric here so again yes it's the energetic demand becomes so crazy that you just have to start to PR prioritize and you just say okay how important is it for you to be able to do like super high five minute watch surges in Iron Man not important at all never exactly so you can't you can't spend time on training it if you could feed more energy so if you somehow would be able to even feed more energy yes then you can definitely uphold more of that and that's of course what we did there we looked exactly at how can we stay in this perfect balance there living at the edge where we can keep the view to Max as high as possible or let's say the whole curve as high as possible because that in end will give us a better ability to race than necessarily our competitors setting records now given these huge energetic differences you know let's just make sure people understand the distances we're talking about at the Olympics in

[01:50:38] Paris next you know July or August it's a it's an Olympic distance Triathlon so we won't need to go into the distances but let's just tell people a worldclass athlete is doing that in what an hour and 40 minutes or maybe even less at this point where are they no 140 145 is basically where you need to be and that's basically 51.5 km 500 M swimming 40 km biking and then basically 10 km running conversely if you look at Iron

[01:51:07] Man distance at the other end of the spectrum we're 2.4 mil in the water 112 on the bike full Marathon run the world class guys are doing that in what 7 and 1/2 hours 740 is yeah 7 and a half Christian Christian went Christian went 721 on the fastest so yeah but 7:30 is a is a good it's again it's simply unfathomable to anybody who's done any of those things that they're going that fast but the energy demand if you're trying to do something all out for an hour and 40 that is a much easier fueling strategy than if you have to go at a submaximal effort for seven and a half hours so is it surprising to you that you can have one athlete who can be exceptional and world class at both it it because I have to be honest with you it's a little counterintuitive to me based on this discussion that you could be the best in the world at both of those that is there another sport where we would see such disparity like we wouldn't we wouldn't expect that the best 400 meter Runner is also going to be the best 10K Runner and we we wouldn't expect that the best 5K Runner would be the best marathoner so this this is this is where

[01:52:29] I think that we have hugely benefited from using science because it allowed us to break down the arm and distance and understand where basically we could gain much more time than what have been done before because what we have to think is that the training the let's say the method for training uh we can come back because you talk you mentioned the five minute intervals and how you were executing this to basically do your

[01:52:52] YouTube Max session we can come back to that because this is also if you're thinking of it if you're thinking of it we are organic we are organic creatures so we respond to stress by normally getting stronger given that we are providing the conditions to get to to allow it to grow stronger so now basically when you are out and you are doing your five minute efforts and you have a you have a you have a finite time you have a finite amount of time that you can do this exercise so let's said you had 90 minutes now basically you can you can twist this around instead and say that in the same way that you go out and you play a little bit with your your breathing to see what you can do with your heart rate at a certain power now you can just say that okay fine I'm actually now looking to provide the maximum amount of stimulus to my to to to increase my V to Max we already said that for example 5 minute power or 3 minute power is a is a good proxy or surrogate to understand how high your V2

[01:53:46] Max is now think of it this way instead that when you go out you're looking actually to accumulate the maximum am amount of work that you can do at a certain output that is actually a better way of looking how can I actually here provide the best possible stimulus for me now to grow my engine to grow my V2

[01:54:05] Max and you might sorry just to be clear you're saying you might go out and say for an hour what's the most number of kogs that I can uh expend as opposed to what's the highest V2 Max I could sustain for that period of time is that are you basically saying we should just use kils or we could just use kils as the metric yeah because you can think of it this way that the further away we are from because in the end you can say that okay velocity is the ultimate measurement of of of uh performance yeah and the further way we move from this the Le the more gray it becomes because there are more mechanism compensating and that has an influence on what is happening there so we could think of it this way that okay the reason why we want to grow an engine is because we want to become faster on the one side but then then the when you go out we we you are not measuring V2 Max when you or you're not you're not measuring milliliters per minute or how much oxygen you're consuming when you're doing your exercise now but we know that the higher intensity you go the more oxygen you will consume per time okay so then we are saying that now we're providing a stimulus to the body to saying that we need more oxygen you need to respond you need to respond to this and basically facilitate this moving forward because this guy he might be crazy enough to go out and do this session again next week or something like this so again the theory of super compensation that's why normally we would say that okay the reason why we get stronger is because we exercise or we provide a a controlled stress to the body that the body is able to respond to and grow from so now when you're out and exercising and you're doing this heel repeats there now you can instead think of this way okay so when I did my five minutes my five minute efforts and I let's say you you you accumulated how many how many repeats would you do during an hour or let's say how many repeats would you do during the session six to 10 6 to 10 so then basically when you do six to 10 that means basically then you are cumulating between 30 to 50 minutes of let's say that high intensity work yes that's of work there so you of course you do more work but you do that specific work there with the idea of that this will give you a bigger engine

[01:56:12] But ultimately actually what you're really looking for is to become faster that's what you're really looking for uh and that can be done like we also mentioned initially as well if you in one sense you can say you don't really care either if your v2x comes down but you just come faster okay well efficiency have increased but okay that's most likely not going to be the range the the the the the the the the outcome of it it will probably be a mix between a lot of things there but now you can think of this way and that is that when you go out and you do so let's say that you ride now at 400 watts and you accumulate 30 minutes at 400 watts or let's say something like that th those days are over by the way okay that used to that used to be the case I'm nowhere I I wish I could still do 400 watts for 5 minutes but anyway let's say 300 watt it doesn't matter it doesn't matter 300 watts and this is close to exhaustion close to exha you have a little bit of Reserve so you can repeat this and like you say you have enough in even in reserve that you even are able to progress throughout the session a little bit on this so let's say that now you're accumulating in and in average uh at 310 wats you accumulate 30 minutes 30 minutes of of of of of work around there now what if you could accumulate because if you go to 50 minutes a normal consequence of this would not normally be that either now you have gotten fitter or you just had a lot more in reserve when you did the 30 minutes and you really didn't bring yourself close to exhaustion at all so then the stimulus and then the stress on the body is also much less and worst case if you were capable of doing now 50 minutes accumulating 50 minutes at 300 watts or 310 Watts for example two weeks ago if you know do it only for 30 minutes that's already detraining of the ability to stay at 300 W if you do too many of these sessions now moving forward unless you only use this one as a way to just provide some adaptation or make yourself ready for something bigger to come forward but now you can look at it another way so let's say again 300 wats uh 300 wats 30 minutes that's that's approximately where you are sitting or 310 Wass 30 minutes that's approximately where you're sitting then then you're close to exhaustion but the session that the time you had got available for for this training that you had there now maybe that was like 60 Minutes or let's say that how I to ask you how long are these sessions lasting typically from basically when you start until you stop the session in not that not that much longer because the warmup and the cool down is 20 minutes in total so it's most of the most of the set like I could be door too from my house in 75 to 90 minutes easily okay but brilliant so basically here we're talking about 75 to 90 minutes in total train time available and then you you are putting in it's very different so just to be clear when

[01:58:57] I used to train like I don't you know I I exercise now I don't train when I used to train my my coach on the really big days would sometimes want me to not begin the V2 Max set until I had done 2,000 kles so I would go out and do an a relatively kind of easy like a 200 watt 2,000 kle ride and then finish with a very big main set um of hill repeats short hill repeats so six minute hill repeats and so that was an enormous total amount of energy expenditure but most of it was actually at like Zone one to zone two you know pure aerobic efficiency and then finishing with the

[01:59:51] V2 Max um again I don't remember what the rationale was for where the get those 2,000 kles of work in before you go there but those were much longer days obviously and and again today because I'm not training you know for me personally velocity doesn't matter anymore nor does power frankly I'm only training for the conditioning of it right I'm basically asking the question how long can I keep my V2 Max High uh one of the things I think about is at what age will my V2 Max in relative terms Mills per kilogram per minute be smaller than my age in numbers that's an interesting question where do we where do we make that crossover yeah no I think I think this is also something that we will we will probably have a completely new picture of also over the next 5 to 10 years as well just because a lot of measurement equipment that we have available becomes more democ ized uh one thing I can also say is that from all the data I collect so much data on my athletes as well and also many of the coaches I work with they collect so much data on the atlet but the problem is that we even see that some we can use the data to even make the atlet faster so we even haven't gone as fast at it is possible to do yet but the time that is available to basically analyze all these metrics and bring bring it back into our our uh uh sound program is so time consuming to do that you sometimes just have to skip this and you have to focus on the more important part of it so one of the things that we are doing is that we are building uh we have a company called enthalpy and where we basically are building um uh so AI but of course llms or or natural language processing systems and and numerical models where we basically allow us to start to utilize even more of this data in order to provide even more deeper individualization for athletes but even when you go out and basically exercising and you're looking at we can because we can break this even further down because again your ability to put out 300 watts for example is also a function of force and circumferential velocity or let's say torque and Cadence because it's very easy sometimes when you go out and you're thinking that okay now I'm going to go Max that you what you feel is the torque you don't feel the power in the same way you feel really the torque but if you go if you aim for something that really feels like super heavy that's a big torque but it doesn't necessarily yield a very high power power output at all right and power and power is basically what drives the energy demand for the body not the torque in same of course it's not entirely it's a mix of a little bit of the two but but do you subscribe to the idea again using this example where if you shift more towards higher torque lower velocity you're putting more of the stress on the musculature of the legs if you switch more towards a higher velocity by by velocity I mean crank velocity lower torque you're switching more of the demand uh in in the direction of the the cardiovascular ular system I mean remember people used to talk about this all the time between

[02:02:55] Lance and Yan right one was pushing 95 to 100 RPM the other was pushing 65 to 70 rpm they're putting out the same power but two different strategies do do you do you think about that distinction for for the cyclist I again again yes well yes I do uh and this is also something that's very easy to measure so for example if you're out and you put on a V2 master and you go for a certain power output and you drop for example that Cadence or you bring that's right that's right yeah you can basically make V2 the metric that helps you decide and that should correspond most to to fatigue ex exactly so well actually the interesting thing is that what you'll see now is that you actually will you might actually bring down the

[02:03:38] V2 the V2 as a function of that you're increasing the torque increasing the torque uh so you get a little bit better ratio there but what can happen actually as a functional is that you also see that CO2 comes up a little bit more so you actually are shifting Shifting the substrate that's right exactly so and of course the mechanism behind this is probably also like it's fairly easy to rationalize and simply because when you're are starting to use a higher torque you are activating a larger crosssectional area of your of of of your muscles so maybe you're also recruiting more uh type two fibers versus only type one fibers as well right so you're becoming much more glycogen dependent as you make that recruitment yeah it's not it's not en black white like that but in general yes but also here you can say that because then we're thinking okay but we have heard about the the expression slow twitch and fast twitch fibers and fast doesn't that normally should more of that be activated when you start to Pedal faster now well yes but you're not even approaching the limit of basically a slow twitch slow twitch fiber or type one Fiber contract or contractile velocity when you're at 90 or 100 or 110 it's more a pure limitation of coordination or being able to coordinate your your your pedaling Motion in order to have a better balance between your gross power and your net power and this is basically where people sometimes they forget is that what happens that that you you start to go at the higher

[02:05:08] Cadence if you now actually measure your gross power and your net power you start to see that yes the net power is the same but the gross power actually starts to go up when you're starting to bring up your Cadence as well which tells why the V2 now also starts to go up because the the V2 or the oxygen consumption doesn't care about your propulsive power it requ it cares about how much power is required it's counting both the usable and wasted energy exactly so this is one thing that you see is the slow if you go with a little bit lower Cadence typically what happens is that you have a bed that is easier to cordinate your pedaling Motion versus for example when you start to go with a higher Cadence but that's why even when when you start if you do let's say you do a graded exercise test if you aim for a low or let's say a low torque the problem is there as as the ergometer basically now starts to force you to go to higher power higher power higher power higher power and you go with a low Cadence this will basically start immediate to how say increase the let's say the motor unit motor unit activations you recruiting more and more of muscle fibers and you won't be able to get up to an equally high power output simply because the limitation that comes in now is that you have no more motor units you have no more muscles to recruit anymore and you are forced to stop the only way now to compensate for this is that you have to bring up your Cadence instead as a function because if there's no more say no more muscles to to recruiter well then only thing you can do is start to work faster instead or bringing up the

[02:06:42] Cadence faster H okay we we now we we we ventured a little bit further out let's say off the track here so so to bring it back again to your question a little bit about okay so you're looking to conditioning uh conditioning and or creating the fundament or the ability to put out that big Power there again we know that power is a very good extremely good uh there's a very good correlation between power and V2 obviously more work more oxygen consumption simp simp simple as that and this is also a this is a curve you can almost say it's a lineary relation relationship so if you increase your power by 10% you will normally increase your oxygen consumption by 10 % as well for those people that are really into the pudding here of course they they understand that this is not entirely the case this is a curv lineer relationship but for the Simplicity we keep it this way for now so now what you're doing and just to complete that you will not increase velocity by 10% in that situation because of the relationship the square relationship between velocity and drag so just so folks understand while those two things are moving up in a curval linear relationship the velocity relationship is actually a squared or a power relationship ship and therefore it gets harder and harder when you're talking about athletes at the level that you're coaching to eek out an additional kilometer per hour when they're already going 48 kilm per hour it becomes seismic to try to add 5% to that exactly so then back a little bit to you so so then back to your to your question here you can think of it this way since we know that there is a fairly good correlation between or not a fairly good is a extreme good correlation between power and oxygen consumption now you can think of it this way okay so how can I then increase my my oxygen consumption because now we're not talking about milliliters per minute now we are talking about milliliters accumulated so in the same way we talk about power and the relationship between power and work we can talk about the also the difference between milliliters per minute and milliters per let's say session for example so then we can think of it this way okay so how do I provide a stronger stimulus to to to let's say to the cardiovascular system respiratory system to everything to so to basically

[02:08:58] I get a higher view to Max well I would then say you have already a power meter so you already have something that we know are have an extremely close relationship with oxygen so how can we now increase the oxygen total oxygen consumption during that session there then basically I would probably argue that saying doing five minutes on five minutes off for example will not necessarily yield the maximum work that you can do at that because we're not looking at total work during the session because obviously that would be better if you brought down the intensity toal but now you're looking for this specific you want to increase the maximum oxygen output so we not looking at something that sits in this range there there high intensity so I would rather here look at it more like go out and play a little bit and look a little bit okay what kind of intervals do I have to do here to pack as much as possible kilog of workare at that power power out puts during that session that you got available and I'm pretty sure if you do this over a month and you go back into the lab and you test your V2 Max you'll already see now that you have a higher vew to Max than what you did have before and and just to give a sense of what some of those games could look like cuz again I used to experiment with every type of interval from 30 seconds on to 30 seconds off up to 8 minutes on 8 minutes off so it was always the only thing that was constant was the one to one one work to rest ratio but as as I just alluded to right it could be the work to rest could be as little as 30 seconds one minute two minutes yeah even less yeah and and so what what is your intuition because again the classic thinking classic cycling physiology is maximizing V2 Max and maximizing pvo2 max power at V2 Max critical power for example is going to be attained at 3 to 8 Minute intervals now it doesn't mean you don't improve the engine size when you're doing intervals Less Than 3 minutes or more than 8 minutes but the that you're you're most efficient in your training time at those intervals are you arguing that's not necessarily true there there could be gains outside of that if you're using maximum kles per unit time as your metric yeah yeah accumulated inside a session yeah because we again think of it this way we're looking for stimulus so to again make it or to be a little bit uh uh blunt rude you can think of it if you do one minute no if you do five minute interval that's the only thing you do the stimulus that you are providing now at let's say p V2 Max or power at V2 Max for example or let's say you had an oxygen mask and you could measure now your oxygen uptake you'll see that the total accumulated oxygen that you have been using now during that session is very very little so the reason for why you do intervals and you don't try to do for example if if you try to not do it even as intervals you even try to just combine those 30 minutes into one power output at all you won't be able to put out the same amount of power if you just did it in One S one one go 30 minutes there probably then you would be forced to do maybe to bring it down to 280 270 if it was 300 for example what's when you did it as as 5 minute intervals maybe even more down uh now we can think of it this way in the same way we can just bring it down so so why five minut well why did you land on five minut well could it also be four for example could be three could be two because what we're really looking at here is how the maximum but but we want to make sure we don't make the interval too small that we're getting we're quote unquote cheating and using pure glycolytic power which obviously has its benefits but won't necessarily increase presumably at some level mitochondrial function and mitochondrial throughput I mean we really because we're so focused on V2

[02:12:48] Max here we want to make sure we're increasing both we're increasing an energy system that is flexible enough to oxidize both glucose and fatty acid through the mitochondria and therefore with oxygen so at some level don't those interval durations get so short that we can be misled by what we're seeing assuming we don't have the oxygen mask so if we have the oxygen mask of course we'll notice that but if we if we're only relying on power that correlation between power and V2 that linear curve starts to separate in lower durations doesn't it so basically again I think one just one thing to bring in here so so disclaimer which is very important to think I think that there's no like single workout that is the like the golden workout we need different kind of stimulus because like when when you do when you do different kind of let's say intervals at V2 Max they will have they will they will elicit different different uh functions in your body or different benefits in your body for example if you do micro intervals micro intervals one of the things that might be there is that you won't necessarily bring your core temperature as high up as you would do if you do a longer prolonged workout for example and we know that also for example one thing that's very beneficial to a body is to have more plasma more plasma is good for us and we also know that that also has an influence on V2

[02:14:16] Max as well for example so like bringing up the core temperature and let's say also like working on fatigue or being able to focus on relaxing when you get more fatigue in your body as you're doing longer intervals there are many benefits of doing longer intervals as well but now we purely looking at one thing here so we just said okay fine let's see how can we bring the view to

[02:14:37] Max the highest and we we we we we disregard everything else we don't talk about necessarily about endurance uh fatigue resistance all these kind of things that we we we we just neglect that for now so now you can think of it this way that what what is the driving what what does or what is it that causes us to to bring up the oxygen the why does it come up here I think it is useful to think of also what is the measurement method that we're using as well very often to quantify this and I'm if you we have to remember that this oxygen Apper when we are Mex measuring oxygen consumption we are not measuring what's happening inside the muscle we're measuring what comes out in the end in the exhaust here and then we are quantifying V2 Max as function of that if we go into so for example if you do mitochondrial respirations so if you take the mitochondri you do a biopsy you take out now the mitochondria and you put it into Chambers specific Chambers is to measure now the mitochondrial respiration we are not talking about 90 milliliters per minute per kilogram anymore we know that already for well for even for Fairly for not well trained athletes you're already at 200 milliliters per minute per kilogram we know that for Elites you are more than three to 5 100 m per minute per kilogram if you go into what the mitochondria is capable of using of oxygen there sorry just to make just to make sure we understand that all of what you're saying is we are never Limited at the level of the mitochondria I would say statistically speaking so if you're not talking about people I me not talking about people with mitochondrial disease but if you're if you're if you're talking about you and me and your athletes and most of the people listening to this when we ask the question where is the the rate limiting step in oxygen consumption or more to the point oxygen utilization it is not at the mitochondria it's not that we are unable to put more oxygen through the system at the final point where it is needed for combustion by the way I've always thought it's at the level of stroke volume that it's actually at getting the plasma to the muscle is that what you believe yeah getting getting getting the blood getting the oxygen getting the hemoglobin transported to the cells is the most most important thing more l so so it's basically is a is more of a central limitation than a peripherial limitation we're talking about there because the per the peripher is where if you look at it for example from mitochondrial perspective it is so the ratio between what it can use is so extreme compared to what we are able to pump around or or take up in our lungs and pump around to to the body compared to what we can what we can use so then so then and that's actually not without touching into that that actually goes also from uh when we look at it uh for example you you mentioned that or atlete or My athletes are are are um uh using a lot of carbohydrates uh for for fueling and so on we also know that basically the 60 to 90 grams per hour that's not a limitation either it's much much much higher than that we we raise and we use this I use so how do do we quantify this we use isotope traces so we add isotope traces to the carbohydrate and then basically we so similar concept as double label water but here we add it actually to the carbon instead to look at the carbohydrate uptake so we know that that's also it's much higher this is a lot of research that we have done with with Morton specifically on

[02:18:08] Christian and gusta uh and we know that again if you do muscle biopsies then we see basically that the carbohydrate up or or or of of of uh is so much higher than what we are able to supply through our system so again it is a supply problem so sorry meaning you're limited in what the gastrointestinal track can tolerate not at the substrate utilization in the mitochondria exactly yeah and I'm going to be a little bit now I'm going to be very crude there but we can think of to put it this way what brings us to V2 Max is not because we're thinking that we want to have a high V2

[02:18:46] Max oh no I want to you can you can start you can start to breed increase of ventilation now as high as you want but you won't increase you will for you yes you will increase your oxygen but you'll never get to your maximum level without sufficient work you need work exactly not even close to it you will bring it up but you will not be just because you're breathing more and you you're working more when you're doing that um but then coming back to coming back to uh micro intervals and whether whether this is glycolytic or not I think that if you go into the muscles and you measure in the muscles you'll see that basically what happens there is that basically muscles are trying to use use all absolutely all basically Energy

[02:19:24] Systems immediately instantly but because we have a lot of buffer mechanisms in our body if the if the burst is short enough then basically it won't show up as something here because you're basically just feeding it body and then basically you have a long taper or let's say you will never get the spike in V2 but you can have a you can see that you have an elevated V2 consumption over a little bit longer time if you measure longer if you just measure during the interval it won't show up on the exhaust because you take off the mask before it basically shows up there but if you keep the mask on now and you keep it on there for let's say a couple of minutes after you'll see that now that basically you have an elevated oxygen consumption compared to compared to before you did that interval there so basically we can say that when you do a burst it will use most likely all energy systems instantaneously all of them as much as possible because I think like if you if you say that okay now it's first

[02:20:18] ATP first we use stored ATP and then we shift to PCR and then it becomes glycolytic and then basically we go off to beta oxidation this is rather more I think the more correct way to view this basic the reason why you can have a high power output short and high power output is because you able to supply from all the energy systems instantaneously but then you're depleting the different then all of a sudden the the phosphated creatine comes down immediately and then the glycolytic and then yeah yeah yeah then that's where you're yeah that that makes sense yeah so now so now basically coming back then to micro intervals versus longer intervals as long as you start to accumulate enough enough work during that session there because we also talk about V2 and vco2 vco2 is really what is really useful for is to do get an instantaneous picture of of course what kind of substrate are you using and whether you are at an RR value of let's say even 0.8 or even let's say below 0.8 for example but let's say that you are 08 or you're 09 or you are one in RR value basically it doesn't make that much of a difference in your energy yield so one ml of oxygen you if you use 20 Jews of energy 20 Jews as a as as a as a as a or as a number to basically understand your energy demand there you won't go very wrong whether you had been using so if you put this into into the formula and you start to look okay how much big of a difference it is there is not a massive difference yes there is a difference but it's not massive so if you want to be accurate obviously you want to do this but if you want to understand more of a fueling strategy perspective then of course you need CO2 to better understand okay where are you how are you using the how say fuels at different times but here also we have to remember now that when we go into a lab and we test there as well this is a completely different picture than what it would be if you brought somebody into the lab at the moment they went over the

[02:22:09] Finish Line in a race because now you would basically see that the velocity that they hold there at the end or the power they hold at end there even though maybe it's much lower it's still very close to their View to Max because basically they are not able so the v2x everything will come down yeah so there there's a missing time component into this very often when we look at research papers when we talk about this because we talk about it very often as a spot picture or something that happened in a fresh State rested state or whatever yeah or ideal States um then coming back to uh then to the question and to round that up I think exactly that when you do micro intervals and so on and we talk about glyco liing and so on basically you can use here also heart rate as a

[02:22:51] Gorge if you start to see that when you do micro intervals and you're packing in let's say that you did 310 Watts 310 Watts uh and and and and you were able to accumulate uh yeah that 30 minutes of that during those uh during that session there if you now do micro interval so let's say you're able now to bring it to 330 Watts for example and you do 30 minutes of that or you even do maybe you even able to do 330 wats average and you even accumulated now for example uh 35 minutes of that what you'll see there because now it starts to become quite a lot of them there is that most likely you see that you also have a very high heart rate and maybe equally high heart rate as you did when you did when when you did the five minute intervals unless you look at accumulated heart rate there because you can here also use heart R is an indicator of how much time you have accumulated close to V2 Max because we know that one of the conditions that has to be met also for you to reach V2 Max is that you also thinking then you need to pump as maximum amount of oxygen around in your body at the in order to do that and we do we we do know that that is a combination of a very very high heart rate close to maximum heart rate and stroke volume as well so it's just occurred to me that

[02:24:06] I've got eight pages of notes Here of things I want to talk about with you and we are halfway through the first page so clearly this is part one of many podcasts we're going to have to do together hopefully the next one will be in person there are however a few things I want to discuss before we part today um we have yet to do kind of a more thorough discussion around lactate and if I can only discuss one more thing with you for maybe another 15 to 30 minutes before we go I'd like to do a little bit of a deep dive into lactate now for some background since I kind of abandoned any athletic goals and the only thing I train for now is my health right it's for my longevity it's for something I call the centenarian decathlon so being as fit and strong as I can be in my 80s and 90s without necessarily worrying about what I'm doing today um in in terms of trying to maximize my performance today

[02:25:09] I'm trying to maximize my performance tomorrow a very important part of my training because my training volume is now so much lower than it used to be when I live lived on a bike or lived in the water um I'm I'm trying to be maximally efficient which is always risky because you know sometimes you just have to put the miles in but what I do spend is about three hours a week in zone two and and again there's so many different ways to describe zones so I'm not doing this in terms of heart rate

[02:25:40] I'm really defining this in terms of mitochondria so Zone 2 is my highest work my highest power output where my lactate stays below 2 m so this is very sustainable from an RP perspective you know it's it's it's RP 6 to7 I can talk but I'm not comfortable talking but I can talk it's definitely below my 1hour functional threshold power um but it's more challenging than that 200 Watts riding around in circles having fun trying to just purely Focus on position um and I do use my lactate I do check my lactate constantly to make sure that I'm really hitting that spot um now what's the rationale for that well the rationale for that is that 2m is about the Tipping Point about which you can be in a steady state of producing lactate clearing lactate and once lactate starts to get into the three and four four Millo range you you wouldn't have indefinite access to that

[02:26:51] Energy System you're going to start accumulating so much hydrogen that at some point you're you're per your your your your physics of performance are going to be compromised so you know I'm guessing like let's now talk about this in terms of worldclass athletes so if you had a continuous lactate sensor on an Iron

[02:27:12] Man um in his 7 hours and 30 minutes give me a sense of what his lactate tracing looks like so this is where I differentiate between volumetric measurements and concentration metrics because concent lactate is a concentration metric we don't measure the volume of lact and the plasma volume is decreasing as the athlete is running so you would expect the lactate concentration to go up slightly even if the production of lactate is constant yeah uh and also further here is that uh we have made some discoveries over the last years as well which is when we start to do um

[02:28:00] Iron Man training for example which also um are very different from a lot of the understanding that currently is there there there is there is some things there that are changing and we we can we will definitely touch on this in in a let's say an upcoming uh podcast but to give you the trace now uh first of all I think that two millimoles when you have little time to train during a we I I'm

[02:28:32] I'm very for me if for example you came to me and say hey Ola I need some training advice uh for me longivity uh of course U that's the most important for you or Wellness but we can always say that well in the end it's about whether you have a high view to Max really doesn't matter if you're not capable of moving very efficiently around just because you're wasting energy so we can say that for like universally maybe more universally it's about being able to move more per time like we said in the beginning even moving your head is around is movement it's just better we break it down to a global movement of the body or we break it down to basically say local movements uh of parts of our body but movement is actually the most important thing in the end here for all of us um then uh I would say that uh if you have for me if you came to me I would probably I would have a my I would very much look at okay most important thing would be to bring joy of exercising and sense of achievement into your training moving moving forward because that's what's going to get you out in the day that's what's going to get you out of the bed if you look forward to exercising because you find it enjoyable you'll do more of it that's the easier way to get you out and even where you would start to prioritize it over other things you are doing instead of pushing it always in front of you and then finally you get out and exercise because you you know you should do exercising exactly to to meet your your your uh expectations um so that would be the most important thing but if we look away from that so I I would say that Mo like the differences between riding also at one milles versus 2 milles as long as one mill is more sustainable for you over let's say over months and years because it brings more joy to you it allows you to maybe be more PR or let's say almost use it as a as a mindfulness session if that becomes more sustainable you can think about what what you accumulate because we very often again this is a problem very often with research and many things is that we give a spot picture of something we look at something in one session over a couple of session instead of actually looking at over over a lifespan or over over a long long long period and then this is where I think exactly that we very often we undervalue the joy of exercising because we go out with an expectation that okay I have to go hard

[02:30:51] I have to go all out and these kind of things which is very demanding and taxing on the body especially if you're not prepared for this and by the way I just I'll I'll interject there that I can completely relate to that and I've accepted that as a part of the transition in my life right so there was a day there were many days there were many years where I had a belief system that said every single day without exception you must burn the pack of matches fully at least once so it didn't matter what the workout was there was still an allout effort of about 3 to 5 minutes somewhere in the day that would probably when I measured it I wouldn't always measure it but it would take lactate into the 16 to 18 Millo range like incredible pain and truthfully I can't do that anymore because I don't have the mental fortitude for that much suffering anymore so I still I love to exercise there's never a day that I don't want to but I also don't have to look forward to that degree of suffering anymore and I think that that's okay right that's the difference between being 50 and being 30 um and I also don't think I need to suffer that much certainly on a daily basis maybe once in a while um but that said you know I still really enjoy quantifying my training and I know that there are many people who don't and

[02:32:31] I and I I think for those people you know for example most of my patients are absolutely not measuring their lactate levels during their cardio training it if if 2% or 5% are that would probably be accurate and for most people it's what you say it's what do I need to do to make you enjoy this and use your rate of perceived exertion as the guide tool um but look I still have a little bit of a data person in me and I like using this metric to maximize the efficiency of and it's a great way for me to track my progress right are am I able to get

[02:33:15] Watts higher and higher and higher while keeping heart rate and lactate more or less the same um and and so I'm just guessing that at your level this must be a relatively important metric right I mean in terms of what is there well first of all maybe just to find for folks what what a lactate threshold is we haven't even talked about it it's not something I particularly care about anymore but but you know talk about what a lactate threshold is how it's measured do you guys even still do lactate performance curves yeah but it more more as a function of more as a function of other metrics that I collect okay so lactate for me again is is is a concentration metric and is a is a marker of something and for me it's a marker more of substitu isation or like not not an extremely accurate one but it's a good one um so I would say the lactate for me is a way that allows me to collect more even but this is is a redundant metric to other metrics as well to basically be more precise in the way that I would prescribe or change even the training on a session uh so I would say that there are are plenty of good surrogates or or uh proxies that you can use instead to do the exact same thing without Le dat but if you're looking more let's say for example you want to know better now for example uh your subsidization or have an idea of that it I would say even argue that you can't necessarily only do one measurement you have to do a little bit of couple of let's say little bit change in intensities not much but small range there with a couple of measurements to get an ID because your let's say call it your your lactate uh or your maximum lactate steady state concentration for example in in a session can also vary based on for example dehydration so for example if you go out you have one lactic concentration today this might already change for in in two days time for example that's one but but I think it is but we use it uh as a way um uh uh okay how can I make this not too complicated so I mean I'll tell you how we used to do it and it was probably much cruder than what you would do but if we would do repeated intervals at ascending Pace or ascending like meaning descending pace so ascending effort descending pace so if it was in the pool we would swim hundreds or 200s and do and at change the pace so you'd go out pretty easy for the first one check the lactate fully recover repeat it fully recover repeat it and you're getting faster and faster and faster so then you have you make a graph the x- axis is the speed the Y and we would note heart rate as well but we would really focus on speed and then the y axis was the lactate concentration and it becomes a power curve and again this is very crude so I can imagine that now the methods are much better but you can eyeball them as sort of two separate linear curves and they intersection becomes the inflection point at which you go from kind of sustainable to unsustainable lactate production or nonlinear parabolic lactate production and we would sort of say look let's just assume that that intersection occurred at 3.5 Millo concentration of lactate we and we would note what the pace was there we would say to that athlete you have to be mindful of exceeding that pace now this speaks to everything you just said I mean that pace is going to change depending on your hydration depending on your energy reserves depending on your fatigue so of course it's crude but directionally that's what we thought about as you you have to be very careful every time you exceed that pace in a race because you're now tapping into a very finite Reserve um is that kind of how you still do it albeit probably with much more accuracy yeah no I I I what what I really like with what you say uh is one you talk about infliction point because this is a this is very misunderstood some people still today go by fixed blood lactate accumulation values or concentration values so they stick for example to four Mill moles or something like this and okay if you're going to if you're going to publish a paper and you want it to be able to compare with other papers that are out there well that that's that's fine but already here the problem with that is that four moles can be accumulated in a whole range of different ways you can go just above your second infliction point or just above maximum like this the state and then you creep up towards four four M meaning that now you have to have a smaller power output in order to get there or you can go with a very high power output and it would take a short time for you to reach that four moles there so how do you know go backwards and say that okay well four mol should coate to this power it's highly dependent on the protocol that you're doing there already but the way that you prescribe or the way that you describe that you you basically said it is is something I would say this is this is this is fine because the two most important thing if you want to use it as a way to control your intensity so you want let's say a different way of controlling intensity as opposed to for example heart rate or other things I we know of course again heart rate again also is also influenced by by by by by hydrations and other stressors and other things as well so when you are using lactate now um one I like the way that you describe it you you talk about infliction points perfectly and make it as simple as you said as well depending on how long your protocol is now you can you can even say that you get you can draw three lines you're looking at basically drawing one line that goes through the flat section of your profile more or less of the lactate then you get one that goes more on let's say on the liner increase so you get yes for every step you increase in Pace then basically then basically you also see there's an increase in laced but at some point you see there's a complete departure between increase in Pace and laced and it goes complete or it goes very almost vertical yeah yeah so this is where you could say that also then talking back to for example metabolism you could say that the first infliction point is not too far of where normally where you would see your fat Max is and the second one is typically where you would see your maximum active steady state is more or less people I think in the nomenclature call that LT1 lt2 yes we use that very much because then you are to I like to be specific in this sense because when you talk about LT1 and lt2 then you already have distinguished it away from for example ml fix yeah yeah yeah because if you because if you talk about mlss this actually normally requires you do a very specific profile so you would do for example longer interval so you could for example do uh like 30 m 30 minute or or 20 minute rolling effort for example and you're looking at lactate as a function of let's say every five minute to see whether the lactate value is stable or whe it starts to increase so maximum lactate steady state is basically what it says in the names is the highest highest lactate value that you're able to sustain steady state if you go now a little bit higher in effort or in intensity or let's say you accumulating a little bit more fatigue then basically you already start to see that now Lac is not stable anymore for the same power output down it will actually start to see that Lac starts to accumulate up going upward it's not steady state anymore and what capacity or duration is built into that

[02:40:39] Assumption of lt2 because again it it you know lt2 cannot be sustained indefinitely so there's some point at which it ceases to be a true steady state what what does that look like in a in an athlete so this again depends a little bit because at Maxim lative steady state depending on how powerful the athlete is uh and here is also misconception a lot of people think that

[02:41:04] Maxim the steady state is is the equivalent of of RR value of one this is not this is not correct not at all y so so one thing you very often see is that for actually this is something that we we uh we discovered uh and uh with with at is true different when we went Iron Man and when we went Olympic racing so short long and and other athletes as well and that is that what you see is that the maximum La steady state typically occurs at a lower r value depending on the distance you're doing so the longer the distance you do the lower the r where you you'll actually find that that sits at a lower

[02:41:41] RR value it it is logical if you look at it purely from a phys from a physics perspective or let's say you talking about stationary action principles for example so or thermodynamics then basically how do you how how do you supply the bod with with the most sustainable energy the simp possible way yeah it comes back to that let's just go back to that for a second hold up uh so so at an Iron Man sorry at an Olympic distance are they able to hold lt2 for the whole race whereas at the Iron Man are they well below lt2 and closer to

[02:42:17] LT1 uh the problem with very powerful aades is that already because now this is the problem where lactate comes in because laced only looks at concentration it doesn't look at volume so the problem is that LT1 will already occur at a very high so very high utilization of V2 Max for an Iran atlete that means how high just just give us a sense so oh I have to sit down now because now it's more than a year ago or one and a half year or no a little bit more than a year ago let's just say speaking roughly speak yeah roughly speaking roughly speaking I would say that it sits in at around 80 80% yeah close to 80% of V2 Max that's right so if the V2 Max is 6 lers per minute at 80% of that at 4.8 L per minute they're at about

[02:43:16] LT1 yeah and that you already do know that that's not sustainable because you're already now turning around so much carbs per hour that it doesn't work anymore so you have to well but hang on hang on it depends a little bit on the re right because you're now at maximum fat oxidation and so what what what what are your athletes now your athletes have one thing working for them and one thing working against them the thing that they have working for them is they have the healthiest mitochondria on the planet but the thing they have working against them is they're on a very high carbohydrate diet and I'm saying for and against them in terms of fuel utilization so they actually have the capacity for insane fat oxidation but their system is tuned towards a faster fuel not a more energy-dense fuel so let me guess would they hit 8 grams per minute of fat Ox are they getting that high put it this way we have had blocks where we just have been looking at how high we can get the in fat dogs and this it is extremely high you get to you get you're probably getting close to one gram per minute then no even higher okay well that's so that and that's on a high carb diet yeah it's just it's it's absurd to me that we are out of time here and if it weren't for the fact that

[02:44:35] I had a hundred patient calls today that I can't just cancel we would just continue to do this so we have officially covered 2third of one page out of eight pages we have not yet talked about what I want to discuss around muscle biopsies we have not talked about um getting into Anor robic threshold a term that I don't pay any attention to but I think we should talk about we haven't talked about um the the use of temperature probes and understanding the effect of cooling during um during during both competition and training we haven't talked about heart rate heart rate variability training desire performance and Recovery um we have not talked about some questions I have about the use of peed and why they don't seem as prevalent in

[02:45:22] Triathlon as they do in other Endurance Sports I could go on and on that's just finishing what's on the first page I wanted to really get into MCT density I wanted to talk about too many things for me to even rattle off now so um you said you're going to be in the US at some point I hope we could do round two of this in person would be fantastic all right yeah this has been really cool for me as well and what I want to say also one final thing here we of course we talk very much about terminology and how we see things and so on one thing that is important for me to be very clear on is that terminology is one thing but we have to remember also that people might use these terminologies also differently as well and as long as a coach and an athlete for example have an understanding of something and that works for them don't get how say discouraged or don't start quarreling over definitions these kind of things because the most important thing is exactly that you have a language and it does work for you and that's most important that somebody people some some like people Like Us come and Hammer them with a lot of terminologies and a lot of definitions they obviously have gotten something right and it's important to have respect for that and there's also a lot of things that we don't know we there's a reason why we are continuing to do all this research as well because we are so curious we want to understand more and we understand that there's so much still to discover as well about everything we even covered now during this call yeah um well thank you Olaf that was that was really wonderful and um I I very much look forward to to round two the same thank you so [Music] much
