This clip is from episode Navigating bone health: early life influences and advanced strategies for improvement and injury prevention (#214 rebroadcast)

In this clip, they discuss:

- Osteoporosis Can Be Silent – Many individuals don’t realize they have low bone density until they experience a fracture
- Genetic & Lifestyle Influences – Family history, poor nutrition, smoking, and sedentary behavior are significant risk factors
- Corticosteroids Weaken Bones – Chronic use of steroids like prednisone can impair bone formation and increase fracture risk
-  Hormonal Changes Matter – In women, estrogen loss post-menopause rapidly accelerates bone loss; testosterone also plays a role for men
- Low Body Weight Increases Risk – Individuals with low BMI or low body fat often have less bone mass to begin with

## AI Summary

Here's my analysis of this segment from The Drive podcast about osteoporosis risk factors:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode segment focuses on key risk factors for osteoporosis and bone health concerns. Dr. Attia discusses how genetics plays a surprisingly large role (up to 50%) in bone health, along with various risk factors including family history, trauma-related fractures, and lifestyle factors. He particularly emphasizes the impact of certain medications, especially corticosteroids, on bone health, and discusses special populations like female athletes who may be at increased risk.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Genetics accounts for up to 50% of bone health [00:00:17]
- Female athlete triad: interconnection between low bone health, hormone dysfunction, and low BMI [00:00:50]
- Early smoking (before age 16) has worse long-term impacts on bone density than later-onset smoking [00:03:34]
- Prednisone at 5mg/day can significantly reduce bone mineral density within 3-6 months [00:05:24]
- PPIs may increase osteoporotic fracture risk, though data is less clear than with corticosteroids [00:06:15]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Monitor bone health if family history of hip fractures exists [00:00:17]
- Maintain healthy BMI (above 18-19) [00:00:50]

Risk Factors to Watch:
- History of fractures from mild/moderate trauma [00:00:50]
- Smoking history (especially early onset) [00:02:14]
- Long-term medication use (corticosteroids, PPIs, anti-epileptics) [00:01:50]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:

Medications Discussed:
- Corticosteroids (both systemic and inhaled) [00:01:50]
- Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) [00:06:15]
- Phenytoin (anti-epileptic) [00:08:04]
- Prednisone (5mg/day mentioned specifically) [00:05:24]

5. **Special Populations**:
- Female endurance athletes (especially runners) [00:00:50]
- Former smokers [00:02:43]
- Asthma patients with history of inhaled corticosteroid use [00:01:50]

6. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Bone Mineral Density (BMD) measurements [00:02:43]
- BMI monitoring (particularly for values below 18-19) [00:00:50]

7. **Notable Quotes**:
"I didn't realize genetics accounted for up to 50% of bone health." [00:00:17]

8. **Follow-up Questions**:
- What are the specific interventions for counteracting medication-induced bone loss?
- Are there particular vitamin D supplementation protocols for patients on anti-epileptics?
- What are the specific screening recommendations for early-onset smokers?

The transcript ends before discussing interventions for improving bone health, which was mentioned as the next topic to be covered.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] So, Peter, another followup is, you know, earlier you mentioned that there might be some risk factors for why someone might get screened for bone health earlier. So, kind of what should people be aware of if they're thinking about if they're maybe at risk and what are some of those red flags they should look out for?

[00:00:17] Uh, so, you know, it sounds cliche, but family history matters. Uh, and this is actually not something I appreciated until we were getting ready to do this podcast. I didn't realize genetics accounted for up to 50% of bone health. So having either parent that's had a history of a hip fracture, that's a huge red flag. Um there are other things we want to care about, right? So we want to look at fractures related to mild or moderate trauma. So you look at somebody who's had a fall from standing height or less. That's, you know, someone who's fallen from such a low height and still had a fracture. That's a huge problem.

[00:00:50] Another thing we look at is in female athletes. This is really common actually in female endurance athletes, especially runners um where weight is such an important part of the sport, right? You know, it's uh you're you're punished a lot uh in terms of performance for extra weight. Same is true in cycling, not as true in swimming. So when you look at high-end uh female endurance athletes, we care a lot about you know poor nutritional state which can lead to a very low BMI, low body fat percent and eventually estrogen deficiency. So these interrelated conditions of the sort of low bone health, hormone dysfunction and and low BMI are kind of collectively known as the female athlete triad. So that's another big risk factor. Low BMI in general, so anything below about 18 or 19. And then the other thing we look at is uh is people who have had high exposure to drugs that affect bone metabolism. And I think the most common of these that we see is corticosteroids.

[00:01:50] Now that's not always systemic corticosteroids. You know, it's not always people that have had to take lots of steroids for illness. It can also be inhaled coreroids. And we see this actually in a number of patients who had significant asthma as children and used a lot of inhaled cortosteroids. So those are that's not an exhaustive list, but that's a pretty good list to sort of get you thinking about who is at high risk here.

[00:02:14] Yeah. And you you mentioned it a little bit at the end there and we did receive a lot of questions on it which are around the various drugs that may impair bone deposition. So um anything more you want to say? I know you mentioned a few of them there, but anything you want to double click on? I I think the last big risk factor we look for and we just saw a patient recently who didn't have any other risk factors except for the fact that they have a 20 packear smoke history that is more than 15 years old.

[00:02:43] So you barely think of this person as a former smoker because they've been so long without smoking but you know they did smoke for 20 years prior to quitting. Um and that is an independent risk factor for low uh BMD which in this case this patient had very low BMD. uh we had to refer them to an endocrinologist.

[00:03:01] Do you see anything with patients cuz you know we know that BMD the 8 to 20 is such a big age range and if you have someone who is smoking kind of in that age range while bone mineral density is really going up. Do you see it become kind of even worse? Yeah. Um that's a great question Nick. So uh I didn't know this until again we got thinking about this study. Uh but there there are actually data looking at never smokers, early smokers, and late smokers.

[00:03:34] Early smokers were defined as people who started smoking before the age of 16. And late smokers, well, it's hard to believe late is considered after 16. Um but the early smokers were far more impacted. So when you look at these people later in life, the never smokers, not surprisingly, had the best bone density. the early smokers had the worst and the late smokers were in the middle.

[00:03:59] Um I don't know the stats about teenage smoking today. I I kind of assumed it was on the decline but um you know this would certainly be yet another um reason to avoid smoking at a young age even if you know that person goes on to stop at the age of 20. Um, and even if their risk of lung cancer becomes relatively moot by the time they're, you know, 50, they may still pay a price for that with bone mineral density throughout their entire life.

[00:04:31] Yeah. And on the topic of what you talked about a second ago, we also did receive a lot of questions around various drugs that could impair bone deposition. You mentioned a few of them earlier, but is there anything you want to double click on there? So again, you know, corticosteroids I I think have to be considered the first and most important one of these drugs you want to be considered about and and and they, you know, I think they they do a couple of things, right? So they kind of impair the mineralization of bone by favoring bone reabsorption during the early phase and then they kind of inhibit calcium absorption in the gut. That this this area comes up this this this comes up over and over again, right? Anything that impairs calcium absorption is going to be problematic. And it and it really doesn't need to be mega doses of steroids. Um people who are familiar with long-term use of steroids might recognize that a dose of predinazone of five milligrams a day is not enormous.

[00:05:24] Um you know a prennazone dose of 5 milligrams a day is I mean I think it's actually still a kind of big dose because it's about the physiologic equivalent of how much hydrocort you know how much cortisol a person makes. Um but nevertheless, you know, that amount is associated with significant reductions in bone mineral density and an increased risk fracture within as little as 3 to 6 months of initiation.

[00:05:47] Again, just as we saw in the figure that showed how women are primarily losing tbecular bone. It's it's the same here with with with cortisol. So, um that doesn't mean you should never take uh corticosteroids. There are lots of conditions where corticosteroids are going to save your life. It means you have to be aware of these things and you're going to have to work a lot harder to counter their effects and we'll talk about some of those things.

[00:06:15] Um, another class of drugs that I get asked about a lot is proton pump inhibitors, PPIs. And you know, I I would say the data here are less clear. So there are studies that have assessed the relationship between PPIs and they do show an increase in osteoporotic fracture. Um the most likely mechanism suggested is again intestinal calcium absorption. So anything that interrupts that which then goes on to interrupt osteoclast formation and bone remodeling.

[00:06:48] But I but I want to be clear that this is not nearly as well understood as the case is for corticosteroids. So there there are a number of observational studies that show an increase in the risk of fracture, but you know, then we look at large metaanalyses that don't find a a stat a statistically significant uh decline in BMD with PPI use. Um so again, I think you just have to be smart about this, right? Um there are lots of reasons we're going to put patients on PPIs. If a patient has significant reflux that is not amenable to other treatments, we're going to put them on a PPI. If a patient has Barretts esophagus, we're putting them on a PPI.

[00:07:27] It's non-negotiable, right? So, it just means that we have to be thoughtful about is the drug really indicated and if it is, what else can we do to reduce the risk down the line? I think the final class of drugs that um tend to have a similar association although probably from a different mechanism are some of the anti-epileptic drugs um and and one in particular which is phenotin. a super common uh anti-seizure drug here. I think the mechanism might have more to do with um like the liver inducing an enzyme called cytochrome

[00:08:04] P450 that leads to increased catabolism of vitamin D and that of course you'll may recall will lead to decreased uh absorption of calcium in the gut. I don't know if anybody's done a study, but it seems to me that a no-brainer study would be taking patients on phenitoin and supplementing them with lots of vitamin D to see if you can overcome that. But again, um you know, phenitoin is a common drug within the world of anti-seizure meds, but in the big picture, nowhere near as common as corticosteroids and proton pump inhibitors.

[00:08:38] So, I think where we're going to go next is starting to look at what people can do to improve their bone health. I'm Peter Aia.
