## Description

Brian Deer is an award-winning investigative journalist best known for his coverage of the pharmaceutical industry. In this episode, he and Peter discuss the content of his book, The Doctor Who Fooled the World: Science, Deception, and the War on Vaccines, which exposes the complex and disturbing story behind the infamous 1998 Lancet paper by Andrew Wakefield linking the MMR vaccine and autism. Brian explains how doctors led by Wakefield, a lawyer, and an anti-vaccination parents’ group worked together on a study to validate their preconceived belief that the MMR vaccine caused autism. He reveals what happened behind the scenes as the study was carried out, explains problems in the lab, and discusses inconsistencies in the analysis.  In the end, this is a story that serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of science driven by an agenda rather than by a spirit of open inquiry.

We discuss:

## Transcript

[00:00:01] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter attia

[00:00:10] Brian thanks so much for uh for staying up somewhat later I guess in the afternoon evening um your time it's uh it's really an honor to be able to speak with you here today about such an important topic um I think as I told you when I reached out to you um this is certainly a subject matter I've paid very close attention to for a number of years but I was still somewhat surprised by some of the revelations in your book when I first read it actually had to read it a second time to fully assimilate um all of it at which point I reached out to you and said look I'd really love to speak with you so I I'm grateful for the time you've made I'm sure this is a a tale you tell often well thank you Peter good to be here let's just uh let's just get right to the chase um obviously uh you know surveys of people um around the world certainly I can speak in the United States in the UK a sizable portion of a population believe that autism is likely or probably caused by vaccines is that a is that a fair statement today yeah it's a very it's a very um well-known opinion I don't know what the precise polling is at the moment but yes there's there's tended to be quite a a strong uh view about that particularly

[00:01:25] I think in North America not so much in the UK at the moment but um yeah I think that's true a lot of people have this idea this is not something that you were paying enormous attention to initially it um you were I don't want to say a latecomer to this but you weren't I gather paying close attention to this in the early 1990s or even earlier because the idea itself that a vaccine um could cause harm has certainly been around for uh probably more than 100 years correct sure sure yeah different vaccines yes but um the the idea that it might uh cause autism uh arose in the late 1990s yeah so let's let's just talk about the story because I think there is really um there's a character that is at the center of this story a character by the name of Andrew Wakefield um a former physician um who

[00:02:22] I have to be honest with you I think prior to reading your book the impression I had was that he was a misguided and not particularly competent physician um but I don't think I was aware of some of the other um shall we say uh behaviors that that would I think go beyond a lack of con competence or scientific rigor on that point it's an interesting point because when I started researching the book I mean I've I'm reasonably experienced in the the nature of Storytelling for one reason or another I've gone into it a little bit in my life and um I really wanted to try and have some kind of Arc of development in this character so I was looking to give him the benefit of the doubt in his early years this is a guy who as you say he he he's a he was a physician or in fact he trains as a surgeon and he he went off from the UK to Canada in the late 1980s where he studied uh at the Toronto General Hospital and originally he was observing doctors there who were trying to do the world's first whole bowel transplant and that was that was the idea they had at the time and he was a trainee there but he moved very quickly away from surgery and we've we've never entirely found out the reason why he did that uh very unusual thing to do because his mother told me that he'd always wanted to be a surgeon nothing else but to be a surgeon he moved away into research and when I went back into those years I really wanted to make him look uh believable credible almost heroic because it's a better story if you're trying to if you're trying to draw people in uh they want something to latch onto they want to get the idea that this was a good guy who as you say was misguided was perhaps incompetent perhaps moved away from the things that he really understood but I never really was able to find anything that that evidence that it seemed that at a very early stage he demonstrated a fanatical obsession with proving that a particular infectious agent caused a particular issue uh and nothing would Shake him from the idea he latched onto and the way he latched onto it was so extraordinary and so absurd uh that it was really very difficult to give him a a good positive heroic uh sympathetic start in the story let's talk about his Eureka moment which if I recall was oh I don't know it was on Young Street or Bathurst Street or something like that it was in a pub drinking a Guinness what was the amazing

[00:05:26] Insight that he had um in that in that Pub in Toronto in the in the late 80s well what happened was as you say he was he the story which he told another journalist it's a remarkable piece of History because it never surfaced anywhere else other than an interview he did with a with another journalist um was that he was he was as I say working at the Toronto General hospital where they were uh looking into the possibilities of whole bowel transplants and and the reason why my one might want to do that is in order to deal with crohn's disease most people I think have an idea of what Crohn's disease is an appalling ulcerating blistering burning disease of the bowels um and nobody knows what causes it even today nobody knows what causes it people have got ideas and there's been a lot of epidemiology but I don't know if you've ever looked at it yourself but the epidemiology of Crohn's disease is just totally baffling and bizarre and no matter how many books you stack up on a table to try and understand it you just just realized just better to walk away and just believe it he was in this Pub is the way he he tells it and and he wanted to find out what the cause of

[00:06:46] Crohn's Disease was and the mythology or the the the the legend that he has sought to create is that he he didn't want to spend his life chopping out bits of gut which is normally what happens if you get crohn's disease i i in addition to heavy duty very heavy duty drug therapy usually you end up having pieces of your gut chopped out so he wanted to find out the cause as being a much more credible um course in life and I give him that credit at the start and I set it up like that he was trying to discover the cause of Crohn's Disease and he's looking into this pint of Guinness and he says well the convention thinks to himself were the conventional wisdom is that Crohn's disease was caused by um uh bacteria food some kind of allergic reaction inside the gut and he came to the idea well maybe it isn't that maybe it's maybe it was a disease of the blood supply to the gut wall um and an infectious agent now this was in in the late 1980s this was when AIDS was really big in the news and really an intractable problem and obviously in the case of AIDS they found an infectious agent so he thought well what could the Infectious agent be and he came back to London and got a job at a um uh really to be fair at that time the third-rate London Medical

[00:08:19] School the Royal free in Hampstead North London and he was still on the budget of the welcome trust which at the time today the welcome trust is a is a preeminent uh medicine and health related charity absolutely Blue Chip gives out enormous sums money and really is in many ways the financial engine behind the United

[00:08:42] Kingdom's extraordinary success with um or apparent success with dealing with uh the coronavirus outbreak because of the sequencing uh which is being carried out here on a massive scale and largely with uh funding that was originally given by the welcome trust but at the time it was the if you like the grant giving arm of a pharmaceutical company and he was on their budget and he came back to London and he would be on their budget for a couple of years at this hospital and medical school but he was going to inevitably be moved off their budget onto the budget of the medical school so he's he's there the clock's ticking he's got this idea about Crohn's disease and he goes to the library goes to the hospital Library and takes out or at least reads there a two-volume Encyclopedia of viruses called Fields virology big thing is couple of couple of bricks thick in its two volumes and starts going through it until he eventually comes to measles virus and there he sees a paragraph which says that in in acute measles infection the measles virus can be found in the uh in the gut in the colon and and the intestines generally um now and he thinks ah and in Crohn's disease this blistering that you get produces little ulcers and measles acute measles infection characteristically in fact it's pathognomic I think of the uh of the of the of the disease in measles you get things called complex spots which are little spots uh in the um in the in mostly in the mouth and he came to the conclusion that these complex spots were essentially the same thing as was seen in the bowels um when uh somebody has measles usually usually a child so he thinks ah I found it this is my Eureka moment measles virus is the cause of Crohn's Disease now just as little aside the thing about fulminant measles is you can find it everywhere in the body I mean you wouldn't just find it in the gut you wouldn't just find it in the mouth you find it everywhere I mean for the period of acute infection you can find measles all over so nothing surprising that that but that's where that's where he started off and he then set about trying to prove that measles virus was the cause of Crohn's Disease now if the measles virus is in fact the cause of Crohn's Disease and the measles virus is waning because of vaccination is it safe to say then that the next leap is a vaccine that introduces a small amount of weasels measles could still be causing a problem is that the is that the next step yeah because the thing the thing about um about Wakefield was that he he could never do what he was the equivalent as a scientist he wasn't trained in science you he trained as a surgeon which is as a particular psychology I think and I think as I say in the book in in science courage isn't about proving yourself right it's in your efforts to prove yourself wrong it's your efforts at a very early stage to try and refute your own hypothesis so a hypothesis which is nothing more than a guess so you start off with a guess and then you try and prove it wrong rather than try and prove it right obviously you're collecting data that supports it but yeah but in order to to work in a in a rational way you try to prove yourself wrong and he never got to that second stage at any time in his life he never got to the stage of trying to question his own ideas to doubt himself and this I think many people came to regard as an extraordinary flaw of character possibly for anybody but certainly for scientists um yeah I'll just interject Brian with one of my favorite scientists who you can probably see behind me Richard

[00:13:00] Feynman very famous for having said and I'm paraphrasing that the first principle in science is um not to be fooled or apparently you know it's not to fool yourself effectively uh and uh you're absolutely right um when one comes up with a hypothesis the goal is to do everything you can to demonstrate it is incorrect um and and even the word proof in science is a loaded word isn't it because unlike mathematics we really don't have proofs in science everything is probabilistic which I want to get to later um and you know you look at a body of literature a body of experiments and you try to ascertain perhaps just as a court would what does the mountain of evidence suggest in One Direction or another versus say in science relying on an antidote or something like that so yeah

[00:14:03] I couldn't agree with you more and I and I think you're right by the way uh you know I trained as a surgeon and I would go one step further and say this is not just about surgery I just don't think medicine the actual discipline of medicine does a lot in the way of scientific training so it is true that many people who train in medicine also go on to receive scientific training but in speaking for myself none of the scientific training I learned came from

[00:14:30] Medical School medical school was really geared towards getting as many facts as possible into your head you certainly learned a bit about the history of science you you were able you were fortunate to put in context what other people had done and how we were able to utilize that information but in terms of the scientific method and you know this idea that you generate a hypothesis you figure out what the right questions are to test it you design experiments you critically look for all the ways you could be fooled that is very difficult to learn unless you spend time in a laboratory and you're well mentored um so uh you know I I actually never take offense to the idea when people say you know doctors don't understand science which is usually something that you know someone with real scientific chops would would level as a criticism hmm oh I think that's right um so yes he he um he so there he is um with this attempt to prove himself right and I mean it it as you say about medicine medicine I sometimes like into like learning Chinese uh the the method essentially is that you read books and you sit in lecture halls and you see things and if you ask a question why is that so then the person is teaching you will essentially say because I say so that's that's what it is you just have to learn this stuff like a European learning Chinese it's this is this is this symbol this is this this is this don't question it just learn it um so but the scientific method obviously is different now but what

[00:16:04] Wakefield would do and it's all over his work I mean not it's everywhere you find a particular word it's almost his favorite word and his favorite word was consistent so he would say this particular finding or this piece of data or whatever is consistent with his hypothesis but of course the thing about consistence I mean it is consistent um that um the uh orbit of mercury uh is related to I don't know inflammatory bowel disease it's consistent that mercury Rose this morning and uh the uh you could you could you could you could link any things together and say they're consistent um it's consistent with me talking to you it's an even it's an even sillier word than associated with which speaks which means nothing right it means nothing it it means it's just means it's it's not a refutation um somebody who used this word consistent all the time and never stopped and he never stopped to question at any stage or or carry out any kind of experiment or research or anything that would conflict with that commitment to the idea at this stage that that measles virus was the cause of Crohn's Disease and when anybody else uh came up with contrary information so for example he would say and this is one

[00:17:37] I I mean I I don't have a background in medicine or science um I had to learn it all from nothing to to to to do this work um and he would he would use for example a technology called um well immunohistochemistry it's it's a it's a chemical essentially a chemical staining a microscopic staining technique and so you take bits of tissue out the gut and you uh you prepare it and you stain it and with certain things use certain antibodies and what have you and you look down a microscope and if the thing that you're looking for in this case it would be measles you'll see it you'll see a stain a color a change in the a color in the stains usually

[00:18:18] Brown um so this is a microscopic technique but then other centers around the world uh other universities in Japan and in the United States and in in the UK um people used what what is now probably everybody knows what it is now PCR the polymerase Chain Reaction which are now big news all over because of the uh efforts to tackle the coronavirus when people use this um this molecular method they couldn't find the measles virus or where they did what they well anyway I won't go into the whole detail they couldn't find the measles virus now I once was was giving a talk I can't remember where it was it was somewhere in the states I can't remember it was a lab meeting with Biology students so they were like about 18 or something like that and I'd said that he'd found measles virus using immunohistochemistry other people used uh the polymerase chain reaction and wakefield's answer to that was that the

[00:19:20] PCR wasn't sensitive enough a which point to my initial surprise my audience laughed and I couldn't I I I I I didn't think I didn't realize it was that funny I mean I realized it was rather paradoxical to suggest you could find something under a microscope you cannot find at a molecular level but that was the length that Wakefield would go to to stick with his hypothesis that measles virus was the cause of crimes and let's put that in context Brian so in 1993 I believe is when he first published that paper in the uh in the Journal of virology is that correct using his immunohistochemistry journalist medical viral J Med viral right and he published in there saying we've identified this using immunohistochemistry and as you said it was two years later that a

[00:20:15] Japanese group using PCR said we cannot replicate these results under any circumstance do you have a sense what the scientific community thought at that time um first of all it's not impossible for scientific results to conflict but was it just sort of dismissed as well you know maybe there was an artifact maybe there was a contamination maybe this person didn't understand how to do the assay correctly maybe their controls weren't right um what was what was the view of how because remember I'm not telling you to remember this I'm saying just for the listener like science is about advancing knowledge it's about being at the edge of what is known and unknown and trying to advance that and this is a potentially interesting hypothesis right let's see let's acknowledge that if measles is the cause of Crohn's Disease this would be a very important thing to know yeah so so I'm just sort of curious in hindsight or retrospect in the mid 90s when PCR which at that point was becoming the way that you would do this type of assay so now the gold standard for the reasons that I think we'll get into later on because I want to get into

[00:21:30] O'Leary's lab and really understand how one can be fooled I think that's the most interesting part of the whole thing for me but anyway yeah yeah so I mean did did you get a sense of how how the scientific Community viewed wakefield's work at that time prior to 1998 because when we get to 98 it's a whole other you know it's a whole other ball of Wax well when you say the scientific

[00:21:52] Community First you've got to remember that this is a fairly specialist field so there wouldn't be a lot of people watching this thing too carefully even outside of Gastroenterology I mean sorry within within gastroenterology I mean I'm sorry yeah within gastroenterology you know some people would people would pay a little bit of attention to but it's a very specialist it's it's probably quite a small community of of scientists who are working in this area and I think they mostly all know each other they will go to the same drug industry sponsor conferences um but um but within that there were people who thought that he was incompetent because it appeared that he'd been using um inappropriate controls in his work um because he his work that his his microscopic work looking at stains under under a microscope were involved controls involved so people were saying well how is he getting these results with controls because you would you would expect to see if he was doing using the technique wrongly you would expect it to to show up in not only in the in the specimens but also the controls if it was contamination or something like that he was claiming to use controls and some people thought he was incompetent but there were other people and I could name and I don't think he would mind me naming it him a professor in London called Tom McDonald who's a uh now the dean of research at uh in fact at a medical center where uh the Queen's husband is currently resident as we speak um and um and he was of the view even then that wakefield's worked with fraudland that he was concocting results even then and that created a problem for me as I was saying earlier because it it

[00:23:48] I wanted to like paint wakeford in the best possible light so I never really in the book went too much into that because I didn't I suppose to be authorial about it I didn't want to piss on my own bonfire I mean I didn't want to I didn't want to lead people from the get-go to suspect that uh he was doing what he came to be shown to be doing elsewhere um so I kind of glossed over that a little bit but there were people even then who said that his work was fraudulent and in fact um Professor

[00:24:22] McDonald uh declined to go when he he was part of a team at another London Hospital who moved to where Wakefield was going to work or was working in Hampstead North London and he refused to go he took a much less interesting and I don't know whether it was a better paid or Worse paid job way away from 100 miles or so away from London rather than go and work in a place where Wakefield was so there was there was no clear consensus as what explained how it could be that wakeful would find these things by microscopic techniques in fact he said that he'd seen the virus under a microscope which I think it's important to explain to people that that's not possible well uh he well anyway that's the that's that was the claim in the paper that was the claim was this an electron was this election an election oh I'm sorry so I thought you meant I thought you meant light microscopy okay no when we get to him seeing it was it was the electron microscope um and um and ultimately that came apart the wheels came off that one as well but um uh but that was the idea but so there was this there was this confusion and medicine as I certainly found I certainly found this as I as I went on through my inquiries um doctors I think and perhaps perhaps um professionals generally are very reluctant to come to the conclusion that somebody is dishonest as opposed to wrong dishonesty inevitably requires the intent to deceive or intend to mislead people are very reluctant to come to that conclusion and that's that's understandable you want to give people the benefit of the doubt so the world just kind of moved on and accepted that there was this doctor with a little team of people he was trying to gather together in London who maintained that measles virus was the cause of Crohn's disease in the face of really very compelling evidence from multiple centers that in Crohn's disease measles was not a causal Factor Wakefield just dismissed these uh other centers and said they didn't know what they were doing but he did they were looking in the wrong place or the virus was present in a levels below below the threshold of detection by PCR but not below the level of detection by microscopic immunohistochemistry techniques which in itself I'm trying I'm trying to think of an analogy because obviously I've done both of these techniques personally and you know there are people listening to this who have spent time in a laboratory that will understand how ridiculous and absurd that statement is but I but I appreciate that most people don't and

[00:27:07] I'm trying to think of an analogy it's sort of like saying um I can see the details on the moon with my naked eye but I can't see them with the most high-powered telescope because the resolution isn't good enough it's not a good telescope well you don't know how to use it it's not it's not a good enough telescope lens so that's why

[00:27:34] I can't see what's on the moon that's why you can't see what's there but I can see it with my naked eye I mean that's how absurd that claim is so yeah that's why I say undergraduate biology students laughed when when I I was three until I used it ever since I love so let's fast forward a few years now into a place where his thesis undergoes a change right a new layer is added to this and it becomes effectively um the main uh story that you are writing about which is a very famous paper uh that came out in 1998 in a very famous and highly regarded Journal called the Lancet which would probably rank in the top five um in the united pardon me in the world scientifically um so let's talk a little bit about that paper which I have to admit I don't think at the time I realized how pathetic it was in other words you you know it's a very poorly done report on 12 patients not recruited at random I mean you're going to go through all of this but um it's almost amazing not almost it's outright amazing that the Lance had published it in the first place let alone took so long um to uh to basically pull it um but but let's talk about what it is that um took Wakefield down this new path to perhaps an even bigger Discovery or idea right so after he came up with this idea about measles virus causing crunch disease one criticism that was leveled was that well you say that uh measles virus is causing Crohn's disease but at the time it's not true now but at the time the instance of Crohn's Disease was Rising uh and uh measles was in decline because of the Advent of vaccination so the vaccine itself he realized he I don't know whether he needed encyclopedia to tell him this but um he realized contained live measles virus so he modified his theory uh his hypothesis at that stage to Encompass uh vaccines causing Crohn's disease so there he was saying that vaccines were linked to

[00:30:04] Crohn's disease and this Drew him to the attention of somebody else a man named Richard Barr a Richard Barr was a uh an obscure lawyer uh an office working lawyer called twig in the UK call a solicitor in eastern England in a provincial small provincial town in eastern England doing humdrum work magistrates courts you know petty petty offense Petty offenders writing Wills things like that house conveyancing and he was in fact a specialist in written a book about it on house conveyancing this man Richard Barr and as I explained the books I won't go into now in massive detail he he got a contract with the British government agency to try to show that the MMR vaccine the measles mumps and rubella vaccine was the cause of developmental issues particularly autism and how Richard Barr descended on autism picked autism out of a whole cluster of other things is a story in itself um and um this man Richard Barr was looking to find a doctor who would help him would agree with him that vaccines caused ultimately they settled on autism and his problem was there weren't any in the UK who really took that position at all it was it was such a an out to the left kind of idea that he couldn't find anybody of The remotest credibility to advance that hypothesis and without a quote unquote expert to say ah yes I say that there's a probable cause that measles in the MMR causes autism he ended up going to this man a bowel surgeon train as a bowel surgeon whose subject was Crohn's disease and whose whole theory was about measles causing

[00:32:13] Crohn's disease he hired him this lawyer hired him this was in early 1996 after some talks between them beforehand so their Wakefield was now hired by a lawyer a very generous hourly rates to help make a case that the measles vaccine in MMR caused autism now this was interesting not least because Wakefield knew nothing about autism and he knew nothing about vaccines and neither of these were any part of his training uh any part of his uh professional expertise but he was the best that this man Richard Barr could get so together they set about trying to prove that the MMR vaccine caused autism uh it's a long story as to why they picked autism but but they did this lawyer picked autism long long story about why that was very interesting and like many ways I wish

[00:33:18] I'd gone into it more but do you want to just give sort of a a short a short overview of it well it was it was it was essentially that that this man Richard Barr latched on to another player in all this which was a woman called Jackie Fletcher and Jackie Fletcher had a child who uh within a couple of weeks of receiving his MMR shot started having seizures and went on to show uh serious neurological illness transformative lifelong damage or or or why is damage presupposes that well anyway um and she had seen media coverage of the uh of an issue to do with vaccines and while she was in the hospital uh talking um to other parents one of them or some other of them gave her the idea that vaccines could cause this injury to her child now a child didn't have autism uh uh I hate using the word but but I mean specialist Tuesday I suppose I can she had a profoundly and handicapped child um and she she came to believe that the cause was the vaccine nothing to do with autism so in order but in order for her to sue in the United Kingdom she had to get lots and lots of other people to say the same thing because the only place you could ever get money to do that was a government scheme where they provided money for people who couldn't afford to

[00:35:04] Sue and who could afford to sue drug companies or vaccine manufacturers so um they they kind of she got together with this lawyer Richard Barr and with Wakefield and together they made music over this idea that the MMR vaccine caused autism it was it was generated basically because autism which which although the phenomenon the the the the manifestations of what came to be called autism have been present you could go back to like the Victorian um uh lunatic asylums in the United Kingdom and you would you would see autism and there

[00:35:44] I've I've got video in from television programs long before MMR was even even licensed um which you would say Well in that period you would say that was autism autism had come to be constructive a lot of people don't realize about autism is that autism is a construct there's no it's not like um it's not like let me think of an example it's not like

[00:36:05] Crohn's disease autism is a is a kind of tech box diagnosis of of different signs and symptoms which are brought together and clustered together and it's really been created a bit like schizophrenia really and in fact schizophrenia kind of went into decline with the rise of autism um a bit like childhood schizophrenia autism was was was an emerging diagnosis in the early 1990s in fact the American

[00:36:32] Medical Association the World Health Organization both brought out diagnostic categories in the early 1990s identifying a spectrum of disorders one of which was autism and there were several others so this was a this was something which when this Jackie Fletcher this woman running this uh she she's running this effort to sue for her own child she set up a group and they started doing surveys and in those surveys they came up with quite a few cases of autism because it was beginning to be diagnosed and so they they kind of said okay well that's what that's the most common diagnosis we can cluster together so we'll go after that so that's why they went after MMR on autism simply the simply the the artifactual situation of there being a newly emergent um uh diagnostic category and also the introduction in the UK of the

[00:37:28] MMR vaccine so they went after this idea and Wakefield was then enlisted so Richard Barr provided what initially was most important was the money for Wakefield to do research and so what they did is they made a Grant application very similar to any scientific research who wants to look into something if you make a Grant application to somebody who's got some money and the people who had the money with this government agency was actually called the legal aid board operating a thing called the legal aid fund which funded people who couldn't afford to sue drug companies to sue the manufacturers of MMR so Wakefield had the job of ensuring that this lawsuit was launched at the time the lawsuit hadn't been launched it had just been collecting clients collecting anecdotes collecting stories taking statements and preparing so that the gut this government agency would fund them to go forward and Sue the drug companies so that was wakefield's mission and they made the Grant application to the legal aid board um in uh June of 1996. now the paper we are getting to that you mentioned was published in February 1998 so this scheme between these people and there are a couple of other people involved in it as well was the origins of the idea that vaccines caused autism and ultimately we would find they were this was the origins the Akon if you like

[00:38:56] Acorn if you like from which the anti-vaxxy movement even if today emerged to create the issues there create writing over the coronavirus shots so it's this that was the explanation in very sketchy sketched out terms of why they hired Wakefield Richard Barr was going to get the money from the legal board Jackie Fletcher this woman she started an organization which she she gave her the name of Jabs to um she would bring the clients she would recruit the clients and Wakefield would do the tests that were going to show that the MMR vaccine was a causative was the cause of autism in fact he The

[00:39:44] Proposal he put to the legal aid board with this solicitor Richard Barr said in advance of a single child in this paper the 12 child paper which you mentioned before a single one of those children had been investigated at that hospital they had made the proposal to the league labor that they would show that there was a new syndrome which included both inflammatory bowel disease which is what interested in

[00:40:15] Wakefield and autism which which interested the lawyer and Jackie Fletcher the campaigner and they bolted it all together made a Grant application and a a duty lawyer in the government's legal aid board the woman she was in her late 20s ultimately signed the document for Wakefield to be employed to do research that ultimately was what ended up in the Lancet 18 months or so year and a half later in this paper that created this enormous

[00:40:55] Fury and what nobody knew until well you know I came along I suppose I have to say that although everyone criticizes me now particularly doctors who sort of say always self-aggrandizing and they do things like saying no I actually did one at my Publishers University Johns Hopkins the other day and somebody said oh some of the people right said oh well you helped you helped one mask this I said no I didn't help it I did it and that's one of the extraordinary things about this story that the medical establishment just kind of sat back and let all this go on and it appeared that only a journalist spotted the grounds to believe there was something funny going on here but anyway so this was the background to this paper and then in February 1998 I'm sorry to talk so long but anyway February 1998 this paper was published in the Lancet which in terms of general medicine I would say was the number two Journal after the New England Journal of

[00:41:52] Medicine it's it's way down the rankings from Nature and Science but their General Science journals so they they carry a lot of other stuff other than medicine when you get into general medicine he goes broadly goes New England Journal medicine uh the Lancet which kind of has a bit of a tussle with the Journal of the American Medical

[00:42:10] Association annals of internal medicine then you get to the British medical journal and onward down you go so very prestigious Journal a 12 child case series and you said Peter earlier that I'll sharp in a moment but you said earlier that that this was a ropey paper and so I thought I don't agree with that actually at face value if you it's it's kind of with with the the the the knowledge of hindsight when you know the story you look at that paper and you say well this is all a joke and yeah but at the time at the time it was very credible because it was a case series now when you think about case series um it's just it's literally a collection of anecdotes so for example Crohn's disease when that was discovered in the 90s well it wasn't discovered but when it was formally characterized in the 1930s fully described um that was a case series of tissue samples taken from 14 patients uh autism itself which was first characterized and properly described uh in fact from Josh Hopkins University you know Publishers in my book um uh on 11 children it was a it was a case series of 11 children AIDS what came to be known as AIDS was first described classically described in 1981 based on five gay men in Los Angeles so there's nothing there's nothing uh uh questionable or improper or inadequate about a case series of 12 children yeah I think I think what I was referring to is something we'll get to later uh so it's less the size of it and

[00:43:52] I think if my memory serves me correct let me Brian there was not an Institutional review board that had approved what those children went through well the pipe has said there was pipe said there was I see it said but that turned out to be incorrect is that turned out to be a lot turned out to be a lie it was a lie um and uh no the the the um it's the see what inter just as kind of a brief aside a lot of people think I'm like you know a pro-vaccine campaign and

[00:44:25] I think you probably think this and I'm not and that is not what got me involved in this in the first place what got me involved in this in the first place was to do with the scientific method how how was how did this paper how did this paper work what was going on behind it one of the things that really bugs me is people who believe they can judge research by a text on a piece of paper or on a screen and you can't those papers are not even the study people use

[00:44:55] I'm sure you aware this that the people use the word study and paper interchangeably and they they believe that that the paper is what it's all about and what I was able to do and I still believe I believe it nobody's ever done it I don't understand but certainly no journalists have done it I've been asking like since last year publicly for if anybody knows some who's done anything similar I'd like to know about it because it would be interesting and I'd incorporate it into the into the story to go around the back of the paper and find out who the patients were what was wrong with them what was their diagnoses what was their histories what were their test results and all that and

[00:45:31] I did it on these 12 children so let's let's talk about it because it is it's so powerful and as you said if this is the acorn of the movement we have to resort to the long and arid dissertations as as bastia said and really understand that so let's start with a fundamental question of how were these subjects recruited right well advice value they appeared just to be part of the routine caseload of this Hospital's uh bowel Clinic a pediatric bowel Clinic and essentially the picture was this over a period between um uh well appears about over a period of about maximum six to nine months a series of parents turned up with their children at this bowel clinic in the hospital a pediatric bowel Clinic and they said where's the effect of my child was developing perfectly normally perfectly happy child eleven of these children were boys one was a girl uh all of them were white um and they my child is going to be perfectly normally we gave him or in one case her the MMR took the doctor got the MMR and within days specifically within 14 days that was the range that was the maximum range that they they allegedly reported within 14 days uh and some of them one of them was said to have come on immediately after the vaccine so between immediately and 14 days eight out of these 12 family parents the parents have I have to express it carefully because two of the children were brothers so I have to say the the parents of eight of the 12 children uh uh said that their child the first symptoms of their child's developmental issue autism overwhelmingly um came on within 14 days of an MMR shot and at face value if that was true then that could be potentially the first snapshot of a hidden epidemic of catastrophic injuries to Children it may be that these doctors at this Hospital were just better doctors more thorough ask more questions um had uh had you know just more time or whatever and that possibly all over the world children were experiencing this and just nobody had noticed so the fact that this paper said these things um was extraordinary in itself and it got network coverage right across the spectrum that night we the UK then had five National networks and they all carried it on the Evening News very substantial media coverage because the hospital and medical school convened a press conference which was chaired by the dean of the medical school and one of the people on the platform with what the table anyway with Wakefield was a professor of gastroenterology the man who factored hired Wakefield from Canada so so the media thought well this must be something important and it had been trailed in advance they'd been there had been leaks and promotional things have been done to attract more and more attention to this thing they absolutely knew what they were doing extra phone lines extra landlines were installed in the hospital uh this is back in the day of mechanical answering machines they hired they bought went out and bought mechanical answering machines to fill the public alarm that they knew they were going to create and this hospital this medical school and this Andrew Wakefield announced to the world their probable cause of autism as the MMR vaccine and of course the the result would be obvious and it was tell people what actually um what those kids went through when they were enrolled in a study that as we would later learn did not even have um an IRB to approve it what was the actual set of procedures that these children went through well it was described in advance this is rather interesting because it was described in advance to the legal board to the funding agency to which they'd made this Grant application to do this work uh uh as the the so first I should say these children are children who don't like their lives being disrupted these are the kind of children who the slightest variation in some cases to their routine will cause them great distress um it's one of one of the Curiosities of autism um so they were brought to London none of them lived in London the nearest family was 60 miles away uh some were 280 miles away and one was in the United States yeah one was on the island of Jersey in the English Channel near France and one was from the bay area of California and just to hit pause for a second that immediately speaks to the idea that these weren't just kids being seen in this hospital as part of the routine caseload but let's put that aside for a moment yeah I mean the idea that you would bring you would bring somebody from the

[00:51:04] Bay Area from the bay area of California to London for medical treatment is is particularly that hospital is absurd the idea that that there aren't good hospitals in San Francisco or California generally is is an absurdity so that in itself interestingly enough that that that child was net well and he won't go into that it's like that's I'm going to but but yes back to your point we're talking about children who um who any disruption of routine is traumatic and so we're gonna bring these kids here and what was done to them okay so the children were brought in on a

[00:51:42] Sunday uh different Sundays they didn't look up at the same time different Sundays on Sunday afternoon they would turn up uh a doctor would take the histories uh from the parents so the parent would simply be interviewed as to what they could remember uh the child would be examined they would then be bowel prepped for colonoscopy in fact it was an ileo colonoscopy I mean I've had a colonoscopy but I've never had an ileo colonoscopy in a colonoscopy you go in I don't need to tell you but there might be a few people who you know might just need the route map you go in through the anus you come up through the sigmoid colon you come up the descending colon you cross at the splenic flexure across the uh transverse colon which sort of sags across behind the breastbone you turn into at the hepatic flexure you go down the ascending colon to the cecum which is pretty much where the appendix is and then there's a valve there so that's a colonoscopy to do that then there's a valve a little valve and if you go through that valve that valve separates the large bowel the colon from the small bowel and that particular stretch of the small bowel is called the ilium and the first couple of centimeters of that is accessible to an instrument um a a colonoscope or endoscope if you like but um and you can get into the first two centimeters and the thing is when you go past that valve into the small intestine the small intestine is the bit that um that takes um uh nutrients out of food it's actually prior to the colon so so from your mouth this is the this is the top end rather than the bottom or the distal end so you get into the the distal end of the small intestine the small intestine is what takes uh nutrition out of food and the large bowel more or less takes water out of your feces so that we don't try all stuff around behind us well for most of our Lives anyway um so the this scope with this instrument would go up round down and then there was a quite a difficult maneuver to get into the small intestine it's quite a significant um uh piece of work in itself and in fact later not actually one of the 12 bit later in the series a child had catastrophic damage uh caused to him by this procedure and uh there was a huge financial settlement from the hospital but anyway so that was that was the first thing they do some of them also had up upper endoscopies where you push a tube down the throat and and look around um it mostly in the duodenum and that area um so so that that would be the first thing that would happen the next day and then most of the children had lumbar puncture spinal taps which is a needle basically pushed into the spine to take fluid essentially brain fluid through the spine they were required to undergo MRI scans um uh eegs electroencephalograms um and uh let me think what else barrier meals where you're you're essentially x-rayed you you drink a radioactive drink and your x-rayed to see to get an image of the of the uh of the gut uh blood tests which generally required with these kids three people to hold them down in fact Andrew Wakefield sued me over some of this we maybe get to that at some point he sued me and one of the things he sued me over was saying that these children were being held down by three people in fact yes they were there were children screaming one child collapsed three times in the corridor two children had to be one had to be admitted to another hospital after discharge from the Royal free for apparent side effects or Consequences of lumbar puncture another one had a an

[00:55:34] Emergency doctor course to their home um so they had that they had blood tests uh uh and uh what else did they have I've probably forgotten something and and some of these children were so constipated upon arrival that if I recall the colonoscopies were very difficult colonoscopies they did not have easy bowel preps the way you know a child might um the irony of course is that most of these kids were anything but having inflammatory bowel disease or Crohn's disease given the incredible constipation that many of them experienced you can have constipation with inflammatory bowel disease but it's very it's it's unusual and it's usually part of the differential diagnosis that the patient doesn't have inflammatory bowel disease and they also had blood tests in fact the the clinicians working on this had themselves divide well I would say devised but published on a panel of blood tests which they used to do which which determined whether or not there was a probable cause to do colonoscopies or ilio colonoscopies in this case and those blood tests all came back normal um but I still went ahead and did it anyway because Wakefield had said to them which is part of his contract with the legal board to help Sue vaccine manufacturers that um that there might be some mine lesser inflammation that wasn't being picked up by the blood test just like with the with the measles virus not being detected by the PCR because the PCR wasn't sensitive enough so the blood tests weren't sensitive enough to detect the bowel disease that he said these children had or suspected they had in fact he told the legal aid board that they did have it before he did the research which purportedly discovered it but anyway that's just that's just the way these things go in this story so how does John O'Leary enter this story because he becomes a very important collaborator uh as as effectively doing the most important pathology here correct yeah so what wait for see the what what Wakefield was trying to do the reason why he wanted these tests done was that he was looking for measles virus so if your hypothesis is that measles virus causes Crohn's disease or causes autism or whatever well those two things um the thing about the last part the small intestine the ilium that is the most characteristic part of the bowel where Crohn's disease is found

[00:58:10] Crohn's disease can can manifest anywhere between the mouth and the anus in fact it can but where it most characteristically manifests is exactly where they went to and this got Wakefield really excited so what he wanted to do was to get into the small intestines of these children in order to find the measles first because if you found measles virus live long after vaccination we talked about it persisting years after vaccination these were some of these kids were age nine some of them were the youngest was three the oldest was nine and a half so you're talking about children who would have been vaccinated years previously and his hypothesis was that the measles virus was persisting in the small intestines and he was going to find it so when the when the the um the endoscopist so basically when you do a colonoscopy you go all the way in without doing very much you just try and get in and as you say some of these children were so constipated they couldn't get in and actually had to abandon the the thing and and and clean them out again and then one child they said they were gonna ultimately we're gonna do it three times until the mother said no no more no more of this um but um so he wanted to find the measles virus in the small intestine so when the cola cut the endoscope is got as far as the small intestine he then

[00:59:43] Man Came named Simon merch did some of it and another guy called um Mike Thompson did uh some of it um they would take little biopsy Snips they would snip off the on the end of the uh colonoscope they got little jaws and they would snip off a bit of tissue and bring it back the through the thing there'd be a nurse standing to one side who would like be pulling these things back through little little rods down the tube um and then the the Kaleidoscope will come back through the gut taking little bits of tissue at each of the points at the at the ascending colon at the transverse colon at the descending colon in this uh in the sigmoid colon at the rectum and but the the gold the gold in this for Wakefield was then the small intestine and so so in the waiting in the endoscopy Suite where this went on um there was a a scientist who was actually a PhD he was doing his PhD working under wakefield's Direction um waiting to take samples of the tissue away and freeze it in liquid nitrogen so that it could be tested uh by the using the polymerase chain reaction for measles virus and yes they this scientist um did this way in fact his PhD was it was a very good piece of work it's not like a PhD in the Arts I mean where you can well you just I think in the art sometimes you get a PhD just for turning up and writing the thing but he actually did a bit of Science and uh and he he he developed a gold standard uh PCR test for measles virus and Wakefield uh supervised that and they published on that and then they went on in wakefield's own lab to use the PCR technique to identify measles virus and they couldn't find measles virus in any of these children and wakefield's answers that was oh the

[01:01:52] PCR wasn't sensitive enough and and why had he switched to PCR here as opposed to going back to the immunohistochemistry because he had already made this criticism in 95 when the Japanese group said using PCR we can't find it and he had previously in 93 said oh no it's here with immunohistochemistry so why in 98 is he not going back to immunohistochemistry that's a good question I like your questions I mean it's it's I don't normally get doctors doing these conversations so nobody asked it's a very good question the reason why he wanted to do PC had to do PCR was in the

[01:02:31] Grant application to the British government's legal aid board he'd said up front in years before well 18 months before the paper was written and before any of these children had been investigating the hospital that they would undergo PCR for strain specific sequencing and I think probably everybody well everyone who's got a television set or radio these days knows what that means because it's it's so part of the discussion over um over vaccines um so he he wanted to show that this virus came from a vaccine because the virus the measles virus could come from three there could be three possibilities one it's a virus that comes from nature you you caught it from somebody one is that it's a laboratory strain because there are particular strains of the virus which are kept for laboratory work and the other is it came from a vaccine but in order to determine which one it was you couldn't use immunistic chemistry because it wouldn't it wouldn't get you down to the nucleotides which is what you need to get down to in order to sequence classic procedures absolute workers I mean maybe to just explain to people it's immunohistochemistry might have the ability to recognize there's a person there PCR can fingerprint the person and this is sort of like saying there are three people you know and I just need to see which fingerprint it is to know if it's the lab strain which would be a contamination if it showed up in your sample a naturally occurring strain so it's a transmission that you acquired versus a vaccine strain yeah yeah and he was trying to demonstrate and test the hypothesis if we're going to continue to give him the benefit of the doubt at this point he was testing a hypothesis that said yeah

[01:04:15] I'd have to take issue with your use of the word testing um he he wasn't testing hypothesis he was advancing it and simply trying to prove that it was so um he at no stage did what a scientist would do which would be to test it by attempting to falsify it try and find some some reason to believe that he was wrong he simply wanted to prove that he was right and he'd he'd set out what it was he was going to find in his Grant application before a single one of these children went anywhere near the hospital it's a totally random aside but I remember you made the point about the relative lack of rigor that went into his Grant application um it wasn't like he was applying through the most rigorous or replying to the most rigorous granting entity and it actually reminds me of the first

[01:05:13] Grant application I ever wrote in my life which was in medical school for a very small uh project it was for a summer research project and at my medical school they had this amazing thing where you could get paid an enormous sum of money to do research for a summer it was basically a great way to offset your tuition it was it was it amounted to about a third of your tuition for the year and so I put my little application together and I just happened to review it with a guy named Pat Brown who's a very famous scientist at Stanford um and I must say I have to hand it to him he just schooled me on what it means to write a scientific proposal and he didn't pull any punches with how pathetic it was and part of it was you know this lack of at the time understanding you know I was a first year medical student I really didn't understand what it meant to have a hypothesis generate a series of questions and go through this this process we're describing um and I had to go back to the drawing board and start all over again and I bet that if someone like a Pat Brown were to take a look at the proposal put forth by

[01:06:25] Wakefield they would have had the same reaction which is this is not a person who has the chops to do this type of investigation um and again I think it speaks to the another point you made which is the relative lack of policing in the field and by policing I don't mean literal policing but I mean self-auditing and self-policing yes I mean the the the Grant application he put in was received by somebody with no medical background and no medical no medical or scientific advice or country opinion or anything was sought by the funding agency it was literally a lawyer a young lawyer with no uh back background in in science who simply uh authorized the work so after Wakefield and his his colleague cannot find any evidence of the measal virus either naturally occurring or through vaccine um in the distal ilium via PCR uh in theory that should be the end of this inquiry at this point in time but what happens next well so what he did was he using public money he flew to New York and found a professor an Irish Professor who was then doing uh teaching in uh in New York and um and asked him if he could use his

[01:07:46] PCR equipment this this professor man named John O'Leary was going back to Ireland back to Dublin to work at a hospital the coombe Women's Hospital it was a maternity hospital not exactly a great Center of scientific inquiry but he was going back there and he said to Wakefield yes I can find uh whatever you need to find and then proceeded to set about trying to find measles virus in uh bowel tissues taken from children at the

[01:08:21] Royal free hospital in Hampstead in North London and he was paid an enormous amount of public money to do this um and uh he ultimately from his lab they published a paper claiming that they'd found measles virus in nearly all the children that wakefields had said samples uh from now I think to really explain what happened in O'Leary's lab one has to understand a little bit about

[01:08:51] PCR and what the number of Cycles mean what amplification means um and ultimately we'll even talk a little bit about the controls and again I I I don't I don't ask this of you lightly because I know that these are technical topics but again if one truly wants to understand what took place I think one has to understand what took place in O'Leary's lab because in many ways that is the epicent in my opinion I could be maybe you would interpret the facts differently and I would respect your opinion more than my own but I almost view O'Leary's lab as the epicenter of the epicenter of the fraud

[01:09:32] I agree with you I mean I actually I agree with you um and and I agree and I I appreciate the point you're making because you would not believe how difficult it is to describe um molecular amplification in a single paragraph I think I'll use two paragraphs in different places but uh then to a certain extent I repeat it slightly um to get it down to its to its simplest level and yet still be accurate so maybe

[01:10:03] I'll try I mean I'll I mean I'm doing off the top of my head now and I can't obviously haven't got words in front of me to shuffle around but essentially this is this is in fact it's what's topical at the moment all over the world this stuff is being done on samples from the jet members of the public uh who are being tested for uh evidence of infection with the coronavirus that's right every time we go out and get it I mean I've probably had 20 coronavirus tests via PCR in the last nine months and maybe that's more than the average person but very few people at this point will or not have had PCR touch their life so whether it's a coronavirus test or a crime scene that is trying to demonstrate if that microscopic drop of blood is from a suspect it it would go through this amazing technology for which the Nobel Prize was awarded in the 1980s to to Kerry Mullis yeah so um and it something isn't in the book I don't think I'm not sure what's in the book is that partly it begins with the discovery of um a polymerase uh in the Yellowstone

[01:11:17] National Park now you can say what's a polymerase tell me what a polymerase is just to shorten it a bit so it's an enzyme basically that catalyzes a reaction so I mean I can even shorten a bit of this whole thing for you right which is um you when it when you have a double strand of DNA how does DNA replicate so there are basically two reactions that you want to be able to do with DNA sometimes you want to just make more of it so you for when a cell is dividing to make another version of itself it has to break apart that double-strand of DNA and it has to make another template of each of it and it uses enzymes to do the breaking apart and then the building and there's a code for DNA it's a very simple code because there are four letters and each letter has a known corresponding letter so you you you have these uh you have this code where you basically break it apart you you replicate it and then you you duplicate

[01:12:16] The Strand there's another side of breaking apart DNA which is if you want to make protein and here you actually break it apart to make a single strand of something called messenger RNA and the RNA carries that message out to be transcribed as a protein so it depends on the application in which you're doing it but but these polymerase enzymes basically facilitate different aspects of this process so like like um like the Evening News I'll do a little bit maybe maybe on that so so um so yes though so there's this ladder uh joined together and this is this is the classic double helix of DNA and so we'll do the machine version because that's what we did these days this is all automated not so long ago not so many decades ago this was all done manually very time consuming extremely boring process now done by machine and the Machine uh heats up the the test tubes with this with your samples in and a few other things controls and what have you and the as it as it heats up with these these things the the ladders split apart um so that instead of having something joined together you've got them separate um and it and and in in the case of measles virus you have a you have something a preliminary step they're called reverse transcription where where because the virus is a RNA is a single strand rather than DNA which is a double strand RNA ribonucleic acid is a single strand so for this this technology to work you need two strands um for reasons which I'm sure you'll probably get to um so you then so what happens initially is a a second strand is created um synthetically so that you then have what is called C DNA which is a which is is is a kind of an artificial construct of DNA and then once that's done won't go into how it's done but once that's done and you've then got this piece of

[01:14:27] DNA the machine heats up the um the material the test tubes in it and these two uh ladders split apart um and at that point this polymerase this enzyme that amazingly was discovered in the Yellowstone National Park um goes along the broken rungs of this ladder and creates a complementary second ladder so for each of the points rungs on the ladder it creates another one which joins to it and these are the nucleotides that uh you know the the base nucleotides the fundamental building blocks of life and so so when you start off with these these two these split apart the polymerase runs along from one end of the of the unbelievable really runs along from one end of the ladder um to the other and then you've got two um DNA two double-stranded samples so then you cool it the cooling brings these two together and they solidify and then you repeat the procedure they split apart again the attack polymerase goes along creates the extra thing and then instead of two you've got four and then you cool it down you as you cool it down then you heat it up again and you keep repeating this process until two becomes four four becomes eight eight becomes 64 is it yeah it goes like it goes It goes exponentially yeah and on you guys have two Powers

[01:16:07] Yeah yeah before very long it becomes astronomical unbelievable numbers and then at that point you can you can read it and it's read by well it's read by things called primes primers and probes what primers do these are these are other little bits of um of nucleotides in a chemical solution which bind to very specific nucleotides they're like bookends so you've got these the you've got these these these uh primers which take a slice essentially Mark out a slice and this other thing comes along and identifies called a probe and if the thing that you're looking for is present the whole thing by Magic which is now all being monitored by laser beam uh which is like taking taking samples measurements uh by millisecond as to why this is going on will uh give a give a signal which is then recorded on a recorded on a computer and generates a a curve and this curve um uh it it starts off flat and then it rises and then it goes what's the word I the asymptotes into a flat it's kind of a rough kind of s shape and with before it asymptotes um goes flat you take a reading uh and that's usually at about 35 Cycles right and that's to put that in perspective that's that means 2 to the 35 copies you've potentially made and you know by the time I was doing this it had become so automated um the kit was called tacman like taq because of the polymerase you mentioned the attack polymerase and so it was called you know real time Quantified PCR quantitative and it was really quite amazing because as the scientist you only had to prepare the reagent and it was literally as simple as a Betty Crocker cooking exercise where you put in your primer as you put in your probes you put in your tack you put in your sample and the

[01:18:30] Machine would go through everything you just said the Heat and cooling heating cooling heating cooling cycles and it would spit out for you the information of what's present and how much of it is present because remember you can go up to 35 Cycles but if you start with a large amount of nuclear material you'll see it much sooner and in fact even with the coronavirus that's an important feature right so when a patient tests positive via PCR you know you have to remember these tests are really geared for their negative predictive value more than their positive predictive value you would like it if a lab would report how many cycles were necessary to demonstrate a positive test and in a clinical assay we're going to come to why all of this is relevant in a clinical assay you need to be able to report the number of Cycles because it matters if it was positive after 20

[01:19:22] Cycles versus 30 Cycles that's a far greater that's a that's a very big resolution difference in something being present so I think you did a fantastic job by the way explaining PCR no I think it's going to be all kinds of people like like listening to this or gonna go oh no no it's not no no yeah so so um let's now go back to O'Leary's lab so he I mean the way you describe it it's like he was basically paid to find something yeah yeah so O'Leary has now sent the samples the ileocecal biopsies of these children and he has what at the time is a state of the art machine right the ABI prism 7700 yeah I guess at the time yeah yeah um and as you said this is a machine that is not rated for a clinical diagnosis correct it does not have a clear yeah it does not have a clear certification one cannot make a clinical diagnosis with it it is a research tool only and the um the company that makes it says what if you go more than 35 Cycles what is the inference of what you're looking at uh but basically and in fact Tony fauci said the same thing he did a video just a couple of months ago where he was talking about uh cycles and he came up with 35 as well basically once you go past 35 where the where the rising line ask him that word asymptote it's basically goes flat um then you're going to be getting if you get if you get at that point if you haven't found what you're looking for um then you either conclude it's not there or you've done something wrong and you need to need to start again I mean you you said how simple this thing appears to be and it's interesting that you you would say it that way in fact the the the the the apparent Simplicity is is beguiling and and misleading because well it wasn't it wasn't this simple in 1998 um not and and and furthermore um you can still be fooled by the machine an awful lot yeah they they the the the technology is so sensitive I mean it's it's it's in many ways it's why it's reason why it's I mean we're we're past we're probably into 2001 or something but now but um the one of the reasons why it's a research tool and not a clinical instrument was because so much goes wrong and and the the the technology is is so sensitive that that just anything will uh create contamination and if you're getting if you're getting signals after 35 and you think they're positive signals it's probably contamination or some kind of error you've made in the thing and even with the coronavirus the test which so now we're dealing with a couple things that are different one you're dealing with a clinical grade PCR assay so that means it is under far greater regulatory scrutiny and it is far more standardized than any anything that you know someone like O'Leary was using secondly even under those conditions the test is far better at demonstrating something is negative than positive so we say it has much greater negative predictive value so when the test comes back negative you can almost with certainty 99 more than 99 certainty say it's truly negative when it comes back positive you really don't know that it's positive you have to repeat the test and any physician listening to this or patient listening to this who's had either themself or a patient with a positive PCR for covid realizes the first thing you do if they're not symptomatic is test again and even in my practice we've seen three false positives on PCR that were later found to not be positive and that's just the nature of using a test that is so sensitive hmm so anyway so Leary was this man John

[01:23:13] O'Leary um was hired by Wakefield using uh well on on wakefield's recommendation it was actually hired by Richard Barr the lawyer that was working with Wakefield to test these samples on these children these children with developmental issues mostly autism from the Royal free hospital and O'Leary found or at least well this is this is a game where you get use of words is very um is very important I won't say he found he reported uh measles virus in pretty much

[01:23:45] I don't know nine out of ten children uh and uh this created huge interest they published a paper and um this was apparently the the evidence that the measles virus was there in the guts of these children um but then you get to the question of well if if if they really did find measles where was it from was it from one of these three things I was talking earlier on was it from nature was it from a natural viral infection picked up from somebody was it uh uh from the MMR vaccine or was it a laboratory strain because

[01:24:29] Laboratories who work in these areas will often have and in fact they have a special usually have a special room where this these materials are prepared called the plasmid room where they prepare samples of laboratory strain virus in the case of bees also there will be it within this laboratory situation of o'learys there would be laboratory strain virus being used and manipulated on the premises so then the question would be okay he says he's found measles virus well sit you sequence it so in addition to this particular the PCR machine that does this process and you can say well okay there's an element of there's an element of identifying a sequence there because your primers and probes these things the bookend and then lock onto the um the samples um uh nucleotides would would do so more effectively if what you were looking for was there but nevertheless there's a second machine a sequencer these days they're they're called capillary sequences and they they they literally run the the uh individual nucleotides these meniscally tiny things which are contained coiled up in in the the DNA of every cell in your body and they string it all out and run them through past laser beams and they will identify each and every one of those nucleotides a mark out for you what it is what are the four nucleotides do you want to do the four bases because I I think we can spare people but a T C and

[01:26:11] G would be their acronyms yeah um and it's and it's it's slightly different with um with RNA you substitute in you but yeah yeah but um so they run so there's a machine and O'Leary had one of these machines in his lab and in fact he was invited to give evidence to uh with Wakefield sitting next to him O'Leary's represented himself as being an independent researcher and in fact he was in a business deal with the guy sitting next to him Andrew Wakefield they had got actually got a whole raft of business plans and and joint ventures and money money go rounds and you know directors of each other's companies and all this kind of stuff and um he he actually said in in into the Congressional committee that he had one of these sequences he identified it gave the make and what have you in his lab and so did O'Leary's lab produce the sequences to answer that question was it a virus from nature was it a virus from the MMR or was it a virus from Laboratory and he never ever produced uh any sequence data from those children at all so this is why the book has this process described in it and why we're talking about it in such detail now because it's important that people understand what that means to not ultimately sequence your samples to read that code that can definitively fingerprint the virus where it's from and if it was from a vaccine then which vaccine was it from a vaccine from this company or that company or whatever and he never produced any sequences and when it ultimately came to the lawsuit that was launched in the United Kingdom Andrew wakefield's play was published in the

[01:28:15] February the lawsuit was uh was approved to go and was the first Ritz was served the first legal papers were served on the the defendant drug companies the following October finally when it came to the crunch and what and a lawsuit which consumed in today's money roughly 100 million US Dollars between the two parties by which this lawyer Richard

[01:28:44] Barr in in a duel with the drug companies fought out in preliminary papers what have you the case never came to trial because it collapsed they never ever produced any sequence data from these children notwithstanding the fact that by this time thousands upon thousands of families in Britain the United States and increasingly around the world had been told that the measles virus had been found in these children and it was from the MMR vaccine and that data has never been produced and that to me is the most extraordinary indictment of these people uh not only the fact that these children in the Wakefield 1998 paper um were a pre-selected group of children from parents who'd come to the hospital to make the allegation that their child had been injured by the vaccine and hence to join the lawsuit that Richard

[01:29:47] Barr Was preparing and Andrew Wakefield was working on none of this was known none of this was reported until a Sunday Times investigation by Yours Truly went into an enormous uh uh cost in terms of my time and then we had a big Medical Board hearing that disclosed information and disclosed the children's records what have you so there was that and then there was O'Leary paper uh where again there was nothing that revealed that this whole project had uh had um basically gone after something that was a complete illusion I would describe it as a scam and I would say that the only reason these people aren't under arrest is because they say and can say oh I believed that the MMR vaccine caused autism which to me in my opinion I'm giving you my opinion now with my opinion that's just like the mafia saying we're the good people we're the good people we we think that we're we're protecting our clients these people refuse used to sequence the samples in the PCR they did not disclose who these parents were and why they'd come to the hospital to make these allegations and by the the interplay between these two uh events the Wakefield paper and the

[01:31:18] O'Leary work they were able to manufacture the belief that the MMR vaccine causes autism and the consequence of that is that there are tens of thousands probably hundreds of thousands of families around the world today who've been led to believe that their child was that they've got with developmentally challenged kids that their child was injured as a result of the parent's own decision to vaccinate them and these people why this is so important these people provide much of the backbone for the anti-vaccine movement today which is running the websites and the

[01:32:06] Facebook pages and the YouTube channels pumping out all this stuff now about the coronavirus up until December of 2019 and January and February of 2020 they was all about vaccines and autism and the MMR all that kind of stuff when the Great switch came over to the pandemic we see today that Network that infrastructure of of parents who torturing themselves with this idea that it might be their own fault for vaccinating their child that their child has some kind of Developmental issue have become mobilized in the belief that uh they need to identify an alternative culprit to themselves now I don't believe for a minute that these parents are in any way culpable for their children's autism but these parents have learned to deflect and project onto others the drug industry me governments whoever who they say are involved in this conspiracy to to well what they now taught the pandemic this conspiracy to promote vaccines and so on and so forth but before we get to that there are a few other things I want to go back to that I also think are technically important to understand um can you talk a little bit about the the formal and stain samples in

[01:33:28] O'Leary's lab because I think that in addition to the failure to do strain specific sequencing which was the absolute Mandate of This research right this was the purpose of the study so in addition to failing to do this one thing you set out to do when you look at the formal and staining it to me is one of the most revealing parts of how contaminated this work was do you want to give people a sense of what that found yeah well okay so if we go back to the Royal free endoscopy Suite uh and these children being scoped as they call it when the they they go into the small intestine um they uh would bring out these samples these pieces of tissue and they were divided and went in two directions One

[01:34:23] Direction went to wakefield's own researcher scientific researcher this guy called Nick Chadwick he's actually left science now because I I think in part because he became so disillusioned after this whole ferrago um he went off and froze his tissues in liquid nitrogen so they were frozen just like frozen peas uh which preserves the the um the the DNA of in fact they are if and of the sample of the RNA of the virus were there to be any there but there wasn't but anyway would have preserved the virus but uh in in pristine deep Frozen form and then there was another set of samples split from this set that went to the hospital's pathology um uh unit and for what is a routine process in in it's called histopathology in hospitals where uh Pathologists look down a microscope at samples which they stain with chemicals and um you you get various reactions that they're looking for so this second set of samples um is fixed in formalin and I think everybody knows what formula is a preservative and the the thing about when you preserve things in formalin is it tends to slightly scramble or at least make less accessible the uh molecular the nucleic acid in the in the samples so when you come to run a PCR test you have to run more Cycles to get to the same result so if you had if you saw if you if you took if you split a biopsy and you froze this sample and you uh use the other sample in you preserved it in form the other sample in for informal in and ran the machine you would find the virus much quicker in the Frozen one than you would in the formal in fixed one and because right so just just to go back to what we were talking about that means if you you know you take the exact same piece of tissue you cut it in half one goes in formula and one goes in nitrogen let's say the nitrogen one hits its PCR threshold in 20 Cycles you might expect the formal in one to require 30

[01:36:54] Cycles to reach the same amount of genetic material because you functionally started with so much less because the formula had degraded it yes right so what happened in O'Leary's lab we should be doing uh we should have a show on CNN and we could like bat it back um yes so so the the thing about this and the only reason this ever came out and you see that's another thing I have to say about my work is it's it's let it's less to do with vaccines and promoting vaccines or anything like that which is not really part of my agenda it's it's it's the the scientific questions going on behind all of that which are applicable to all sorts of uh all sorts of it's much bigger than just vaccines so so yeah so what happened was they came up against because the the particular importance of the vaccine program and they were suing vaccine manufacturers they came up against the pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical industry effectively unlimited money they can they can pay for anything any kind of legal scientific test whatsoever came up against the pharmaceutical industry who hired Britain's top expert on the PCR technology so they hired him and he uh produced reports which looked at the which made the comparisons among other many many other things made the comparisons between the uh number of

[01:38:25] Cycles on on the fresh frozen uh biopsies and the formerly fixed biopsies and found and and they were compared with a well I guess very complicated they were compared with another Gene and essentially what he found was that it took the same number of Cycles to um get the CO this time number of Cycles on both samples um on both the formal and fixed and the uh fresh frozen samples to which there's only one explanation to which there's only one explanation which is that the virus got into the samples after they were fixed informally in other words they could not have come out of the children so the most gracious explanation is that this was purely a laboratory contamination a less gracious interpretation is that it was deliberately uh falsified well this PCR expert he went a stage further man named Steve Bustin um and he went a stage further because he was paid an enormous enormous amount of money to do this long I'm not saying he got paid too much money because you know you pay for what you get what you pay for um he then went further and started looking at the individual uh Wells because this machine would be how would like have a whole have a whole rack of

[01:39:56] Wells I think there are from top of my 96. so they're 96 yes you have 96 Wells uh in a tray which goes into the machine and some of these Wells would have the samples you're testing for some would have positive measles controls taken using a laboratory strain of measles would be in some other ones some would have distilled water and some would be empty and he found that by analyzing and these these these Wells are being monitored second by second by second by second by the machine and all this data that's spewing out of the machine um I think hundreds of data points for each well if not thousands I can't remember off the top of my head uh for each well all this material was gathered and O'Leary was very keen to avoid it being disclosed to the drug companies who were demanding in fact ultimately the drug companies lawyers had to go to the high court in London who then made an application to the Irish high court to order like um O'Leary to produce the data to produce the outputs from this machine and he came up with all kinds of reasons why couldn't he was in Australia the machine broke down um the dog ate his homework and on it went but ultimately this guy busting did get later and he found that Wells that had been reported by the machine to be positive for measles virus were in fact uh submitted in legal papers as being an empty well as having nothing there as though somebody had taken an eraser and rubbed out the results in other cases he found that Wells that were them themselves empty were reported positive and rubbed out and so there in his analysis there had been manual human intervention to adjust the results coming out of those machines that machine in fact well there were two actually but out of that machine um in order to make the results consistent with what Wakefield wanted to find so the interpretation of that by many people and I've just simply observe it was you would have to assume that a person or person's unknown had deliberately cleaned up the output of that machine yeah let's reflect on that for a second right so let's pretend we were talking about a company say Enron who had deliberately with its accounting firm manipulated its books in such a way that it could deceive shareholders what would be the consequences of that well in that example the consequence is jail well I don't know what's happened with

[01:43:04] Volkswagen because well part of the Volkswagen group did precisely that with um fuel emissions from their cars where they rigged the results I don't actually know how that one's played out yeah I don't know if anyone's gone to jail on that one but um you would think yeah and and so it's interesting when you look at um at this case it really doesn't if you just viewed it through the lens of the behavior not the consequence but the behavior um it is it says nefarious as the most nefarious thing that you know we see in court you know the the stories of corporate greed and things like that um and certainly uh more than than even the corporate incompetence that that sometimes masquerades as greed um another thing that I I again I don't want to just dwell on this beyond anything but again it's worth noting how when you finally got a hold of the medical records of those 12 kids or at least a subset of them they were not which which again if you were looking at medical records of children that went back to when the events actually occurred meaning when they were actually vaccinated when their symptoms truly showed up so before they were recruited into the study how consistent were the true findings with what uh were ultimately reported where they my recollection is they were not entirely congruent in that regard oh that was all

[01:44:31] I mean that they they we kind of skipped that one but uh yeah no I was what happened was that when I I first broke the story in Sunday Times a series of pieces and I was invite invited to make a uh television documentary and hour-long um it's in the dispatches Strand in the UK and um and in the course of that uh Wakefield then sued using actually the medical professions money at the time he was still a doctor at the time and he sued us and because he he sued us but then he he wanted to have his lawsuit Frozen so that he didn't actually have to go ahead with it so he was going around telling people he was suing us but in fact he'd had his suit stayed as the legal word to to freeze these things so we me and the television Company Channel 4 television which is a national network with with statutory duties for fairness and uh and balance and um and accuracy uh we took him to court and forced him to sue us so he'd either have to put up or shut up and in the course of that I was able to read these Children's medical records and gain and uh get other documents disclosed to me um which uh evidence to me that these children did not have what he said they had uh there was not a single one of those 12 children whose cases were accurately reported in that paper in the

[01:45:57] Lance in February 1998 not one of them there were children who uh whose developmental issues proceeded their vaccination there was there were children whose issues were not 14 days or less after vaccination but months in some cases many months later in fact he's what he called his Sentinel case the first parent who who came to him who phoned him that the suggestion of the the the Jackie Fletcher who'd set up the campaign group the first patient she ultimately admitted in court papers that her child had shown no issues associated with inflammatory bowel disease or

[01:46:38] Autism or anything like that for nine months after vaccination And yet when she went to the hospital she said 14 days was actually never nothing before nine months later so and then there were children who were reported in the paper as having a diagnosis a behavioral diagnosis of autism who didn't have autism at all didn't have well it didn't have an Autism diagnosis at all I can't say what people did or didn't have I can only say what the I can't bring them back and you know I can only say what the what the reporting said they did not have autism diagnosis so what way could have done was to change the the times to

[01:47:21] Onset change the diagnoses um diagnose and he was a he was a non-clinical academic gastroenterologist wasn't a clinician had no patience says let's call him in the book a doctor without patience although some other doctors who don't have patients have taken issue with that um but um a change diagnoses he represented as an inflammatory bowel disease uh normal uh pathology findings um and there was nothing in that paper that could be reconciled with the actual children's diagnosis records histories um and uh laboratory and blood tests at all not not one of them and um and that really I suppose is um is what I was able to do I mean I interestingly because he's sued Us in the UK and then abandoned that when I actually abandoned it on the day I was sitting reading the medical records of the children at my lawyers offices um and uh I couldn't use that material because it was sealed material I was seeing it as pursuant to court order I was reading the Children's Medical

[01:48:32] Records pursuant to a court order which allowed me to do it in fact one of the parents turned up to court and challenged and said they shouldn't be allowed to read my child's medical records it's confidential and the judge said well I'm not having these parents saying who can have what documents and gave an order for me to read the Jordan medical roses but I couldn't use it until what happened then was there was a huge Medical Board hearing went on for 217 days longer than the trial of O.J

[01:48:58] Simpson at which these medical records were studied and and read aloud over and over and over by lawyers uh in London and at the end of it Wakefield lost his license to practice medicine and the Lancet retracted the paper so that uh Medical Board hearing which was a reinvestigation of my findings in the

[01:49:20] Sunday Times and really as a newspaper we forced them to do it they they had and it cost I I think the ultimate figure was about 10 million pounds to have this this hearing you know that um but I couldn't use that material until it was was ventilated at that hearing and other documents I couldn't use until Wakefield then sued me again in Texas when I did some reports for the bridge medical journal because they asked me to do a series of of um of reports for uh for a medically qualified readership so we did that and then

[01:49:51] Wakefield sued on that he was funded by a New York financier called Bernard seltz and his wife Lisa who who put up the money who ponied up the money for him to sue me and the British medical journal and that was thrown out too but in the course of that the documents that were disclosed uh behind seal in the UK litigation was unsealed in the American litigation and I was able to use it in my book The Doctor Who fooled the world um and that tells the story of all of this and indeed a lot more there's one piece of this story Brian that I think I

[01:50:31] I'd love for you to also tell because it still comes up a lot to this day and it's the story of quote unquote the CDC whistleblower yeah to be honest Peter I mean I think I'm I'm getting a bit tired now we've been talking for more than two hours uh and and that is that's a record for you I know that's a record people want to know about the CDC whistleblower and this movie vax that wakeful came out of and The Rebirth of the anti-vaxxy move because because by the time I'd finished this aspect the investigation wafer was finished I mean he had haircuts worse than mine this is a covid lockdown London haircut now I've never I haven't had my hair cut for like I don't know two months or something three months God knows what he was walking around looking like me now yeah um he was finished he was written off he was or none of his colleagues would speak to him he was done but then came the the return of Andrew Wakefield um on the scene and that's the next stage that's the fourth part the book is in four parts the first part is um is

[01:51:41] Big Ideas the second party secret schemes the third part is exposed and the fourth part is Avenged and you then come to Avenged wakefield's um what I would characterize as a vindictive uh repost to his personal ruin where he started to do what he's always done which is to mirror his own behavior onto others and accuse or claim falsely claim that a researcher at the CDC had accused his colleagues of fraud and that Wakefield had discovered with this fraud through this alleged whistleblower and that wasn't true either but I mean let's let people let's let's give people a chance they'll read the book it's it's you you you you do a very good job describing this with full transcripts um and again I think it's I think it's important for people to understand this um do you think that that Andrew

[01:52:46] Wakefield would ever sit down with me for an interview uh no no no he will only sit down for an interview with somebody he knows will not ask him questions that are difficult that's the first thing and secondly um you you you would not you would not be able to field his replies so for example he will say and he does say um I never got involved in the lawsuit until after the children were seen at the hospital which is just a most flagrant lie I mean

[01:53:27] I've got the paperwork I've got the contract I've got the the redeemers he was involved two years before before yeah but he would just lie to you I'm just giving you everything so you're talking the degree of pathologic lying is so great that it becomes this you're you're in a fact-free Zone I want to end on two uh two things the first is I want to read you something from the New

[01:53:49] England Journal of Medicine which in 2011 wrote an article uh or published an article rather titled the age-old struggle against anti-vaccinationists I'm going to read you a quote from it and I want you to tell me if you think this is accurate or if you think this is too harsh so um it states that this has been an issue that's existed since the 19th century but now the anti-vactionist anti-vaccinationist media of choice are typically television and the internet including social media Outlets which are used to sway public opinion and distract attention from scientific evidence the editorial goes on to characterize such people as they tend toward complete mistrust of government and manufacturers conspiratorial thinking denialism low cognitive complexity in thinking patterns reasoning flaws and a habit of substituting emotional anecdotes for data including people who range from those unable to understand and incorporate the concepts of risk and probability into science grounded decision making and those who use presumably on the other side deliberate mistruths intimidation falsified data and even the threats of violence do you think that's too harsh

[01:55:03] I think that's absolutely right what I would say about it now that's that's absolutely right but what I would say about it that is static prose Exposition yeah now that's one way where somebody could say well I don't know who wrote that but um whoever it is is probably a very learned person with enormous experience I'm telling you this that's what he's doing I'm telling you this in the New England Journal of Medicine what I've tried to do is to take a different approach to it which is to tell the story and to show people which is why we got into all that stuff about cycles of PCR and things like is to show people the real characters behind this and the specific facts of how they did it and that's what I tried to do in the in the

[01:55:49] Doctor Who for the world is to tell the story as a narrative who did what and the closing point from me would be a quote by a book I suppose if I can remember it is and this is just before the this is before the pandemic well began I wrote this was that to me the importance of it was not just about vaccines of vaccine safety and the issues that you deal with in your clinical practice but it's this if he could do what he did and I'll show you what he did who else is doing what in the hospitals and Laboratories that we may one day look to for our lives now we are looking to those hospitals and Laboratories for our lives and that's the really the message behind the whole thing it's not I I had no message to convince people to vaccinate their children I don't advise people to vaccinate their children I don't accept uh endorsements of my book from vaccine manufacturers or The Usual Suspects whose names we all know um

[01:57:00] I was interested in that question if he could do what he did who else is doing what in the hospitals and Laboratories that we may one day look to for our lives and that's the importance of it because the reason wakeful got caught was because he took something as high profile as vaccination um affecting everybody's children prior subject of primary concern to almost everybody and he chose to do what he did within that so therefore I was able to for my very first story I got four months to investigate before we published a single story uh the television program that like I think we're about eight months or nine months preparing that the bmj series which took six months to prepare for uh publication the book and all of this is subject to the scrutiny of lawyers other journalists my contract with Johns

[01:57:57] Hopkins University my North American Publishers requires that I have told the truth and if I hadn't told the truth my Publishers would be in a position to pulp the book and send me the bill that is the contractual position I'm in uh the book has been reviewed but it's been peer-reviewed two different liable lawyers one in New York and one in

[01:58:19] London have looked at it and two members of staff at the Johns Hopkins University press went through all my documents against a 2 000 references footnoted references in the manuscript of this book to be sure that what I've been saying is backed by the evidence it's not just me saying it so while I appreciate those words from handed down by somebody who knows about these things and summarizes it based on their expertise and their you know their life story themselves what I've tried to do is to tell the story of the real people and the specific facts as to how we got the anti-vaccine movement that is today causing all this Mischief over um SARS cov2 shots so so that's my pitch and that's why I wrote the book and I you know hope somebody might go out and buy it I I think people absolutely will and I and I and I think that people should not assume that because they've heard this podcast they know all that's in the book the book is incredibly rich with detail um as I said at the outset I read the book twice because I need it it's not it's a book that you can easily Miss

[01:59:32] Parts the first time through I think my my closing thought Brian will be this um first I guess I have two one I really appreciate the point you just made which is this is really less a book about vaccines and it's more a book about how science can go wrong and how science can be corrupted by bad people and I think we can say that um I think for me a very sad footnote to this story which you've alluded to begins with the kernel of those 12 children who were summarily tortured in a hospital uh some 20 years ago and if anybody listening to this has a six or seven year old child and especially if any parent listening to this has a child with autism um they will understand what you said which is these are children in whom any deviation from a normal routine is devastating that means bedtime being at a slightly different time never mind going to a hospital sleeping in a foreign Place being tortured through a bowel preparation when you're constipated having a colonoscope rammed into your colon one child having 12 perforations if my memory serves me correctly having a lumbar puncture multiple venous punctures um to then realize all of this was done without even a modicum of investigational review board oversight in other words this was not even deemed an ethical thing to do to think that that's the kernel of evil that then went on to produce so much angst for so many parents who now are left wondering have I done something to cause harm to my child um

[02:01:23] I think that is the absolute saddest Legacy of this and despite um you know if if effective tomorrow if this story vanished which it won't um there would be no undoing what I consider that unspeakable harm so I thank you for doing what you've done um I wish we could end on a happier note and I thank you for staying up so late I know it's very late there in London um but I'm I'm greatly appreciative for this time Brian no problem thanks Peter thanks for your interest thank you for listening to this week's episode of the drive if you're interested in diving deeper into any topics we discuss we've created a membership program that allows us to bring you more in-depth exclusive content without relying on paid ads it's our goal to ensure members get back much more than the price of the subscription after that end membership benefits include a bunch of things one totally
