Keith Flaherty is the director of clinical research at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and a previous guest on The Drive. In this episode, Keith first delves into the statistics on cancer's prevalence as we age, underscoring the significance of finding effective treatments and early detection methodologies. He touches on the history of cancer therapeutics and illuminates the notable enhancements in cancer therapy within the last decade that are setting the stage for a promising future. He goes into detail on the potential of immunotherapy and therapies that can combat cancer’s evasive tactics while explaining some of the existing challenges around specificity, cost, and scalability. Additionally, Keith highlights the significant leap in early detection methodologies, namely liquid biopsies, which have the potential not only to determine if a cancer is present in an early stage, but also identify the possible tissue of origin.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] all of these advances are converging in a way that if we keep talking at fouryear increments the pace of progress is going to be like substantially greater per unit time we've already witnessed that I mean it's there's no question that fouryear increments over my career that's that's been true um it's reflected just in in approval of drugs by the FDA uh for cancer but but now the convergence of Diagnostics and

[00:00:22] Therapeutics um that's what's finally coming into view um that that that that piece has really I would say been largely missing hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music] Atia hey Keith great to be back with you again hard to believe it was uh almost exactly four years ago that we sat down in Boston to uh do what will be part one of this discussion um but you know we've got a lot more listeners now and you know it's not like some of that content uh isn't still relevant today so we'll we'll probably talk a little bit about some of the things we spoke about then but there are a number of things that

[00:01:04] I'm excited to discuss with you that we haven't talked about um and I suspect that will make up the Lin share of our discussion so thanks again for making time yeah thanks Peter it's a great pleasure to talk with you again and yeah you're right four years A lot has happened um you know in therapeutic development maybe you could have said four years ago that some of the things that have played out would have played out but on the diagnostic side that's I think that's probably where um four years ago I I was I didn't quite have the crystal ball Vision as to how things would um would develop there so and of course those two areas are like tightly related in oncology so excited to dig back in well let's just start maybe give folks a a short background a little bit about about what you're doing and um you know why it is that you're at least in my view in a great position to to kind of talk about cancer in a way that is uh more than just an inch wide and a mile deep which is the general nature of the field but you know several inches wide maybe and and and and several you know in a mile deep like what is it about your back right right I'll try to hit some highlights here that make that point so um yes I'm a medical oncologist

[00:02:17] I've been in the field now for 23 years um which is a relevant number because of the fact that um the first translation of molecular insights you know specifically genetic insights into cancer biology you know really became therapy starting that year that's when a mat neber GC like was first in patients and was you know kind of a revolutionary moment um so my my my career you know kind of you started right then and there um myself interested as a medical oncologist in trying to translate science to Medicine in a in very much that way like taking insights in terms of the genetic makeup like the mutations um and sort of mutational architecture if you will of cancers and trying to translate that understanding into therapy so I've been doing that for 23 years uh like anybody in the academic medical world and oncology um I focused on like specific cancer types so melanoma and kidney cancer and both of those I chose because of because of the molecular insights that existed at the time that felt like they were um at least beginning to be ripe uh for translation uh so I did that work for about a decade at University of

[00:03:24] Pennsylvania moved to Mass General um part of the Harvard uh University uh you know kind of umbrella Harvard Medical School um to build a clinical program focused on therapeutic development much more broadly across cancer um and then I think as we'll talk about this interplay between Therapeutics and and molecular understanding and ultimately

[00:03:47] Diagnostics basically built um a translational research group you know surrounding therapeutic development um what I refer to as bedside to bench translational research to sort of understand um mechanisms of action mechanisms of resistance in other words when drugs work why and if they don't work you know why not and use those insights to try to kind of accelerate or drive the whole process forward and then

[00:04:09] I'll just like you know throw in um also that over the past 10 years um I've co-founded now a handful a little bit more than a handful of Biotech companies uh with locko oncology being the first 10 years ago and that was acquired four years ago and Scorpion Therapeutics being the most recent um and I'm actually sitting in the offices of

[00:04:27] Scorpion Therapeutics at the moment um and so uh yeah like basically that you know it's it's through those channels um I guess I would say it's my job to keep you know a a steady eye on like new therapeutic Concepts that you know could be ready for prime time um to move forward and then again trying to translate like understanding into you know tools that we can actually use for real patients AKA

[00:04:55] Diagnostics and Keith I think you know it's it's always worth repeating to folks what it is about cancer that's um as far as the big four chronic diseases I call them The Four Horsemen in my book there's something about cancer that's particularly damning which is when you look at the other two chronic diseases that are huge Killers which are cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disease they increase in their severity uh exponentially as you age and they don't really become a dominant source of mortality until people are in the seventh and eth decade of life and that's not true for cancer um in fact I

[00:05:37] I have a little table in front of me that I had one of our analysts pulled together that I think is just we'll put it in the show notes it's very powerful right so it's sort of looking at people in tenure increments just from 25 to 34 35 to 44 Etc all the way up to you know north of 85 and it lists the percentage of people in each age category that die in response to cancer and here's what's interesting is that that number peaks in the middle right so at 25 to 34 it's 6% 35 to 44 it's 133% think about that for a minute right that that is a staggering number for people so young by the time you get up to 45 to 54 it's 23% 55 to 64 30% 65 to 74 31% and then paradoxically it begins to come down after that because those other diseases are taking off another way to look at this is where does cancer rank in cause of death for all causes by decade and if you go in those same buckets starting at 25 to 34 it goes from third thirdd second first first second third in other words it's always first to third there is no other disease that always ranks in the top three cause of death for every age that's it full stop period it's cancer and so you know it's uh it's the second leading cause of death overall we can talk a lot about those stats but there's nobody who's listening to this podcast whose life has not been affected by cancer that wouldn't be possible I I don't I don't think you could come up with an example of someone who doesn't know someone who's at least had cancer uh and it very likely died as a result of it yeah no that's a good reminder I mean you know one interesting thing maybe just to um break that data down a little bit is you know people you know think of pediatri atric cancers um of course those are like you know if you if you if your life has ever been touched by a kid um with cancer there's like just's like just almost nothing more jarring uh you know almost seemingly unjust if you will about a child um being diagnosed with cancer for children it cancer is quite rare so like it it really occupies enormous amount of Mind share but then as you go into the decades that you were um summarizing you know what's interesting is to reflect on the cancer types uh you know that kind of lead the way um right so brain tumors leukemia uh melanoma the one you know this the most dead deadly form of skin cancer you know one of the cancer types

[00:08:10] I mentioned that I've been focused on my career uh career long um you know that really jumps up you know in those 20s 30s 40s um those cancer types kind of lead the way in kind of the younger population um and there's some interesting implications there in terms of like well what causes those Cancers and and why are you know some people you know so vulnerable to them um and then you know carcinogen induced cancers well melanom of course is there's a carcinogen called ultraviolet uh light that's a carcinogen for skin cancer including melanoma um but like smoking related cancers for example you know those really start to jump up um in later decades um and then you've got um so like you know everyone is aware of this but obviously lung cancer leads the way there but there's there's a a smoking footprint for a bunch of other cancer types that people don't think about so much head and neck cancer is one that I think is you know relatively not top of mind for people but you know even when you get to bladder cancer which you think how does smoking cause blatter cancer but and it's not the sole cause but it's certainly a big contributor um you know these sort of smoking related cancers um they do they take exposure right obviously and and a bit of time um to accumulate their population impact um ultimately and I guess the Just One of thing that I would kind of throw in there because I'm sure we're going to talk about like you know the really population prevalent cancers like so breast cancer prostate cancer lung cancer col rectal cancer the big four um so breast cancer and prostate cancer are not related to well obviously ultraviolet light or smoking so much I a little bit of smoking influence on breast cancer risk but um but there it's um you know this really interesting interplay between um you know these these hormone receptors uh you know kind of being hijacked or co-opted in a way um and you think about the way in which those cancers form I think it it best fits your um you know kind of this age like you know cardiovascular disease and neurogenerative disease I would argue like there's there's something at play there that's similar to these hormon driven cancers which are very age related so breast cancer and prostate cancer really pick up in those later

[00:10:19] Decades of age um so it's just kind of interesting to reflect on you know kind of the how and why different cancers kind of feature um in those uh different Decades of age and that that has tons of ramifications in terms of how we think about screening which I'm sure we'll get into yeah for sure so let's add a little more color to that Keith so you mentioned the big four right so lung being number one I think a breast and prostate is kind of number two and coloral number four and then if you add a fifth in pancreatic you now account for a little over 50% of all cancer deaths so you know we'll talk about incidents but we're going to talk about mortality and at the end of the day just five cancers account for half a little over half of all cancer death in the

[00:11:00] United States that's one point I'd make second point I'd make that's very interesting when it comes to breast and prostate is on the one hand we have this clear understanding of the role of hormones and yet as you point out the implicated hormones are actually at their lowest levels when these cancers typically come on board right so we talk about the relationship between testosterone and dihydro testosterone

[00:11:22] BHT and prostate cancer and yet when men have their highest levels of these hormones in their 20s in their 30s and even in their 40s that cancer is never to be found that cancer shows up only when those hormones are long gone I mean you know not gone completely but of course greatly diminished and the same is true with breast cancer right we see the incidence of breast cancer going up but it's not necessarily hitting at the peak level of estrogen and women there's more complexity to it but again it speaks to just how much is going on beyond the surface and the first order thinking well yeah no that's a great point and actually you know you're it's kind of very tempting to insert here kind of a you know sort of deep cancer biology uh you know uh principle if you look at other cancers than breast and and prostate the you know the cancer types where we've really gone the deepest in our understanding of what causes them to become cancerous in the first place um and and even in terms of Translating that in terms of therapies it's really been around the growth factor receptor um and Downstream of growth factor receptors like so on the surface of cancer cells and then inter internally um that's where the that's where the action has been right and and and here's the point which you just made about the hormone receptors um is that basically cancer cells quote unquote figure out how to become independent of the actual growth factors themselves right so they basically turn you know through genetic mutation or alteration they turn on these um surface receptors or the immediate Downstream um signaling molecules from those surface receptors its mutations there that's the absolute like nidus if you will The Hot Spot um of where most cancers not all but where most cancers actually get their kind of you know kind of oncogenic Drive um you know the mutations that that that drive cancer again really analogous um to the comments you you know or or the reality and the comments you made about um prostate cancer and and breast cancer in terms of the uh you know the basically that the circulating hormone levels um at the time those cancers manifest are low what's happened is cancer cells have wired themselves in a way to be sort of autonomous or independent of those lians but still using the receptors and their

[00:13:37] Downstream consequences to drive yeah and I and I wonder if there's a parallel between the following observation which is a test a a prostate cancer that develops in the presence of low testosterone all things equal is a worse prostate cancer so there's that paper in the New England Journal of Medicine got it's probably been 15 years now that demonstrated clearly that the lower the testosterone at the time of diagnosis of prostate cancer the worse the outcome very counterintuitive right everybody thinks testosterone is causing prostate cancer when in in fact what we're seeing is if I mean the way so I wouldn't interpret that to mean testosterone potentially has zero role or that high testosterone is protective although some have argued that what I would argue is your point which is the cancers that grow without the hormone are worse and therefore the parallel if you will is the ER PR negative breast cancers are worse than the erpr positive breast cancers those cancers those typically hormone sensitive or driven cancers that proliferate whether it be the initiation or proliferation without their respective hormones tend to be the the harder ones to to combat that's right yeah I mean it's basically um so in those instances those cancers have actually figured out how to essentially replace the function uh by virtue of accum you know I use language like they figured out because I'm I think you might remember from our conversation we like to anthropomorphize cancer exactly

[00:15:04] I was just going to say I I love anthropomorphizing cancer it's just it's actually from a therapeutic development perspective it's like the easiest mindset to sort of adopt in terms of thinking about how cancer solve the problems that they need to solve to become cancers it's like it's kind of scary language to use I realize but but when you're trying to then like reverse that or intercept that you know kind of becomes a little bit useful so anyway the point is that there's a constellation of mutations that can that can turn on um essentially the downstream Pathways uh from you know for example estrone receptor U so that so the what's driving that a so-called triple negative breast cancer so lacking hormone receptors and lacking her to which is a well established surface Target a growth factor um receptor on on normal cells and and on on cancer cells including breast cancer cells for cancer breast cancers that have figured out how to become breast cancer what you see in their um genetic makeup is that they basically Al still are are dependent on the same sort of cellular processes they still have to kind of you know regulate the same um Downstream programs they just do it through a variety of means and ones that become very challenging to directly Target I mean to like to intercept those and so the point you're making about breast cancer I'll just kind of maybe complete a little bit this way which is you emphasize that their prognosis is better right so in other words before ever talking about therapy that like those breast and prostate cancers that um you know form and stick with breast cancer because that spreads across younger ages you know a bit more than prostate cancer does their prognosis is better so before even coming to the issue of treatment but their treatability is also far greater right because we've got drugs more targets yeah exactly and and and intercepting those um uh you know what you know hormone receptors specifically which are by the way inside of cells just a little Nuance to um separate from the comments I made about sort of the surface growth factor receptors those drugs we've had them for a long time but also like serious advances have been made applying new chemistry strategies to developing even better and better versions of those so so we're actually so what we're witnessing um let me just make this point in relation to pancreatic cancer which I'm glad you called out is that um we I've might have used this term four years ago we have this scenario in cancer where there's kind of a distribution of halves and

[00:17:25] Have Nots and what I mean by that is we patients whose's prognosed to start with is better and whose therapy advances are really accelerating and like making certain cancers and hormone receptor positive breast cancer is a quite a good example of this where like additional drugs now have been successfully developed as combination since we spoke for years ago even now FDA approved and on the market um and so the outcomes of those patients just continue to be distanced from cancers like pancreatic cancer where first off The lethality of pancreatic cancer right like per case diagnosed um the case fatality rate so-called um is far higher than these other cancers right so it doesn't even come close in terms of number of cases diagnosed to breast and prostate um or lung for that matter but but but per case diagnose the likelihood that it's going to be fatal ultimately is inordinately High um and so that's both a that's a prognostic issue that those are aggressive cancers but also our therapy advances have been like really quite minimal which is to say all we've got are the what I refer to as classical chapy drugs of kind of the pre-2000 era um which have a modest impact um you know at all so talking about halves and have knots pancreatic cancer unfortunately remains very much in that kind of have notot into the Spectrum yeah a couple other points to make just on the broad you know sort of uh

[00:18:46] Contours of cancer um one of the other carcinogens we haven't really discussed which is essentially the second most prevalent um environmental trigger of cancer after smoking is obesity um and we can certainly debate whether it's obesity per se which I don't think it is in other words I don't think it's adiposity uh I think it is inflammation and growth factors that come with obesity namely insulin uh probably igf-1 uh not to mention the inflammation that is part and parcel with that which I assume is in some way impairing the immune system and things of that nature so um that's another example where you have a lot of these cancers let's think of those top five Brad prostate pancreatic are clearly linked colar rectal as well I'm not sure about lung so lung might not be as related to obesity is the other four but uh there are also many other you know cancers that fall outside of the top five lethal where where we do tend to see this relationship uh to my last count I think there were about 25 26 maybe 27 cancers that have a pretty tight relationship to that so you know that's not only something that's increasing uh in terms of societal prevalence um but you might argue that that also takes a while to to sort of kick in yeah so that's yeah totally right um yeah thank you for inserting that because it really is you know it's it's so easy to think about um ultravalet radiation and skin cancers so easy to think about smoking uh I mean now that we understand you know when we sequence uh you know an individual cell or a population of cancer cells um sequence their genome and we can now see the you know the footprint if you will the damage um that those types of carcinogens induce obesity is unquestionably you know like another when really that that third highest ranking um quote unquote carcinogen but the way it does it is is certainly more complicated and and it is as you're saying sort of it's systemic um you know

[00:20:47] I really do latch on to that literature that you alluded to um regarding sort of insulin signaling um you know kind of like sort of the the body's metab olic response um to to obesity um I mean even you can study this just in like a Fed versus fasted State like in kind of a shortterm um setting but but when you're you know someone um is obese basically they there are metabolic you know adaptations if you will that the body sort of attempts to make and I would draw the analogy to you know where we started with um the hormone receptor uh you know driven cancers so you know breast and and prostate um it's you know it's a different um phenomenon to a degree but basically you know insulin growth factor igf you alluded to and then um its receptors on cells which are sort of ubiquitous on all cell types and certainly this the you know the cell types that um for which we've got epidemiologic evidence that those cancers are more common in the obese um population basically what you know what you can say from laboratory data is that you know the the signaling that happens through insulin signaling in cells um it's it's tightly tied uh to what we have you know kind of talked about already which is that sort of growth factor receptor you know um pathway I mean it really it is ultimately part of that you know sort of same biology there's a there's a a pathway that that connects those surface receptors into cells um that then regulate um sort of how the mitochondria act as sort of the you know the power stations if you will inside of cells um so the so-called I3 kise pathway um you know well described as being a driver in cancer um that pathway is basically being chronically driven um in that setting of high high insulin levels High uh insulin growth factor uh circulating levels um you know so exactly you know what threshold level um poses risk and over what period of time like you know those um I would say those dots haven't been fully connected but the epidemiology is undeniable and I would say the laboratory data that supports you know that connection is also unden so I think there's you know there's there's something about you know that that kind of pushing that driving it's I mean like chronic inflammation as you cited which Itself by the way of course is a direct uh causal factor for certain cancers um yeah so like like a organ site or tissue site where there's chronic inflammation um well described that cancers can arise in that uh in that setting it's a similar phenomenon basically they kind of keep whipping the horse if you will in a way and and and cells will you know ultim Ely um through genetic alteration still um basically you know respond uh you know to that environmental stress um and and and

[00:23:39] Cancers ensue so I remember in the in January of 2000 um I'm in my last year of medical school and I uh Trek across the country from California to Bethesda to go and spend uh four months uh as a medical student rotating on the immunotherapy service with Steve Rosenberg and this was the opportunity and dream of a lifetime for me I had read his book The transformed cell many many times as a medical student and wanted to uh basically go and learn what

[00:24:13] I could and um that I look back at that uh I think I was there from January until April of that year I mean uh literally one of the most uh you know joyful examples of pure Bliss I I had I've told the story before but I I think I told the story when I had him on the podcast you know I had um found a friend

[00:24:33] I could stay with in Bethesda but it turned out in the four months I was there I was probably only there eight times um I I didn't leave the hospital I literally had a cot where I slept and I just didn't want to be out of there I wanted to be kind of as as close to the lab as close to the clinic as possible but I'll never forget one of the most um you know insane things that he said in the first week that I was there he said looking back over the past 30 years we have basically made no progress in the long-term management of metastatic epithelial cancers uh

[00:25:13] Translating that into English if you had a solid organ tumor that had spread to a distant site in 1970 the chance that you were going to be alive in 10 years was the same in the year 2000 and that was basically zero now there were a couple of small exceptions and they happen to be the cancers that you and he are both interested in there were about 10 to 15% of patients could achieve a solid durable remission at the time to high do interlukin 2 but that was not appearing to be the case for any other epithelial tumor and there was still absolutely no sense of why that wasn't the case for the other 90% of patients who had metastatic renal cell carcinoma and melanoma how are we doing today 23 years later um do you have a sense of how much bigger that number is so if we went from 0% 10 years survival in 1970 and I'm using 10e to really try to get out some of the median survival extension stuff but if we were 0% survival for solid organ tumor in 1970 call it 1% in the year 2000 on the back of the you know few cases of RCC and melanoma what are we at today yeah I think 15% is a conservative number um you know some would make a case for 20% I think the problem is there that you need a little we need a little bit more time some of the some of the newest therapies you know we don't have the 10 years yeah we don't have the 10 years um but but if you track their fiveyear you three and five year outcomes if you will you'd like to think that you know they're they're going to get us to to 20% um so that's you know again just just to clarify what we mean by um using this term metastatic um so like clinically overt detectable metastatic cancer means that you're picking it up radiographically or clinically like that's right that's what that that's what that term means um now the fact is that cancers are found when they're found at what's thought to be an earlier localized um uh you know site uh basically it's you know it's very very common that cancers will have spread to so-called Regional lymph nodes like through lymphatic channels to the closest lymph node Basin wherever that may be um this is not true for all cancers but certainly true for the common epithelial cancers you're um uh you know focused on in this question and so basically um the point to emphasize there is that spread to lymph nodes is properly called metastatic right but we just don't use that jar it's it's a jargon term like we just we we don't actually we don't talk think about that um as being metastatic yeah so the sort of the analogy right is like um you know when people leave a city in an airport and go to another airport that's in another city we don't call it spread until they leave the airport and go to the city proper even though they've clearly demonstrated the capacity to go from their house to the airport hop on an airplane go to another airport and once they step foot out of customs and collect their bags well now we can say they've really spread yeah that's right and and the other point I was just going to quickly make is that it's feasible to surgically remove Regional lymph nodes along with the primary um site of disease in you know the vast majority of cases and so because of that you know sort of historical standard practice of you know surgical reection including

[00:28:30] Regional lymph noes um we think of surgeries that can Encompass all of that as you know basically being you know one one treatment and then those patients are you know we're going to come to this I think probably a little bit further along in the conversation but you know they are thought to have not have metastatic disease but what I mean by that is you know overt so like you can detect it clinically or radiographically um how do we know that some of those people actually have metastatic disease right at that time well by following them five and 10 years well not even that long I mean one two and three years is in fact enough for most of the aggressive cancers um they will you you do the surgery you've cleaned the Slate you do scans you know of various kinds you you see nothing um and basically a substantial fraction of those patients depending on the cancer type and depending on how much you know the features of their primary tumor as well as lymph Zone involvement a substantial fraction of those patients let's go with 30 50% you know kind of typical range um over those few to several years of followup will manifest metastic disease well they always had it they had it they had it from before the surgery was ever done um and as you said basically they actually cancer cells this or the analogy of the traveler left the airport I mean they actually they you know they did they lodged in a you know distant sight uh we just didn't have the methods you know to find it so time would would tell um that that in fact in retrospect they had had it um this is where actually some huge advances have been made in terms of um blood-based detection um of those instances uh we're not we're not perfectly good at that now but there have been substantial improvements in the technology for detecting particularly circulating tumor

[00:30:05] DNA um in instances where people have only microscopic medesthetic disease that's that's the that's the term I wanted to kind of insert in this conversation is microscopic medesthetic disease we'll come back to this but let me let me just you know pick up on this theme again you know for for evident overt metastatic disease when you can see it on scans or or clinically um witness it uh that's where those numbers pertain that we're talking about like you know getting in this you know 15 moving towards 20% range um 10% on an absolute scale so so like let's let's go with the idea that we're on the path with available therapies that have just you recently been introduced included towards that 20% number half of that

[00:30:44] Advance has come from one therapeutic modality pd1 antibody based immunotherapy a single approach um has accounted for half that number it's astounding and then what about the other half um that has come from a a repertoire of these so-called molecularly targeted therapies that intercept you know those um you know genetically altered drivers that I alluded to some minutes ago um these surface receptors and their Downstream signaling molecules um but you know those those individual drugs have picked off you know as small as 0.2% you know of the cancer population um in the kind of rarest in instance up to you know a couple few percent right and then but you add them all up and those have produced um you know also uh you know long-term survivors now I Me by by historical standards so that 10 10e numbers like it's an astoundingly long Survival by historical standards because metastatic cancer will prove fatal um in nearly everybody if untreated um you know within that time frame even the most quote unquote indolent cancer yeah so let's just kind of go back and and restate the important part of that so um basically 1970 to year 2000 zero progress has been made 2000 until now we've probably been able to um you know make a small dent in that half of that dent has been on the back of K truda how many how many drugs are in the other half of that like so we mentioned GAC a minute ago that was probably the first yeah there've been 52 been yeah 52 FDA approvals but um but that's against 19 unique mechanisms right so there's a lot of me a lot of me

[00:32:27] ISM um I mean this is true in all Therapeutics not just oncology um and so that's so like I I tend to then go down to that number right so like 19 unique mechanisms um and and even there frankly there's not there's some there's some overlap um so like different like your targets but like for the same population like within a given pathway inside a cell there's instances where we've actually successfully drugged like one component and its immediate Downstream component and the immediate Downstream component yet again that would then count as three on that list of 19 but really they're very overlapping so if I were to really boil it down you know I would we're you know kind of in the 10 range um in terms of you know truly unique y uh molecular targets uh and and

[00:33:13] Kuda does have company so this I you know so the the target of Kuda just for those who are trying to keep up with the jargon as they do their their Google searching on any of these topics the target of katuda um is P capital P capital D hyen one that's a surface receptor on certain immune cells um particularly on these cd8 positive T lymphocytes that can kill tumors directly but there are other immune cells that um Express pd1 and so and that's a break on those immune cells so the antibodies that block that break are the so-called pd1 antibodies there are five of them that are FDA approved and katria katuda or pmab is that's the dominant one that made it to Market um first and also in the broadest number of cancer populations um but there's you know when

[00:34:02] I said meu ISM before like there's like lots of metm in that space and then um is CT is anti-la 4 still being used or is that mostly just being used in melanoma how how what's the prevalence of its um susceptibility versus that of pd1 yeah for four cancer types now and and most would argue a fifth um have evidence that adding C4 to pd1 as another block so that's another break on the immune cells on on those T same tea cells um it was actually discovered before pd1 as a Target and and the therapy was Advanced against it um a little earlier than pd1 but a much smaller percent of cancer patients get a benefit um you know from that drug there's some evidence that it actually can act kind of independently you know sort of exert its own benefit but but I

[00:34:52] I I'm ascribing that 10% number by the way there's some real math behind that it's not totally like just a adult number of patients who get long-term benefit from pd1 um if you add in C4 you're in the 1% you know range in terms of the you know addressable population for C C4 antibody therapy who who can who derive then like 10y year

[00:35:13] Type U benefit so pd1 is doing really you know the the heavy lifting yeah I think it's probably worth just sort of explaining immunotherapy again again we have an entire podcast dedicated to that when I sat down with Steve Rosenberg you and I spoke about it briefly four years ago but I think given that the immune system is uh I was about to make a joke that wasn't intended to be a joke I was about to say it's not inate as in our understanding but of course it is inate and and it's in its physiology um but given that I think you know people don't necessarily you know completely understand the nuances of the immune system given that um it's played such an important role in cancer uh optimism over the past two decades and given that it's probably about to play more of an important role as we go forward I I think it's worthwhile for The Listener and viewer to understand how the immune system works with respect to cancer because when we talk about till when we talk about checkpoint Inhibitors which we've already touched on I don't want people to be lost so unfortunately this is one of those moments in this podcast where you got to buckle your seat belt up a little bit um but it but it pays dividends um because you become a very educated consumer of of how these drugs work yeah so let me let me kind of layer the onion this way um which is I I find it most useful and I say this even in talking to patients um so they're you know my my lay audience U if you will uh to start with um you know the concept that that the immune system needs to find levers that it can grab onto as in differences things that are fundamentally different um than normal cells we our immune system is trained um in fetal develop M um to to do exactly that and and and quote unquote only that um except for the fact that we unfortunately hold on to self-recognizing immune cells and those can cause autoimmune disease which is not the topic of our conversation today um but basically um it so when you consider you know what's what's different about cancer cells and what you what have we learned over the decades on that topic there are a variety of differences um now I'm going to start here because it's kind of gives a little bit of chronology in a way we we we began to understand some time ago that um a lot a common feature of cancer cells is that they behave um like their sort of progenitors or precursors like in development right all mature cells in the body come from a you know well a stem cell of you know of a of some sort um and there's lineage in different different lineages and different types of stem cells But ultimately you see cancers actually adopt sort of a biological Behavior that's like backing up if you will in the developmental um process um this is part of the just a consequence of the genetic alteration sort of the combination lock as I often refer to it of genetic alterations that can lead to cancer is that that's one of the programs um that they typically adopt and it turns out that developmental cells um have surface um you know proteins uh surface you know markers if you will that are not expressed in in fully mature tissues and the immune system can see those um so that's well documented and St rosenberg's early successes actually were were you know identifying uh those immune cells that existed in people that could recognize uh you know those those types of antigens so so these are referred to as cancer test antigens so just think of that as kind of this developmental sort of biology turns out there are also interestingly some what we refer to as lineage antigens so like you know uh surface markers that you know kind of tag a certain you know cell type that the immune system interestingly can recognize even though we think of the those as being more like self um but you know we we we we see that we see evidence that that the immune system reacts uh to those and that there are you know cell therapies um as you were alluding to before um that also take advantage of that the the big discoveries of the recent you know several years have been that carcinogens cause mutations um in genes that then you know those genes encode first RNA and then proteins and and the altered amino acids sequence of the protein that can be recognized so those are intracellular almost always um those those proteins but we have a Machinery in our cells all cells in the body um including those cells that go on to become cancer that basically breaks down those proteins as they age um and will present a representative set if you will of those broken down protein fragments or peptides um to uh you know present them meaning on the self Surface in the context of these um uh you know molecules we refer to as major hytto compatibility um receptors as they're you know kind of alluded to but the idea is that they're they're they're trying to show the Wares if you will the the inner contents of a cell to the immune system um because we think that because of that is that that virally infected cells you know have an infection inside um we think this is how this you know Machinery um was ever uh uh you know how it ever evolved in the first place and so kind of showing the inner contents if you will as a way of being able to like let the immune system know that there's a virally infected cell well that same Machinery exists again in every cell um and by the way if cells stop doing that there's a branch of the immune system stop stop presenting antigens at all um antigen is a new word I meant to um introduce that antigen means a difference like a a protein fragment that's being presented and seen as different we call that an antigen and it can come in these different categories that I'm talking about um so basically if a cell if a cancer cell were trying to hide itself if you will by not expressing um these receptors to present antigens then there's actually a branch of the immune system that's basically you know natural killer cells as they're called they're very primordial immune cells are supposed to just you know swoop in and and kill those cells and and we have evidence that that does occur so so let's just let's just pause here Keith to make sure people are following the anthropology of this um so basically you have a row of homes and each person in their home is responsible for demonstrating the contents of their home so they reach inside and they pull out various items from their home and they leave them on the curb and the you know the military is coming down the street inspecting the contents on the curb and they're just making sure that it's all stuff that we've pre-agreed is safe right so what they know they don't know the entire repertoire of what could be presented but they have a very clear list of what is acceptable and they're basically just ident identifying anything that is not on the acceptable list and if anything shows up and it's not on the acceptable list the house is destroyed furthermore if you leave nothing on your curb either because you're too incompetent or you're nefarious and you're trying to hide withs in your home there's another branch of the military that comes along and just blows up your house so failing to play the game results in in a loss of home that's right yeah well said so that so that's the beginning right I mean it's this kind of sampling if you will like you said of the of the inner contents um uh and and so that that's important to recognize because you know if you kind of start with this core principle that cancer is a quote unquote genetic disease meaning that mutations that happen in key genes that um disable cell's ability to repair DNA damage as a common um you know feature of cancers for example or mutations that activate some of those surface receptors or

[00:42:54] Downstream signaling molecules that we talked about before um those uh mutations we've learned in recent years can be seen as different um so they like you know kind of began to you know increase the kind of the toolbox if you will um of handles that the immune system can latch on to so if you think about it that way cancers you know um you know begin to form potentially uh if they're witnessed uh by you know the immune cells as having indifference early um we have lots of evidence that they can be eliminated um and I mean and there's actually kind of the I guess you know indirect um you know negative evidence if you will that people who have profoundly compromised immune systems will pop up with Cancers I mean if you give people you know seriously you know highd do immunosuppressive medication for various other medical conditions you will see cancers just kind of sprout up um you know quickly and then certainly over time as well um this immune surveillance concept is inordinate amount of evidence um in support of this idea that if at least keeping them down you cancer Proto cancers down if not outright eliminating them is that's just part of life on on planet Earth um you sort of in the cosmic storm if you will with UV radiation as being you know one Carson engine I mentioned well actually gamma radiation coming through the atmosphere is is also a cause of DNA damage we have to kind of um you know try to repair those uh that damage inside of cells I mean want say we I'm again using the anthropomorphic inside of a cell's uh inner workings here um and but you know but if the repair can't happen we have this other mechanism of immune surveillance basically to wipe it out so what I the reason why I wanted to just kind of spend enough you know kind of words uh you know on this concept is that basically people have to understand that by the time they're diagnosed with cancer something's gone wrong right basically right like the the system didn't work um to detect you know in this surveillance mode uh the forming cancer it didn't eliminate it um how can that be well it turns out that there um you know for every you know kind of process C that activates the immune system in response to an infection just go with that idea that that's like kind of you know the primary function of the immune system in terms of how it is that we ever kind of got out of the swamp in the first place evolutionarily um there's a break on the immune system like you can't just elaborate immune response you know indefinitely I imagine having the flu forever like just dumping cyto kindes or immune system hormones into the bloodstream you know cranking up you know body temperature you know and consuming a ton of metabolic resources in fighting infection and feeling bad as a consequence when you have the flu you can't do that like you know indefinitely you got to stop you know immune responses um and so we have you know mechanisms to do that like turns out very elaborate set of mechanisms to do that and Cancers have just ever so craftily figured out uh how to basically kind of reach into the genetic code the blueprint uh and Co-op mechanisms that will basically impede immune system recognition and response that's the pd1 pdl1 story so pd1 we've talked about that's the target of krudo but what cancers do it's a nasty little trick um is they figured out how to not all cancers but but the ones that are most responsive um to katuda they have figured out um how to express on their surface uh the the foot that presses on

[00:46:16] The Brak okay so that's called pdl1 so program death hyphen L1 Lian one which basically reaches across to pd1 on t- cells and tells them shut down basically like mission accomplished don't need to do anything here um and so you know a lung cell an Alvar lung cell um that ultimately becomes cancer is not supposed to be expressing that that that that protein on its surface right it's not supposed to be regulating the immune system that's like that's not the the natural job of a lung alular cell um but a cancer that arises from that cell uh in many instances basically quotequote figures out how to Express um that protein and so then blocking you know the interaction of the foot with the break like that's the magic that's there there it is um now that's just one mechanism but as I said it's actually produced a bigger incremental benefit in the cancer population than any single mechanism we've ever discovered in all of cancer biology research and therapeutic development history so it's a pretty powerful one but I'll just conclude with this statement that there are other mechanisms by which the immune system can be suppressed um in fact there's entire cell type in the immune system repertoire that are have a dampening effect on immune system response and Cancers can recruit them into their so-called micro environment and create this very adverse environment for the tea cells that could otherwise attack and kill so it's like almost like assembling a force field by virtue of inviting in these non-cancerous cells right there like this is like the cancer cells recruiting in um these suppressive immune cells so this is some of what we're up against I mean I just want to make it clear how kind of complicated it is um yes we we're super grateful to have had this you know kind of Eureka moment um with the success of pd1 drugs uh but but cancers have co-opted multiple mechanisms by which they defend themselves in terms of you know trying to close the gap then and use this immunotherapy concept much more broadly in cancer is going to require us to develop the understanding of okay well which tricks are being pulled and how to be able to you know really Target those very specifically we can't disable people's immune systems like that's not okay um and so we we do need a fair amount of precision and um you know and and figuring out kind of The Sweet Spot if you will in terms of What mechanisms cancers are using for this purpose of all the things that um Steve talked about when when I interviewed him last year the one that I was most Blown Away by which spoke to my time away from the trenches you know time away from what you're doing day to day was that roughly 80% of epithelial tumors had novel neoantigens now again if you said that at a party that would go over everybody's head and it wouldn't resonate as a particularly insightful thing to say but in light of what you've just said let's let's make sure people understand what that means and how shocking that is relative to where we were 20 years ago because 20 like just to put this in context right so when I finished my time at the NCI and went back to finish medical school and applied to residency you know you talk in residency interviews you're talking about what you're obsessed with and what you're interested in and I talked a lot me that my time at NIH was such a formative part of my education and I can't tell you how many people I interviewed with that just laughed in my face and said this immunotherapy stuff is nonsense like it's totally irrelevant like what are you talking about kid like this you're going to sell yourself to us as an interesting person that we should let into our program and you're talking about that crap like it literally means nothing okay it works on melanoma who cares right okay why is the fact that 80% of epithelial cancers have novel neoantigens a totally staggering feature that had people understood that 20 years ago U you know maybe more than just a handful of people would have found immunotherapy to be a very promising field yeah right right right so let's let's break that down a little bit um you know kind of the biology behind this so mutations accumulate in a Cell that's going to become cancer Fair number I mean we're talking you know never less than dozens in the you know the quote unquote most genetically simple cancers but you're typically into the hundreds and thousands um and basically you know like not all of those have a consequence um and and to the point about these antigens so some of them are in parts of the genome that don't even encode proteins right so like in which case they're not going to ever become you know the types of antigens you're alluding to the ones that are translated into proteins again those proteins age they get you know sort of you know broken up in the proteosome presented in the context of these MHC molecules that I referred to before on the cell surface but that's done differently in each of us and so basically there like we don't show our entire wees we show kind of you know Ed um uh representation of them in other words these MHC molecules you know you inherit kind of half of your set from your mother and half of your set from your mother father um they have a ability to grab just certain protein fragments um and present them when I say grab they're like actually loaded onto those um by a like cellular Machinery that's quite elegant um and so the point is we have this um you know this repertoire of showing the inner contents and so only certain mutated well genes that transl into let's call the mutated proteins or you know just altered proteins um only certain of those can actually be presented out of the very large number of mutations that actually exist um but what is astounding is that that as you say 80% of so when you use epithelial cancers just remind people like breast colon prostate lung the B pancreas it's basically it's not

[00:52:16] Leukemia Lymphoma basically and and brain and brain tumor right yeah not Leukemia Lymphoma or brain tumors uh and so and yeah and melanomas we mentioned before those actually come from melanocytes which are of neural crest origin which are actually share common features with brain tumors but basically just to be complete it's all the rest of cancer um what's astounding is that basically you can find evidence um that these mutated proteins are being presented um in the vast majority of these common Cancers and here's the point we are born with t- cell receptors um well born and during early fetal devel or early u u uh development after after birth we elaborate this this very uh impressive repertoire of t- cell receptors that you know sit on the surface of t- cells that can recognize exactly these altered proteins like with just one amino acid substitution uh present um in the the uh the peptide fragment um we've got that repertoire me you can so this is you know the proof that these antigens are antigens I mean like to meet the definition of antigen you have to find in a human being that the immune system can actually see it um in the context of it being presented on these MHC complex and and it turns out that like this it's kind of a lockin key concept essentially um that that it has to structurally work out that the protein fragment is being presented you know in the t- cell receptor docking in and seeing that version but not the unmutated version right like where that difference is enough to basically tell the t- cell go like kill um yeah so these exist I mean this like this first began to be described in Earnest about a decade ago um and then you know of course we were sequencing cancer gen um you know a ton at the time and we figured out as pd1 and C4 were being clinically developed we began like looking then in retrospect and seeing you know it's these tumors that have a ton of these mutations um they're the ones that are responding like much more likely than other cancer patientscancer types um and so guess what it's the ultraviolet radiation Associated cancers that have like just enormous amounts of mutations like in total and the presence of actually significant numbers usually often times dozens of these mutated neoantigens that's the jargon term that we're we're like coming towards here um and so that explains why the response rates are so high in those cancers smoking related cancers then account for just about all the rest of where pd1 has been efficacious so it like we didn't know this when pd1 and C4 antibodies were first being developed that like it was this interplay that um we could then like just add one drug that you know can block this foot on the break as I mentioned before and Bam you unleash these pre-existing te- cells against these presented um antigens but that does explain a ton of the benefit that we've um covered already with this um so-called immune checkpoint antibody approach so so that's fascinating but I

[00:55:13] I think you know what you're coming to is well then then what what else can we do with that information right and and so what Steve I'm sure talked about with you is well we can actually engineer immune cells to attack these things um and you know basically potentially overwhelm other ways that the immune system tries to well that that cancers try to protect themselves from the immune system um which is what cell therapy um of various kinds can do uh so you know basically we're still in the early days of elaborating this understanding um that that yes the vast majority of cancers um have these you know mute alterations that the immune system can actually recognize let me just finish with this one very Nuance point we have learned that some mutated new enens are much more U will cause a much more robust immune response than others in other words they're not all the same in terms of the type of immune response um that can be elicited and there's an argument that many have made terms of thinking about cancer biology and evolution and coexistence you know of this immune surveillance um system that basically the mutations that we end up seeing in diagnosed cancers are ones that aren't particularly well recognized they don't produce powerful immune responses the ones that produce ful immune responses well guess what those cancers never became cancers in the first place they got wiped out um right so there's this notion that like basically you have to be able to fly under the radar you know right and and you can you can build yourself as a cancer cell with a certain repertoire of mutations provided that n none of them are powerfully immunogenic yeah I mean we could talk about this forever I'll say a couple more things on it so that we can move on to talk about te- cell therapies where I think we're going next but I again I think to put a bow on this the way I think about this is that you know through all of recorded human history there have been very very rare reportable incidents of spontaneous regressions of solid organ metastatic you know these epithelial tumors right where you know Steve Rosenberg writes about one which was the the patient who got him to completely change his career it's the 1960s he's a resident at the

[00:57:21] Brigham a patient comes in who 10 years earlier had been sent home to die with metastatic gastric cancer throughout his liver you know they took his stomach out to pale him and you know he should have been gone in 3 months he shows up 10 years later with a gallbladder that needs removing not a shred of cancer clearly a spontaneous remission there's an example of someone who made not so much and so significant of an antigen that it got wiped out before it got anywhere this one actually got all the way to the promised land but somehow at that point the immune system said I recognize it and there are enough of us that recognize it and we're going to wipe this thing out and then what basically happened and it took 20 years well yeah almost 20 years right was figuring out that if you just dump enough interlukin two which is candy to te- cells you're you're going to pick up the next threshold which is in melanoma in renal cell at the time we didn't know why but as you point out they just have so many freaking uh mutations that you're bound to just stochiometrically come up with an antigen that's going to be your lottery ticket if we just dump enough interlukin two on we're going to flip the next threshold and then of course the checkpoint inhibitor takes it One Step

[00:58:43] Beyond that which is okay you clearly don't have enough for un spontaneous Nutri uh M uh mutation spontaneous response you don't even have enough that if I just gave you il2 but if I give you a more sophisticated help turning down the suppressor now it's going to work but to really unlock this right to basically say we could make 80% of cancer gone just gone imagine that right like 80 and by the way it might be more because maybe you can induce mutations we're going to come to that in a moment but if we if we just wanted to take 80% of cancer deaths off the table we have to be able to find out who is that perfect Soldier down there that's really really really out numbered and make make more of them and so so so what does that look like yeah well it's

[00:59:33] I mean just you know just to uh kind of connect the dots from early versions of cell therapy to where we are now um in you know Steve rosenberg's work was you so-called adoptive te- cell therapy let's not focus on that jargon term so much but basically doing a surgery to remove a single site of cancer metastatic cancer um removing the immune cells that had found their way into that cancer um which turns out actually is some of them are seeing antigens that they're specific for others are just trafficking through and they're kind of bystanders as it turns out um but any case immune cells you know don't traffic in high numbers through all cancers but certain quote unquote immunogenic cancers yes they do melanoma again being you know near the top of the chart there um and what Steve what Steve was doing um through the 90s um and certainly by the time you got there was taking those immune cells isolating them from that patient's tumor and simply expanding them right not not not not picking no genetic anything it was just grow these

[01:00:30] T yeah grow these tail yeah to a number that when he Infuse them back was could then you know systemically could then traffic through the body and Destroy um people's cancers um not not all the time but a significant minority of patients could be cured that way that's still true today and and and by the way we are right on the verge of that just that approach alone no genetic manipulation becoming an FD approv therapy finally melanoma which is where you know Steve had had the most consistent success back in those years he he's tried it in many different cancer types now what's been learned along the way um is exactly what we've already summarized which is this you know this idea of antigen specificity that you can find basically you know this kind of you know what is it that the immune system is seeing um these infiltrating immune cells in tumors what are they what are they looking at and then taking that knowledge to basically now begin to engineer um immune cells generally starting with the patient's own immune cells um so not coming from tumor anymore right but just basically collecting them from the blood um you need a fair number of them uh but because of genetic engineering advances cell cellular um genetic engineering advances you know we can now basically you know swap in swap out you know essentially whatever we like and in these immune cells that you know um we want to direct against cancers uh we can basically introduce you know the the the the recognizing piece if you will um so if we if we sequence of patients cancer uh which we do just as part of routine standard of care these days but you do it this like a little bit deeper a little bit more um uh in yeah kind of a systematic thorough way basically in in let's go with that number 80% of patients you know we can identify a mutated uh antigen that will only be in the cancer cells and introduce into the their immune cells a surface recognizer if you will I'm just being vague about the term not get lost in too much jargon all at once um and then basically just you know dial up that number of cells in the laboratory and then Infuse them back like a blood infusion which is how cell therapy is given um and and that's that's the approach that like translates you know connects the dots that we that we've covered we are not doing that today to be very clear the cell therapy advances Beyond just simply expanding um the the tumor infiltrating um immune cells or lymphocytes uh beyond that approach the engineering that's being done right now are against surface lineage markers um so on B cells for lymphoma primarily but some leukemias and now multile Myoma as well basically we are wiping out the cancer cells that arise from that population and the normal ones okay just to be clear like that like so what what we're what we were talking about is you know a very elegant you know very tumor specific um

[01:03:23] Cell Therapy strategy which you can like readily Envision uh sort of taking the field if you will but where we are right now in cell engineering is going after common surface markers in cell populations that we can quote unquote afford to get rid of so eliminating B cells is actually not a great long-term thing but you can actually survive without your B cells these are antibody producing cells for those who don't you know track immunology and so so the the poster child for this of course is cd19 and as you said every B cell is walking around with this marker on it just we don't have to get into why it's called cd19 and when a subset of B Cells

[01:04:01] Go on to become lymphoma that is otherwise unresponsive to other treatments lo and behold you could you know wipe out you could basically send in someone that's going to Target every cd19 um and and you you'll get rid of the bad guys you'll get rid of some good guys and on balance it's it's worth it for sure um but yes what we're talking about here is a next layer of sophistication because for example if a patient has metastatic lung cancer it's not an option to wipe out all of the lungs um that's right but it's also a more complicated problem like there are many cancers for which you could completely live without the organ you don't need your colon you don't need your breast you don't need your prostate you don't even need your pancreas um you'd much you're better off being I mean I'll give you an example I think you may remember this I have a friend um with Lynch syndrome it was unbeknownst to him because he was adopted um developed colon cancer uh in midlife again a great surprise when you're 40 to develop a stage three colon cancer um but later developed a pancreatic adoc carcinoma um you know I sent him to see an excellent uh doc who

[01:05:16] I had trained with and he was inoperable um so everybody who is familiar with pancreatic cancer understands inoperable you know locally advanced uh pancreatic cancer is uh is a is a six to 12 month prognosis um but because he had Lynch when this was 2012 maybe maybe 2013 it was just around the time that a paper had come out in the New England

[01:05:45] Journal of Medicine that had mentioned hey if you have mismatched mutation genes you might be a candidate for this new anti pd1 and this story has a happy ending in that sure enough he got the anti pd1 went into a complete remission MH but now needs insulin because the his immune cells destroyed every pancreatic cell in his body not just the cancer but the non-cancer do we do we not have enough novel proteins on breast cells or prostate cells that we can that the that the cd19 approach is going to work anywhere else is that a one hit wonder no well I wouldn't say that but it's it's true that we're you know these these te- cells are so powerful um you you need to find um you know handles again on the surface um that are truly specific for cancer cells so so I was honing in on you know what is truly specific or cancer cells these mutations um yeah that's and it's it's a big hill to climb that I haven't we haven't gotten into in terms of you know developing you know personalized uh engineered te- cell therapy for the entire Global cancer population that's a again it's a there's a a cost issue there there's a technology um you know issue uh you know to some degree as well but any case in the meantime you know what is the field focused on right now it's trying to you know identify those surface markers proteins um that are truly specific to cancer and and that's what we've been struggling with because there are other therapeutic modalities that don't require quite as much specificity where you can direct you know like you can direct chemo even like on the you know an antibody that's on on the back end of it has chemotherapy drugs that get you sort of ingested by the cancer cell and have a more localized effect um radionucleide so like like you know really powerful radiation emitters on the back end of such molecules um also and it's clear based on you know precedent you know clinical data and now some approved drugs even um that that are what I'm describing that there's like a spectrum of selective expression that is not needed there but for for cell therapy you you need it otherwise again you're going to obliterate uh every single uh cell in the body and here's the problem cancers come from us I mean right so so when they when they're you know reading the blueprint if you will and and um and translating certain genes into RNA and then proteins um that comes from the same genetic blueprint that you know our normal cells have uh and so you know

[01:08:14] Finding such proteins this is this has been a real it's not just technology Gap but it's it's it it's a it's been a real conundrum and like feeling blindly and just trying bunch of things like that like because of the power of the killing potential of these immune cells um there's like you know every constituent in the field has no appetite for that um so this is this has you know been where the field has been anguishing most um in terms of trying to understand if there's more cd19 like um opportunities but but on common epithelial cells where we can't you know can't destroy um you know the the normal version so so we need to get to this greater specificity let me just iner one final thought here um which is that the cell engineering field has certainly Advanced to the point of being able to create um you know basically sort of by functional recognizing um you know elements uh so these surface you know uh recognizing receptors U where basically both of the targets have to be present right so like an and switch as it's called like the

[01:09:19] Boolean and or um so we're basically instead of just creating a cell that goes after cd19 you create a cell that goes after cd19 and cd20 and you only ever kill a cell that's got both actually that's not a perfect example because cd19 and cd20 are almost always coexpressed on B cells but any case you get my point that there you know there is a fair amount of work going on right now to try to find pairs um that might proteins that might only be expressed on on certain cancers that might start to give us um you know the opportunity to take this same basic approach that's more readily scalable than the more personalized while you've got this you know genetic makeup of your cancer cells uh and we're going to zero in on a personalized approach that's specific to your immune system type and to that mutation um again in in theory it can be done U but we have to drive down cost of manufacturer we have to like a lot has to happen for that to be remotely feasible um and economically manageable let's go back to till for a moment you mentioned that they're on the cusp of um receiving an FDA approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma so again just to bring people back to what that means that means a patient with metastatic melanoma who presumably has progressed through all other non-cell therapies um and still has harvestable tumor this is a very important feature of till you actually have to be able to surgically pull out a large enough sample of a tumor so a patient for example has cancer that has spread to their lung they have to actually undergo lung surgery and take out a wedge or lobe or whatever amount is necessary that tumor is taken immediately to the lab where all the lymphocytes that are there are expanded and expanded and expanded and I forget it's been so long since I've been at it I think they want to get to at least 10 to the nine is that the order of magnitude okay so you want to you expand this to about 10 to the nine cells and they're reinfused usually with interlukin and again you're you're looking for this response it sounds great in theory MH why doesn't it work every single time you've clearly identified lymphocytes that know how to go there and presumably that's half the battle why don't they why doesn't this work every single time yeah I mean it's it again it goes back to defense mechanisms to a degree I mean it's so there's there you know this I talked about that kind of layering of the onion uh metaphor before basically there are layers of force fields I mean there it is the case that there's actually direct mechanisms that can impede killing um at the tumor cell level and I talked about like pdl1 being expressed on cancer cell surface well it turns out even intracellular um mechanisms um so so the way in which interferon which is an immune system hormone that like basically triggers cell death it's part part of the killing process um that when CDA positive T cells are trying to kill a cell like a virally infected cell or in this case a cancer cell and it turns out that that and you know to become cancers you know successfully become cancer in the first place that you can find direct evidence certainly in melanoma of of that can that you know in intracellular pathway itself being altered so that like that that the immune cells are actually unable to do the killing because IM because that cell is no longer sort of sensitive um to immune cell mediate death um which is a very nasty little trick and one that can't be overcome just by dumping in U more immune cells at least we don't have direct evidence that it can this also can cause resistance to to pd1 antibodies we demonstrated like in melanoma and handful of other cancer types now but like so you have to start sort of like inside the cell in terms of you know ways in which cancers have evolved an ability to resist immune recognition that is like that they're kind of contending with um but then you've also got you know that recruitment of um suppressive immune cells that I alluded to before which like especially very antigenic cancers very commonly you know do that need to do that um and you can't overwhelm them just by introducing more

[01:13:23] CDA positive tea cells uh buy and large and so in those cancer types where those um so-called myoid cells are very very predominant like this cell therapy has just not taken you know hold at all um and then there are trafficking issues um in other words you know so like basically features of cancer micro environments um some of them related to oxygen tension some of them related to nutrient availability um that make it very challenging for Anyan cells to you know persist you know multiply and and do their killing work and so this is you know we we we've known for so such a long time that cancers are cancer cells are metabolically inefficient um that they're living in this incredibly harsh environment um like as in very low oxygen gradients and and we just you know people didn't really understand like the why of that I mean like right people people what you're describing of course comes stems in part from the warberg effect which had always been you know people had always thought well it must be that cancers can't undergo oxidative phosphorilation and that's why they're doing this inefficient thing but to your point between the substrate argument you know going through reams of glucose leaves you more building blocks which is what they need more than ATP uh and then on top of that you're lowering the pH you're creating this incredibly harsh micro environment uh it seems like there's every reason in the world for from from a from a um a natural selection standpoint for cancer to do that I this is my point is that I think it's the why of it is that like well cancer cells like ultimately figure out how to sufficiently thrive if you will in such harsh environments well who can't survive in that very harsh environment immune cells I mean right and so this is the idea that this is all much of this has to do with you know kind of creating conditioning this harsh environment as a force field um you know this is another thing we are not addressing by virtue of just dumping in um more immune cells and so you know my argument is you know that like when I talk about multimodality therapy for cancer it's you know about targeting those mechanisms that we can address inside the cancer cell it's about modulating the environment um metabolically U you know kind of actually even fixing to a degree this oxygen um you know pity of oxygen and in the pockets you know of that um as well as manipulating these other cell populations like immune cells um and turns out even like fiberblast for example like get recruited into certain cancers most notably pancreatic cancer um they seem to be part of the force field again immune system as well so we have to kind of knock down the force field I mean it's just it's the Star

[01:15:59] Wars analogy right you've got to take out that the Moon that generates the force field around the Death Star before you um you you send in your fighters to actually try to destroy it and so you know to me it's it's you know we're we're on the verge of understanding you know kind of the hierarchy um of this biology and how to think about you know both diagnosing and then treating at this level but but the toolbox has to elaborate you know much more completely it's just I in my strongly held view it's not going to be four therapeutic

[01:16:32] Maneuvers all in column a right or four in column D it's like one from a one from B one from c one from D that's the type of four drug regimen that's going to eradicate cancer and it's not going to be one cocktail for all patients so let's let's dig a little deeper into that in terms of what the next five years might hold for us right so if we're sitting down again in five years to talk about the success ESS of the previous 5 years what's likely happened right so how much further have we gone in immunotherapy just in straight up activating te- cells either through adoptive cell therapy via genetic engineering to take peripheral blood lymphocytes and turn them into or engineer them into till let's put that as a category of therapy let's talk about other ways to identify checkpoints or uh checkpoint Inhibitors and or um combat the tumor suppressor cells so call that the sort of tumor suppressing environment go after it how much of it is going to be in the metabolic environment or the kind of interstitial micro environment that's and targeting the hostility um and then how much of it is going to be inducing mutagenesis so again you know you and I spoke about this probably couple of years ago and I ended up I think it I think I was able to keep it in the book I know there's always so much pressure you're trying to chop stuff out of the book so I don't remember if this finally made it in but

[01:18:03] I at least referenced one study that had taken patients I think with lung cancer who were you know none of them had any pd1 activity and then a course of platinum based chemotherapy all of a sudden rendered a subset of them to now be susceptible to it in other words using a conventional chemo increased immunos susceptibility even the conventional chemo itself wasn't particularly responsive um so so and again there's lots of ways to to go about doing that um you know paradoxically you could almost imagine taking a cancer cell and exposing it to more mutation forming uh insult so so and again I'm sure there's other ideas but so so yeah keeping the time frame short which is five years what are we going to need to do to double the response rate the durable response rate yeah well within a 5e Horizon I think what um I'd say well this first let's

[01:18:59] Look Backwards briefly um over the past eight years we have exhaustively tried to find other gas pedals and brakes on immune cells CDA positive T cells most notably and and in and and we we know what those gas PS and braks are on those cells and we have tried drugging those like typically on top of pd1 antibody therapy and that has almost completely systematically failed um now it doesn't interestingly produce horic toxicity in other words immune system doesn't get so hyperactivated like that's not the problem um but it just hasn't moved the needle now I will cavat that by saying that um those approaches have been used um without any notion of trying to like zero in on individual patients and sets of patients for whom you know that you know new immunologic mechanism you know might was hypothesized to be uniquely suited in other words we've been throwing a lot of spaghetti at at the wall and hoping things would stick by just you know treating like a broad array of different cancer patients with absolutely no um molecular selection even though there are certainly there always there were and remain hypotheses along those lines that you know were never really tested um so anyway just trying to hyperactivate T cells um with drugs I would say we've we've kind of played that out it's hard to imagine the only way to revolutionize that would be what I just alluded to which is really like really kind of tightening um or or sharpening our lens if you will um and focusing on on applying those drugs in very specific patient populations so beyond that um I really do see there's there's there's what I would say a related class of therapies the metabolism targeted therapies um and epigenetic targeted therapies which have been exploding um in terms of understanding how you know the blueprint the genetic blueprint is sort of folded up and unfolded um The Regulators of that um and the way in which cancers um many cancers like need to figure out how to you know co-opt or you know take over um the the function of some of those um folders and unfolder um and so there's been real explosion in novel U very early in development drugs in that class and it turns out interestingly that that altered metabolism so the warberg phenomenon that you alluded to um and the and the Regulators of that switch um those have been become elucidated on a you know much more complete way in in fairly recent years many people would have thought well you can't Target metabolism and get away with that right because every cell in the body needs to be able to regulate its metabolism in a you know kind of condition dependent way that's true but but cancers really do um they very much depend on this metabolic disregulation and and we think that we're on to you know some of the unique

[01:21:39] Regulators that cancer is particularly um co-opt so I I I would pay a ton of attention I mean our group um in terms of our therapeutic development work is is really quite focused in that area can you give us a bit more of a sense Keith of what that looks like so we we know that you know just from a glycolysis standpoint we know cancer basically is a one trick pony most cancers right they're they're turning glucose into pyruvate all day every day independent of how much fatty acid is available and independent of how much oxygen is available and independent of they they they have perfectly healthy mitochondria used people used to hypothesize the mitochondria were defective that's why they were doing it no evidence that that's the case so what so let's just play out what you're saying um you could take something really Draconian and say okay there's an end so we're not going to interfere with any enzyme that turns glucose into pyruvate that would be a bad idea because you have to do that if you're healthy but um so where else could you target where you disproportionately hurt a cancer cell without hurting a non-cancer cell that's undergoing glycosis yeah our group just published a paper on this topic uh you know it's now just five months ago um looking quite broadly to understand like the these metabolic Regulators um and which ones cancers seem to select L use and and interestingly this analysis was focused on uh immune cell recognition versus lack of recognition um and kind of the interplay between these two things so like you know we already we already laid out the argument of the idea that cancer is you know it seems in part adopt this inefficient um metabolic strategy because it allows them to kind of suck in you know available nutrients and keep them away even from immune cells so we were trying to unpack that and basically um when you look in biased way like sort of all of the you know Gene products that are expressed in cancer cells um differently than normal cells what you see is that it's outside the mitochondria so inside the mitochondria

[01:23:36] I'm 100% with you basically you can't poison that the factory uh in that way but it turns out that not only the function of mitochondria but also just like the the production of mitochondria so mitochondrial biogenesis it's called like there's many different mitochondria many many mitochondria per cell different cell types you know need different numbers of them based on their metabolic demands so cancer cells will actually regulate you know the amount of mitochondria they have um through these outside of mitochondria um uh you know programs if you will U transcription vectors in many case that regulate you know kind of the the program in the genome this is the the nuclear genome not the mitochondrial genome um that regulate this process so there's there's some switches there um and one of those switches um basically jumped out of this analysis as like the top you know differentiator if you will um that expressed in Cancers and not um and others now it's a it's you know it's the type of molecule that historically has been thought to be challenging to create a drug against um there actually is a

[01:24:35] Proto drug against it that's you know still preclinical but you know moving forward we've been collaborating academically with that company and um and so early days in terms of knowing whether this is really going to you know kind of bear out but but these are the types of insights we just didn't have uh you know five and certainly 10 years ago um that that there were would be there might be ways to actually kind of laser in on um The Regulators of metabolism that cancers are most potentially vulnerable to and I'm not suggesting these are going to be Standalone approaches as I said before rather they're going to poent yeah they're going to potentiate um these other therapies let me just kind of make this statement um to that point when we look at what drives resistance to both targeted therapy so those molecules I referred to before these you know surface receptor and downstream molecules that have been successful and extend people's um lives with cancer and imun therapy and we and we look at common themes in terms of resistance this metabolic switch like using oxidative phosphorilation when they weren't using it before like that's a very common theme in what we call the persister cell population um in in both therapy types and so the idea that you would then potentiate simply what we've already got you know right with this class of therapies go from 20% of cancer patients having long-term survival to you know 40% I'm just making that number up um just by figuring out this piece of the puzzle I think that's you know very much in view um now we might have to toggle Upstream Downstream you know kind of like play with where it is that we're um ultimately poisoning this uh you know process um and we may have to do it just kind of sporadic periodically like in other words not not constant like drug exposure all the time to be able to get away with it which is a common theme in terms of thinking about four drug regimens for cancer but let's come to your idea of actually um taking advantage of this very delicate um balance if you will where cancer cells have have accumulated gentic alterations to a degree that's supposed to be um intolerable for a for a cell's survival right in other words if you can't repair mutations and um alterations that have been caused let's say by acute exposure to something like radiation for example where you get a lot of mutations all at once we have repair mechanisms but if they don't do their job then a cell basically has a program by which it commits suicide um so so called program cell death and basically um cancer cells live dangerously on the edge if you will um in having accumulated these mutations um in certain cancers like with your friend with Lynch I mean wow the number of mutations that unable because of the of the defective Machinery is just off the charts like ultraviolet radiation

[01:27:05] Associated skin cancers um also off the charts and so any case um the point is that we know that actually if if you introduce more mutations into those cells like in the laboratory like you push them over the edge like they just like there's a limit to how much you to what they can handle so how about you know combining that concept with what we were talking about before of immune system recognition of mutated proteins and just say hey okay like you want mutations again going back to my anthropomorphic you know now we're talking to the cancer cell you you want a lot lots of mutations because it helps you you know dial the combination lock if you will and become a cancer fine you know we're going to not just double we're going to you know 10x the number of mutations you have um both to increase immune recognition and possibly also just simply drive toward yeah um that concept is it's behind

[01:27:58] Platinum based chemotherapy Effectiveness in cancers that that are somewhat deficient in repairing their genomes um right so that's a link that we've known about now therapeutically for a number of years parp Inhibitors uh that's that's a DNA damage repair enzyme parp um and inhibiting its function can push certain cancers that are close to the edge if you will over the edge so there's already some direct evidence that we can get that benefit the immunologic piece um that's I requires um another layer of complexity which is that basically you you would need to introduce the mutations um and and ones that are shared across you know the the whole population of cancer cells or if if not the whole then then nearly the whole so the immune system actually interestingly is able to elaborate um immune responses that become broader right so this is you know sort of epitope spreading as it's called uh where the immune system latches onto a a certain antigen in mounting an initial immune response but then actually can bring in reinforcements that are recognizing um other antigens and create a more sort of polyclonal response what was initially a monoclonal response um so uh so that that's a part of innate immune function but there's pretty good experimental evidence that you have to start with something that's at least shared in you know 95 98 maybe even 99% of cancer cells so this is where the idea of like you know using let's say radiation to treat like a single site of metastatic cancer and someone who's got 20 sites um we've tried this um and it hasn't worked I mean there's are like very sporadic cases where actually can like trigger um a much more profound immune response that's actually like systemic like that goes after all the tumor sites but that's quite rare again just for folks to make sure we're following the reason it would be rare is if you only introduce a whole bunch of mutations to 10% of the tumor you're you might generate a new immune response you might kick the tumor over the edge either by having so many mutations that it all under goes program cell death or it now finally Rises to the level of detection but that's not sufficient enough for the across the clear the rest yeah it won't clear the rest of the tumors and so so this then you know being manic oncologist you can imagine this is where my you know mind commonly goes in that we have to come up with a syst has to be systemic yeah I mean you have to do this systemic right and so that that's where there's some really fascinating data um that a colleague of mine at Mass General is uh about to publish and would suggest that basically you can incubate cancer cells and by incubate I mean actually in in a living being um with mutation inducing drugs

[01:30:33] AKA chemotherapy drugs certain chemotherapy drugs um but to for that to work you need to actually be you have to kind of pin them down with another therapy first right so some of the therapies we've talked about already that like actually are effective um you know partially effective for a period of time you know months to many months in some cases before resistance might manifest to some of these targeted therapy approaches if you pin them down with that therapy and incubate in you know these chemotherapy drugs that basically start to dial in more and more mutations um at least in Mouse models um it would appear that actually you can you can buy the time that you need to be able to actually introduce new mutations and have that um trigger immune recognition and make even you know pd1 antibody based therapy you know much much more effective effective um and so so we're going to try that idea in human beings um right basically taking so-called oncogene targeted therapy backbone treatments um and then using what are called alkala Agent chemotherapies which are the ones that can introduce new mutations most commonly um and and even at somewhat low doses it would appear um you potentially can introduce the mutations without having some of the dilar effects that chemotherapy drugs are well known to cause Keith I'm going to change gears for a moment only because I know we have a very short today relative to how long you and I could normally speak um and I want to talk about another very important topic so to introduce it let me share with you some stats that you know better than I do but I'll let you interpret the stats for the listener if you take a person with stage three colon cancer so this person has cancer in their colon it's even spread to the lymph nodes of the colon but to the visible eye it has spread no further and to there's no radiographic evidence that it's anywhere else you're going to put that patient on a fancy regimen of chemotherapy I don't have to spell Out full Fox and all that stuff but there's a there's a regimen of chemotherapy you'd put that patient on how many of those patients are going to be alive in five years 60 70% of them yeah it's about right yeah I mean again all depends on the size of initial tumor and other features but that's about right yeah let's now take that same patient in a way except he also has cancer that has spread to his liver so you're going to go ahead and cut the colon out take those lymph nodes out but on the CT scan you're going to notice that he's also got metastatic cancer so one of them is stage three one of them is stage four we're going to give that stage four patient the same chemotherapy we're going to give them the same drugs but in five years somewhere between none and a few per of those patients will be alive and if you wait to 10 years it's none yep y what's a decent explanation for that observation which by the way if we had more time we could tell the same story for every Cancer basically yeah yeah like in other words what I refer to as microscopic residual disease like why why why is it that we're actually able to eradicate microscopic residual disease with the same drugs that that don't do the job um when you have macro disease yeah in other words why does it work when you have hundreds of millions or billions of cells not all clumped together but sort of diffuse but when you have like a hundred billions cells and they're like in big visible clumps the same drugs just fail yep so there's there's there's you know I would say two prevailing explanations uh there there are hypotheses I mean frankly because they become explanations once we actually you know connect the dots and really you know prove that we can you know demonstrate our knowledge by curing more patients with this um so one is basically just a clonal heterogenity concept so basically as cancers evolve um we use used to think that cancer cells were kind of identical clones of one another like that like they're just like you know just a massive number of absolutely identical cells um that in the beginnings of cancer that is largely true um but as cancers continue to evolve um in our bodies uh they actually keep mutating um and so you start establishing subclones I mean and like you can have a dominant subclone that's typically the case like that might even be you know 99% of cells um and then in that remaining 1% you might have 10 subclones um we've proven now that that certain therapies actually able to pick off the 99% they leave the 1% or and then somewhere in that 1% is a clone that has a resistance mutation like already in it to the drug that we're giving um so there's a clonal heterogenity you know um you know uh hypothesis that I would say is is quite strong at this point because of some of the evidence I just alluded to that that's a big part of the problem if you nip it in the bud if you will with offering the same therapy there's not so much clonal heterogenity um that's that's that represents a Curative opportunity and so when I was talking before about these um socalled anene targeted therapies which is not all of the targeted therapy successes we've had but the ones that go after these mutated um activated U proteins on you know these growth factor receptors and downstream ones in particular um it's very clear that you can't you can cure a trivial fraction of patients with over medesthetic disease and you can cure a pretty substantial fraction of patients in the so-called agant setting so microscopic residual dis setting and and so so we we have direct evidence that this phenomenon occurs but but but you're asking the why question it's we think some contribution or some part explanation from having to do with you know lack of clonal heterogenity the other is this secondary immune response concept right that basically all successful Curative cancer therapies actually do trigger immune recognition um through what's referred to is immunogenic cell death so that you're killing the cells directly with your drugs um but that basically the but the mop-up work if you will of actually eradicating every last single cell is an is the immune system's job um it's a concept that was first um introduced uh with when we had just you these conventional chemotherapy drugs from the 1900s um and and now we actually have more and more evidence that our you know sort of more elegant molecular targeted drugs actually engender these types of you know you know better immune system recognition phenomena um as part of their mechanism of action and and I and because we've directly demonstrated that like better immune recognition in you know in patients who are receiving these therapies looking at biopsies compared to uh pre-treatment and that that happens rather quickly um you know I think it's reasonable to then you know like overlay that on top and say well yeah it's it's it's extending your spontaneous remission you know kind of um starting point uh from from a while ago in discussion uh that basically you're you're allowing this kind of

[01:37:28] Tipping Point phenomenon to occur yes you're directly killing cells with these drugs that's true but the eradication piece yeah um you know is is uh is ultimately an immune system and I think there's kind of a hybrid there too right Keith which is that in the in the micro metastases environment in the adant setting you have less capacity for the tumor to create the hostile environment in which to impair the immune system from in up the damage so it's it's all it all favors keeping the cancer cell on its heels and the way to do that is to just have as little of them as possible is going to increase our odds you still have to win I mean you still have to kill because if you don't it will get back onto its toes that's right and and this is I mean this is what we're talking about is behind this you know massive like wave of enthusiasm um and it's it's it's um legitimate enthusiasm not hype that early detection is going to allow our same toolbox of drugs to be massively more effective um so early detection that's the only reason I posed the question right like that that's exactly you're taking the queue and you're running with it right because we're we're pretty terrible at that uh in as as it stands right now um so you know as I think many um uh of your audience know basically we can only screen we only have real direct evidence of effective screening for a few cancer types um I mean cervical cancer for for sure but we could also like hopefully eradicate cervical cancer by getting everybody vacc eventually exactly um but but cervical cancer screening um you know absent a vaccine is is quite effective so um so that's one breast cancer for sure we can cut the risk of breast cancer death by about a third um with mamography but that's not that's not a very inspiring number I mean I absolutely suggest that everyone who's eligible who you care about you should um you know strongly insist that they get mam s colonoscopy um and other less invasive means of deducting colon cancer can reduce risk of colon cancer death by about 25 to 30% ballpark I mean the the best the most optimistic estimates would be about a third um also um and there again I'd say well that's that's a real number I mean you know I I've had my first colonoscopy and I'll keep doing them but that's not that that isn't you know um again particularly inspiring and despite you know lots of effort and would say lots of controversy prostate cancer screening is is really quite poor

[01:39:55] I mean really it's like kind of a it's a it's almost like just you know um nonrandomly assigning people to get prostate biopsies right as you getting PSA tests basically it's it's it's not a great way of detecting um Cancers and certainly not potentially dangerous prostate cancers but I would add something to that Keith which is that all of those three the three last ones which are three big cancers right those are three of your big five um they all have something in common so if you look at mamography infrequent colonoscopy and

[01:40:26] PSA I would make a case that all of those are not great screens by themselves I'm sure you would agree right so in other words um people often confuse and unfortunately this is true of Physicians and policy makers more than it is patients because I think the patients are looking to those of us who think about this for input patients confuse or policy makers rather and Physicians confuse the statistics you rattled off as proof positive that early screening doesn't justify the cost Yeah a different way to say it is no mamography used in isolation which has its blind spots is not a mono theapy yeah PSA by itself as you said is shy of a random number generator MH but that doesn't mean that adding ultrasound or MRI to the breast surveillance program won't dramatically by stacking tests with different sensitivities and specificities right mamography exceptional for small calcified lesions uh Works poorly in hyper glandular tissue right the exact opposite is true with the MRI uh similarly with the PSA by itself virtually meaningless but PSA density PSA velocity now adds much more uh specificity uh furthermore you start to add things like a 4K and if the risk is high enough you get um you know multiparametric MRI I'll I'll tell you this Keith I mean I'm not telling you anything you don't know but I think again just for listeners in 10 years I have not had one patient get a prostate biopsy that wasn't warranted and I'm I'm not a superstar it's not like I've I've got something no it's just that we're we're doing this we're not just using PSA right sometimes we've had patients who only get picked up on PSA velocity their

[01:42:23] PSA is not high enough to trigger the 4K no one would go and do anything based on their you know P so so I I think I get a little frustrated when the medical community that's anti- early screening or or screening and early detection poooo it based on what I still think are impressive numbers the number you you state because that's sort of like saying you know um you know there's too many fatalities in cars we shouldn't drive right it's just it just doesn't make any sense it's like yeah there are fatalities in driving let's figure out ways to drive better you can put a seat belt on you could not drink while driving and you could mind the speed limit that's a totally different situation than saying it's you know we're g to abandon all those things so um anyway this is why I think yeah you're you're reminding me that I like in my world uh you know being an oncologist I like I don't have to contend with the community you're referring to that's right so I mean I take those numbers as being like absolute support and endorsement but part of what I'm getting at is the remaining unmet need right and it and it's into that massive unmet need that there has been just an enormous advance in terms of methods for detecting like you know single Al uh single U fragments of genes um in the bloodstream uh so it turns out that that normal cells shed

[01:43:48] DNA um in the in the bloodstream and it is digested and broken down you know reasonably quickly U but not immediately um cancer cells do this also uh as it turns out um and the more cancer you have in your body of course the more um well maybe that's not so obvious but is true that the more cancer that is in the body the more um of the copies of cancer

[01:44:11] DNA that will actually be shed in the bloodstream but sequencing technologies have advanced um to a degree that now you know from a single 10ml tube of blood and particularly one collected over time so kind of analogous to your ps your PSA velocity example where you're sampling at multiple time points if you sample at multiple time points now and subject those um I don't mean just to the methods that are you know being early you know are being commercialized now but but are being commercialized I mean since we talked four years ago what what felt like you know very much a research method is now emerging as a a real clinical option there's methods now that can find cancers at at at an earlier point and a broad array of cancers like Way Beyond just the the cancer types that we're talking about I the ones for which we have screening methods I mean um so really kind of you know almost pan cancer tests but in R&D mode right behind them are you know 10x 100x more sensitive methods that are are absolutely going to move the needle in terms of our ability to find cancers um at a microscopic Point um now here's the problem uh so the the problem is at a mic opic Point uh right what do you do I mean right where do you direct the scalpel I mean this is this is a fundamental conundrum so you overlay on top of what I just described the fact that on that on the circul tumor DNA um as it's called you can actually do more than just sequence you know for mutations to find that it's circulating tumor DNA as opposed to normal DNA you can also look at what are called methylation patterns which is has to do with this kind of like folding and unfolding of the blueprint um these these molecular modif applications that that that exist in certain cell types um and basically if you find you know mutated sequence of DNA and it's got the methylation pattern of a colon epithelial cell guess what cancer you probably have right so so and and while you can't direct the scalpel right away obviously you can do a colonoscopy um but similarly for you know breast cancers and others where you can then start to focus your attention right with with imaging analysis to try to you know detect the cancer maybe not the moment that the blood test is positive maybe it's going to take you six 6 months 12 months 18 months of continued surveillance and then you'll find it at a much earlier Point than you ever would have found it you know based on our other methods um so that's one you know sort of Paradigm and that that's where we are right now with the adoption early adoption of you know methods as they exist now that are getting rapidly better in terms of increased sensitivity so there's been a real explosion in terms of investment in this area and now um scale up of technologies that are you know commercially relevant um but the other concept I wanted to just kind of weave in here is I think where you kind of started this um set of questions which is that basically you know in certain instances we're going to find you know targetable mutations and you know and by that I mean with you know drugs or with immunotherapies where basically you know we'd say well look we can't we see it in the blood we actually with our best available scanning technology we can't actually see it in a way to direct a scalpel but we actually know what drug to give you to eradicate your trivial amount of cancer um right you know using analogy that we we started with here which is like clinically overt metastic disease versus you know microscopic disease that remains after surgery the AKA adant setting um but now finding cancers at a point where there's many fewer of these cells and where you know the defense mechanisms the force fields the heterogeneity that we talked about before don't exist and so this is I mean a real reason for optimism I should just highlight that there's two applications here um one is actually to do um much more precise therapy in the postsurgical setting so really figuring out you know right after surgery who still has microscopic disease in them who doesn't now that that's a much easier problem I mean I I actually talked with Max Dean about that problem and he's one of the

[01:48:05] Pioneers in that field and of course not to minimize the the the the amazing breakthroughs there but there you know what you're looking for right you've taken out the patient's lung cancer you know exactly how that lung cancer differs from a non-cancer lung cell and you're out there looking and you're right I mean this now becomes the most elegant way for uh post- treatment surveillance but it's it's what we started with that is the much more difficult problem and frankly the most important problem I mean if you solve this problem I I I don't know that the other things matter anymore right like if you sol if you solve this problem you you you win the game yeah completely no yeah we just we've just we've always been stuck in this mode in cancer research and therapeutic development to kind of start with the worst case scenario if you will and and then learning that's you have learn that's right and the same therapies that arewhat effective in the over metastatic setting are much more effective in the so-called adant or post-surgical setting and we have every reason to believe they're going to be at least as effective arguably more when we're down to one you know like two logs three logs even fewer cells um at the time that we're finding intercepting the cancer when the immune system is still quite competent is still actually you know doing you know much of its job so what's the what's the state of the uh of the market today Keith in terms of um uh tests that that people listening to this can actually get as part of a uh a cancer screening uh protocol so so so

[01:49:36] Grail has a commercially available kit uh it's you know it's not overthe counter you need to get it through a physician um what what are some other tests out there and in your view how close are we to these tests being an imperative part of cancer screening yeah I I I think we're not quite at the imperative point but we're uh we're certainly at the point where I would say it's reasonable to get a test I mean right if you consider yourself an early adopter and you know who you are um it's reasonable to get a test um it's you know and just quickly to answer your question uh the first part of your question uh there's a test that was initially developed by a company called

[01:50:13] Thrive that was acquired by exact um and they they they have a commercially available test as well and then another company called Deli um have a commercially available test which are all all have performance characteristics that are you know in the same realm um in terms of supporting uh you know their their current clinical use um but here's the concern um that many people have which is um that basically we're at a state in the field where finding people who are blood positive blood test positive um could lead to a large degree of anxiety in terms of then you do you know stand standard radiographic assessment you don't find the problem and that and that basically the medical community and because we're not talking about oncologists you who are doing the tests right so um the medical community um really hasn't had time to really kind of work out the Kinks of like how do we manage this situation and so you can almost argue that there need to be you know generalists who you know kind of really develop expertise you know kind of content knowledge have a network of

[01:51:15] Specialists that they can work with to be you know to be able to kind of catch these patients um and these tests were launched you know before that was really so that's just my PSA Public Service Announcement in terms of um the fact that you just like you know if you just get a test and you're not in the hands of someone who can you know kind of manage um a positive test U I think that that that is at least anxiety-provoking but the and the technology will is is I me again it's we we've uh with collaborators of ours uh we've actually been doing like direct head-to-head comparison U you know kind of analyses like of how much lower can we go in terms of you know amount of of tumor DNA in the blood that can be detected with you know what are currently R&D methods but are readily scalable um we're really at 100x better I mean it's like this is

[01:52:04] It's and you know that it's at that point you're talking about a finger drop of blood if you're 100x better than 10 mL you mean yeah but okay that's true you could take it in that direction but we actually you would say no stay with 10 or 20 M and we are way more sensitive oh exactly exactly I mean right so that so that's the point and and then then do serial analyses right do mult you know so like in the in go with high-risk populations to prove this point if you like but so we we we we can readily

[01:52:30] Envision how it is that we basically start to capture you know a much bigger um uh section of the population it's a little hard to estimate right now basically until we do more studies what's differentiating these companies so if you just look at Deli and gra and and is it the I mean you know so sort of so Grail to me I have no interest I have no uh affiliation with any of these companies we use Grail in our patience um when we do we don't do this in everybody for exactly the reasons you've stated you got to be able to tolerate the uh the the noise that may come of these tests that's sort of our view of aggressive cancer screening in general but but when we use it we do use Grail and that's largely based on the affiliation with alumina right which is if you've got the best sequencing company in the world that created the engine for this thing then I mean that that sort of makes sense to me but but what else differentiates these companies yeah it's basically uh so I mean there's three three kind of aspects to circula G

[01:53:26] DNA that we we now know um if you pay maximal attention to you can increase your sensitivity you can you know find more cancers so I started with mutations that's like that's kind of the the first principle then comes the so-called fragment length so fragment tox if you will or its own field uh separate from you know uh first generation genomics um and that uh and and you know Deli basically like basically came out of that scientific discovery that circul tumor basically um comes in different fragment sizes um than normal cell DNA and that that basically this is a kind of population phenomenon you're measuring multiple well many many um circulating DNA fragments um and tuning your algorithm uh ultimately to be able to kind of find this sweet spot of differentiation that that is that's definitely part of the formula and I I would argue that just everybody's going to rise to that um you know uh inclusion of that method and then that methylation aspect that I talked about before that that that's that's the other feature that has been a differentiator um in terms of kind of the the first marketed products um in this class um even across these three companies but there are 10 more companies coming right behind so basically the the first one is kind of not valuable for pan screening because that's that's your that's how you're checking for recurrence when you know the mutation right I mean we're not going to be able to screen people on the basis of guessing cancer mutations are we uh no no some would argue we can I mean the cost of sequencing continues to nose dive um believe it or not um still still going down U lower and lower uh cost uh you know per you know unit of um of sequencing done no there were there are some who argue actually no no we just we go after you know pick a number you know the Thousand most common cancer mutations the 10,000 most common the 100,000 most common cancer mutations I mean I guess if you had K and you had like if you you know p53 P3 which is pv3 is mutated in 50% of all cancers now it turns out hundreds of different

[01:55:29] P3 yeah it's a big Gene but it but but still so this people used to object to that concept based just on sequencing cost um you know uh argument but that that I think is becoming less and less relevant so yeah so that that first feature doesn't require that customization which is what's being done in the postsurgical setting you alluded to that but just to make sure that people understand that that's that that

[01:55:51] Tech when know what mutations exist in the reected tumor it does allow you to create very very sensitive test for that patient and that's what's being done commercially are these bespoke um assays based on what comes out in the surgical specimen but when you don't know what you're looking for the argument is if you do enough sequencing um you you'll find them which companies are do are there companies or is that all done in the lab right now are there are there companies that are actually taking it's not it's not yet commercialized no no but it I mean but it's this is like there real I mean I mentioned this briefly before there's just a a real scale up in investment in this area which is incredibly heartening to see I mean I used to complain for so much of my career about the fact that

[01:56:32] Diagnostics just didn't get the same investment that Therapeutics got because the return on investment just fundamentally different like you know fundamentally different um between the two domains and yet as clinicians like we need the Diagnostics we can't even we can't even think about Therapeutics until we you know well that's that's the irony of it right is that people talk about oh we'd really love to lower healthare costs yeah you need earlier and better

[01:56:54] Diagnostics like it's just it's just such a no-brainer that you could you know it's I think it's wise to be upset about the cost of oncology Therapeutics that are adding no value but you spend a tenth of that on the Diagnostics you make that problem irrelevant exactly right that's right and and then the durations of therapy that we need to give people you know to have Curative outcome I mean like you solve so many problem you just say we're turning this into a lock and key model from diagnostic to therapetic

[01:57:22] Keith we're just about out of time so I want to kind of end with with a with a question that you may not be able to answer but it's worth asking anyway um you know I think of you and and and people I know like you as the most remarkable you know oncology Advocates meaning I know that if one of my patients comes down with uh cancer I can call you up and say Keith I've got this woman it's a very unusual breast cancer it's you know it's it's her two new positive but erpr negative there's something funky about it going on who do you like who should she be seeing um and and and and and let's say there's another situation where a traditional therapy is failing and and you know you're going to point me in the direction of um of where where there's a clinical trial that's promising not just a phase one that's like probably got no hope but here's a here's a phase two that really has some hope okay so like there should be an entire industry of

[01:58:22] Keith flarities who are there to be consulted by um families who find themselves in this in this situation because again we come back to how we started this discussion there's nobody listening to us right now or watching us right now who hasn't been touched or will not be touched by cancer and even if it's a cancer that ultimately doesn't kill them which again in about half the cases it won't actually kill you you will need help navigating the system and the disparity in Cancer Care in this country uh and probably in most countries is significant and therefore it does matter who you know it does matter which expert points you to the best treatment center so because I can't clone Keith and a dozen other people that I know that I can pick up the phone and call what what does that look like I mean what what can somebody do when they when they get that bad news this drives me crazy what you're talking about in terms of access to expert opinion um when you need expert opinion and and particularly for complex unique um outlier cases if you will or and you don't know as a patient or a family member whether you're you know um dealing with a middle of the road case right how how would you know um and and this is where um basically so first off like we we we need to pull our insights if you will right like like break down the silos of you know hospitals and centers and universities and whatever um and pull our you know kind of you know opinions uh that's kind of Point number one point number two is we need to leverage technology for this purpose like this is I mean this people get all excited about artificial intelligence in terms of it's you know it's how it's informing you know chemistry advances and and the like and and and you know

[02:00:14] I'm excited about those things too but but and then other aspects of you know biology Discovery and all that but this is the this is the most obvious basically right is that you essentially you you start to you know like build the database essentially of of opinions um that you know that like I and others you know offer to specific cancer cases based on certain aspects of their diagnosis right and and the patterns are like the these are not hard for a machine to figure out I mean a human could figure out no it's it's sort of codifying what you do what you do very easily as the teaching set for the AI exactly and what getting at is within the 95% you know boundary of you know of you know kind of typical cases um basically you you I mean really could you could the decision support can really be based on you know the last 100 cases that I and my you know other melanoma colleagues have seen that are you know just like this um and then the edge cases is where we need to apply our specific attention right and there I think there are actually enough of us to handle the edge cases um uh the problem is that we like the way our system works is like nobody knows what their complex of their diagnosis is so right so basically are like everybody's seeking you know the same level of care and and you know sort of decision making um without that understanding and and I we can get way ahead of this and and and be transparent in explaining like look you know here's why we're saying you've got a very typical case we have a ton of outcome data we you know we know we know what therapy um is is the very best and then like you know the issue of like therapeutic access and like investigational therapies that are you know crossing the divide or are showing real responses in real human beings and should be considered you know as a certain priority maybe not the top priority but a backup option or something that's also like that is like that is just not um rocket science um and you shouldn't have to get on an airplane never go see anybody but even on the zoom screen I mean honestly this is we we are so inefficient in terms of how it is that we disseminate information um it drives me crazy and um there are very few entities but are few um that are working on this problem and and kind of see it this way this is you throw some technology this problem I think this this goes away so what is the best thing that one could do now what are what are the companies that are out there that are trying to do this now that they're reputable in your mind yeah

[02:02:31] I mean n of one's been at this for a long time and they this is still a model that they're um I think quite good at um but but not the accumulating of the database and the you kind of again figuring out how to you know um you know uh you know kind of focus attention if you will um there's a company I know called excur that's doing um exactly this kind of work I mean but it's still it's still at the helping individual patients navigate level right now what

[02:02:57] I'm you know the the next turn of the the full it's not the full Insight machine that's right that's right yeah but that but it's going to come I mean I I mean this is another area that there like investment you know under underinvested um and I would really I mean I would really like to see this because we we otherwise as you know we're kind of blowing the bank on a very efficient um system as it stands right now and it's not it's not scalable certainly not globally scalable well

[02:03:22] Keith this was this was fantastic obviously we're going to sit down in four years again and and and talk about the the last four years which will be going forward from here and um uh I I don't know I I have to say I find myself quite optimistic um about what I see happening um and um I I think I think we'll be talking about some big wins in four years again I don't think we're C quote unquote curing cancer um but I think we're going to get a lot better at detecting it earlier which gets people into a treatment pipeline soon um and I think we're going to continue to see probably incremental ways to harness the immune system that's probably where I I see a lot of optimism and again I think that's in combination with other traditional therapies and non-traditional therapies such as the metabolic ones you mentioned yeah the the good news is that the the technology curve continues to bend upward right and so we talked about sequencing technology as an example there but cell engineering advances ability to take new molecular targets and rapidly cycle that through to you know new drugs um small molecules antibodies the like um all of these advances are converging in a way that if we keep talking at fouryear increments the pace of progress is going to be like substantially greater per unit time we've already witnessed that I mean it's there's no question that fouryear increments over my career that's that's been true um it's reflected just in in approval of drugs by the FDA uh for cancer but but now the convergence of

[02:04:49] Diagnostics and Therapeutics um that's what's finally coming into view um that that that that piece has really I would say been largely missing um but you know if you link up all that we talked about today I think like that's that's the take- home message really is that's the crossing of those wires that's what's really going to massively get us um towards the path of having many a much much much higher percentage of patients who are 10e survivors to use that

[02:05:14] Benchmark again yeah well Keith thanks again it's been great speaking with you and I I I know we'll speak a lot more in the next four years but I look forward to hting you again back in four years and having the uh the next increment of time discussion absolutely really enjoyed it be well [Music]
