# #123–Joan Mannick & Nir Barzilai: Rapamycin and metformin—longevity, immune enhancement, & COVID-19

**Channel:** Peter Attia MD
**Upload Date:** 2020-08-10

**Duration:** 136 minutes

## Description

In this episode, Joan and Nir discuss their extensive research into rapamycin (including the category of analogs to rapamycin known as rapalogs) and metformin, respectively. Based on his work with metformin, Nir shares how he believes it could be a pro-longevity drug and the clinical trial he’s leading to test this belief. Joan discusses her work with rapalogs, their ability to suppress the immune system as well as provide immune-enhancement, and the clinical trials she has led that inform her insights. We also talk about the potential beneficial roles of both metformin and rapamycin in reducing mortality from COVID-19, reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, and delaying aging as well as its related diseases.

We discuss:

00:15:00 - When Nir became convinced metformin could be a pro-longevity agent  
00:24:15 - How metformin and rapamycin impact the hallmarks of aging and extend lifespan  
00:34:15 - Enhancing the immune system with rapalogs and metformin  
00:41:30 - Potential of metformin and rapamycin in reducing mortality from COVID-19  
00:59:00 - Insights from Joan’s studies investigating the immune-enhancing effects of rapalogs  
01:08:15 - Vaccines and treatments strategies for COVID-19, and the likelihood of long-term immunity  
01:14:30 - The potential role of rapalogs and metformin in neurodegenerative disease  
01:18:00 - Nir’s TAME trial—primary objectives and latest updates  
01:25:45 - Potential synergistic effect when combining metformin with rapamycin  
01:27:30 - Why Peter stopped taking metformin and started taking rapamycin  
01:37:30 - Story from Nir’s book that demonstrates the challenge of doing good scientific studies  
01:42:00 - The biology of aging—epigenetic clocks, proteomics, and Nir’s centenarian data  
01:57:15 - Joan’s dream experiment to test immune-enhancing effect of RTB101  
01:59:45 - Concluding thoughts on COVID-19

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the episode:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Joan Mannick and Dr. Nir Barzilai discussing two important drugs in longevity research: rapamycin and metformin. They explore these drugs' potential roles in immune enhancement and COVID-19 protection. The discussion covers clinical trials, mechanisms of action, and the broader implications for aging and disease prevention. Both experts share insights from their extensive research experience and discuss the potential of these compounds to enhance immune function and reduce disease severity, particularly in elderly populations.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Rapamycin/rapalogs can enhance immune response to vaccines in elderly patients [00:15:00]
- Metformin shows potential to reduce COVID-19 mortality by up to 25% in diabetic patients [01:15:30]
- Both drugs work through multiple pathways affecting aging hallmarks [00:45:00]
- Women show more stable proteome aging patterns than men, with only 200 vs 560 changing proteins [01:45:00]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Consider immune enhancement strategies before exposure to pathogens [01:20:00]
- Focus on host resilience rather than just pathogen response [02:00:00]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Rapamycin:
- Dosing: 5-6mg weekly with cycling (8 weeks on, 5 weeks off) [01:30:00]
- Side effects: aphthous ulcers, slower nail growth [01:32:00]

Metformin:
- Typical dose: 1500mg extended release daily [01:35:00]
- May affect exercise performance and lactate levels [01:25:00]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"We are reinforcing the host, we're not fighting the virus" - Dr. Barzilai [02:05:00]

"I think biomedical research has been elevated a notch" - Dr. Attia [02:15:00]
