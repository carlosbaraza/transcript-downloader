[00:00:42] Peter Atia MD com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode welcome back to another episode of the drive my guest this week is Ryan holiday previous guests and a close friend in addition to the conversation we released on tuesday with sam harris i also wanted to bring back ryan to talk about stoicism and how it can help us during these current times we talk in this episode in particular about some of the measures of stoic philosophy and how moments like this are sort of tailor-made for examining those principles and more importantly figuring out how to apply them to our lives but worry not this is not an episode that gets deep or philosophical in any way shape or form it is mostly about us talking about balancing the challenges trying to think through other things that folks are experiencing that perhaps Ryan and I are not experience for example Ryan and I happen to live in largely rural areas and therefore at least we're not space constrained during this period of time but but we're aware that many people are and the question then is okay well what would you do if you're stuck on the 17th floor of a 600 square foot apartment in

[00:01:53] New York how can you apply some of these principles we revisit some of my absolute favorite stories from some of his books including the one that I think about the most which is that of Winston Churchill during the Second World War and basically we extract insights and lessons from a number of Ryan's book again his most recent stillness as the key obstacle is the way ego is the enemy let's just get right to this one it's about 90 minutes long and I think most of you will find at least something of value in here so without further delay please enjoy my discussion today with

[00:02:24] Ryan Ryan thank you so much for making time on pretty short notice yeah of course any time are you doing I'm doing okay overall I think I'm doing pretty well feel pretty feel pretty fortunate to be with my family during all this I think sort of reflect that I'm at the other day and thought man this would be a lot worse if all this were going on and I wasn't with my family so despite the inconvenience of this which I think is it's obviously an inconvenient in different different extent to different people yeah I don't know I'm doing better than I was a week ago of seeing the potential upside of this now you from the beginning Ryan I mean I was in contact with you right away and you seemed to immediately find a way to be productive in this and and I think part of that is you're one of the people that has the luxury of being able to work from home but aside from that does this also kind of pose for you a new laboratory in which you can examine your own reactions to this sort of thing and then that of others yeah I mean to me that's the only potential positive of any sort of dramatic setback or adversity or obstacle or whatever it is is that it is a chance to sort of see things differently or look at things differently almost always this status quo is something we had some sort of part in setting up so we kind of liked things the way that they are so sort of given a choice I'd probably have left them exactly as they were but then when you sort of experience these sudden shocks suddenly you're working from home or suddenly you're not doing this anymore or in my case like a whole bunch of stuff that I was planning to do later this month and then in all of April was suddenly cancelled and so obviously the economic hit of that is very large and very unpleasant but at the same time so

[00:04:23] I never would have canceled them sort of deliberately but then when you find yourself feeling really that they got canceled you're like oh maybe my feelings on this were a little bit more mixed than I understood I mean for me I am very lucky I work from home not only can I work from home but I live on a fair amount of property outside of a major city so and I had some mutual friends you being one of them that sort of gave me some heads up on stuff that was happening so I was able to prepare so I wasn't sort of caught off guard or as harmed by it as some people so I have a little bit on the hierarchy of needs because I'm not that worried about food let's say or not that worried about where my parents are or how my kids are doing or whatever I do have some time to think about it but I I have been feeling this weird feeling of oh maybe this pace and this set up is actually closer to what I want my life to be than what the life I had that was supposedly disrupted was yeah that's an interesting thought right because as you said there are a lot of things that there's probably nobody listening to this who hasn't had to make an enormous sacrifice in something with respect to their professional life in their personal life and for many of us those changes like the example you gave are not things we would have done on their own if someone came to me in January and said from

[00:05:52] March 1st until I don't know I'll just make it up and say July you cannot get on a plane I would have said that's impossible I'd just say like that's incompatible with my job that's incompatible with what's expected of me by the people I help I could have come up with a hundred reasons why that could never have been done and yet guess what that turned out to be untrue yes a lot of the things we think are non-negotiable we're just actually not willing to negotiate but of course are non-negotiable weirdly that is something that kids sort of teach you as well I think is suddenly all these things that you thought you couldn't do that you thought had to be a certain way get get blown up and then you're forced to sort of question them but yeah I'm in the same boat obviously this is the way that it has to be obviously this is the system it only works this way but so much of that is just sort of a status quo bias that we have were a sense of what's normal one of the really great things about being a writer of course although I think there's probably a metaphor in it

[00:06:58] I remember early on in my life Robert Greene told me he was all material it's like every shitty thing that happens to you is material everything you mess up is material every person that breaks your heart every dollar you lose every sort of missed opportunity is material there's a jorge luis borges quote it's similar where it's like you've got to use it all basically and so the one thing that I think in situations like this is like how can I channel what I think and feel about this into the output or the work that I actually do and I think there's probably an analogy there if you're an investor if you're a psychologist whatever it is that you do and this is not at all a full redemption for the tragedy and the enormous losses that are gonna come from what we're experiencing but it's almost sacrilegious I think to decide not to study this and understand it and sort of realize a deeper understanding of humans of yourself of leadership of clients whatever it is I think deciding that you're gonna experience this in a way that you emerge from it at least sort of wiser and better at what you do to me is sort of the way to think about it so you've been writing a lot of really great stuff Ryan in the past three weeks building on obviously the themes that you've written on in the past namely around stoicism what are some of the most important things that stand out to you specifically with respect to this type of uncertainty around pandemic and as you point out it's really now sort of reared two very ugly heads the first is the head of the pandemic itself and the risk it poses physically to people and all of the uncertainty around that maybe we still don't actually know how bad this virus is unfortunately because we don't know the de nom of testing we don't really know if this virus kills 1% of the people it infects or 0.1 percent of the people it infects so that's a 10 full difference that makes all the difference but if that weren't enough as you alluded to there is now an undeniable economic tragedy that's being imposed on many people that itself and by itself would be problematic just as it was in 2008-2009 so if you could bring Epictetus Marcus

[00:09:26] Aurelius and Seneca back from the dead bring them here today walk me through what you think they would say about this this specific example in situation where in my instinct is typically to do that right there's this quote from Churchill he's talking as sort of world war ii is is breaking over europe he's not quite been brought back into power there's this letter he writes to his friend and he says the last couple of days he says i've been trying to put a thousand years between me and the 20th century and he was just talking about reading and writing about history and so he was trying to to sort of get perspective and i think we can do that really easily and and in a way it's more informative than watching CNN like obviously you need to watch CNN to know what the local authorities are telling you to do this day or that day there is value in the news in that sense although the news is also sort of compounds hysteria and it passes on propaganda and misinformation but i think looking backwards gives us in some ways more insight because as unprecedented and new as this is it's also like one of the oldest things ever

[00:10:37] I mean Marcus really is who I write probably the main character in most of my books died of a pandemic in 180 ad so it's not as if humans have not experienced pandemics and plagues and and sort of massively contagious viruses and I think Marcus Aurelius is a particularly interesting example what they called the Antonine plague it hits

[00:10:58] Rome and it lasts for 15 years so you want to talk about sort of a humanitarian tragedy of epic proportions and then massive economic and geopolitical ramifications when marcus aurelius writes meditations he is writing in the exact scenario that a lot of us are in right now trying to keep ourselves from being exposed but also trying to do our jobs at the same time he was a leader in a time but they had a lot less visibility into this thing that was horrific ly deadly very contagious and spreading fear almost as quickly as it was spreading disease and what I found in Marcus's example particularly was just sort of calmness clear-headedness sort of courage my favorite story from Marquez which I told them a lot of my different books but like at one point the sort of treasury of Rome is starting to run dry and

[00:11:54] Marcus walks through the imperial palace and he starts selecting various treasures that belong to the Emperor and their family and he sells them on the palace lawn to pay down Rome's debts when I say that it just makes me feel so sad it's sort of how far we've gotten from that from a leadership perspective but Marcus really sucks buddies like what plagues are very bad no one would say that they're not but he's like a plague can only threaten your life the real problem the thing we actually have to be worried about is sort of selfishness and greed and panic these things sort of ruin your character as well as your life and I think what we're seeing now is people kind of struggling with that tension when we're so sort of removed from mortality from danger from anything that makes us not do what we want to do at the moment we want to do it that people are really struggling with how to sort of temper themselves and how to limit themselves and have self-discipline and put other people's needs above their own so I think from history we can see that these are sort of timeless struggles that we've always had I read something a few weeks ago I think it was a column that David Brooks wrote in the New York Times and the gist of it was that there are certain externalities that are very difficult that can be uniting and certainly Sebastian Junger has written very eloquently about this in his book tribe so in a post-911

[00:13:27] New York the suicide rate went down people were united in a common sense of urgency and a common sense of having been wronged and it also probably helped to diminish some of the sort of useless pettiness that defines our existence and showed us what really mattered and what didn't but the point I think that Brooks made in this article was hey pandemics are different it still has all of those same things of telling you what matters what doesn't what's a threat etc but it comes with this bit of isolation that actually tends to be quite negative now

[00:14:05] I'm not sure I actually agree with David in that setting because I think that might be true historically but I wonder if connectivity today is making it a little less so in other words it'd be one thing if it's 1918 Spanish flu is ripping through the world and it's clear that you basically have to hunker down and be fully isolated but today even if we had to resort to those levels you and

[00:14:35] I have the ability to speak right now look at each other on a computer screen there's much more intimacy today than there was then so what is your take on this specific nature of a pandemic that causes physical distance between people and how that factors into the sort of the challenges that we face as humans being quite social creatures yeah I read that piece too and I think the sort of the seed of the point is right but there's some you could argue against it in a lot of ways like I was in high school during 9/11 but I remember concerts got canceled and sporting events got canceled and travel got canceled and and people were scared and they stayed inside their house so there is an element of social isolation in those tragedies it doesn't last as long but I think we forget very quickly how we were all hunkered down for a short period of time what I think the difference between I think it's actually less a nature of is a pandemic a particularly vicious kind of tragedy or sort of crisis because you can't see it in a sense that almost pits people against each other it forces you inside I mean I think that that's an element of it but in a way it also connects us in that it affects everyone all at the same time like the world wasn't suffering from 9/11 at the same time even world war two did not actually affect large swathes of the planet so it evens out I think to me the defining feature and when I sort of look at these things historically the defining feature between whether it sort of makes us better or makes us worse or how it manifests itself culturally is what the leadership does and to me when

[00:16:18] I look at this crisis I think it's a historical in the sense that very rarely has there been such a failure of leadership at essentially every level from the geopolitical level to the specific world leaders to the governors to the government agencies it's been sort of quite horrendous in every sense and I was just reading Doris Kearns

[00:16:44] Goodwin book leadership in turbulent times which is very good and she had a story in there that I remember from Robert Caro's book on LBJ but he talks about when LBJ takes over for Kennedy it's a crisis at least on the US level that it's difficult to wrap your head around I mean like a beloved president is assassinated then the assassin is killed and it was done on television and everyone saw it and nobody knew who was responsible nobody knew what would come next we were just a few months past a

[00:17:16] Cuban Missile Crisis this was a traumatic event without precedent and here you have a vice president who's not particularly LBJ was everything Kennedy was not he was a smoke-filled room guy he was not photogenic he did not have charisma he was not a good speaker and most importantly he was not elected and

[00:17:38] LBJ tells this in his sort of folksy Texas way he says like look when I was a kid he was like the cattle will get stuck in a crevasse ravine or mud and he was like it's in these moments that the foreman has to charge in and sort of lead the cattle out of the swamp with confidence and aggression and clearness and and sort of all the things that you associate with somebody coming in taking charge morally physically in all senses of the word and

[00:18:11] I think what we're experiencing now is less to do with the pandemic and to me more a result of what happens when something really scary and bad and alarming happens and you realize we've been operating or we've been in a rudderless ship and remain in a rudderless ship I think that's what everyone is experiencing right now and I think you can say that wherever you happen to sit politically I don't think it's a political question I think it's a leadership question what is a person to do it's funny you and I spoke in God we probably sat down in late October early

[00:18:49] November that was released in January I mean basically at the time that you and I spoke we didn't actually know what this was nobody there hadn't even been a single case and yet so many of the things that we talked about seemed even more relevant than they did at the time we spoke about kind of consequences of having an overly secure life and how that gives you this false misconception of unlimited time well certainly we're realizing that's not true we spoke a lot about stillness and I want to come back to that because I tell you if there's one character you've written about that

[00:19:27] I can't get my mind off as I struggle it's Churchill but I want to come back to that and then there's kind of this idea of dying well and how it helps you live better so let's just start with let's assume someone hasn't listened to us speaking before and they don't know anything about stoicism let's go back and kind of encapsulate a little bit about what this philosophy or is Tim our mutual friend likes to call it I think he calls it an operating system how would you describe it in the context of that well I think the sort of central preceptive stoicism is basically that we don't control what has happened or what is happening but we control how we respond to those things and so in a way it's kind of this resignation or it's ceding a lot of the things that we would like to be in control of in favor of focusing on the things like that we actually immediately are in control of so and you might think like oh you're talking about the reactions does that mean be reactionary no it's just saying like okay what is in my immediate purview and I'm gonna start on that I'm gonna make sure my family is okay I'm gonna make sure financially that I'm making some good decisions here I'm gonna focus on hey even if I did get caught off guard or I was naked when the tide went out how am I prepared for this to get worse how am I prepared for what may happen after this so it's this kind of focus on the immediacy but it's focusing on doing what you can where you are with what you have and so you can see what for the Stoics yet they are dealing with pandemics like we're talking about they're also dealing with exile and war and mob rule and all sorts of plus just the normal stuff whether it's a problem in a marriage or a business partner that's a cheat or it's that they fell and broke their leg and now they're stuck in bed for six weeks life is capricious and random and

[00:21:30] Murphy's Law is real what can go wrong does and so obviously ideally you want to be prepared for those things as stoic say but it's more about what do you do when stuff goes wrong how do you respond and how do you focus not on who's to blame how unfortunate it is or any of those things how do you instead focus on okay here's how I'm gonna move the ball forward I talk about that in the books and I've read about that but I'm also just a human being who's trying to figure that out day to day just like everyone else you know what happens when 30% of your income disappears or what happens when you've got to now pay for employees that can't work what happens when you watch your years of retirement gains disappear what happens when you can't go visit your grandmother one more time [ __ ] happens to people philosophy isn't supposed to be this kind of abstract theoretical thing that you do in a college classroom it's designed for this it's designed for when you're holed up in your house and you don't like how things are yeah I think that last point Ryan is so essential people like me never found philosophy that interesting in college probably because I wasn't smart enough and now my attraction to it is not academic it's what can I extract from this way of thinking that will help reduce my suffering yeah so going back to the point I brought about Churchill you know I've read stillness as the key three or four times I absolutely love it right it is actually of the 57 books you've written it's my favorite no I'm just kidding it's only 12 or what how many books have you written right I think it's ten I think it's ten okay well I have probably gifted to stillness seven or eight times in the last three months as I said I've read it three or four times and this section on Churchill really speaks to me and rather than me try to explain for folks who haven't read it the story of how Churchill went about creating routine and ritual during what I can only imagine is the most stressful experience any one person could have really contemplated for a sustained period of time in the last hundred years I mean maybe that's not true but well he would be tough to make a case that there was somebody that for months and years on end felt the angst that Winston Churchill felt so I find myself thinking and I want you to kind of explain what that was and how he managed it because I was floored by sort of the ability that he had to maintain stillness through that and that's something I've thought about which is

[00:24:17] Peter is upset as you are about this as much as the uncertainty torments someone like you as a control freak in as much as you feel the obligation to your patience and you want to make sure every one of them is okay and like that's a pittance compared to what Churchill experienced and oh by the way Peter you're like three weeks into this you better buck up and get ready for it so tell people a little bit a if they're not familiar with exactly how the war unfolded and B with Winston Churchill the man prior to the war and then during the war give us a bit of a story because it's just such a beautiful story yeah I mean Churchill's life obviously is incredibly privileged in some senses but then is an unending stream of adversity and pretty much every other sense I mean he's born early enough in the 19th century that as a young war correspondent he witnesses the last cavalry charge of the British Empire and he dies sort of well into the space age you just see that the scope of history that he experiences I mean church shows first talk in America he was very well received and it was highly anticipated he's introduced on stage in New York

[00:25:28] City by Mark Twain and then basically after having sailed across the Atlantic yeah in a boat right and the last time he visits America he flies in a like a 727 or something like that so you get this enormous scope in span of history that's punctuated with she's not a bright kid nobody has high hopes for him his mother is sort of promiscuous has a terrible relationship with his father his father dies they think of syphilis when Churchill's like 20 assuming that his son will never amount to anything

[00:26:01] Churchill's taken a prisoner of war at like 22 years old nearly dies in Africa in this prison camp escapes he writes a series of books he stands for his first election and then sort of climbs his way to the top of sort of British politics and ends up being sort of the fall guy for the Gallipoli campaign in World War 1 has a nervous breakdown thinks his career is over sort of emerges a little bit back and then ends up sort of destroying his political career by advocating very strongly against the rearmament and the rise of Germany and spends what they call serve ten years in the political wilderness he spends basically ten years sort of run out of town he's radioactive everyone thinks he's an idiot they think he's lost his mind and he is a hundred percent right and no one listened to him and Hitler rises to power Germany Rhee arms World War two is the inevitable result of this and it could have been prevented and nobody listened to Churchill and Churchill was only brought back in after he is ignored for ten years and then yeah he sees himself he basically saves the free world puts Western civilization on his back draws the United States into the war famously wins the war and then is rewarded for this by promptly being thrown out of office days after the war comes to an end and that's not even the end of it right it goes on and on and ends up dying as a very old man having sort of another series of triumphs and setbacks in that and then I would say if you just look at so that's the span this guy wrote ten million words in his lifetime was one of the highest-paid most successful writers in the world during his lifetime holds office for 60 years Nobel Peace

[00:27:55] Prize invents the tank it's just an incredible life probably one of the most ambitious busy people of the age I think proof of the great man of history theory like the world we live in today as a result of Churchill saying [ __ ] Hitler I will give my absolute last breath defying this person there's a famous story I love his daughter-in-law says like as it looks like the Nazis will certainly land and invade Britain his daughter-in-law says like what could we possibly do Winston like how could we possibly what do you expect us to do if this happens and he said he looks her in the eye and he sort of growls and he says I expect you to go in the kitchen and get a butcher knife and take one of them with you when they come in the front door his point was like we are going to fight this thing down to the absolute last man and that stand which was partly a bluff but also sort of a hundred percent real courage and commitment turns the tide of history and so I'm fascinated by Churchill because that is an epic life I want to add one thing to that Ryan before you get into the next part so it I want to distract the thought but the other thing that it was amazing to me is here's a guy who a decade out calls Hitler he basically says this guy's a fascist and he's gonna do really really bad things and your point he is completely exiled and by the time Chamberlain is finally forced to resign and they very reluctantly bring

[00:29:32] Winston Churchill back as the prime minister I mean the Germans are basically knocking on their door and what I find it's another subtlety of this which I have to remind myself of I have a tendency in a situation like this to say this was inevitable how did we not see this coming how is it that we shut down the branches of government that should have and would have had us prepared for this how is it that we didn't put you know testing yeah

[00:30:02] I can rap off all the things we did wrong and so when Churchill inherits a huge mess it seems almost unfair it's like well now I have to be the one to fix the mess that I told you for the last eight years was going to be the big mess but again the great ones don't seem to dwell on that because there really isn't a lot of benefit that comes out of that backwards looking things so it do you want to say any more on that in addition to sort of everything you've already said yeah Churchill had this sort of code that he lived by and I'm forgetting the exact phrasing of it but it was basically it was like savage infighting magnanimous in victory sort of gracious in defeat and part of that what I think is not only did nobody listen to him but they liked viciously punished him there like destroyed his life basically and then said hey now that the battle is already lost we're willing to sort of put you in charge what I find remarkable is was

[00:30:58] Churchill's sort of empathy and compassion even for those leaders he kept some of them in his cabinet he managed work with them there was no recriminations no punishments he was Lincolnesque and his ability to sort of go okay this is just the hand I've been dealt and there's a famous expression a famous statement he makes about the

[00:31:18] French general who surrendered to the Nazis obviously he's like this guy's got to go or not collaborating with this guy but he said something like let us be sympathetic that we never faced the predicament under which he broke and so there was this for all of his combativeness and determination there was also an understanding I think in him having experienced along tumultuous life [ __ ] happens what matters is how we gonna solve this and I think when you look at what he did was like he rolled up his sleeves and got to work in even those 10 years it's not like he spent 10 years of idle time one of the reasons ironically that

[00:31:58] Churchill was so able to understand Hitler Churchill was like the only one of the leaders in in Britain who like took the time to read mine Kampf and actually study it and look at it and so Churchill had in a way that ten years of exile was the best thing that could have happened because it put him in a position to not be tainted by the incompetence of the people that sort of brought everyone into this mess it gave him a much longer and larger perspective and it put him in a position to sort of figure out what to do next and what I'm fascinated by even if you sort of take out the war stuff how was

[00:32:38] Churchill it just to write ten million words in your lifetime just to just to do that in in addition to a political career how does he pull this off he was a sort of a creature of habit and routine he had this sort of ritual he would write at the same time every day he would nap at the same time every day he would eat and dress dressed for dinner he had this rule that I've been joking with my wife about he said spouses should not see each other before noon that was the secret to a happy marriage he took long walks during the day I was actually just in this is maybe two months ago I was in three months ago I was in London I had a talk in London I was in London for maybe like 18 hours and I went landed at Heathrow to uber to Chartwell which is Churchill's estate and then went back gave my talk and flew home but to experience when you look at where Churchill lived it starts to make sense he had his goldfish pond that he would visit every day he had the swans that he would feed he had a little studio that he attached to his house that he did his painting in every single day he had even his estate or his house is surrounded by this brick wall he laid the bricks for the brick wall himself he would write every day he would paint every day he would lay bricks every day and he would work every day and this sort of rhythm or ritual I think was what allowed him to get into the headspace to get into the tap into the flow state required to do what he did I find and you wrote obviously about this in in terms of JFK during the Cuban

[00:34:11] Missile Crisis but to me it's something about the way Churchill handle this because it was much longer maybe it's in terms of the normalized value of stress the Cuban Missile Crisis was greater but it was over in 13 days this was years and I just find that amazing the discipline in making time to be still and how that mattered and obviously he wasn't writing he wasn't as prolific from a writing standpoint during during those bombing campaigns and such but he took his bath every day for example and it's funny I was sort of talking to my daughter about this the other day because we see like every kid around now she's going through you sort of she's homeschooling effectively right and you know she was lamenting how much work she had to do and I was like I sort of introduced her to I can never remember if it's Parkinson's or Peter's

[00:35:02] Law I think it's Parkinson's Law which is work expands to fill available time and I kept trying to say like you have to make room for moments of detachment every day regardless I mean it's just non-negotiable because otherwise you could spend the whole day buried in your history lesson or whatever other thing you're doing and as important as that is it would be very easy to say whatever it is I'm doing right now whether it's trying to stay in touch with my co-workers or trying to to figure out a way that we're gonna pay that next bill I mean those things are vitally important but it's not necessarily clear to me that you're going to do a better job of those things if you neglect that sort of self-care that comes from being in nature being still detaching from it right it's like a bipartisan complaint we have about presidents that they like why are they playing so much golf they're spending so much money playing it's so much taxpayer money playing golf and I don't think it's a coincidence that presidents choose that game and that they pretty much all universally play it going back least to Eisenhower and before it's because what other excuse and I think

[00:36:12] CEOs similarly gravitate towards golf because if basketball is your game you get maybe thirty minutes of basketball right or if running was your game you get five or ten miles but golf is a game that takes three or four hours and it's three or four hours or you're not supposed to be on your phone where you have to sort of mentally focus you have to be present it forces you to control and master your mind in a non-work context and Churchill happened to be famously terrible at golf so he painted instead but he said actually like the most important thing that powerful people can do is have one or two hobbies

[00:36:49] I would argue that something that's a problem for Trump if Trump had more interests if whether it was reading or sports or even socializing he'd be watching less cable news and be able to see the bigger picture as a nonpartisan example I was the director of marketing at American Apparel for a number of years and that was a company that self inflicted and then also the financial crisis was sort of in a perpetual state of crises and sort of chaos and I remember talking to one of the girlfriends of the CEO his name was Dov we're in his sort of huge mansion it's like totally empty of furniture he's not married he works 24/7 365 he's sort of perpetually on the never taken a vacation he's perpetually on the edge of sort of descending into insanity and I said something like this he have any hobbies and they were like just sex like sex was his only hobby and I think that was too luckily correlated with a lot of the self-inflicted unforced errors that he made as a leader because he was never stepping out he was never disconnecting he had no structure everything was always urgent very minor example there's something I'm dealing with some supply chain issues with my company and it was like someone who works for me called me they were asking me about it I was sitting down for dinner with my family to be able to go like hey I'll call you back in an hour I'm having dinner with my family right now obviously that's what you should do from a family perspective but that forced one hour break made me handle that situation better cuz if you'd forced me to deal with it at that moment or if I was a bachelor eating

[00:38:29] Chinese food in my house when I got that call I would have lost my temper I probably would have made a rash emotional decision I would not have forced myself to take an hour to sort of let it sit right and so one of these things these hobbies do and relationships do and a little bit of sort of order and structure and our lives do is they kind of just protect us from just reacting and reacting and reacting all the time you've written both in your book and in your newsletters about a lifetime versus dead time and and even though you didn't use those terms a moment ago you basically gave a great example with respect to my favorite Churchill which is he's booted out he's in exile he's a political pariah he's the scum of the earth and you'd think I mean he could have done the equivalent of watching Netflix every day in the 1930s but he didn't what did he do he's reading everything that he can read about this crazy guy in Germany he's writing he's being as prolific as anyone can be and it prepared him for when the chance came that he was going to come in and basically help save the world and so what advice could we offer people myself included by the way I'm just gonna be completely transparent about my own selfishness and having this podcast with you Ryan it's mostly just a therapy session for me it's really tempting sometimes to just turn on

[00:39:53] YouTube and Netflix and take a break from the the news is pretty upsetting but is there any harm in just watching Breaking Bad for the fourth time how would you help us guard against the temptation to seek pure distraction and how would you counter that and why what's interesting about Churchill is it's not like he was only preparing Churchill also by nature of his writing and the speeches that he gives in the radio broadcast that he does becomes almost more famous in

[00:40:25] America than he is in the UK and I'm not sure he would have been able his credibility with Americans was so great greater than it was with his own people at that time that when it comes time to sort of sell the transatlantic alliance that work that he did was sort of very paid enormous dividends and this idea of a lifetime dead time it's like look you didn't control the fact that you're stuck in the house you don't control that most operations are set that you don't control any of this but you do decide what you're gonna use this time for I guess the question is when else are you going to get the good news is basically for a lot of people very little as expected I mean some people nothing is expected because they are unfortunately not employed at the moment but what's unique about this period is we are being I think pretty understanding about the fact that things have ground to a halt without anyone's consent and so nothing is expected of you so how are you going to use you've essentially been gifted time and how are you gonna use that time I think it's absolutely appropriate to use some of that for self-care for relaxation for tuning out because that's not a terrible use of this time anyway if Churchill had emerged from those 10 years in the wilderness and the only advantage had been he was well rested I think that would have been beneficial right like how is he able to to basically be active in politics up until his death when I think most people would have burned out I think that 10-year period was not a vacation but it was what do they call it in in the NBA load management it forced him to recharge and rest and and sort of figure out what was important so

[00:42:10] I think at the very least we can use this time for that but now is also time to really question a lot of things about our lives about the decisions we make about the businesses that we have about the goals that we've been striving towards it's also a chance to experiment with new things to try new things I mean like as a very small level right I don't know about you but I've got like a million in requests to be on like people's Instagram lives and I saw this this meme where they were like it took a global pandemic to get anyone to try

[00:42:43] Instagram live but that's sort of what I'm talking about it fully in the sense it's like oh because people now have a minute they are experimenting with in trying things that under ordinary circumstances they would have never allowed themself to try and so I think that's a good use of this time for people what I'm trying to do is focus on on writing on reading and just sort of spending time with my family those are sure my big priorities I'm also using it as practice too like the financial blow has been so significant it almost makes everything seem comical and so I'm almost using it as practice to like say no to stuff do you know what I mean like it's like oh if I can take this I can do a lot less generally do you know what I mean yes it gets back to that point earlier which is if you had said to me in

[00:43:31] February Peter you know I think it would be a good idea if from late February until late June you did not travel I would have said oh that's a beautiful idea Ryan impossibility don't you know that fill in the blank right don't you understand bubble and of course then it's imposed on you and you realize well actually these things are much more possible than we believed and therefore we've kind of imposed our own barriers to sanity at times and that means yeah we could probably live with less and we can do less so as awkward as this is this feeling this helplessness a there's not a huge amount of value in just being upset about it I mean it feels good in the moment but it doesn't really produce much benefit the long-run stoicism says so much about this and one of the things that it talks about that we don't like to think about is having a plan if things get worse how do you think about that personally and how can others kind of apply that insight to themselves yeah it's certainly not pleasant to think about how it could get worse when it's already so bad but again we want to focus on moving forward rather than sort of staying in the same place or looking backwards I think what this is teaching a lot of people myself included is that we thought about everything but this there's a great mind Seneca quotes

[00:45:01] Fabius who's one of the great generals in Roman history you defeated Hannibal and he says the only inexcusable thing for a military commander to say is that I didn't think it could happen it's not that you can't lose something you can't mess up but what you can't do is confidently say here's the realm of what's possible and what's not possible and so I think what this is reminding me of whether we're sort of making plans at my house for is just like hey look don't be prepared for a rainy day where you're out of work for two months in a sense that's almost something that you're more able to quickly adapt to and resolve but are you prepared for [ __ ] to really really hit the fan and I think that's where a lot of us were more caught off guard actually here's a great example of this and I think we're gonna have to figure this out as a country the

[00:45:54] American system of being sort of 50 strong states backed by a stronger central government it was designed to be really adaptive and resilient because okay a hurricane hits New Orleans now New Orleans can get the full benefit of the American federal government Florida gets hit by a hurricane California gets hit by wildfires Wall Street is struggling our system was designed for isolated but serious short-term black swans what we are really clearly struggling with is massive interconnected problems that are effect everyone at the same time and I think you could argue that on an individual level hey I've got life insurance in case I die or I've got some savings in the bank in case my wife loses her job or we have a babysitter on call in case there's an emergency we have a couple things here or there but what we're much less prepared for is everything to go wrong at the same time and I think that's something we're gonna have to adapt and figure out how to do especially because it's that same weakness that sets us up to be very poorly equipped to respond to say climate change or an invasion from a foreign threat we are just not in a position to deal with serious catastrophe it's like we're set up only for minor catastrophes yeah the difference between centralized and decentralized organization again I try not to spend much time thinking about all the reasons we're in this situation but I can't help but sometimes think I hope we don't forget this I hope we don't go back to business as usual when this is over I hope that a year from now this lesson hasn't been forgotten does stoicism tell us anything about the likelihood that we as a society will learn from this if you really look at history the truth is like yeah we don't learn very much but I think stoicism is there's a Hemingway quote I love and it's in farewell to arms he says the world breaks everyone and afterwards sometimes the broken people are stronger in the broken places but the people that don't break the world kills and so that's something I've been thinking about because the myth of stoicism is that it makes you unbreakable it's the David Goggins thing you can't hurt me it's the James Stockdale super hero unbreakable sort of sheer almost inhuman strength and endurance under crisis and in a way that's almost too because it doesn't feel real I don't think stoicism is about making you unbreakable I think it's about making you stronger but I think the reality is really bad stuff happens and we have no choice but to sort of ascend to it no amount of defiance as we are seeing from a leadership standpoint right now no amount of defiance and denial stops a pandemic no amount of invective stops a pandemic you roll over and you take it to a certain degree it's about sort of damage mitigation more than anything but where I think philosophy really comes in what it's actually about is emerging from that better and stronger and so to me the ultimate the ultimate tragedy would be for the people that are unfortunately gonna pass from this and that could be you or me or people we both love or just you know sort of countless faceless strangers we've never met the worst thing we could do to those people would be to emerge from this and essentially learn nothing to go back to business as usual and I don't just mean that in are we gonna have better preparation for disasters the thing I keep coming back to the thing that makes me saddest and that I'm sort of struggling with trying not to be resentful about and try not to be angry about is that we don't just mean in the

[00:50:17] United States we put these leaders in charge even though their flaws were very well advertised even though their lack of competence was almost something they bragged about even though the sort of obvious holes in their strategies and skill sets were there we put those people in charge because they agree with certain policies we wanted because we thought they would juice the stock market because we wanted to stick it to the other side we made a deal with the devil and I'm talking about a lot of different countries we put woefully unqualified leaders but more importantly even if they were qualified because some of them were we put leaders with enormous character flaws people of genuine bad character in charge and we knew it and we knew it and we said to ourselves I would never want to be this person I don't want my kids to be like this person I don't like what they say I don't like what they do in their personal life and we said I know that they don't actually believe in the things that I believe in but they're paying lip service to them we said all of that is okay it doesn't matter that their shitty human being what matters is they're gonna get what I want accomplished or they are going to make me more money or reduce my taxes and as you're seeing now because what leaders are actually supposed to do is be there when [ __ ] hits the fan we are seeing the ramifications of that look it wiped out all the gains of the market so and there's nowhere to go but down from here and and so I think that's really what we have to learn to me I think it was a betrayal of my parents generation to my generation but I also think I hold myself responsible to like I think we mortgaged our children's future by not wanting to get involved by not wanting to say anything this doesn't just affect us it's gonna have generational impact and to me that's that's what's got to change bringing it back to right now because at the time that we're recording this which is very late in March my kids ask me every single day how much longer how much longer and I think honestly for them it's mostly just they missed their routines and rituals they miss going to school it's not like they're suffering and I say I don't know I really don't know guys you know could be this long could be that long but I really don't know I'll have a better idea into we expose you're fortunate you live on a farm and you live outside of a city so you can always spend time outdoors and I know for you personally even before this came along that was the epicenter of your grounding you and I sort of had that in common which is I think we sort of like solitude outdoors what about the people who are listening to this who don't have either of those options you are living in a small apartment in New York City or you're living in any city and you look out your window and you can see people locked up in their house I mean from a medical standpoint my view is everybody should still be outside everyday regardless of where they live and one just has to take extreme care when those are areas that are high-risk like New York and in which you have to be careful what you touch and how close you get to people but what other sort of practical insights do you offer people that don't have the luxury of being on a farm and being able to work from home so we're back to the you're thinking about applying for unemployment I just read today that over a million people in California have out for unemployment and at least that's according to a story that I read I you knows at this point I half the things I read I don't even know if they're being taken out of context but there's no doubt that there is a staggering number of people that are in the process of filing for unemployment managing a life at home with kids that are out of a routine that means you and now have another job which is trying to help educate your kids and basically homeschooling them and just none of this seems amenable to stillness right none of this seems amenable to letting your mind get out of its own way so how do we force it yeah my sister is in a apartment in Park Slope and I've been trying for a month now it's probably too late I was trying to get her to leave that's one of the interesting things to me I think a lesson that we have to learn and again putting this at it we're following the health authorities etc but just the sort of amount of sort of passivity about it's like we saw the train coming and we froze or we just went about our normal business as if we had no agency I would say one in 20 of the people I talked to had any sort of plan for how they were gonna weather what was so obviously coming some form of quarantine right and if people had been a little bit smarter about it sure there might have been some spreading of the virus but maybe New York be so overloaded if the people who didn't have to be in New York right now we're not sort of going about their business doing the de Blasio strategy of working out into the last possible moment at the gym and then accepting the quarantine do you know what I mean so I think a lot of people are unfortunately stuck in less than ideal situations what

[00:55:49] I'm trying to think about I'm trying to message friends of mine that I know at least in Austin just as some it's like look you can come to my house and walk around the farm or go in my pool I will wave to you from inside and then hallway for you to leave before I go back outside I think I think that's something we're gonna have to figure out sort of culturally and relationship-wise is like how do people that have resources or have sort of access to things how can we get in a place where we share them sort of effectively so without endangering anyone I've got a place in Florida that's sitting there empty that would be better than a place in Park Slope but that's the sort of reality of the situation for me a couple of things that one of the last purchases I bought on

[00:56:33] Amazon before as this was starting to sort of happen is you're stocking up us up I bought like an old school alarm clock and I have young kids so I always get up early but for a long I don't keep my phone in my room was I try not to use my phone in the mornings but so it would be like okay yeah if I have to get up by 5:00 a.m. to catch a flight I would set the alarm in the other room or whatever but I was like you know what as part of this part of sort of the routine and I was like I'm gonna set an alarm and I'm just gonna wake up really early every morning intentionally I don't have to I could just wake up and drag myself through the morning and just be kind of like killing another day but one of the things I wanted to do was just decide to be like just deliberate it's like I can't be deliberate about where I'm spending the time like I have to spend the time here but I want to be deliberate about the order that I have in that I don't know if you've read anything about hurricane Carter he was this Rubin hurricane Carter I know his story very well yeah my brother actually met him really I think he's a fascinating person reserve wrongfully accused spends decades in prison for this triple homicide that most certainly did not commit and one of the things I remember reading about him doing just as a more extreme way of what we're talking about he was like okay I'm physically in prison that's not my call he's like but I am going to rebel in every other way that I can he's like I'm gonna be awake at night and sleep during the day I'm gonna wear my uniform this way or that way I'm not gonna ask for this favor or that favorite he decided that how he was gonna wrap his head around the lack of control that he had was he was gonna assert control in other ways and I think that's an interesting approach that might be worth thinking about for people so how can you find some ways to assert agency in the midst of all of this powerlessness and and I think you'll find that that's really reassuring I like that idea a lot I mean those of us with kids I think are naturally at a point where we're still getting up at the same time and things but when you wake up making your bed first thing in the morning it's these things sounds stupid and trivial but I agree with that I think having a schedule allows you to maintain some control over something exercise to me is also a really big one I think obviously for most people it's harder to exercise now because for most of us it's going to the gym that is exercise which has now been taken away but there are tons of great apps out there that are basically saying look here's how we're gonna modify this and here's what you could do with limited equipment or here's what you could do with simply only your bodyweight and to simply take 20 minutes a day and do that no matter what and say hey look at 10 o'clock this morning

[00:59:19] I am absolutely doing my app-based workout even if worst case scenario that's a day that I just can't get out there and take a walk for whatever reason it's hard to imagine not being able to make twenty minutes to do that and yet it's much easier to spend that extra 20 minutes tooling around on Netflix or YouTube and yet the dividends of that 20 minutes are huge not just sort of physiologically but I think psychologically and I think I mean I hate the word spiritual because I'm not really but I think you know what I mean when I say spiritually as well no no I think that's right my wife likes future which is like a sort of remote you have a person trainer that gives you a workout everyday but you don't actually see them and then they design it based on what you have in your house I hope it drives people towards some like the Moores or solo endurance sports too because I think there's all sorts of psychological and philosophical benefits to distance running or distance bike riding or swimming if there's some way that you could do it unfortunately I haven't found a way to do swimming since this has all happened there's no real like rivers or lakes that are available at the moment or oceans but I think realizing like oh just sort of practicing that muscle of like I'm gonna tell my body what its gonna do I think is probably as important or relevant as ever in this moment and I like yeah in

[01:00:40] New York the one or two exceptions to the quarantine is like going outside for your physical or mental health you've got to take advantage of that and when we're talking about sort of a lifetime dead time like what good can come out of this you were saying like a lot of people are sort of already on a schedule with kids we were always on a schedule with our kids like they had to go to school at a certain time but we just sort of always had sleep training was really tough for us we made a lot of allowances we sort of just leaned into the chaos of it a little bit there wasn't a ton of structure what we use this for was a chance to really force that and practice it and I would say like it's weird we're just experiencing so it's crazy and disrupted as our lives are in some respects in other respects the machine is operating more smoothly than ever we're doing the same things every day eating better we're bedtime is more on the dot and so again no one would say like hey the global pandemic is now a positive because I've got a better routine at home that's cold comfort but you can find redeeming qualities inside of the [ __ ] sandwich so to speak you can say hey you right off the losses as a sunk cost but where you're able to find some good is that you made these marginal improvements across a bunch of aspects of your life that will hopefully last longer than however long this goes on Ryan how is your journaling changed in the past couple of weeks Europe lithic journalist well journaler i don't know what the word is there when yes yes yeah yeah have you noticed anything in your journaling of late that maybe wasn't there prior yeah journaling is weird for me too because my writing is also an outlet where I get to work out a lot of thoughts so I really have just felt on fire as a writer recently I'm not I'm currently researching some books by not writing for any book projects so I found that the daily Stoke email that I do every day and daily dad like I've just been like in the zone more productive than usual it's better than usual so

[01:02:47] I've really felt good about that for journaling I've felt I'm really trying to think about I'm really trying to use it as a place to sort of remind myself and reiterate to myself how I want to be inside this sort of reminders of kay you're worried about X Y & Z one way not to think about that is to think about other people instead so I'm trying to

[01:03:09] I'm trying to just sort of buck myself up a little bit in the morning kind of remind myself of what's important to me I'm trying to use it again I think journaling is not this just this stream of conscious sort of thing you're doing it's not performing for history to me it should be it's like playing scales on the guitar or on the piano you're running yourself through it over and over again so that it gets more imputed into your memory and kind of into your into your being yeah it sort of makes sense say again I think you get to write every day for those of us who don't or when we're writing it like for me I'm writing all the time but it's usually kind of technical stuff this outlet has become something that I think is a I don't know I'll tell you what brought it to my mind recently so when maybe about three weeks ago when we sort of pulled our kids out of school and just decided we were gonna do something that at the time seemed outrageous but basically play the lesser of two risks my daughter was like this is crazy there's no way I'm not gonna be able to go out and buh-buh-buh-buh one I was like Olivia what do you think about

[01:04:22] Anne Frank and of course she didn't know who Anne Frank was so I was like all right well I want you to tell me by the end of today who Anne Frank is and let's talk about her so of course she was about read about her and said that then but the interesting thing is my daughter didn't know what an attic was I said

[01:04:36] Olivia do you want to come see our attic she goes we have one I said oh yes we do honey buns so I got the ladder out took her in the closet took her up to the attic I mean she's just about had a cow she couldn't believe how small and miserable the Attic was and that this girl spent years up in an attic writing this journal family yeah yeah and like you read what she wrote in her journals and it's unbelievable you cannot believe a child could have written this you can't believe how she could turn to that journal and say you are my best friend you were the person to whom I can say all these things I mean it's just it's unbelievable and again I just I don't say that to sort of begrudge the way we've raised our daughter to not appreciate how good she has it relative to a girl growing up in the Second World

[01:05:25] War but it is a little bit of a phase shift and it just brought back to my mind a few weeks ago how powerful this tool can be and it brought me back to our first discussion actually about him yeah it would be difficult to be a 13 year old girl at any time and then to be a 13 year old girl in an attic in a country you're not from right because she'd already fled Germany to the

[01:05:49] Netherlands then you're trapped in this attic with another family it would have been horrendous and her journal is so good that it's actually something like Holocaust deniers used they're like it's impossible that a sixteen-year-old girl could have written it but she was just a precocious brilliant girl and what I think is interesting is that she wrote that journal partly inspired I think it was the queen of the Netherlands wrote put out a call over the BBC saying like hey we're eventually gonna get through this we want your help please keep a record of what you're experiencing in doing and so that idea of finding purpose in something that you're doing even if she had no idea the impact that her journal would actually ultimately have she had no idea that it would be sort of final legacy that it would be the sole sort of creative work that she'd be allowed to do which is all tragic and totally unfair but I'm sure that because she not only wrote the journal but then she would go back and revisit the journal and she clearly edited it and she responded to parts and she organized it it was a project and so

[01:06:58] I think that is something we're thinking about with our kids it's just what goals or things can we give them to throw themselves into that allows them to sort of escape from this and a little bit and I don't think that's terrible advice for adults either so what's a PR you're gonna try to make in your deadlift if you have weight rack at home are you and your wife gonna try to lose five pounds are you gonna try intermittent fasting are you gonna try to read the entire

[01:07:28] Harry Potter series as a family you can create things to throw yourself into that allow you to feel some momentum and accomplishment and purpose and if I knew how to do this would be something I was doing but like you know just the people that are making masks right now I mean that's to me another great example of trying to find where you can contribute and where good can be done rather than wallowing in your resentment or anger or boredom you're generally a pretty disciplined guy when it comes to social media have you created any new rituals or routines around avoiding it or selectively utilizing it for some benefit but not getting sucked into it yeah so I don't check Twitter because I found that it sort of triggers me the most and I don't have Instagram on my phone and I don't check Facebook either so I've been sort of very actively not using those platforms at the same time I have been sort of stepping up what I put out on those platforms so I've been I've been starting to do sort of lists of things or explaining stuff topic on the different media I've been enjoying the creative element of them but trying to distance myself or protect myself from the let's call it the sort of manipulative and anxiety inducing sort of characteristics of social media yeah what are you most optimistic about in the next couple of months and what are you most concerned about and then connects a couple of months and that can be either about you personally in your family or just broadly your fellow citizens

[01:09:09] I mean upside I hope this redefines the role of the president for a lot of people hopefully this redefines the importance of a lot of the alliances and relationships internationally that we have with a lot of different countries and those things were people were Trump was not wrong in sort of questioning some of them but also sensing that the public wasn't that possessive of them hopefully it this redefines internationally how we operate in just our understanding of China our relationship to other countries I'll say like I'm very glad that for daily stoic all of our products we manufacture in the United States because it is dramatically protected our supply lines and allowed us to have inventory on hand it's allowed us to keep the lights on in the business it's allowed us to connect with and sort of work more collaboratively with the people we work with I wish that maybe some of the stuff was even closer to home like I wish I had even more oversight or control

[01:10:10] I think positively I think this is a wake-up call and a lot of ways I think it sort of knocked people out of the stupor or the slumber that we were in I hope that's a positive Tyler Cowen wrote an article and I think he's crushing it by the way anyone who's looking for smart stuff I think marginal revolution in Tyler Cowen is putting out awesome stuff as always but he was saying he thinks that pandemic has killed the sort of progressive woke left that it sort of woke us up like why are we arguing about transgender bathrooms and neglecting this or that why are we fighting about cultural appropriation and sort of coming together on things that matter why are we talking about health care for illegal immigrants and not do we have enough ventilators in emergency rooms at the same time I think one worry would be actually it doesn't kill the sort of revolutionary extremes on either end of the party but they seize upon the wreckage that emerges from this and are actually empowered that's something I'm worried about and I think a little bit selfishly but I also think it's gonna have big ramifications I'm a millennial sort of smack in the middle of the millennial generation my generation 9/11 catastrophic wars in the Middle East which wasted trillions of dollars the financial crisis and now whatever we're going to call this financial crisis I mean it is a betrayal of one generation to the next generation that I'm not we talk about the lost generation in the 1920s

[01:11:46] I mean people I know we're just getting their [ __ ] together they just bought their first house in already expensive markets they just started putting money away for their retirement they were just recovering from the last time the world was melted down by irresponsible adults and boom it just [ __ ] happened again I'm gonna be okay at least right now but I'm certainly not so okay that I'm not thinking about yeah what does it look like what does it do to Medicare and Medicaid and Social

[01:12:21] Security that even the people that survive this are gonna have long-term health damages what does it do that people who were about to retire just watched years of their gains evaporating tomorrow if there's anything I'm worried about it's actually more the economic than the medical yeah I don't disagree with that what are you worried about I think in the short term I'm certainly worried about a handful of geographies that I don't think under non optimistic scenarios will have this supply to meet the ICU demand so I think New York is very likely going to be overrun and I think that that's obviously disconcerting because it puts doctors in a position that I don't think anybody ever signed up for when they went to medical school which is and again it's something that's so foreign to us in the United States but it's not foreign to doctors outside of the United

[01:13:15] States which is the truest form of triage how do you look at two people that if you had endless resources you could probably save both but in a situation where you don't have endless resources you have to prioritize one over the other there's no you didn't take a class in that and even if you did it wouldn't have helped much I'm just I guess I'm glad I'll never have to make that decision I suppose but a bunch of people might have to make those decisions and that's I find that very the friend that frustrating through the lens that we've discussed which is a little bit more preparation not a lot believe it or not but a little bit more preparation could have thwarted that I think the economic consequences of this are as you said at least as staggering if not more staggering than what comes of it though again it's still so unclear what is coming of this and unfortunately you can make a model say anything and that's a little frustrating because there's models out you can basically find a model that will say whatever you wanted to say so that's not entirely helpful but but there are scenarios under which this thing is a problem that could on the one end result in a million deaths in the United States which would be enormous right that would be a third of the total that's like basically adding a third or 30% more deaths to the all-cause mortality we experience that's hard to fathom through this lens at the other end of the spectrum this could end up being a small fraction of that it could be it could end up being the the same number of deaths that you would get from influenza again I don't think either of those extremes by the way are what's going to happen but they could and in the latter case it would be boy that was we paid an enormous economic price for that you bring up an example of comparing this to the 2008 recession well it's gonna look and feel a bit different and that scares me a little because I don't think we have a playbook for this maybe it's not as necessary I mean they you know as if when we're recording this the federal government has announced basically a six trillion dollar stimulus package of which two trillion is in hard assets and four trillion of that probably less so but that's so much money and it gets to the point you raised earlier which is unless you can keep interest rates at zero a debt service on debt we've accumulated over the past 18 years is unbelievable and

[01:15:46] I've asked people that I think are some of the smartest people on earth when it comes to fiscal policy I just asked them point blank tell me what we do when we can't pay our debt tell me what it means for the United States to default on its debt those things are troubling so all of that said I still come back to something which Sam Harris and I talked about a few days ago on the podcast which was it's okay that those things are upsetting and it's okay that I can worry about them a little bit I'm trying to check myself to make sure I'm not worrying about them at the point where it ceases to be productive worry is only productive when it motivates me to do something and at this point I'm pretty freaking motivated to do something I'm doing everything I can with my little narrow band of skillset to do everything

[01:16:37] I can and therefore I realize that there is little to be found in worry and so what I've been doing is making a point to spend time with my wife and kids every day and reiterate to them how happy I am to be home with them and in part that's just telling myself that as well it's sort of trying to combat that anxiety that still slips into me especially when I'm sleeping frankly and my dreams are pretty pretty distressing but I'm just trying to basically curb the worry and focus on what's here and what's here at the moment and and believe it or not I've actually had weird thoughts which is when this thing's over and I have to get on a plane and go back to New York I don't think I'm gonna look forward to it that much not because of New York but because it's like yeah back to traveling again yeah no this could be a new norm that we appreciate more maybe we all were flying more than we needed to be and working more than we needed to be and yes saying yes the things we didn't need to know about because we'd never sort of been fully forced to appreciate what home and life was and to me that is a positive that emerges from it again not worth trading a million lives but certainly a positive we can sort of pull from the wreckage of this yeah well Ryan

[01:17:57] I made a plug for it in the past and I'm gonna do so again if I was very bullish on people becoming daily subscribers to the daily stoic I'm even more so today what's the best way that people can sign up for that if they haven't done so yeah you can sign up at daily Stoke comm where dailies TOCOM slash email and then the other one I do every day that I've actually been liking just as much as daily dad which is daily dad comm and people can follow you how on Twitter yeah I'm at Ryan holiday and then also at daily stoic if you want a piece of stoic wisdom every day as well okay any of your books at this moment you think people should go back and reread or read for the first time yeah I mean I think obstacles the way is probably particularly well suited if you're especially if you've sort of been knocked on your ass here and they're trying to figure out what next that's what that book is sort of designed to try to tackle and then if you're maybe more like you and I are and some of the things you and I were talking about it just the stress and anxiety and worry and calming that kind of racing part of your mind stillness is the key is the most recent book and that one sort of talks about a lot of things we were talking about today well Ryan thank you for making time today to talk and thank you for sharing your insights they mean a lot to me personally and I think they're gonna mean a lot to folks listening I appreciate that no this was fun and again by the way this is a I don't know about you but I didn't think my mind was not racing I wasn't distracted I wasn't catastrophizing because we spent an hour and a half actually engaged with each other and I think not everyone has a podcast but one way to call that race in mind is to have a real long conversation with a human being and I think you'll be surprised at both what you find and then how much you get out of that experience yeah I think that's a great point connectivity matters yes all right Ryan best of luck rest today Thanks appreciate it thank you for listening to this week's episode of the drive if you're interested in diving deeper into any topics we discuss we've created a membership program that allows us to bring you more in-depth exclusive content without relying on paid ads it's our goal to ensure members get back much more than the price the subscription method and membership benefits include a bunch of things one totally kick has comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic pay per person thing we discuss on each episode the word on the street is nobody's show notes rival these monthly AMA episodes are asking me anything episodes hearing these episodes completely access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear everything without having to listen to spiels like this the qualies which are a super short podcast typically less than five minutes that we release every Tuesday through
