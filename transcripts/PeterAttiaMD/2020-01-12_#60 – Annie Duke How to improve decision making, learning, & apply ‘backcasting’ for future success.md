## Description

Full title: #60 – Annie Duke, decision strategist: Poker as a model system for life—how to improve decision making, use frameworks for learning, and apply ‘backcasting’ to boost your odds for future success

Original release date: 7/1/19

In this episode, former World Series of Poker champion and author, Annie Duke, explains how poker is a pertinent model system for decision making in the real world, a system which blends imperfect information with some unknown percentage of both luck and skill. We go through the decision-making matrix, and how we spend most of our energy focusing on just one of the four quadrants at the expense of the learning opportunities that come from the other 75% of situations. Annie also shares how this evaluation of only the bad outcomes (and our tendency to judge others more harshly than ourselves in the face of a non-status quo decision), leads individuals, leaders, and teams to avoid bad outcomes at all costs. This avoidance is at the cost of the types of decisions which lead to progress and innovation both personally, and societally, across many realms from poker to sports to business to medicine. We also dive deep into a framework for learning, and the levels of thought required to rise to the top of a given domain. Finally, we talk about something that resonated deeply with me in terms of how I think about extending healthspan, which is the concept of “backcasting”.

We discuss:
-Annie’s background, favorite sports teams, and Peter’s affinity for Belichick [7:30];
-Chess vs. poker: Which is a better metaphor for decision making in life (and medicine)? [12:30];
-Thinking probabilistically: Why we aren’t wired that way, and how you can improve it for better decision making [18:15];
-Variable reinforcement: The psychological draw of poker that keeps people playing [25:15];
-The role of luck and skill in poker (and other sports), and the difference between looking at the short run vs. long run [38:00];
-A brief explanation of Texas hold ‘em [47:00];
-The added complexity of reading the behavior of others players in poker [53:15]
-Why Annie likes to “quit fast”, and why poker is still popular despite the power of loss aversion [58:30]
-Limit vs. no limit poker, and how the game has changed with growing popularity [1:01:00]
-The advent of analytics to poker, and why Annie would get crushed against today’s professionals [1:10:30]
-The decision matrix, and the ‘resulting’ heuristic: The simplifier we use to judge the quality of decisions —The Pete Carroll Superbowl play call example [1:16:30]
-The personal and societal consequences of avoiding bad outcomes [1:27:00]
-Poker as a model system for life [1:37:15]
-How many leaders are making (and encouraging) status-quo decisions, and how Bill Belichick’s decision making changed after winning two Super Bowls [1:41:00]
-What did we learn about decision making from the Y2K nothingburger? And how about the D-Day invasion? [1:46:30]
-The first step to becoming a good decision maker [1:48:45]
-The difference between elite poker players and the ones who make much slower progress [1:55:30]
-Framework for learning a skill, the four levels of thought, and why we hate digging into our victories to see what happened [1:58:15]
-The capacity for self-deception, and when it is MOST important to apply four-level thinking [2:06:15]
-Soft landings: The challenge of high-level thinking where there is subtle feedback and wider skill gaps [2:16:45]
-The benefits of ‘backcasting’ (and doing pre-mortems) [2:19:30];
-Parting advice from Annie for those feeling overwhelmed (and two book recommendations) [2:28:30]

Here's a comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast with Annie Duke:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focuses on decision-making theory and practice, using poker as a model system. Annie Duke, a former professional poker player and cognitive scientist, discusses how poker provides unique insights into decision-making under uncertainty. The conversation explores the differences between chess and poker as decision-making frameworks, and introduces concepts like "resulting" and "backcasting."

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Poker provides a better model for real-world decision-making than chess due to incomplete information and luck factors [00:14:25]
- Discussion of probability theory and why humans aren't naturally wired to think probabilistically [00:18:49]
- Introduction of four levels of decision analysis, from basic to advanced [02:01:14]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Use backcasting to plan long-term health goals [02:20:16]
- Consider both skill and luck components in health outcomes [02:24:34]
- Focus on functional longevity goals rather than just aesthetic outcomes [02:21:49]

4. **Notable Concepts**:
- Backcasting: Working backward from desired outcomes to determine necessary present actions [02:19:49]
- The "Centenarian Olympics" concept: Planning physical capabilities for age 100 [02:21:49]
- Four levels of decision analysis:
  * Level 1: Only examining losses through luck
  * Level 2: Examining losses through both luck and skill
  * Level 3: Examining both wins and losses through luck and skill
  * Level 4: Examining even successful outcomes for potential improvements [02:01:14]

5. **References & Resources**:
Books mentioned:
- "Super Forecasting" by Philip Tetlock [01:13:15]

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter Tiye m.d. calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic

[00:01:04] I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming

[00:01:23] I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our show's members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:28] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription I guess this week is Annie Duke and he is the author of the best-selling book thinking in bets making smarter decisions when you don't have all the facts and some of you may recall a few months ago I talked about this book a little bit in my Sunday morning news because it was just one of those books where even halfway through and I realized this was a book everybody needed to read and I couldn't get enough of it and I immediately reached out to

[00:04:33] Annie and said I'd love to have you on the podcast and what follows is that discussion but for those of you who may have not got that or missed that Annie was one of the top poker players in the world she played professionally for about 20 years in 2004 she won her first World Series of Poker bracelet that same year she won two million dollars in a winner-take-all invitation-only World

[00:04:53] Series poker tournament of champions in 2010 she won the prestigious NBC national heads-up poker championship prior to all of that by the way and we talked a little bit about this she was actually awarded a National Science Foundation fellowship to study cognitive psychology at the University of Pennsylvania so poker actually is something that kind of came later to her in life she now spends her time writing coaching and speaking on a wide range of topics from decision fitness emotional control productive decision groups embracing uncertainties she's also done a lot of work in charity and unfortunately we don't get into any of that I had planned to but as is often the case we get so far into something in this case obviously poker and uncertainty and decision making that after three hours or so if we hadn't even got to some of the other things that she's done we talk a lot about how she got into this and of course we do spend some time defining poker because if you're not a poker player and I'm not a poker player I mean

[00:05:44] I sort of know the rules but I think it is important to understand the nuances of the game at least as far as the rules go and the different types of poker so even if you've never played a hand of Poker in your life and don't know the difference between Texas Hold'em and blackjack for that matter you'll still get a ton out of this because we really explain that stuff and we contrast poker with other things like chess where clearly you have to have a lot of skill to play them but luck is not an element we talk about why poker is in some ways the model system for decision making in the real world we talk about back casting which is something that I believe I alluded to in my newsletter that is what really got me excited about the way she described this and we talked about doing pre-mortem exams versus just post-mortem exams we go through the decision matrix meaning how do you look and evaluate decisions after the fact when you have to be critical of both the decision-making process and the outcome and I have to tell you this is just yet another example of a podcast where I came away learning so much and I've been preparing for this I obviously have read the books and I've thought a lot about decision making and I know quite a bit about probability theory it didn't matter

[00:07:01] Annie still took my understanding of this to another level and in the process I realized she is working on another book which is a workbook to help with decision-making that's gonna be out next year so one day I can't wait to get that and two we're gonna have to have Annie back when that book comes out and do a real deep dive on how to implement that workbook so I can go on for a lot on this but you don't want to hear me talk you want to hear any talk so without further delay here is my guest

[00:07:27] Annie Duke Annie thanks so much for coming all the way up to New York I'd like to say just to see me but now you've let the cat out of the bag that I'm the second excuse to be here today yes when I get requests I try to pack them into the same day their efficiency purposes are you from Philly originally

[00:07:45] I'm not from Philly but my father is from Philly originally so yeah my dad grew up in Philadelphia and graduated from West Philly high actually so he's born and bred and I live in Philadelphia now it's actually my third time through so there's clearly some kind of magnetic center to do it out there for me are you an Eagles fan I am

[00:08:05] I'm sorry I can't I'm so angry about them beating the Patriots two years ago I'm just so upset about oh please oh I'm so sorry for you that they didn't get their six Super Bowl that day and they had to wait two more years I don't know it just bothered me like all right so wait are you a Patriots fan I am okay so interestingly enough I am a Red Sox fan because I grew up in New England mm-hmm and it's kind of just an accident of sort of the timing of my own life that I'm an Eagles fan which has to do with I was never much interested in football when I was growing up which isn't that crazy for when I was growing up in terms of the

[00:08:41] Patriots because they were just horrible it was horrible so I liked the Celtics because Larry Bird and Kevin McHale and obviously the Red Sox it was like Fred Lynn Carly's drum ski and Carlton Fisk and like that amazing team so and we used to go like once a year so I would like to remind you as you're so upset that they didn't get number six on that of what it was like to be a Red Sox fan I know I know but you brought up Fisk right so it's Vanya was it the 79 team or the 76 team I think he was 76 someone's gonna correct me but yeah where it's like oh no I know that's it's hard to watch you know it is

[00:09:20] I'm a billet wreck fan so people sort of say oh you're a Patriots fan like wow but it's not that I disproportionately like anyone on that team although I think Tom Brady is I think unequivocally the greatest quarterback of all time at this point but to me it's just it's Belichick like I'm obsessed with the way this guy operates like you always get asked the question like if you could meet anybody famous who would it be I mean at the top of my list would have to be him like and again it wouldn't be in the setting of him giving glib answers in a news conference because that wouldn't be that much fun although it's funny as hell to watch if I could spend a day on his boat with him really understanding the discipline that he brings to what he does it would just it would just amaze me there's a beautiful article that was written probably five years ago it was just hold in a really funny way because it was the gist of the article was everybody's got a belly check story and it's players coaches all telling these stories of him that really highlight the single-minded focus of winning that is kind of amazing to me even though from a life ethos standpoint

[00:10:23] I don't really care that much about sports anymore I've sort of there was a day when it really upset me if my team lost now it's sort of oh that sucks it's good to that point oh my god I could tell you stories about when I was in high school if my team lost it was like if you want to get at least one degree just one degree from Bill Belichick you should have Michael and Bharti on a gridiron genius yeah it's a great book about leadership he worked with Bill

[00:10:49] Walsh he worked with Belichick he really kind of talks about what the leadership qualities of those two particular coaches he's really great you should look at you know him I do know I'm gonna ask you to make that Internet I will make that introduction I met Bill Walsh about a month before he died and it was the most sort of simple he was at Stanford and I guess he was getting some medical care and I was there I lived in the Bay Area at the time but I still swam at the Stanford pool and one day I was just finishing a swim and I was walking back to the parking lot and I can't believe it but

[00:11:23] Bill Walsh was like walking alone like on this part of the campus I normally would never interrupt somebody to be the fanboy because I just feel like had sort of I don't know I just know it's not my style to do it but I couldn't help it I was oh my god I just want to shake your hand and and of course like a total idiot I just started telling him all of my favorite moments of his coaching career as though he doesn't like do you remember the drive at the end of the second Bengals Super Ball when there were only two minutes and four seconds left and remember when Taylor cut and he was just the kindest he totally entertained all of my nonsense oh yeah those were some great times those are some great memories and sadly he died like a month later I mean he was sick in that moment he was totally able to anyway so but that said I'm not happy about the Eagles and we'll just let that slide literally it was like two years later here's the thing Belichick is in no danger of not getting into hopefully now there's Tom Brady this is what I'm trying to remind you of the Red Sox letting the Eagles have their one moment yeah well now the Red Sox can't stop doing it it's also yeah because I'd like to remind you that the Eagles did get their first try and like ever at the

[00:12:34] Super Bowl against the Patriots in the first place in LA so like come on it's like crumbs crumbs for the peasants so first of all read your book I don't know how long ago it's been but I mean it was probably ten minutes before I reached out to you on Twitter I loved it and I think we all sort of read books and apply our own filter to them and of course one of the filters is on this business of decision making and in medicine we make decisions all the time and we make decisions with incomplete information and I remember explaining to somebody once something that I think I either heard you talk about on a podcast after the fact and described it more eloquently and I think you also alluded to it in the book which is people always think of chess as this perfect game for decision making especially my wife I was having especially as I said no actually chess is not a great example because everybody has perfect knowledge at every moment in the game so it's not to discount the importance of strategy in chess people who are brilliant to chess are brilliant but it's not the perfect analog for decision-making in life for that poker is much better because you have incomplete information and that tends to mimic what we see in life and in medicine I think you almost never have complete information and that's sort of one of the things that is both frustrating because how can you make a serious decision when you don't know all of the facts but at the same time I think makes it intriguing and interesting and gives you this sense of there's a craft that can be mastered here that is less sort of amenable to robotic decision-making chess is missing this particular element which decision-making in general has which has to do with incomplete information so in chess I didn't see the players whole position and what that means is that I should be able to calculate out if I'm considering a move I know what all the possible moves are that the player can make and then I can think of what all the possible moves are that I can make a response and so on and so forth so that

[00:14:25] I should be able to calculate out with absolute perfect knowledge here what the right move is at any given time it's missing another element though that I think is really important to think about which is a very strong influence of luck so in chess the pieces stay where they are nobody takes dice you roll an 11 and 2 pawns come off the board or if it's

[00:14:47] Snake Eyes check me or maybe something good happens you roll a 6 and you get an extra queen that doesn't happen in chess so that there's this we know that the pieces are only ever going to move through an active skill and this idea of the strong influence of luck is really really important meaning if I were to do the same thing in the same situation and then post decision are there other things that could reasonably happen that

[00:15:15] I don't have control over I don't have control over which thing is actually going to occur it's actually a really important element to the way we make decisions if you think about in poker if I put my money in with aces and you put your money in with fives you know 80 ish percent to win there so it better that means 80% of the time I'm gonna win but that doesn't mean that you can't win 20% of the time you can win and I have no control either way I don't know if on that particular iteration I'm gonna see the 80% of their 20% that really crosses all decision-making so you can tell me this would be my intuition it's not a medical practitioner but not only are you dealing with incomplete information in medicine but even if you did have complete information if you apply a treatment in a situation and it happens to work there's all sorts of stuff going on I assume that's relatively stochastic that we don't really understand where if we were to do that same thing again it may not work in the next situation so we always want to think about that because that has a very big effect on our decision-making yeah you're absolutely correct and just to hear you explain it that way that might even be the more important factor actually than the absence of complete information now the definition of a chaotic system versus just a stochastic system is even more profound where even a slight change in the initial condition can produce a profound change in the outcome we don't even have to posit that we can just leave it at the same initial conditions can produce different outcomes right we can kind of impede it in this particular way let's say that we're dealing in a world where we had perfect information I think it's important to think about this to understand why chess is really so bad in terms of thinking about these kinds of decisions it's an interesting decision making problem I'm not trying to slam chess I think it's a great game and it teaches critical thinking skills and it teaches you to think many moves ahead and to think about what other people know and there's all sorts of great benefits that it has it just happens to be missing a couple things that I think are really important but let's say that we had perfect information for example if I have a coin and I've weighed it so that I know that the weight is correct I've examined it and I can see that it's two-sided then I now have perfect information I know exactly what I need to know about the coin to understand how often it's going to flip heads and how often it's going to land on tails but what I can't know is what it will land on the next try so that's that issue of luck so if you flip and lands heads it's reasonable for me to say it could have landed tails and if we did that again that tails is totally a possibility regardless of what I happen to have seen on this particular flip so and then what we can do is say okay so even in conditions of perfect information we don't really know which outcome we're going to get we might know the frequency how often that might occur or how often we could expect it to occur but we don't know for sure what will happen this time and then you can take it further and say but what if you haven't examined the coin and based on some set of outcomes you're now trying to derive what the coin looks like now that becomes even harder and that's where you get into something that looks very little like chess why is it do you think that as humans we at least most people most of us don't seem innately wired to understand probability theory because I studied math as an undergrad and I spend so much time in it I think I take for granted now how easy it is for me to think probabilistically I sort of view the world as a stochastic map but

[00:18:49] I'm pretty sure I wasn't born that way and I'm pretty sure that nothing maybe this isn't correct but I doubt that we were evolutionarily wired to do that or I feel like we would see it more often in the way people behave and I think the absence of that in the general person's point of view who hasn't been forced to be trained in that way speaks to that this strikes me is one of the more difficult things in explaining anything this touches everything from politics to business to science because it's too easy to say well that didn't happen therefore that couldn't have happened as opposed to describing it the way you did which is no actually it could have happened and if the same tichel circumstance happens again by the way this thing could happen I would imagine if we were to take the distribution of how naturally probabilistic thinking comes to somebody I'm guessing that you were probably born closer to the right tail that being said I guarantee you that if I followed you around for a day

[00:19:46] I could find all sorts of spots where you're not thinking probably true and I could in particular find all sorts of spots where your initial gut reaction is not probable can you have to stop yourself I'm positive I'll give you an example of a game I played that's not an exact example of this but it humbled the hell out of me and I always go back and play this with other people so the idea of the game was to teach people what at 95% confidence interval looks like and this is back when I was at a consulting firm called McKinsey & Company and I was a part of the risk practice our whole job was walking around and helping companies manage risk so we did this at an off-site one day to help us kind of figure this out so the moderator goes up with 20 questions have you played this game so I have and this is one of Phil tetlock favorite who wrote expert political judgment and super forecasting which I highly recommend anybody interested in probabilistic thing I ended up reading super forecasting years after this yeah you know he's got this in there yeah so

[00:20:45] I'll tell it just listener so you take and I still have it by the way I still have the 25 I was terrible at this I tell you what my score was after I'm so pissed about it - how bad - like zero and I really tried it's just like the questions that I got were really out of my knowledge base and it was like I was trying it I'm really wide ok so what the moderate does is they give you 20 questions each one has a quantitative answer that is known it is known and the question for you the participant is for each question give me a bracket that contains the answer so for example what is the average height of a male in the United

[00:21:25] States an appropriate answer would be somewhere between four foot six and six foot one because that would be a reasonable guess at a bracket that contains the average height of a male right so the way that I've heard is that you want a bracket to contain at 95% of the time which means after you've done all 20 you should have exactly one incorrect and 19 correct and the purpose of saying 95% confidence is if they said to you you have to have a hundred percent confidence you can sandbaggin one inch tall yeah there's somewhere from 1 inch tall to a million miles tall and the questions in fairness to people like you and I who have flunked the test the questions are hard so did you get how many votes did Abraham Lincoln receive I didn't get that one like what is the distance between

[00:22:12] Jupiter and its nearest I don't have any clue but how many people were at voting during Lincoln's I don't know and I had this really but it's such a great exercise because you think okay I've got this under control I'm gonna just try my best to get everyone correct with a reasonable guess and I'll probably get one wrong and I think in the end I got 12 right and 8 wrong which of course is like a 60 percent confidence interval on things that are perfectly knowable and so yes I completely agree with you and of course your initial example is a better one which is how many times do I make either a decision or have a gut reaction that I have to actively talk myself out of the reason why I bring that up is that I think that there's a couple of things that we want to sort of keep in mind and then if you want to talk about sort of like from a like an evolutionary story why it is that we're not particularly wired to think probabilistically we can get into that but what I want to get across is this that first of all we're all sort of like sitting we have proclivities you know where we're sitting on a distribution somewhere on the distribution in terms of sort of how we're born how we're wired to think probabilistically and that doesn't mean that we should say either we're there or we're not I mean the idea is that wherever we sit on the distribution or whatever our personal distribution looks like we just want to shift it to the right so wherever you are you want to accomplish two things one is it would be really good if you thought probabilistically a little bit more why because the world is probabilistic and so the more accurately you can think about what the outcomes of your decisions might be because they're not deterministic when you make a decision and there's many many things that could occur with some likelihood of each of those things occurring and understanding that particular fact is incredibly important to decision-making so the more that you can shift yourself a little bit more on the side of probabilistic thinking the better off you are no matter where you started and then the second thing we want to accomplish which is what I was trying to get at at the catching yourself part is to understand that we are wired this way so it's really hard at all times to think that you don't know things for certain to sort of live in this counterfactual world and it's frankly kind of impractical it would be hard to like drive for example if we were living counterfactually all the time so the idea is that when we do make an error to catch it faster because for most things when we make an error and we we have too much confidence or we're thinking about something as deterministic when we should be thinking about it as probabilistic for most things we don't catch it at all so if we can just catch it a little bit more often and if we can catch it a little bit more quickly we're a lot better off and these small shifts if you can get a couple percentage points better you're way better off in your decision making so let's go back to kind of where you started thinking about this which was through the lens of playing competitive poker how'd you end up playing poker chaos theory mmm-hmm so let me just say that when I started playing poker it wasn't all over television because I think that otherwise that would be a really simple answer like I was in college and I wanted to make money and I saw poker on

[00:25:34] TV and I started playing online I think would be the origin story of the majority of poker players today not my origin story because I'm Way too old for that where did you go College Columbia okay yeah so you're here in the city so I'm here in the city and there's no internet I mean I think there's some sort of I know Al Gore was inventing it or something I don't know but it didn't exist so the first thing that happens on my way to becoming a professional poker player is that my brother when he was in high school got very very interested in chess started really studying it became incredibly good at the game he got accepted to Columbia decided to take a year deferment to live in New York and study with a grandmaster during that year he started playing poker all sorts of things happened he lost his college nest-egg he eventually did very well but in this particular year he was learning I'd say and he was he was learning maybe off the money that have been saved for college there's a little bit of money it wasn't a lot anyway he had started playing and then I followed to New York to go to

[00:26:40] Colombia year later I actually went I didn't defer and by the end of that year my brother was very good so now we're both living in New York at the same time he actually doesn't end up going much later he ended up going I think for like six months but he ends up never finished in college and he's playing poker professionally and I'm going and watching him sometimes so I'm just sort of sitting and what does that mean at this era of time these are like smoky rooms in New York City or yeah there was a place called the Mayfair which had a game and they had poker and they had backgammon before that my brother was playing at a place called the bar point for people who don't know that's a backgammon term and it was like a backgammon club people also played gin there it was on 14th and 6th and in the back room there was a poker game this was before I came around he was sort of already out of this place by the time that I came around although I did spend a summer here where I got to see him sort of playing in that particular place so he found out about that through like his interest in chess ends up there in the backroom there's a game that starts on Friday night and ends on Monday morning and by that I mean that's how long the people played they didn't get up and leave and come back we've got have a whole other discussion about sleep deprivation and decision-making but we'll save that for another time yeah this was in the early 80s so I believe there was cocaine involved I'm sure but at any rate so so he starts playing in that game and that's actually where he he cuts his teeth that's where he's cutting his teeth that's where he's sort of learning how to play that's where he's losing this college money and eventually so he's playing in that game he's not doing very well and he starts figuring out oh actually it's sort of in the same way he approached chess he sort of found whatever books he could find and he found a few other people who were kind of really interested in learning the game and he sort of starts working the game and eventually he basically sort of breaks that game like he becomes so good that I can't remember whether they kicked him out or not but in the meantime when he had lost his college money and what he starts doing because he now he needs money to be able to play is he became like the errand person for the game and so they'd be like hey Howard will you go get me a sandwich like at the deli downstairs or go get me some pizza or go get me cigarettes or go whatever and he'd go into an errand and then he'd get a tip and then he'd save his tips up and then get into the game eventually he didn't need to be the errand person anymore because he turned the tip money into enough money for him to eventually send himself to college for that brief period but so he moved from there to the

[00:29:15] Mayfair which was from the Mayfair's we're sitting Gramercy Park near there it's either Gramercy or Chelsea I think it's Gramercy Park I think it's near Gramercy Park it's a nice place then he was playing there for a while and he falls in at that point with a group that really becomes very famous Dan Harrington Main Event champion Eric Seidel who I think has nine world championship bracelets from the World Series of Poker might be more than that now but he's won I think like 40 million dollars playing poker he's amazing Steve's alatau also bracelet holder within that group Jason laughs these guys are all coming out of this one group so this is sort of like Daniel

[00:29:54] Coyle writes about these centers of excellence or everyone his term is for them but these little places that just produce so much greatness like all these soccer players that come out of this place in Brazil and all these tennis players that come out of this place in Russia this became this because place where everybody's sharpening everybody in this one place exactly if you're a tourist and you hear about this game you don't get to go and play obviously right like they'll take your money if you want but yeah anybody can play and anybody does play the thing about poker that's part of this stuff about like the hidden information and love is that that kind of uncertainty leaves open the array of explanations for why you might might be doing well so if I play chess against you a few times it becomes very clear to me why I'm losing I'm losing cuz you're better than I am I have nothing else to protect my ego like I can't put a hat on it and say no it's because of something else see that's such a great point that's worth pausing on it as well for a moment there are very few sports or activities that we play that are as pure as something like chess where as you said there is ZERO excuse whereas I can't think of another activity I'm sure there are several where if you really want to you can't oh the ref screwed me or other wind I mean did you see that or like I'm into archery right it's like oh you see that animal move out of the way at the last second he heard the arrow coming or whereas in reality no you took a lousy shot right I mean they're all on a spectrum and one thing that we forget is that there's an equanimity to luck so if you're playing tennis and there's wind your opponent is also playing with that wind if you're in a game although we like to think so the refs generally are making bad calls just sort of period some good some bad and they're not like screwing a particular team systematic systematically going against a particular team although it sort of feels like that but what we notice is the wind blew our ball an interesting thing that happens in sports that are one-on-one like I play tennis is that you can blame it on the style matchup that it's not that like you're not particularly good that's a great new excuse I hadn't even read you that like oh that was a bad style for me actually better than them but they're lobbing they were doing a lot of lobbying and my high balls weren't really on that day but I would crush anybody else so yeah exactly so so poker basically is just a fertile ground for that thinking right which means that it doesn't cause you the kind of self-select out it's as you said this was like a nest of what was going to become the best players in the world and of course people were still coming back so he ends up at the Mayfair well I guess there's another element here which is the variable reinforcement of winning well so then you've got the whole dopamine side of this coupled with this psychology of I can post hoc rationalization rationalize my losses pump up my winnings from an ego standpoint and the next win is coming at a point I can't predict I mean that is a recipe for get me into this actually let me just bite into that for a second so this is actually really interesting so let me just say I didn't play poker at all in college like I never played it wasn't until graduate school that I played 3-times or something so I go to graduate school at Penn I'm studying cognitive science this becomes important to me later as I'm thinking about the game of poker this issue that you just brought up the difference between a very

[00:33:17] Abell reinforcement schedule and a fixed reinforcement schedule what we can think about is we can talk about ratio or interval schedules so a ratio schedule would be by number so if you put a rat in a skinner box and for those who don't know Skinner boxes it's got the lever and then either there's positive reinforcement like a food pellet comes out or maybe negative reinforcement like a shock so let's make it positive and say it's a pellet ratio schedule is by number so it would be like every fifth press the rat gets a pellet and an interval schedule is by time every five minutes the rat gets a pellet and if it's fixed what it means is it's actually every five presses or every five minutes and depending on whether its ratio or interval you get different behaviors from the rat so what happens on the ratio schedule is that the rat has this very even pressing that goes on this very even somewhat quick but not mad press press press press food press press press press and then if it's every five minutes the rat twiddles its thumbs until it's almost five minutes and then it goes crazy so you get this burst of activity it's almost like they don't want to miss a second they want to make sure that they get that food exactly they don't want to give up one second where they could have had food and so you get this big burst of activity then you can also take a ratio or interval schedule instead of it being fixed you can make it variable and what that means is it's now on average is the way that you can think about that so let's say on average every 20 lever presses you'll get food or on average every 5 minutes you'll get food so now instead of this big burst of activity on the interval schedule on average every 5 minutes because they're not sort of waiting and then oh I think it's about 5 minutes and they go now they're pressing pretty steadily the whole time because they're not sure anymore right is it going to be the second or not and then on the variable ratio schedule you get the same thing you get a lot of pressing very quickly because they don't know is that the next press or not so that's all kind of interesting and you'll see you different activity pending on whether its variable or not what's interesting is when you try to extinguish the behavior this is what's really key so when you extinguish a behavior what you do is you just withdraw the reward so now you've trained the rat it's pressing the lever and then you just stop giving the rat food and the question what does it do when it's fixed it stops doing the thing super fast it's like hey wait a minute like I've been pressing a hundred presses of this stupid lever you haven't given me any food I give up I have figured this out there's no food coming my way same thing if you're doing it by time but when you make it variable they just don't stop and it's particularly bad when it's a variable ratio schedule so I think about it like this so anybody who's ever watched people sitting at a bank of slot machines in Las Vegas those are on a variable ratio schedule that you'll get a reward it's gonna be on average a certain number of plays you could get a reward five plays in a row you could go 80 plays without really getting much in return and you kind of don't know cuz it's on average and what happens to people sitting at those slot machines is that they'll be going along and there'll be no reward and you'll hear them say a thing

[00:36:47] I'm do I'm do and what that means is that it doesn't matter what you do to that machine you could just turn it off what they think is no it must be the next press it must be the next press and this is exactly what happens to the rats in the Skinner box you train them that on average every 20 presses they get food and that means sometimes they're getting three pellets in a row and sometimes they're going 80 presses without getting food that's obviously out at the tail no pun intended but it's just an average and now you would draw it and they just never stop pressing the lever and it looks just like what humans do and I sort of always imagine the little rats and the cages saying I'm do so this is exactly the way that something like poker works if we're thinking about sort of an edge what that means is that over time I'm gonna get a certain percentage of your money but in a particular moment you could win a lot of hands in a row in a particular moment you could not win so many hands in a row and unless you're a really good statistical aggregator right unless you're sort of stepping back and really looking at what does this look like over the long run it's really hard to see what the underlying distribution is it's hard to see whether you're winning or losing to that situation there's a slight difference right because if I understand correctly the slot machine is driven by an underlying probability distribution curve so the person sitting there playing it like the Skinner rat is kind of right in that they are do they just don't know when whereas the person playing poker there is no certainty that they will ever win again necessarily in other words it's both luck and some skill so they could take probabilistic good hands and missplay them and lose on a potential hand that could have been their do right yes yeah so it's sort of like in some ways the person at the poker table has an even harder problem than the person at the slot machine yes because the slot machine is pure luck so the slot machine simplifies the problem because the machine is set to a particular distribution and the probability is set about how much you're losing per dollar and so if I sit down the underlying probability is knowable that's right and your only task is to pull the lever or push the button whereas in poker I have to still actually I have to do what we're gonna get to which is the skill of this game right and what you're trying to figure out is I mean obviously this isn't true of everybody but when people sit down at a slot machine people aren't thinking I won because I'm so skillful I mean occasionally they are if they think they have a system I don't think that's true most people are saying like I'm doing this because I'm gonna get lucky and maybe I'm do and whatnot so so I think that you have less illusion about it so now in poker you lay on top of the fact that it's stochastic that obviously it's a skill game and in the long run with enough iterations your results will be solely determined by right because the probability starts to approach equal distribution for everybody assuming there's no cheating well it would be true even if there's cheating for this reason that what that would mean is that whatever skill elements that you were applying you wouldn't be able to overcome the situation so all I mean by this is that you have an expected value that expected value is determined by your play compared to your opponent's play and when you say skill do you mean two skills the first being the ability to look at all the cards that are available and calculate the probability of cards that are not being shown and the skill of being able to Bluff or are you referring more to the latter than the former skill would be the umbrella of all the things that are within your control in the game that have an effect on the outcome so first of all and let me just step back a second sometimes people think that a game isn't skill if in the short run there's a really strong influence of luck so people will say well baseball is a game of skill but poker isn't a game of skill because they're looking at well but in poker I could have the best hand I could play it perfectly and I can lose to you because of the turn of a card so therefore isn't it just luck and how can you tell if something is a game of skill because I'm obviously making the assertion that in the long run your results are going to be solely determined by skill I think the way you said it actually is probably the best definition I've ever heard which is in the long run if two different people can play the exact same game over and over and over again and have dramatically different results under the same stochastic input doesn't that imply that there is a difference that is in the control of the player and isn't that the definition of skill yes because of actions that they take their distribution is different right so for example if you and I made up a new game which would be really boring game called toss to dice and the person who gets the higher number wins if you and I played this game for the next week we sat here at my table and we played over and over and over again in the end we would end up this there would be nothing that we could do that would and therefore there was no skill and no skill in that game but if we can bet on it that's right and baseball of course is such an obvious example of skill because while there is luck involved within a matter of minutes you would tell the difference between me and a professional baseball player doing anything right there's a really great test that you can do to figure out if something a skill and then and then let me just get back to baseball for a second to show what's happening why people are sort of misperceiving with poker whether it's a skill game are looking so the first thing is you just want to apply a test can you lose on purpose assuming you've followed the rules of the game now it's not symmetric

[00:42:47] I cannot apply a test of can I win on purpose but I can apply a test of can I lose on purpose and I'll tell you why so tic-tac-toe let's agree that that's a skill game mm-hmm it's bottom-feeding skill game but it is right but if you and I play neither of us can win on purpose assuming that we both know how to play the game because we're gonna tie every single time but one of us can lose on purpose very easy to lose on purpose at that game so we don't want to apply the win on purpose because that's hard particularly as you narrow the skill gap then you can't do that but I can lose on purpose and in a game like baseball you can lose on purpose in a game like basketball in a game like chess and any of these games you can lose on purpose we can think of other acts of skill like if you're a salesperson you could make it so that on purpose you never close to sale as an example that's a game of skill if you were a lawyer you could probably make sure you lost every case I mean hopefully you don't do this but and in poker you can indeed I can lose on purpose very easily I can't win on purpose but I can lose on purpose and that's true of baseball as well somebody can lose on purpose but they cannot win on purpose that you do not control that at a basic level is a really good test of whether something is a skill game or something is a lot game where I think the confusion comes in is that as you narrow the skill gap luck starts to play a much bigger role it starts to kind of show itself that influence of hey there's different ways that this could turn out yeah and sometimes you're going to see one thing and sometimes you're gonna see another thing and you kind of don't have control over which thing you happen to see a lot of the time we start to see that influence as we narrow the skill gap so that's a great point right that's why you look at virtually every Super Bowl these days most of them come down to the last series the last possession I don't remember these stats but it could be as high as like two thirds of Super Bowls come down to the last possession and if you think about that you could easily do what I do when looking at the Eagles beating the Patriots and say it came down to that one stupid play when Brady went back for the pass and boom the pawl get stripped out of his hand and it's like if that didn't happen he absolutely would have connected with grogg they absolutely would have won and whether or not I'm being delusional or not you can't deny the point that those teams were so damn near perfect if you took the Red Sox and you had them play a little league team there'd be basically no influence of luck right like what luck is gonna go the way of the Little

[00:45:16] League team I mean with the Red Sox what luck is gonna go against them aside from all their players all at once get injured and can't play anymore they could put in their third stringers and the Little League team is crushed but if you put the Red Sox against the Yankees this is why we have to have seven games and it's probably still not enough to try to figure out who's supposed to advance to the next round and in fact we know it's very rare in a series that a team wins for nothing it's very often going to the sixth or seventh game why because it's very narrow and it's very often things like you just said who wins the coin toss in a football game that has a huge affect on what the outcome is who just gets to go first especially over time yeah oh my gosh that's a huge influence of luck why because you've narrowed the skill gap so much but if you took that NFL football team and you put them against peewee players or even a college team or even a college team it's unbeliev class would have no effect no one would care who won the coin toss in overtime the NFL team I mean I don't know how they would get to overtime but you just magically make overtime appear you put them in there and the coin toss will have no effect whatsoever so I think this is something for people to really understand and so it we think about a game like poker and a lot of these decision-making processes that we do in life the skill gap is actually quite narrow so once i've taught you in poker things like you know the ranking of the hands like a flush beats of straight hate you you know you can Bluff you know sort of about betting you can read your hand all these things that's so much of the building blocks of the game in terms of the skill and how long does it take let's hit pause for one second and just for the person listening to this who maybe doesn't know the ins and outs of poker when we were talking about poker you're talking about a variant of poker called Texas Hold'em correct not necessarily second okay that's what you played correct and that's what most of the pros are playing when we turn TV on and stuff like that so what you see most of the pros playing when you turn the television on is Texas Hold'em in terms of what most of them are playing it's not necessarily that game that's one of the games that they play so give us the brief overview of how that game works so that we can understand what those building blocks are that you're talking about which is everybody within a day could know in detail what you're explaining quickly how this game works so this isn't true of all poker games but it's true of almost all poker games enough that we can pretend that it's kind of true across the board that the goal is to make a five-card hand again there are some exceptions to this I just want to make that clear but I'm capturing most of Poker if I say you want to make a five-card hand those five-card hands range from none of the five cards match up and so all you care about is the top card and the hand in most poker games aces are high in some programs they're low but mostly they're high sometimes they're high n low it depends so you're trying to make a five-card hand those five card hand range from very bad meaning none of the cards match up to each other in any way to really really good and really really good would be a straight which would be five cards in ranked order five six seven eight nine that would be a straight ten Jack Queen King ace that would be a straight you can have a flush that's when all five of the cards are of the same suit so you have five hearts or five spades or whatever full houses where you have three of one ranked King

[00:48:47] King King and then two of another rank 10:10 so your five cards would be King King King 10:10 so anywhere people can go and look up the hand rankings the highest rank is a straight flush is a royal straight flush so that would be an ace king queen Jack ten all of all the same probability of that hand I'm not sure what it is but a straight flush is one in six thousand something that it hardly ever happens so let's start there so basically almost any poker game you play you're trying to make a five-card hand and there's a very clear set of rules about what the hierarchy and ranking are there is no ambiguity there's no ambiguity when you're playing now different games have different rankings because you can play low so in low you're actually trying to make sort of what in high would be a bad hand okay so then the other thing about most poker games is for most poker games you're trying to make a five-card hand out of either 7 or 9 possible cards that just is also true of most poker games not all so in Texas Hold'em it's a particular form of Poker where you have seven cards to work with to try to make your best five so you're sort of like tossing two of them but some of the cards everybody gets to use they're called community cards so we can think about the variants of poker so when you watch something like the Cincinnati kid for example Steve McQueen in that particular game people are doubt their own five cards and so you don't get to use any of the five cards that I have so our cards are unique from each other and you don't get to see any of my cards then you can have variants which are called stud games where all of our cards are private but you get to see some of my cards so in a stud game at the end of the hand I'll have three cards that are facedown and four cards that are face up to you and I'm still making my best five of those seven I don't get to use yours it just gives me more information it just gives you more information so once you can see the four cards that are up that gives you some definition to the kinds of hands that I can have so as an example because I only have three down if my four up cards are a spade a club a heart and a diamond I can't possibly have a flush because the most I could have of any suit now is only four so you get certain information about the possibilities for what I could be holding because you get to see some of my cards but yet you still don't get to use in my cards whereas in Texas Hold'em now that's a stud game but it's common but it's common so what happens is you get dealt two cards that are private to you so these are facedown you don't get to see those particular cards and then in a particular way five cards eventually will end up in the middle so notice that that's seven but those five cards that are sitting in the middle both of us get to use now what that means is that these five cards in the middle define for me what your possible holdings are so that now changes for me what I think that the strength of my hand is I'll give you a simple example it just turns out if you have to private cards the most of a suit that I could have in my hand would be two so I could have like two hearts which means that in order for me to ever make a flush which is five of the same suit like five hearts I need to have three more of those out on the board so if I look on the board and you look on the board and we both see that there aren't three of a suit that's on the board it eliminates the possibility of a flush from the other person's hand that becomes important because if I have a hand that is vulnerable to a flush like if I've three of a kind or two pair or something like that that now increases how I think about the strength of my own hand and you get to look at your cards as soon as they're dealt but as soon as they're dealt you get to see your private cards right so you know what your private cards are the whole time and then these community cards are coming down in the middle and those community cards are defining for you what you think the other player might have now this is a lot of where the skill in poker comes from is understanding what those community cards mean understanding how they define what the other player has how they might relate in a logical way to what the other player has what the probability is that the other players cards match up in some way to those five cards in the middle yeah it's both right it's what do those cards mean about what you have and what do they not mean about what other players have right and it's interesting because depending on how many players are at the table and what's a typical number of players that are at the table in holdup yeah it's generally nine sometimes it's eight the higher the limit they tend to limit the number of players more so if you're playing in a much lower limit game you might see ten people at a table if you're playing in a much higher limit game it's more likely to be eight which is still kind of staggering to me because now so you have this math of here's what I have here's what's common based on what's common what can I impose but now I actually pay attention to the behavior of the other people so I can I can do the probabilistic calculation broadly I'm doing two probabilistic calculations the implications of these cards on me the implications of these cards on people for whom I don't know the other two cards but now I have to do what eight different behavioral checks right so one thing about the way they relate to your own hand is probabilistic and one is it so the thing that isn't probabilistic is these were late to my cards in my hand in a certain way so if I'm looking at the middle here I'd like I know what I have hopefully but what is probabilistic and this is what's really important is what does that mean for whether I have the best hand or not so that I don't know because that's relative to your hand because there isn't an absolute ranking it's not like oh I have a flush

[00:54:48] I get to win automatically now that comes up we're like sometimes if I look at the center of the board I have the very best possible hand that a person could hold that's very rare that that occurs most of the time I'm somewhere in between the worst possible hand that a person could hold and the best possible hand that a person can hold so I have to figure out where I'm sitting on that spectrum right and it's probabilistic in nature whether

[00:55:13] I'm likely to be beating you or not and I can think about that in the sense of sort of just base rates like if I'm holding this strength hand how often would I be winning but then I also have to adjust those probabilities for what you're doing and how you're acting and how you're acting is gonna tell me something two people could act in the exact same way but depending on my model of who they are it could mean very different things so I could bet strongly with a hand and if you call that could mean that you have a particular range of hands that's X and if another person calls their range of hands that they might call what could be narrower or wider they could be willing to call with either a hand that's much worse than the bottom end of the range of hands that you'd be willing to call their width or they could actually be calling with where their bottom ranges that are than what your bottom range is it was a judgment on that person there's a newcomer to a game have an advantage or a disadvantage let's say you and six of your friends have a regular game going and I show up as a first-timer you guys have never played with me does that give me an advantage or disadvantage in terms of the point you just made about ranging me all things being equal so let's pretend you know nothing about this until we play enough you don't know if I'm good or not so let's assume I know the fundamentals of the game all things being equal against the game you're at a disadvantage because you don't know how to range six people but me personally I would prefer to play in terms of my ability to range you I'm gonna be better with somebody I've already played with before it depends on what question you're asking and in fact there's actually been many many cases in poker where someone has come in and they're doing something that's just really unusual that is not something that would be expected and they do really well a certain period of time and then the market basically kind of figures out what they're doing either they adjust or they don't but I've seen a lot of players come in and win a lot in some cases it's just attributable to like their short-term bursts of luck but in some cases they're actually doing something really unexpected and people are actually miss ranging them this usually is because they're playing more aggressively with hands that people normally wouldn't play that aggressively with and then people sort of figure it out and they adjust and very often that person starts losing after that sometimes they adjust and they do other things but often it has to do with this problem of sort of what do you have for example I can cycling a totally unknown cyclist can win a stage of a race because they lead out they break out and the peloton sort of says well there's no way this person can do such-and-such because we don't know anything about them and all of a sudden they let them get away now they're not gonna be able to do that the next day because all of a sudden the peloton is gonna say well wait a minute wait a minute now we're gonna treat you like we would treat anybody who has the potential to win and your moves now fit into a different frame right exactly that's exactly what happens in poker the first thing that you're trying to do is figure out I know sort of in an absolute sense what I have but I don't know where that sits relative to what you have and then once

[00:58:27] I sort of figure that out and that's probabilistic in nature I now have to figure out for you what's the best line of play for me and tell me how the flow of the game goes from here so the five cards common we each have our - how does the betting work and what changes with the showing of cards or movement of common cards so you start off you get dealt two cards and there's a round of betting and you can choose at that point and this is actually a really important concept in poker I actually tweeted about a little while ago because I think people should be talking about it more which is you're totally allowed to fold remember when Steve Dubner and Steven

[00:59:02] Levitt wrote about this in Freakonomics like the benefit of quitting we do not spend enough time encouraging people to quit no we spend a lot of time encouraging people to stick to it and it's actually for everything that you stick to there's a huge opportunity cost involved right there's all the other things that you could have done and if you're sticking to something that you're negative expectancy - and I'm not saying money I mean I'm saying it might be negative expected happiness to it or negative expected health to it or negative expected whatever that and you're giving up the opportunity to go do something I mean I'm a big fan of quick fast so what I like my theory is do lots and lots of things that are basically a free roll where there's very little downside to it go try out piano right it's like a little bit of your time you can't die doing it just go see if you like it but then quit fast just quit fast and move on to something else and then if you find out oh I really love this I really want to when my time do it now stick to it so

[00:59:57] I'm a huge fan of that but in poker this idea is very natural for a poker player because you're doing a lot of the quitting part you're just saying like no this isn't a hand that I mathematically want to play I don't think I realized that and that actually might answer this question which is one of the things I've never understood about gambling in general is you lose much more than you win presumably no not in poker because of what you just said because you can cut your losses okay that answers the question that's my question was going to be I think it answers my question given the power of loss aversion how the hell do people keep playing because you'd think if you only win once out of every 10 hands that's nine experiences that are each more painful than the pleasure of the win but of course you don't view those nine as losses you just view them as non wins you do lose real hands I mean you get to the end of a hand and you lose real money but a lot of the times if you really feel like you know the table well you know the dynamic well you just cut your losses and you're like

[01:00:55] I'm gonna let these two guys fight it out over here but right exactly and I'm gonna only go to the mat when I really have a shot to win and presumably losing that still falls into the loss aversion pain by that point the pretest probability is such that you have a better shot of so it comes back to this kind of variable ratio reward schedule you're winning enough big pots if you're playing this particular form of Poker which is limit let me just say something about Poker comes in two styles one is limited betting so in limit of betting it means that for example if we're playing maybe but we have to bet in like ten dollar increments so I can bet ten dollars and then if you want to raise the bet you can make it $20 and then if

[01:01:34] I want to raise it I could raise it to 30 in other words we're raising in $10 increments and we can't do anything more than that what comes along with that is there's limited exposure to the person but it obviously limits what I can win from you on a particular hand and then there's no limit which is what you'd really see on television which is the super excited someone shoves a million and chips on like when I think of poker

[01:01:55] I think of rounders I'm sure there's been a million movies which is no limit no limit and snapping Oreos I want to be around John Malkovich I want Oreos and I want to hear a Russian accent like that's alright any time that movies on anyway like if I turn on Netflix and somehow it pops up I'm watching it right yeah that's no limit which is like that super sexy oh my god it's incredible I'm gonna lay everything on the table can I bet my lung yeah but there's also something called limit so in limit a really good limit player at the end of an eight-hour session a very good limit player is gonna have one about fifty six percent of the time this is a really really excellent player now go talk to anybody on Wall Street they can get a hundred billion you can if they say for every bad has a fifty six percent chance of winning right I mean this is a huge ad so I'm saying this is a really really really good limit player what that means though is that the person that they're playing against is gonna win 44 percent of the time so think about how much reinforcement they're getting so sometimes they're gonna win three sessions in a row right having 44 percent that's a lot this is a great player that's hard to believe even when you bring it back to the context of what we keep using is a great comparison which is sports think about this if the

[01:03:10] New England Patriots played let's see who was the worst team in the league last year I don't even remember if you put the best team against the worst team it would not be 56 44 it wouldn't even be close it would be 85 15 or 90/10 even in professional sports so that tells you how much narrower the gap is here in poker this is specifically in this limit version of Poker now in No Limit you can get these bigger spreads ah the 56 percent is dollars not number of times in which a person wins 56 percent of the time is at the end of an eight-hour session how many times have I won have you won okay at the end of that session so over eight hours now just to allow you to understand it's just a matter of the number of iterations because it's sort of in the same way that if the

[01:03:57] Patriots are 56 percent against another team if they play enough times they're a hundred percent to have won the series so a poker player who's gonna win 56 percent of the time at the end of eight hours at the end of 1500 hours will approach the hundred percent that they'll be in the money at the end of the year and this is in this limit version of Poker now when we get to no limit basically what's happening is that you're realizing you're more likely to realize you're gonna see huge volatility and you have enormous ly asymmetric outcomes at times right so here's an interesting thing actually because of that is that when I started playing poker I loved that we haven't even got to you playing poker yet but that's okay because we're gonna get there when I started playing poker the pool of players was small so it wasn't on TV it wasn't on the internet there just wasn't this huge market of people who were like oh I'm gonna go and play poker so what that meant was that this limit version of poker was really what was being played in casinos by professionals and the reason was that when you had someone come in who was not such a great player making sure they were getting that frequent reinforcement was really really really important so you can think about it this way if you have kind of an unlimited supply of new players coming into the game when you come in I should just take all your money right then cuz who cares if you get depressed and go away who cares if I hit you over the head and it plays more like chess and you're like well I'm not gonna play anymore because it's not even close it's not even close that's ridiculous because there's literally 17 people standing behind you waiting to take your seat so now what I can do is I can just maximize in that moment I can just take as much of your money as quickly as possible because there's gonna be somebody else willing to come into the game when I first heard a plane that was not true when I first started playing if someone came in the game who was really playing at negative expected value you didn't want to take a sledgehammer to them you wanted to make sure that they were enjoying themselves by the way and so playing these limit games which were kind of like a softer way that the edge played out over a longer period of time was kind of the way to go because then they they won enough it was like they won enough of the time to feel pretty good and the thing is that I think that people focus when they're thinking about poker on the expected value being about money and when this person came in and they were losing money wasn't that awful for them when somebody goes to see a sports game they play money they get something in return for it right they get to watch a good game when somebody goes to a restaurant and they order food they're giving money yeah there's a guarantee expected loss right but they're getting there for them what they're getting in return is of value so generally when these people would come in the game who will be playing at negative expected value if you only thought about money I think that most of them were actually playing at positive expectancy when you looked overall at what their overall experience was now the thing is that no matter who you are it's not fun for somebody to hit you over the head with a sledgehammer like here just give me all your money it happened in two seconds now go away but when they would come in and they'd get to play with really good players and they'd be learning the game which is exciting and they'd feel like you know woman playing at Table one at the

[01:07:21] Bellagio or Aria or whatever and they're winning enough to feel good they're probably learning and this is entertainment for them now it's no longer zero-sum anymore it's like is it zero-sum as far as the money is concerned sure but it's not zero sum over all when you look at like what's the scope of what people value because there's all this entertainment happening as well and I remember there was this guy won't say his last name but this guy named Jay who came and played he came in the late 90s and he you know he's probably mid to late 70s he had made a bunch of money on Wall Street moved to

[01:07:58] Las Vegas to retire his health was okay his mind was super sharp and I think that he just sort of decided this is what he wanted to do for his retirement he had a ton of money and so he started playing in these high-limit games with the high-limit players at that time and it was a small group and he'd come in and play and the whole group would break for dinner and we'd all go with Jay to go eat at a restaurant in the Mirage it was at this time this was before the

[01:08:28] Bellagio was built we'd all go eat dinner and he would sometimes have parties at his house and we'd go over to the party at his house or he'd get invited to somebody else's house and this was his social life and she was losing a lot of money but he was happy he was having fun he had this whole group of people and he got to have this fun conversation and he got to learn this game and so on so forth and think this is kind of how he spent the last four or five years of his life and he was for sure winning to that so I feel like people sort of think it all sounds very cutthroat but it's not and this is something that certainly I think that the players in the 90s for sure were really thinking about which is what's the value add how are you bringing value for this we know how they're bringing value to us wow that's so interesting I wouldn't have guessed that but that's a nice symbiosis there's a really really famous player named chip Reese he he sadly passed away about very unexpectedly who was young passed away probably about 15 years ago now maybe the greatest poker mind ever I mean certainly one of them and the thing about chip was he just made everybody happy around him he made a ton of money playing backgammon he made lots of money playing poker and he had the superpower of these people who were very negative expectancy if you were thinking about money would be calling him up like dying to play with him because he was nice it was just a really good time I think about it it's the same thing why do you go to a movie well okay if we just think about it as money it seems like a losing proposition but of course that's not what we should be really thinking about that as and so

[01:10:00] I think that that gets lost a little bit as the game grows and becomes really really really big and so if you don't have a particularly good time and you're sad and you leave there's somebody else just to take your place and I think that that interesting aspect of how it really wasn't very zero-sum it all kind of goes away

[01:10:22] I think it's come back a little bit now because the poker economy has contracted and I think they're sort of coming back to that idea of how does this become fun for everybody it's a really interesting aspect of the game back then so when did you figure out you got a knack for this it's hard to say cuz I feel like it's all relative you know I retired in 2012 and pretty much anything else that I can think of that's competitive pokers really changed the ability for people to be able to run batches of hands for example after the fact that sort of think oh here is the situation that I was in now I'm going to go and I'm going to run this and sort of see what the right answer would have been so that I can take that into the next time

[01:11:02] I play the kind of analytics that people have the ability for them to discover what the equilibrium point is on a particular decision or whatever it's just beyond what I can even comprehend so I left before I would have had to put that work in if I did put the work in under those conditions I'm not sure that

[01:11:21] I would do well I mean I know that if I sat down today without doing that work I would get completely crushed so in that sense you can look at me and say well I didn't have a knack for it if I tried to play against today's players who know the things that they know and are able to run the kinds of simulations and analytics that they can run now and they're understanding the mathematics of the game are and sort of what the optionality is and so you're saying that a professional player today will take every hand of a game and they'll have the simulation after the fact of that hand well not necessarily every hand but they can pick hands and they can actually run the same way that you do it in baseball I was gonna say this sounds a lot like Moneyball matches it is the advent of analytics to the game right exactly so they can sit there and they can say they can just set the parameters if I am in a particular situation where

[01:12:10] I think that I have to bluff and if I give you this range of hands how often do you fold if I give you this range of hands how often do you fold and they can figure out exactly at what point if I bet a particular amount am i winning enough to that bet that I can now try to bluff in that situation that maybe I would have never thought in a million years was a situation that I would be winning to if I were to Bluff there because I just I didn't have the data so

[01:12:35] I feel like knack is such a strange word because I feel like it's knack relative to what well to your peers at the time yeah so those peers changed so I started playing in Montana what year is this oh my gosh I started playing I turned professional in 94 so it's right around that time I was playing against people in Montana who a lot of them were retirees who were this is kind of what they did some people have their bridge game or some people are playing golf or some people are playing poker and and that's kind of what they wanted to do so well I think that pretty much everybody who plays poker is would like to get better and enjoys the game more some people are more agree to do that than others and people are getting different things out of the game and the people that I was playing with that were not thinking let me become a world-class player at that time particularly because I had really great mentors my understanding of the mathematics of that game was so beyond their understanding I don't think that was part of their enjoyment so the day that I stepped into that room I had a knack certainly compared to the people that I was playing against I started playing two years before that in that game and that was sort of where I was learning and then 94 I decided I was a professional poker player and I moved to

[01:13:53] Las Vegas and I started playing and this is how many years after the game in New York that or was it only your brother that was playing only my brother was playing in it yeah I never played in New York I don't think I ever played a hand of Poker in New York so you get to Vegas in 96 no I got to Vegas in 94 oh that was the declaration of hearing

[01:14:09] Pro okay got it does it become less fun when it's your job now does it amplify the stakes eventually but no not at this time poker is a really complicated game very very complex and I know that there's just so much that I don't know about the game and I'm totally aware that if I tried to sit down and play against today's players that they would bury me because there's this whole layer of the game that I haven't discovered but while

[01:14:38] I was particularly in those early years in the 90s I had started off in Montana playing only Limit Hold'em now I go and I start to learn more about that game so I'm starting to sort of peel back the layers of that game and like most things that you do as you peel those layers back what you start to see is that there was a whole bunch of stuff underneath it that you didn't even know existed right so you think that the onion is a certain size and you put a layer back and you realize oh wait no there's like so many more layers under there than I ever could have thought I was telling this to somebody the other day my pet of research always says it says I don't know if he's paraphrasing somebody or if he coined the term but the further you get from short the deeper the water somebody has to they asked me a question about a topic I don't remember what it was but I said and I wasn't being facetious I really mean it I know less about this subject today than I did 10 years ago and they said how was that possible and I said well to be completely accurate I mean on a relative basis obviously in an absolute basis I know more than I did ten years ago about subject why but my knowledge of how much broader it is today has dwarfed my absolute knowledge so on a relative basis I've gone backwards yeah exactly that's what's happening so I'm learning this game limit hold them learning things about poker in general and then I start expanding my repertoire of the types of games that I play so I start to learn the Omaha games I start to learn the stud games I start to learn pot limit and No Limit so those are different betting structures and I'm immersed it's like I'm living and breathing and talking poker all the time with peers with mentors so and so forth so it's not really like a job in that sense certainly not during that first eight or ten years that I'm playing I'm learning and every second is learning so when did you see sort of robots in the book but you also figure out it seems pretty early that there are at the risk of oversimplifying to different types of players there are the players who when they win it's because of how well they've done things when they lose it's because of bad luck and that's basically the narrative and you seem and again I don't know how quickly you came to this understanding but at some point you seem to come to the understanding of wait a minute sometimes I'm winning when I make the wrong bet and sometimes I'm losing when I make the right bet and that last one by the way must be a hard pill to swallow you end up sort of in your own mind formulating a very common tool we use today which is this decision matrix of that I use the right process yes or no did I get the right outcome yes or no that's a lovely two by two but it's one that you have two squares of that 2x2 never get talked about which are the ones that are at odds with each other let me really dig into something you just said so I agree that we're not seeing the whole two-by-two where I'm going to quibble is this correct me if

[01:17:37] I'm wrong but I think what you said was you could have made really good decisions like I'd had a good situation and ended up having a bad outcome and that's the really hard pill to swallow and I actually think it's the reverse to me I think that's the story you tell when you're opening your book which bringing it back to England Patriots is when the tables are turned right it's the Pete

[01:17:58] Carril pass call on the two yardline or whatever in the Super Bowl that gets intercepted which again by all metrics if you looked at this like you were a robot looking at reams of data the outcome of that call was positive that should have been a touchdown right that's a question of resulting when we're evaluating other people's decisions particularly people that we don't compare to particularly in a situation where the decision is complicated we have this simplifier the shortcut called resulting so what we do is we say if I know what the quality of the outcome is I can work backwards from that to the quality of the decision so this is what happens to Pete Carril it's the last play of Super Bowl 2015 everybody expects he's down by four to the Patriots as always it's always the

[01:18:49] Patriots back to the beginning of the conversation at any rate everybody thinks he's gonna hand the ball off to Marshawn Lynch instead he has Russell Wilson the quarterback passed the ball this is very unexpected the math is very very complicated here there's some game theory in there there's options theory all sorts of things that people are interested in reading about it they can go look at Benjamin Morris on 538 it suffice it to say it is a good play we'll link to all those in our show notes by the way because we love nerding out on this exam sort of background so he passes the ball it's intercepted they lose the Super Bowl this way Malcolm

[01:19:23] Butler my hero just I mean I can't imagine can you imagine what I was doing to my TV haha I remember looking at my daughter going earmuffs and it was I mean I am screaming and my wife's like all right I'm gonna take the kids out yeah I'm like yeah that's fine yeah exactly so this is what we do the thing about understanding the quality of the decision it's it's complex it's really hard you need to know a whole bunch of different things you need to know given the decision was made what were the possible outcomes how often would those outcomes occur if you think about what are the consequences of each of those outcomes how much door I'd prefer each of those outcomes so I can understand what the probability of getting a preferred outcome is if I have a outcome that I don't prefer like an interception like how often does that happen and then you also have to compare it do that exact process with the other possibilities the other decisions that you could have made and now actually compare to see how do I get the highest expected value the highest chance of actually winning the

[01:20:26] Superbowl and it's all very complicated and involves what's the interception rate which people don't know off the top of their head or you have to think about if there's only 26 seconds left how do I get three plays off instead of two and it's very hard suffice it to say if you pass the ball either on the first or the second play there because it's second down 26 seconds left one time out if you'd pass the ball on either the first or second play it means that you can do that plus hand the ball off to Marshawn

[01:20:57] Lynch if all you do is hand the ball off to Marshawn Lynch twice you don't get that third play that third play is incredibly valuable and the cost of the third play is whatever the interception rate is and the interception right there is less than 2% and there's a time management piece to it as well a pass that is not caught is an immediate time stop you could have a bizarre scenario under which you hand it off to Marshawn

[01:21:20] Lynch it turns into a bit of a scrum you have to burn one of your timeouts well you're gonna have to no matter what you only have one left if I recall right so you have one left so that's why if you hand it off to Marshawn Lynch on the first two plays assuming the first one fails that's the end of your timeout so because you can get the clock to naturally stop on a pass that's why if you pass on the first or second play you can get three plays instead of two but that's all very complex so what we tend to do in those situations is we say that's all really hard and I don't know what any of that is and it's all very opaque to me so if I understand what the quality of the outcome is was it good or bad in this particular case it was disastrous then I know what the quality of the decision is so that's what's happening in that Pete Carril thing that's called resulting resulting as a heuristic simplifier works really well in chess if I lose to you in chess

[01:22:14] I played worse than you where it's very poorly in poker if I lose to you in poker who knows and certainly very poorly in football we don't really know depending on how the play worked out whether it's a good or bad decision but what's interesting is that people don't do this resulting thing in situations where they feel like the quality of the decision is known and I say feel like because in quotes yeah right because they don't necessarily know it but remember that what I said is resulting is a simple fire the quality of the decision it's complicated it's hard to figure out so what happens when we feel like we do know the quality of the decision so I'll give you an example if

[01:22:53] I come home one day and I say to you I got in a car accident do you know if it's my fault or not no clue and you won't use the fact that I got in a car accident to work backwards like you do with Pete Carril because you understand that there are certain things that really are knowable about driving and you can ask me what those are did you break the rules of the road were you drinking you can ask me a whole bunch of things so there's all sorts of places like that where we feel like we understand what the decision quality is and so if we have a bad outcome we actually tolerate it this occurs all the time in business as well right if somebody makes a decision let's say they execute on a decision that was made in a committee where the whole team agreed that this was the right way to go and then it doesn't work out people aren't like idiot but if they do something on their own that is not something that everybody always does then all of a sudden if it doesn't work out they're really under the gun so we have this issue of transparency that occurs so now let me get back to this roundabout way so first of all let me just give you a good example of the transparency problem okay bear with me on this thought experiment for a second you don't have ways it's broken and you're driving to the airport with your spouse obviously you have to get there in time and you get in the car and you go the normal way that you go that you've always gone and something happens there's a big accident on the road and your car is not moving and you get to the airport and you just miss your flight are you getting blamed for that is that your fault is your spouse mad at you no not in my case I can imagine in some people's cases but mostly no it doesn't feel like it okay so now you get in your car again you don't have ways whatever your phone's broken you get in your car and you announce to your spouse I have a shortcut mm-hmm I was just talking to

[01:24:56] Morgan over there and they told me about this great shortcut so I'm gonna take this shortcut because I've checked it out I looked on a map that's better and now you go to the airport and there is an accident car is not moving you make it to the airport and you've just missed your flight is your spouse mad at you again mine would not because she's super human but yes I think many people in that situation are absolutely getting yelled at by the way that's a superhuman spouse it's like I cannot believe your stupid short cut so this is one of those cases where so we have this come up all the time and when it comes up in so many different ways it comes up in comes up in medicine all the time because that's such a great example right if Marshawn Lynch had been handed the ball and he had fumbled the ball same exact outcome people would be pissed at Lynch nobody would be pissed at Pete Carril that is exactly right and they might not even be pissed at

[01:25:48] Marshawn Lynch they might just think that the Patriots line is too good yeah the safety or whoever came and stripped the ball out was just exceptional right and why is that what's the difference because in both cases respected versus not expected expected versus not expected and this comes up I guarantee you this comes up in your business all the time it comes up in your personal life all the time it's one of the reasons why for example if someone's really unhappy in their job they won't be aggressive enough about going and finding another position and the reason is that the unhappiness in their job is now but sort of become expected like they're not really blaming themselves for that but if they go and find a new position and they're not happy they're they're gonna feel like it's their fault as an example this happens in business strategy this is the way that teams end up operating so on so forth okay so this becomes a really big problem so every human being understands this difference between kind of transparent and opaque decisions now here's my question for you what decisions do you think are the most transparent to you your own these have the most transparency to us so what happens with our own decisions is that we allow uncertainty to bubble to the surface as the explanation for a bad outcome more often than we would for somebody else's decisions why because we feel like we know what the quality of our decision is number one and number two we don't really want to question the quality of our decision so you can think about that sort of in general do you hand it off to Marshawn Lynch or do you pass it is a question of when are we allowing uncertainty as the explanation for a poor outcome so it's innovative unexpected opaque all of those things we don't allow the uncertainty in the door but when we feel like we know obviously you're supposed to hand it off to Marshawn Lynch now we let uncertainty into the door we do this for ourselves as well so now this brings me full circle to this thing about when we think about this matrix and you say well you might make a really good decision and have a bad outcome that's the most painful you said rather but that's just my subjective overlay I don't know that there's any decision-making expert out there that would argue one way or the other I think that people do think that so I just want to sort of pick at something so let's just start again so what you said was there are these two quadrants right that we would think of as discordant right so one of them is you make a bad decision but you get the right outcome you get the right outcome and then you said even more painful is you make a good decision and you get a bad outcome now what I think is interesting is that I would actually argue that that doesn't have a lot of pain associated with it and let me explain why imagine you're looking at this in the aftermath of the outcome okay so in one case you've gotten a good outcome in one case you've gotten a bad outcome so let me ask you to do the thought experiment where do you want to dig anymore if you get a good outcome are you looking to dig in to try to find out if you made a bad decision that resulted in that good outcome or you just being like good outcome yay me but if you have a bad outcome are you eager honestly I think it depends like using sports as an example

[01:28:54] I think is a different example versus in medicine so I've talked about this before on the podcast in medicine there's a release in surgery there's a conference that's typically done called the morbidity and mortality conference where you as the name suggests every week you discuss all the morbidities and all the mortalities of the previous week and so that is an objective definition a person can basically arrive dead in the hospital from let's say a gunshot wound they still get presented in the conference even though let's say you did nothing they literally showed up in the emergency room you did CPR for a minute they were all basically already dead and the call time of death that still shows up even though there's no blame to be assigned within the confines of how medicine was practiced so those ones don't get a lot of discussion the ones that get a lot of discussion are you made a decision that seemed like the right decision at the time and it seems defensible but the outcome was bad now of course as you've alluded to these are so complicated because there's still the luck component there's all these other things that go into it so I guess if your question is where do you learn the most versus what causes the most consternation those aren't necessarily the same are they the point that I'm making is not so much about where do you learn the most because I think you learn from all four quadrants and it's really important to learn from all four quadrants right I made a good decision I got a good outcome I'd like to understand when I have made a good decision that has a really good expected value and I want to be able to see that

[01:30:25] I want to understand when I made a bad decision that had a bad outcome and where I had negative expected value and then I can understand that so I can adjust my decision making going forward and likewise I'd like to understand when I made a bad decision that had a good outcome and vice-versa what you just described is actually the whole shebang in terms of the reinforcement of this bad kind of thinking because what I'm guessing does not occur every week is the wow this patient did way better than expected but we made the wrong decision let's have a conference about that so let me give you a super simple example to try to get at this because I think that this is actually a really big problem particularly as

[01:31:02] I feel like now people have now understood the importance of process language so if we think about any business movie from the 1980s they're like um results-driven right now now you sort of look back at that in your little horrified because I think we all understand that we don't want to be results-oriented we kind of get that that's a problem and we'd all like to aspire to be Sam hinkie and trust the process and we know we're supposed to a process process process but here's the problem so now let's do this as a two by two okay you have a status quo decision the expected decision a consensus decision and you have a good outcome is anybody hailing you is the biggest genius of all time no but they're saying good job you have a status quo decision that has a bad outcome is anybody excoriating you know they're saying tough luck what could you do you have an unexpected an opaque a non status quo a non consensus decision that has a good outcome and they're hailing you is the biggest genius of all time you have a non status quo decision that has a bad outcome and everybody's calling you an idiot so people understand this so now let's think about what does that do to somebody's decision making well first of all they want to avoid the bad outcome this is where loss aversion comes in right we don't want to be the idiot that's the one quadrant that you want to avoid right well in general we want to avoid the whole right side of the table because the right side of the table contains the idiot section so let's think about how can we avoid the whole right side of the table well one way we can avoid sort of the bad outcomes all together is to kind of fall down on the not deciding thing just sort of not doing anything that's going to cause a big loss or a big win either you could do it by omission you could sort of not act you could make very very low volatility choices there's things that you could do there to play these strategies the other thing that you can do so you can avoid fighting at all or you can make sure that you're making things that don't really create big losses so you're not going to end up in the room but the other way to deal with that whole right side is to focus on the lower right quadrant and say I never want to be the idiot in the room and so therefore I'm gonna make status-quo decisions so let's think about this for example it doesn't matter if 80 percent or so of ear infections are viral if a patient comes into my office I'm giving them antibiotics so I don't want to get yelled at if this happens to be the time now I want to be able to cover my butt and that way nobody can yell at me so now let's think about this so what ends up happening is that we want people to be thinking I just want to make the best decisions and I don't really want to be afraid of the bad outcomes I particularly don't want people to be afraid of this idiot quadrant because we would like people to be innovative and we'd like them to be thinking outside the box and we'd like them to sort of push against what the status quo is because that's how obviously we move forward as a society as a business as an individual but this is what happens everybody has a morbidity conference so even if in the morbidity conference you're talking about process you're in the room because of morbidity so everybody knows I get in the room because of something bad so here's a simple thought experiment that I use imagine that we're investing in real estate like we have a real estate investing group and we have a model of the market obviously and we have limited resources that we can deploy and so we invest in a particular project and it ends up doing 15% worse than we expected we're all in a room now we might be in that room talking about our model true we might be in the room talking about our decision process but we're having a long meeting in a room about the fact that the project did 15% worse than we expected now we do the exact same thing we invest in this particular project and it does 15% better than expected is the same conversation happening no so I don't care how much the word process comes out of your mouth everybody knows they're supposed to be afraid of bad outcomes then and here's the really big problem and it's true we can talk about it in terms of medicine as well but this particular thought experiment that has to do with the real estate it matters just as much as if you've overestimated the market which is how you'd end up fifteen percent on the downside then if you've underestimated the market because your goal is to efficiently allocate your resources within the market that you're allocating the resources in and if your models wrong I don't care if it's wrong if it's under estimating or over estimating that's a problem for efficient allocation of resources not only that but when it's 15 percent to the good it's a signal that there may be risk that you didn't identify so for example you could have the mean right but you may have the variant that's a really big problem because that has really big implications for what percentage of your bankroll or of the total money that you have the total capital that you have that you're supposed to deploy to that particular project that's a very important point by the way which doesn't

[01:36:28] I think get talked about enough even in that circle which is people are very fixated on return on capital but they generally aren't as appreciative of risk adjusted return on capital so Ray Rock versus rock is this concept that seems to be missing from the way a lot of people think about that so it's good that you brought that point up because there could be a number of problems with that issue not just maybe you didn't allocate enough maybe allocated the right amount or too much it didn't appreciate what was at risk right exactly so we want to be seeing those signals right because we'd like to understand if we underestimated the ball and in both cases your model could be totally right and you can just be a couple two standard deviations away or there's a variety of reasons on that particular time that it could have come in low or high that don't have anything to do with your model but you kind of want to dig in either way because it's something unexpected happen the other thing by the way that happens is that when you have a downside event and you do get in the room people rarely asked should we have done worse they asked could we have done better and now again you're reinforcing for people

[01:37:31] I care when things go badly when things go badly I want to avoid them now poker happens to be this very pure place where should I have done worse regardless of whether I won or lost is actually a very important question because sometimes you have a hand I'm thinking about what you have and let's say that I put you in a range where you're very wheat and I'd feel that I'm very strong in comparison to you so because you're weak I'm playing the hand we would call it's low or small where I'm you're trying to draw as much out right which means that I'm not betting really big now at the end of the hand you hit a lucky card at the end of the hand the very last card I end up losing the hand but when we turn the hands over it turns out that you were much stronger than I thought in this case I should have lost more because yes you hit a lucky card but I should have been extracting much more money from you because you would have tolerated it had

[01:38:26] I had your hand right now it may turn out that there was no way for me to get your hand right but I'm supposed to explore that because now what I know is that if I knew what your cards were I would have lost a lot more money than I did that I actually played the hand very poorly for what the hand was that you actually had I actually under played my hand and that story that example you use

[01:38:47] I think to me is one of the best examples of why the title of the book makes sense which is this isn't a book about poker actually it's a book that uses poker as a model system so for example let's talk about biology why do we do so much biology in C elegans a worm or in this type of a mouse or this yeast do we care that much about mice and yeast and worms no they are model systems that allow us to do things in cleaner ways and I think that's sort of the beauty of poker which for the listener them I think they're talking about poker so much why well I think you have to understand enough about poker to understand what you just said because what you just said is it's not often in life we will get that much clarity after the fact but we can still bring that level of critical thought to our decisions to me that is the if you remember nothing else from this podcast this is the part I'd want someone to remember

[01:39:45] I think of poker is the C elegans of decision-making in life that that's gonna be nice and we can think about this on the winning side as well right like I could win a hand from you where I really should have won a lot less again if I had had perfect information I shouldn't have actually won as much as

[01:40:06] I did because for example I couldn't miss read your hand and I could play a hand really strongly and then I can be the one who hits a lucky card and actually if I had perfect information I would not have ever put that much money at risk so we want to explore whether the outcome is good or bad we want to have equanimity toward the direction that we're exploring could I have gotten even more out of you could I have done even better could I have done worse and the other thing that besides that direction by the way is we want to think orthogonal II like maybe you lost for reasons that had nothing to do with your decision process or maybe you won for reasons that you totally didn't predict this happens in financial markets all the time you invest in a say a company because you think that a particular product of theirs is gonna do gangbusters or something and then that product fails but they happen to acquire another company by the way don't take credit for that if that wasn't in your model but you happen to have one so we want to be thinking up-down orthogonal in all these directions so now here becomes the problem we know that people don't like to be in this bottom white grunt they don't like to be in this place of ok something really bad happened and if they do get in that something really bad happened place they want to be able to say but it's not my fault it's a bad luck situation it's like well my decision process was good and everybody had consensus and I handed the ball off to Marshawn Lynch what could I do that was what I was supposed to do so you're driving people into this place where they're very likely to be trying to build consensus not necessarily of the good kind right of the false kind they may be using data not to find the truth but to tell a data story that supports them in case they happen to get into the room so we really like to say the data told us so they may just be doing what everybody has always done they may be slow to decide because they need buy-in or the right kind of sign-off too often or they need a higher level of certainty than they really should in order to make the decision all sorts of bad things come out of this and what really ends up coming out of it is that people tend to move slowly they tend to default toward omissions versus commissions in other words not deciding versus deciding and they tend not to like to innovate too much now is this my guess is there's a different propensity for this across different field so for example have you ever had a chance to talk to Pete Carroll I haven't just thinking about everything you said it would be very interesting to have that discussion with him and say it'd be hard for him to do this but go back in time to before you made that decision I'm pretty sure the only thing Pete Carroll was thinking about was winning I can't imagine there was even an ounce of thought in his mind that said whatever decision I make I want to make sure it's defensible at the press conference I just can't imagine he would have thought that I agree and I think that's what makes Pete Carroll's that's a great coach I was about to say but one you see more Pete Carroll like thinking in something like sports or is it less about sports and more about being the head coach versus the defensive coordinator who in the end is still making a very important decision but answers to a coach of course the coach answers to the owner but I'm not sure

[01:43:11] I'm articulating the question well but I actually think that you are so first of all we know across the NFL that the slowness to adopt the analytics has been remarkable and that's because in this particular case the people who are judging you are going to be like the GM's or the fans or that kind of thing and if they're judging you they're going to be judging you for the unusual decisions so I think actually if we go to Belichick we can kind of see if we go back to this idea of this feeling of transparency people are forgiving when there's a feeling of transparency so if you're Pete Carroll at that point in his career people are much more likely and remember even with him they really bashed him but they're much more likely to sort of give you the benefit of the doubt so I actually saw a great talk by Toby Moskowitz he's a really interesting guy there's a lot of stuff in sports analytics and quant and this kind of thing and he was talking about Belichick and he said when you look at his decision-making when he was with the Browns it was dismal compared to the analytic and it's not actually until he wins two

[01:44:17] Super Bowls that you start to see this decision-making that's really starting to align with the analytics that's really starting to be like I don't care if nobody's gonna understand this decision I'm Bill Belichick and that's the decision gonna make but it's after two Super Bowls that he gets there why because the fans are now tolerant of it they're willing to tolerate the stuff that they don't understand why did you go up for it on 4th and 5 there what would that's insane no well cuz you're

[01:44:44] Belichick so what we want to think about is when we think about these what you said the morbidity conference what is that encouraging in the people that you're trying to lead you're encouraging the behavior that they naturally bend toward which is I want to stay out of this lower right quadrant so I don't want anything bad to happen to me but if it does happen to me I'm gonna make sure there's so much cya there that it's gonna be okay that nobody's gonna sit there and say I made a crazy decision and you're doing that because you're not you're not exploring both directions but particularly because you're not getting in the room when something unexpectedly good happens and here's the issue when something unexpectedly good happens there's so much to learn from that it's that different by the way then when something good happens that shouldn't have happened based on what people didn't know now I'm getting sort of Rumsfeld II in a bit but okay I'm making this up so this could be complete nonsense so I'm hoping you'll be able to come up with a real example remember the whole y2k thing everybody thought oh my god this could be the free-for-all Beauvoir turned out to be the biggest nothing burger in the history of civilization like I have friends in college whose entire job after college was getting ready for y2k so nothing happened fine now there's two ways nothing happened one is nothing happened because there was really nothing going on and we just didn't understand that and we did a whole bunch of stuff to be prepared for it and in the end it didn't matter there's another thing which is oh no it was a real problem and all of that work that was done to make sure airplanes didn't fall out of the sky it worked those are kind of different and I'm using the problem they reserve's work involved versus decision being made so maybe this isn't a great example I guess what I'm trying to get at is you can have great outcomes because there was going to be a great outcome regardless of your decision and then you can have great outcomes where you actually made the wrong decision and you got the right outcome and then there's you made the right decision and the right outcome I'm almost wondering like are there other historical examples in Wars I'm trying to think of like d-day was that invasion on that day the right thing to do I mean history will forever be changed as a result of it in the right direction but has anyone ever gone back and said well you know what based on the weather pattern like Eisenhower got lucky that shouldn't have worked that day and that was the wrong decision they should have waited a day or something to that effect yes so number one with y2k there's a fourth thing that you can say so I agree with all three things that you pointed out it could have been good decision good outcome it could have been it would have happened no matter what we did and so we were irrelevant it could be that we had a good outcome and it was all sort of a waste of times it was a bad decision to do anything it could be it doesn't really matter because when you sort of look at what the range of possibilities were given the unknown information the downside was so bad that you were actually supposed to protect against that regardless and were you gonna waste a whole bunch of human productivity doing it well it's not really a waste cuz it just acts as a hedge against just in case it's the worst case scenario and and particularly with something like that we would want to protect ourselves against that but unless you dig into the win you don't find that stuff out and I think that that's where the problem is so with the

[01:47:55] Eisenhower example what you said it's such a great model for how do we think about our own outcomes in our own lives so this is what tends to happen to us and this is why I was saying oh it's actually not painful at all when you have a bad outcome to go in and look it's what we naturally do something horrible happens to me I'm looking in there I'm trying to find all the luck in there I'm exploring what were my other options was there something else that could have worked out better how often was that decision gonna work out poorly and I'm so excited I'm so excited to go in and discover that I didn't do anything wrong I'm looking for that when it's a bad outcome when it's a good outcome when we land on the beaches of

[01:48:37] Normandy and it's a pivot point in the war and we when people aren't looking it's hard to try to figure out to really explore the counterfactuals well what if I had done this what if I had done this what if what if it had turned out this way so one of the first steps to being a really good decision maker because we have this asymmetry and how willing we are to explore these outcomes and it's what you just said it's we're all living our lives having a morbidity conference now the morbidity conference that we're having in her head is specifically to go find the luck and the whole thing but that's the only conference we're having we're never having the my life is great conference let me go figure out if that's because of my own decision-making or because of luck or if there was a better way or I could have actually opened up a whole other set of outcomes like nobody's nobody's doing that that is such an interesting point you are so correct in that and as you're telling that story I'm thinking of a sort of silly example in my life but it's one that anyone who knows me knows I take very seriously which is how much I love archery and I shoot a lot so when I am

[01:49:42] NOT in New York obviously when I'm back in San Diego I'm shooting constantly and I'm always trying to push the limit of my capabilities which means you're losing arrows you're just invariably if you're 60 70 yards away trying to hit something the size of a softball you're gonna miss every once in a while

[01:49:58] I'm generally losing an arrow to the tune of one a day now these arrows are very expensive so this is becoming quite a problem every one I've missed I can tell you a hundred reasons why and not bad luck I can tell you the mistake I've made I don't think I've once ever given thought to the perfect shots why don't they have ever spent time thinking about that ever I think 90% of my energy goes into thinking about the 10% of the shots

[01:50:29] I didn't like and I thought that's the right way to do it isn't that making me a better shooter what I'm hearing you say is that's part of making you a better shooter it's also gonna encourage I mean if you think about sort of societally if it's the bad outcomes that are triggering the dives first of all you're losing half of the opportunities to learn if not more than half because you might even be making more positive outcomes than less right right well let's assume that the chances of having an unexpectedly good outcome symmetric and let's make it that the thing that triggers us doing a dive is that it's unexpected and you can decide if it's like a one standard deviation away or the standard deviation and a half or whatever it is we can decide and that would obviously depend on the uncertainty and how much ball there is and so and so forth but we'd figure that out and let's assume it's symmetric so by only digging into the downside we're doing two things one is we're losing half of our opportunities to learn and the second thing is that we're reinforcing the risk aversion we're saying hey what we really care about is down side outcome so you better avoid those and three is we're completely quashing anybody ever doing anything unexpected we're because if you do something unexpected the chances that somebody's gonna allow for luck or that you yourself are going to allow for luck as the explanation is just going to kind of go poof and we don't like that so there's all sorts of bad stuff that comes out of it so when we get an outcome we want to basically do what you were just doing with the beaches of

[01:51:52] Normandy which is to say here's the outcome before I make any conclusions about it let me think about what are the other possible things that could have occurred so I have to think about what are the things that didn't happen but could have those counterfactuals and then I need to think about what was my preference for those things how much did

[01:52:13] I like each of those things and how often were those things going to happen so it's just basically thinking about what was the payoff for those things that obviously didn't compare those two cost but let's just simplify it what were the possibilities what were my preference is for those possibilities and what was the probability of each of those possibilities occurring and then so that's the first step with the beaches of Normandy it ended up being a particular way but given that they decided to do what they did on that particular day what are the other ways that it could have turned out with what probability would have that have turned out and how much would we have liked or those things depending on what our goal was which in this case was to win the war and then now we can take that and we can iterate it and say what if they had waited two days what if they had done it two days before what if they had had done it in a different way they had gone from land instead of sea now we can start thinking about if they had chosen other options then how would that have compared in terms of what the expected value was for the option that they actually chose and you can do this for anything so you can do this for the archery I assume that a bull's-eye is pretty unexpected at certain ranges it's more surprising than it is not right what you can say is you could actually go in and start forecasting it I'm going in at a particular range given what I think that my skill level is what percentage of the shots do I think I'm going to get a bull's-eye so forecast it say this is the percentage of times that I think I'm gonna go to bullseye now if it's a particular day and you're well below that you would say hmm I wonder what happened today what was the situation today where I was well below what my expectation was for the number of bull's-eyes but now if you're way above you do the exact same and this is what we don't do I can guarantee you because

[01:53:55] I know this is the way that people think if you think I don't know how many times you shoot at the target I've done so much of the work you're describing without the important piece but at 50 yards for example I know just based on what I do that I should be able to put eight out of ten inside of a certain diameter so I spend a lot of time thinking about when I'm hitting six out of ten inside of that range what's going on but there's days I'm hitting 10 out of 10 this is what you do you walk off and you dance you're like look at me I don't think about why you're like whoa check me out I'm great and the thing is that of course you may have stepped up in skill but wouldn't you like to know exactly what the adjustment what was it that actually clicked for you that day what is it that I know it's not that I stepped up in skill because it can vanish the next day so it's clearly something that is transient well one of the reasons why it may be transient is because I haven't identified it and marked it and incorporated weight because it could be totally transient it could be that you get to a certain skill level and this is gonna be your range it's gonna be six to ten oh well bye transient I just mean what I'm really saying is I'm sure that I did something better on that day but it's transient because I didn't identify it and make it a part of my permanent it could be that if we could look at me under the six out of ten day versus the ten out of ten day

[01:55:12] I mean I'm positive I'm doing something different there is no way equipment wind or any other factor other than me explains that but by only comparing 8 to 6 not 6 to 10 I'm missing a greater disparity which in theory should call out the more obvious deltas it's not just that you're missing half the time it's you're using half the discrimination it's like it's easier to see that there are two lines if they're a foot apart versus a millimeter apart so if I had to say like if someone asked me what's the single biggest factor between a player who doesn't make a ton of progress or make slower progress compared to a player who really really makes a lot of progress and it becomes a leap in poker I would say that's it that when you listen to to someone like Eric Seidel talk about poker you would hardly know whether they won or lost the hand all they're doing is exploring what are the counterfactuals like what are the other lines that I could have chosen did I have the person's hand right what if I had bet a little bit more what if I had bet a little bit less what if I hadn't played the hand at all what would have happened if I played this hand that I didn't play and you would hardly know like if you listen to them you would have no idea in fact probably you would assume they had lost right because it's so foreign to hear somebody luring so much you'd be like whoa you must have really lost that tournament they'd be like no I won the tournament and you move on and and what you hear from players who aren't making that kind of progress is it goes to waste when they talk about the hands they won it's just sort of like I was great and they don't really spend a lot of time on when they talk about the hands they lost it's a lot of exploration of the luck elements and the thing about poker because the luck element in a given instance like in the short run is so prominent that it's so easy to focus on the bad card that came so you'll have conversations with people where they'll talk about like oh

[01:57:10] I had this hand and this person that's called sucking out they sucked out on me meaning that they happen to hit a good card and to somebody who's thinking who spent a lot of time around someone like Eric Sydow you're looking at it and saying well you should have won that hand way before hand or maybe you shouldn't have played that hand at all so for example like if I have a particular hand where you end up hitting a really good card it may be that I should have made you fold before then now sometimes it's you were gonna be sticky you were gonna stay around

[01:57:40] I had mathematically way the best of it and whatever bad luck happened but sometimes it's I should have made you fold a lot earlier I should have made you pay more for the privilege of hitting that card that actually the way that I bet the hand meant that you were making money to my bet when I could have made you lose money to my bet regardless of whether you were gonna beat me on that particular hand in the long run I'd like to make you make losing decisions maybe I shouldn't have played the hand at all there's all sorts of other things that you can be exploring in those situations and they're not getting explored instead what's getting focused on is I can't believe that person sucked out on me so I have this framework for learning things that require skill and I see a parallel now that I've never seen before so my framework and I use swimming as the analogy for this because

[01:58:25] I learned to swim as an adult so this was really the first time I explored this framework but I do think it applies to many things languages you pick it frankly so that framework is we start out as unconsciously incompetent so you take a person like me at thirty-one who doesn't know how to swim you put them in the water there's no ambiguity about how bad I am but I don't know why all I can tell you is I can't swim I can't actually tell you why I can't swim so the first step of learning how to swim is becoming consciously incompetent you actually have to understand why you are really bad at this Oh once you start to understand our committees principle that's like a very important part of understanding how to swim the more of you that's underwater the more buoyancy there is to hold you up once you start to understand how Bernoulli works oh all of a sudden there's this difference about the velocity of a fluid over a body etc and then by the way you're no better as a swimmer in those two boxes right the difference I just want to know the percentage of people who are learning swimming whose site I just love that that's the earth I don't know if I still have them but I would love it if I did I used to journal so relentlessly about swimming

[01:59:38] I had reams of journals that I would write in every single day of my free body diagrams of my body in different swimming positions and trying to figure out ways to make this less bad when I got into this I became so obsessed that I swam twice a day every day this model makes so much sense to me well you don't actually start swimming until you reach the third box which is now you are consciously competent now the problem is you can't do that for long so you tend to vacillate a lot between the second and third box which is consciously competent and then you go back to being consciously incompetent but as long as you can maintain focus you will vacillate between those and usually it's your physical fatigue that will push you from the third box back to the second box now when you become a really good swimmer like Michael Phelps you transcend to this fourth box you are now unconsciously competent everything becomes sort of autonomic at that level now thinking about this through decisions as you were telling a story about Eric I'm thinking about the first level so let's just call it four levels now the first level is you only examine losses through the lens of luck so that's our default I would argue that takes no effort just as being unconsciously incompetent is our default layer 2 or level 2 thinking is I only examine my losses through the lens of luck and skill that's great so you're taking some responsibility responsibility only triggered by the loss then you have a level 3 which is

[02:01:14] I'll do that but I will also now examine my wins through skill and then the fourth level which I'm guessing is exactly where someone like Eric is is no I'm going to look at wins and losses through luck and skill yeah so what I would say is I think that the thing about examining wins I do think that examining wins through the lens of skill is pretty natural we don't spend a lot of time on it it's kind of an assumption of skill I would put wins down in level 1 let's put it this way I would focus more on I would actually think about it not just in terms of are you examining the quadrants that are discordant in a symmetric way so what I would say is that on the level one thinking is I leaned on the discordance on the lost side and I leaned on the concordance on the wind side and I just kind of do that naturally and I don't spend a lot of time thinking about either of them that makes sense

[02:02:18] I don't spend a lot of time thinking about either of them then I think that level two is you're still leaning on concordance on the wind side you're not examining those very much but you do start to these two examine the discordant losses right you examine the concordant losses now so you examine the the losses that are actually due to your own undoing then I'll get to the fourth level then I think that level three is

[02:02:43] I'm looking in all four quadrants so I'm looking at winds that are due to skill that are due to my good decision-making I'm looking at winds that are due to my bad decision-making I'm looking at losses that are due to my bad decision-making I'm looking at losses that are due to my good decision-making and I'm trying to I'm really trying to sort of look at those all equally where

[02:03:05] I think the fourth level comes in is when it's concordant on the wind side that you don't accept it in other words that you say I made good decisions and I won but it does not mean there wasn't a better way so let me actually start to really clean up in there and say it's not about I made a decision it was a winning decision I was positive expected value for it and so I'm done it's now I so care that I got on to what we would call the primary line of play that I really came up with the best possible solution that I could give him what I knew that I won't be satisfied with just finding out that there was concordance like I want to go beyond that on the wind side I think what we're gonna do in the show notes is literally take everything you just said and turn it into a printable one pager that every one of us should carry with us because that's that is a very elegant way to think about

[02:04:06] I promise you I've never done what you just said like I've never once had a level four thought in my life okay well first of all let me just say that I only thought about it because you gave me the levels but it's that last bit so right now I'm writing a workbook very close to finished with it we're in Chapter three I really dig into that piece which is when you have a good outcome and it turns out it's from good decisions what are you doing with that are you done or are you trying to figure out if there was even better one beyond that and here's the reason why we don't like to do that because when we think about what sort of creates the fabric of our identity our beliefs are the threads that our identity is woven out of by doing a level for thought you risk their undermining tearing a hole tearing a hole in it because one of the things that we want to do is feel like that fabric is strong like our beliefs are good and we're confident I mean this idea of competence and being able to bank credit for the way that things have turned out in our life is so core to what forms our identity that when you don't stop at my decisions were good and

[02:05:18] I had a good outcome when you actually dig around in there you're risking now turning something that was a win into a loss so this is where I love your idea of the levels so if we think about that level one like I want it must be good why wouldn't you go further than that and say well maybe I won because a bad luck you're turning a win into a loss and in this particular case we're taking win as the outcome I had a good outcome and you sort of wanted to stop there because you don't want to dig down and find out you might have made a bad decision because now you turn to win into a loss so that's where when you get to level 2 you're willing to do that you're willing to say I want a long-run win and what that means is I might have to turn this outcome that was a win into a loss when you get to level 4 what you say is ok I had a good outcome I looked and I saw that my decision-making was pretty good but now I'm willing to turn that win into a loss in order to get long-run yeah you are basically completely exposed at that point I can imagine how your book became immediate fodder for every hedge fund manager and so forth because again I think the advantage of that type of investing bears some resemblance to poker which is you can't really hide your decisions your outcomes are very clear and which is not to say there's not a huge element of luck just as there is with poker but it's basically an industry where your decisions are exposed every decision you make in the end you're going to be able to trace it to an outcome and frankly unless you're not in the business of making money you have to be wed to good outcomes so the poker player wants to do well the hedge fund manager wants to do well there's nowhere to hide I guess is what

[02:06:56] I'm trying to get at I agree in theory that there's nowhere to hide the interesting thing that I think is how long people can hide from it that's what I find so fascinating is you look at poker and you're like you're getting answers right away like you win or lose so here's the problem it's like okay at the end of the year somebody lost right but why how far are you willing to go to say I just got bad luck that's the question and I'm just really fascinated that people can go really far they can really convince themselves that they just got bad luck and I think that that's true obviously if you're running a hedge fund you have investors that you're accountable to but we all know of hedge fund managers where they had a couple of good years and then people are sticking with them it's like you have a couple good years to start there's this path dependence to this and it's true of poker like if a poker player comes out of the gate in the first six months and loses everything in sight they're very unlikely if they continue to lose they're gonna say oh I must be really bad at this but for every poker player who comes out of the gate with a terrible first six months there's a poker player

[02:08:05] I actually remember way back when a long time ago there was a new player who came on the scene and they won a World Series of Poker bracelet I mean they were really young I mean early 20s and nobody had ever heard of them before and they won and I thought oh you know that's nice because that happens right obviously then they want a second one and I was like oh that might be just the ruin of them now why would I say that if they had won a second World Series of

[02:08:31] Poker bracelet because I stood this path dependence right that if you come out of the gate and you do really well your ability to fool yourself afterwards for a very long time it becomes infinite it becomes almost infinite and you see that in the hedge fund world all the time obviously if an investor comes along and they don't show any result by the way sometimes unfairly it becomes very hard for them to recover from that sometimes unfairly because maybe they just it just went against them for that year or whatever but when it's the reverse when they come out of the gate strong you can fool yourself for a really really really really long time and that's the thing that I find so fascinating that's what really kind of lights me up and trying to figure out the capacity for self-deception is so a bottomless well is there an industry that you look at where you just see on average it is more amenable to higher level thinking the way we just described the four levels in poker like this framework is there a place where either through some externality of the way the industry is set up and the rate of time being short between decision and outcome and some sort of transparency that we have a space where there's a greater incentive to rise to that level first of all let me just say this that obviously we're only talking about places where in the shorter run luck is gonna have a strong influence so when you look at sports that are really highly under the influence of scale people are getting selected out nobody's fooling themselves well actually it was just bad luck that

[02:10:05] I didn't get to be a professional NFL linebacker I mean it might be if you got an injury but I'm five five and I weigh a hundred and thirty such bad luck that I wasn't feeling just like no I just wasn't good enough so we know that in cases where it's very transparent that if you're not doing well we can trace it back to skill so the more chess like we are the less the capacity for us to fool ourselves if I lose to you in chess it's very hard for me to say that I got bad luck because well I don't know where's the luck I don't know go find it for me there's a little bit of luck but not much so the more on the chest range of things we are the less the capacity to do this so first of all we've got to be in an environment where there's a strong short-run influence of luck now the tighter the feedback loop the more feedback you're getting the more that somebody needs to rise to the occasion so if you were to look at what's the capacity which individuals are gonna thrive more in those systems definitely the ones who are much more willing to dig in and dig around so people who are in higher frequency trading for example where those feedback loops of the time horizons are shorter I think are gonna be more likely to be thinking in this way and if they're investing their own money that's a very interesting point it's kind of missing right you gotta have skin in the game are there poker players by the way they play with other people's money and by that I mean not money that they won from somebody else but yes I see okay yeah so there's backing situations yeah there's the same thing the less we're trading on sort of reputation and the more that you're trading on your own your own dollars also I think that you're more likely to end up in a spot where you're thinking so basically you have tons of skin in the game there's a high element of luck and skill and the feedback loop is short those are three situations that will tend to push you towards either abject failure or getting better moving up the ladder of this thinking it's a little chicken and egg so I don't know is it the people who succeed are more naturally kind of more naturally tend to it that kind of thinking and obviously it gets reinforced or what would Eric do if he wasn't the best poker player in the world well I know what he would do because he was an options trader okay so again options trading you could argue that it's sort of similar right it's incredibly similar yeah it's almost the same but would he go and be a good

[02:12:27] CEO of a blue chip company like if he all of a sudden tomorrow assume he had the domain knowledge okay so he could go in and be the CEO of General Electric or Home Depot or ExxonMobil or something where you could put a chip in his head that gives him the domain expertise to understand exploration and production or whatever but could you move that industry or that company within its industry relative to its peers by bringing that layer of thinking yes so that's what that's that's kind of what I want to say is there a little bit of a in an egg issue because I have met people across industries where there are people who are thinking this way where there are people who are really hungry for it now in terms of this idea of like what are you doing when you find out those pretty good decisions and good outcomes or are you only doing post-mortems

[02:13:15] I'm not thinking about it in terms of expectancy that's a problem that you see across all industries but also across industries you see people who are really hungry to try to incorporate that into their solution space how am i dealing with this how am i running my teams so if you just take the investing world I see people who think that way all the way from people who are trading options to people who are doing seed round venture capital much different than late stage venture capital where you mike the time horizon now is faster i mean not the same speed as options but if you're like in the seed round we're talking horizons it could be a decade there are fund managers who are in long short funds where they might put on seven positions in a year you're hardly getting any data and they're they're really looking to think this way because what's interesting is that while trading options might foster this kind of thinking better because you're getting feedback more quickly while you might end up getting sort of selected out by the people who you're accountable to quicker while maybe that particular type of mind would tend to get drawn towards say options trading better the issue is that in absence of the world telling you quickly this type of thinking actually becomes much more important yeah it becomes more important and more difficult right because when you spread the feedback loops out now the way that

[02:14:41] I always think about it is uncertainty gives you the leeway to allow bias to come in and that's the difference meaning the chess and poker in chess because you've taken a lot of uncertainty away you don't have the leeway to fool yourself that is an absolute you do so we can sort of think about if you look at the different screens say trading options and something that has a much longer time horizon the longer the time horizon the more capacity you have the more leeway the world is giving you to fool yourself so then this kind of thing really thinking in this systematic way really modeling the world in this way becomes much much much more important it becomes a bigger imperative for you to be poking for you to be thinking counterfactually for you to have people challenging your ideas for you to be trying to think about am i doing this because it's status quo and if it doesn't go well I won't get blamed am i innovating enough am i allowing people to challenge my ideas and my challenging idea is myself enough am I looking at that discordant box that has to do with good outcomes or am I only willing to look at the discord when it's a bad outcome when the bad outcome is concordant am I like super excited about that or am i imagining well maybe there was a better way how am i digging into all of those spots and then if you're in a leadership role how am i propagating or am I not propagating these problems across the team am i telling the team through my actions that they should be terrified of bad results as I'm thinking about the way that the world is giving me the leeway to be able to sort of have my beliefs lead me around on a leash am i infecting my team with that same problem because now I can be creating this whole other problem and it's such a long time horizon that maybe the world is gonna tell me that this was actually problematic you should be digging into that as if you're getting the answer tomorrow as if you're playing chess and you're gonna find out right away and you should be doing everything you can to try to make sure that you don't find out you hung your rook this to me is why swimming is harder than riding a bike you can teach anybody to ride a bike relatively quickly for a couple of reasons one the feedback loop is very quick like any time you're out of balance I mean we just naturally internally our inner ears allow us to sense that disequilibrium instantaneously so you get the fastest feedback loop imaginable and the consequences are quite high it hurts significantly when you're not in balance contrary to popular belief swimming is about balance it's the exact same thing you're just happen to be in a medium that is so much more dense than air that the feedback loop is much slower and the consequences are much more gentle it doesn't hurt when you're out of balance in fact if you fell everytime on a bicycle that you were out of balance while learning to swim you'd never ride a bike again it would you be so black and blue so in that sense swimming is gentler meaning you have more excuses it's longer time horizon but it's that much more important that you do the examination so if anybody can mindlessly ride a bike very soon after being shown how to do it you can't mindlessly swim for years after learning how to swim it's that hard swimming then becomes the example of where it's more important that you bring that level of thinking if you want to make any progress I agree and let me add something to this which correct me if I'm wrong but I think this is in the same space as you're thinking it's sort of thinking about this soft landing issue the wider the skill gap between you and the people that you're competing against there's so much more cushion for a soft landing so this is something that

[02:18:28] I sort of think about is by not exploring that sure I made winning decisions and I won by not willing to go beyond that imagine if you're in a situation where let's say we're in some sort of zero-sum game so we're trading against each other and if I were making perfect decisions against you every time that we put a dollar on the table I would get a quarter but because of the decisions that I'm making every time we put a dollar on the table I'm getting a nickel so if we think about those quadrants right when I look at I have a good outcome I want a nickel and my decision-making was good because I was positive expectancy right I was winning a nickel I was winning 5% but by not exploring I don't see the 20 cents that's sitting there that I could get every single time and that's the problem with a soft landing that's the problem with having that cushion is it doesn't let you know that there's something better that you could be doing I know we got a trap because we both have to get moving but there's one topic that you very loosely I think we were going to go down the path of by name but then we didn't but I want to bring it up because it's such an important concept in my world and it's something I have done for such a long time but never had a great name for it and when I read your book I was like Oh awesome

[02:19:49] I'm gonna be plagiarizing this all day long and it's the idea of back casting oh yeah a moment ago you use the term forecasting right we're all about forecasting well I want to be doing this in q4 and therefore I need to do this today and this tomorrow and this tomorrow and I'll tell you how I use it and then I'll and let me just say for the record back casting is not a word that I coin oh all right I don't got a reference to who references someone I can say you've read about it in my book

[02:20:16] I didn't invent that word all right thank you for clarifying that so prior to reading your book I would just refer to it as reverse engineering but that never really had any resonance with people but now when I say back casting it forces me to explain the contrast between back casting and forecasting whereas reverse engineering doesn't have as striking of a contrast so the place that I use it is in understanding the exoskeleton of the body so the actual physical structural demise of ourselves so we're all sitting here thinking about exercise and everybody knows they should exercise but nobody really can give you a great reason for why we've been sitting here talking about the outliers professional athletes but outside of people who get paid to do something with their body what are the rest of us doing it's amazing how often you push people on this they can't give you a great answer and because I ask everybody under the Sun this question I'll tell you all answers basically fall into these three buckets so if you're asking someone who's not getting paid to do a sport why do you exercise 90% of the answers are I like the way it makes me look I like the way it makes me feel and I like the freedom and flexibility it gives me with what I eat some combination of those three there are other answers that show up a lot less frequently such as I love the social interaction that comes with it and things like that now I would argue all of those are fine reasons to exercise but I don't think they're good enough the good enough one only comes when you start thinking about back casting which is what do you want your body to function like the day before you take your last breath really think about this so I've taken this to an extreme and people have heard me talk about this in the podcast before but

[02:21:49] I come up with this idea of the centenarian Olympics which is instead of training for like an Olympics that's now where you would actually have to pull vault and run a hundred meters in under ten seconds think about what an Olympic Games would look like of hundred year olds and ask yourself what do you want to be able to do in that olympic game so I have like 18 things I want to be able to do when

[02:22:10] I'm 100 if I get to be a hundred and they're all quite mundane but they're all very pragmatic and practical one of them is being able to do a 30 pound goblet squat which again I could do today blindfolded on one leg a hundred thousand times but at a hundred that's actually going to be quite a task and it's important because that replicates picking up a toddler which presumably if

[02:22:31] I'm 100 I've got great grandkids I want to be able to pick them up I want to be able to stand up off the floor using no support and only a single point of my own meaning one arm and both my legs and get up off the floor without help can I do that today of course can you do that today with your eyes shut very few hundred year olds can do that so I've kind of eighteen of these things

[02:22:52] I want to be able to do and that is back casting it's going to the finish line and saying if I can do that at a hundred what was I able to do at ninety if I can do that at ninety it must have been true at sixty and did it and before you know it I realized wow if I want to do that at a hundred now that I'm 46 I actually have to be able to do all of these other things so there's this whole matrix that comes out of it that's why that concept for me just resonated so much because I really I don't think medicine spends enough time back casting yeah so let me try to add another benefit of back casting so just to be clear back casting is so when we forecast what we think is there's a goal that I would like to reach how do I get there and then generally what you're thinking or what are the things that I'm doing in order to get to this goal when you back house what you say is it's the day afterwards so I have some goal I'd like to be able to do X in a year and now it's a year and a day and I achieved my goal and what you asked now is you look back and you say how did I actually achieve this and you can also do something called a pre-mortem so a pre-mortem would be I have this goal that I'd like to achieve

[02:23:58] I'd like to achieve it in a year it's now a year in a day and I failed why did why did I fail now here is an added benefit that I would like to offer to you when we forecast when we think about here's my goal how do I get there we're thinking about the things we're doing here are the decisions that I make along the way so we're thinking about all the things that are within our decision-making power within our control that are in this sort of skill side of the equation but what happens when you back cast and you say I actually succeeded how did I get here but particularly what happens when you do a pre-mortem and you say I failed how did

[02:24:34] I get here now you will allow luck into the equation so as an example if I'm thinking about when I'm a hundred I would like to be able to do a 30 pound goblet squat which I've never heard before but now I will say that no way I learned that but I'm now a hundred it's the day I've turned 100 and I cannot do that thing why well I can think of some things like I didn't actually exercise enough but I can also think of I tripped and I fell and I broke my hip now tripped and fell that can happen to anybody probably not a matter of skill it just something can happen like you could hurt yourself but the break my hip might have to do with my bone density that's gonna cause you to explore other things that maybe wouldn't be as obvious because you saw nobody's thinking you don't see that bad luck can occur if you're not working backwards and then to your point once you work backwards you can now ask yourself some questions because you see the luck and you can say okay if it's on the good side can I increase the chances that that thing happens to me that I see is luck is gonna intervene in my way can I increase the chances that's gonna happen for me okay so you get asked that but then on the downside which is really important to explore let's say the breaking the hip saying can I decrease the chances that I break my hip yes what are the things that I could do if the answer is no then you can say well are there any hedges available to me can i hedge against this bad luck thing happening to me sometimes the answer to that is also no regardless what you can say is okay

[02:26:08] I've got my hedges set up I'm doing what I can to decrease the chances that it occurs but obviously it still could so let me think now before that bad luck intervenes what am I going to do in response because if I plan for that in advance I'm going to be making decisions right now in a commerce state of mind where I'm not pants on fire freaking out rather than being reactive what the world might deliver me at the time so if I've already thought about it if I already have a plan in place I'm not wasting time I'm gonna be much more calm

[02:26:41] I'm gonna think about it so this is one of the big difference between working forwards and working backwards is that when we work forwards and we're thinking about how do we execute on any kind of strategic plan because we can think about I want to be able to do this thing when I'm 100 and we're developing a strategic plan for how we get there we really focus on what are the things that we're gonna do that are gonna get us there and we don't say what are the ways that luck might intervene but when you work backwards you naturally start to see the luck and then you can start to explore all of these questions that then makes your strategic plan much better it makes you explore a different stuff does your workbook cover exactly this type of decision tree that we just went through yes when is this coming out a year from now so I'm just finishing up the draft now and then you have to lay it out you know how that goes with them yeah yeah so basically what I'm doing with the work because I'm taking these concepts that I talked about broadly and sort of bigger idea way and thinking in bets and

[02:27:35] I'm saying okay how do you practically make a decision how do you build out a decision tree how do you think about the way that luck might intervene how do you think about your own decision-making how do you see the luck how do you communicate with other people such that you're making sure that you're getting the purest feedback from them that you're not biasing their feedback that you're actually hungry for the information and you're seeking the feedback which is by the way the first step which most of us don't do most of us aren't seeking the feedback so where you're hungry for the feedback you're actually thinking about what is the future look like what could the outcomes be how am I going to react to those things how do I understand the the some of my experience and what that's supposed to teach me so it was really trying to think about how do I allow people who don't do this for a living who don't spend their time building out probabilistic decision trees and this is not the way that they look at the world how do I take somebody like that and show them the value and teach them how to actually think within this framework well I think that means we're gonna have to sit down and talk in about a year I hope so I want to also just say one thing just for the listeners because I would like you to put it in the show notes so I'm gonna say it right here he's doing a lot of this stuff that we've talked about with luck and skill I really want to recommend well first of all in the forecasting stuff let me just again recommend super forecasting which

[02:28:54] I know is going to end up in the show notes but there's a really really wonderful book by Michael Madison that's called the success equation and it's all about the influence of luck and skill in our lives it's got a lot of sports stuff in it but just a lot of really digging down and drilling down into understanding luck and skill and how you sort of understand what the difference is between the range of activities and sort of where you can see more influence of skill where you can see more influence of luck how you can sort of parse those apart this huge influence on our lives is luck and he really drills down into that in a way that if people are really interested in the conversation that we had today then I guarantee they would be really interested in the success equation and

[02:29:38] Malmaison also I mean you can just search him and you can see a whole bunch of videos of his where he talks about luck and skill a lot of his writing talks about luck and skill and sort of separating the two and understanding the different influences and yeah I just can't recommend that book more we'll put together a pretty robust set of notes here as we always do and it will point to everything we've spoken about plus

[02:29:59] I'm sure after the fact over the next couple of weeks you and I all have back in [ __ ] you'll think of something else that you want to hear so I'd love to make this the sort of the compendium for all these things and then of course I can't wait to sort of talk about this workbook it sounds like it's kind of an amazing tool I mean again I would say like in the last few hours I've realized that I'm not nearly as good a decision maker as even I think I am and I and I don't say that to be sort of arrogant I just think look I understand decisions at least as well as anybody else has been my bias and I'm at least as probabilistically savvy but I realize like there's tons of blind spots that

[02:30:31] I'm still experiencing and I'm not even close to approaching the potential that that a person would have to make better decisions so that said I find myself somewhat overwhelmed by complicated this is I'm already thinking like Travis is gonna put together some great tear outs that will hold us over until your book comes out but having a book that could be sort of a guidepost to a decision matrix would be fantastic and let me just for people who have listened to this and felt sort of overwhelmed it's funny because it happens to be the chapter that I'm writing right now is that it's really really good to have this framework to be thinking about decisions and to really recognize the probabilistic nature of the world and the way that things turn out for you and understanding what the structure of a really good decision is that being said that doesn't mean that you have to sit down with a slide rule for every decision that you make and in fact for the majority of decisions that you make in your life you can actually decide quite fast and what's interesting is that the way to really understand when can I decide fast is to understand this broader framework this broader framework that would allow you to take the bigger decisions in your life and actually start to think about them in this way where you're really forecasting them is actually the way to understand when can I go really fast and what it will allow you to do is stop taking 15 minutes to decide what to order in a restaurant because you have to understand this framework in order to sort of gap when you can go fast and when you can go slow because when I do talk to people about this kind of framework they do feel a little bit overwhelmed and they're like oh my gosh how am I ever gonna make a decision again like I'm gonna need a supercomputer and do it it's very few decisions that you actually need to take a ton of time on mostly you can decide fast and on the ones that are bigger decisions embracing the probabilistic nature actually gets you out of the analysis paralysis because what you realize is once you've identified your options and you've got an option that you see is better relative to the other ones you stop focusing on achieving absolute certainty and start focusing on achieving relative to the other things that I could do this one definitely looks better to me and because I recognize that there's all sorts of stuff I don't know and there's all sorts of different ways the world can turn out and as long as I'm taking the things that occur in my life and trying to learn from them in a real way I'm not going to be so terrified of sort of downside and that really frees you up you've said that so so elegantly and I think that reiterates this sort of the notion that intuitively people get it right you go fast on the straightaway and slow on the curbs this framework shows you where the curves are yeah and that frees you up to go faster in the straightaways yes and interestingly enough it frees you up relative to what you were doing before to go faster on the curves as well absolutely to not try to figure out in that moment if I don't know the exact right path to take

[02:33:26] I'm paralyzed and I just need to slam the brakes on but to recognize when well this path is gonna be good enough I'll spare all the listeners the racecar analogy that is like zooming into my cortex at the moment because there is a perfect analogy to driving around a corner in a racecar but I will spare everybody that in the show any thanks so much this was really great I really appreciate you responding to my random request to to sit down and talk about this I can't wait to do it again when the new book comes out thank you I'm excited to come back when the workbook is done but this was like an amazing conversation very different than most of the podcasts I've done so I really appreciate it that's the way we do things here we go deep you can find all of this information and more at Peter
