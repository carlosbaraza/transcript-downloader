## Description

In this episode, John Barry, historian and author of The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History, describes what happened with the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, including where it likely originated, how and why it spread, and what may have accounted for the occurrence of three separate waves of the virus, each with different rates of infection and mortality. While the current coronavirus pandemic pales in comparison to the devastation of the Spanish flu, John highlights a number of parallels that can be drawn and lessons to be learned and applied going forward.

We discuss:
-What got John interested in the Spanish flu and led to him writing his book? [2:45];
-Historical account of the 1918 Spanish flu—origin, the first wave in the summer of 1918, the death rate, and how it compared to other pandemics [10:30];
-Evidence that second wave in the fall of 1918 was a mutation of the same virus, and the immunity immunity protection for those exposed to the first wave [18:00];
-What impact did World War 1 have on the spread and the propagation of a “second wave”? [21:45];
-How the government’s response may have impacted the death toll [26:15];
-Pathology of the Spanish flu, symptoms, time course, transmissibility, mortality, and how it compares to COVID-19 [29:30];
-The deadly second wave—The story of Philadelphia and a government and media in cahoots to downplay the truth [35:50];
-What role did social distancing and prior exposure to the first wave play in the differing mortality rates city to city? [44:45];
-The importance of being truthful with the public—Is honesty the key to reducing fear and panic to bring a community together and combat the socially-isolating nature of pandemic? [46:15];
-Third wave of Spanish flu in the spring of 1919 [51:30];
-Global impact of Spanish flu, a high mortality in the younger population, and why India hit so much harder than other countries [55:15];
-What happened to the economy and the mental psyche of the public in the years following the pandemic? [59:20];
-Comparing the 2009 H1N1 virus to Spanish flu [1:02:10];
-Comparing SARS-CoV-2 to the Spanish flu [1:04:20];
-What are John’s thoughts on how our government and leaders have handled the current pandemic? [1:08:00];
-Sweden’s herd immunity approach, and understanding case mortality rate vs. infection mortality rate [1:10:40];
-What are some important lessons that we can apply going forward? [1:13:00];
-Does John think we will be better prepared for this in the future? [1:16:00]; and
-More.

## AI Summary

Here's my detailed analysis of this episode of The Drive with John Barry:

**1. Executive Summary**:
This episode discusses the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic with historian John Barry, author of "The Great Influenza." The conversation covers the pandemic's three waves, its devastating impact (killing 50-100 million people globally), and parallels to modern pandemics. Barry provides insights on public health responses, the importance of truth in communication during health crises, and lessons applicable to current pandemic management.

**2. Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- The 1918 virus had 8 gene segments, 7 avian and 1 mammalian [11:43]
- Peak age of death was 28 years old, showing unusual W-curve mortality pattern [27:22]
- Case mortality rate in Western nations was about 2%, much higher in less developed regions [31:25]
- Virus could bind to both upper respiratory tract and deep lung tissue [31:09]
- Three distinct waves occurred: Spring 1918 (mild), Fall 1918 (severe), Spring 1919 (moderate) [12:34]

**3. Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Transparency in health communication is crucial for public trust [44:08]
- Early intervention in pandemics is more effective than delayed response [45:40]

**4. Notable Quotes**:
"What we learned from history is we learn nothing from history" - Hegel (quoted by Barry) [28:20]

"People can deal with reality; they can't deal with when you let their imaginations run loose" [40:07]

**5. References & Resources**:
Books mentioned:
- "The Great Influenza" by John Barry [01:12]
- "The Natural History of Infectious Disease" by MacFarlane Burnet [23:02]
- "Guns, Germs, and Steel" referenced [22:40]

**6. Follow-up Questions**:
1. What role did genetic factors play in mortality differences between populations?
2. How might modern medical capabilities have altered the outcome of the 1918 pandemic?
3. What specific lessons from 1918 could improve future pandemic preparedness?

The episode provides valuable historical context for understanding pandemic responses and emphasizes the critical importance of honest communication during public health crises.

[00:00:03] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter Atia this podcast my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness . and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level at the end of this episode I'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to

[00:00:42] Peter Atia MD com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode welcome back to another special kovat 19 episode of the drive joining me on this episode is author and historian John berry John is the author of arguably one of the most important books I've ever read in my life the transformed cell and we talked about that very briefly at the outset but that's not the reason we speak today rather today we were discussing a book that John wrote in 2004 the New York

[00:01:12] Times bestseller the great influenza the story of the deadliest pandemic in history we talked about a lot of things here obviously related to the Spanish flu many of you have probably heard about this somewhat in the previous couple of months obviously this was on a per population basis probably the greatest pandemic in human history perhaps comparable only to the Black

[00:01:34] Plague but of course it has many parallels to the pandemic we're in now I think history will show that the current pandemic is not a fraction of the Spanish flu but nevertheless there are parallels that can be drawn this is a discussion that goes into many of the details of the pandemic which is complicated because it really had three separate waves and we get into some of the history of what may have accounted for that the other thing I found interesting about this discussion is that there were a number of things that

[00:02:04] John had changed his mind on from when he wrote the book and that to me is always the marker of a great thinker is someone who can go where the day to go and not necessarily be Wed to something they put in print and I think anybody who's ever tried to write something down and put something out there it does become a little bit harder to go back and look at that and realize that maybe you didn't look at it correctly but certainly when it comes to for example the origin of the Spanish flu Jon's thinking has changed and we and we do get into that again I'll keep the intro brief I think the discussion will speak for itself and so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with John Berry [Music]

[00:02:42] John it is such an honor to be sitting here talking with you because as I alluded to in the email when I randomly reached out to you last week you are someone whose work I've been familiar with for a very long time because a book that you wrote with my mentor Steve Rosenberg has arguably been one of the most influential books in my life the transformed cell kind of you to say

[00:03:07] I give Steve full credit for that book he didn't need me it's the only thing I've ever collaborated on in my life he was very generous and giving me credit for that but I did learn for those of you who don't know Steve we're talking about Steve Rosenberg who is it the National Cancer Institute and was one of the leading pioneers in immunotherapy developed I guess the first immunotherapy that actually worked and for cancer he also was the lead investigator on the first true gene therapy experiments in the United States and I guess the world - in terms of approval there were a couple of disapproved experiments prior to that yeah and so that book was published in 91 or 92 right yeah yes so I didn't come across it until 1997 was in my first year of medical school I read it and it's just one of those moments that I think people have once in a while in life and it just sort of changed everything for me it gave me a complete sense of how I wanted to think about the world and problem-solving and all these sorts of things and I read it probably five times when we're done with the podcast I'm going to show you my original copy because three years later

[00:04:21] I would actually get a copy from Steve signed I have since purchased a dozen copies whenever I find one on eBay or Amazon this is an embarrassing thing to admit I would insist anyone I dated read the book I just felt like they needed to understand that degree of obsession and that definitely minimized the number of dates I had to go on but it was incredible then and then as I mentioned you earlier I went and spent time with

[00:04:46] Steve in my third year of medical school and then went there for two years later and it's I still view my time at NIH as one of the most blissful periods of my life because it's a period where you could be completely immersed in trying to solve a problem and when you're at that age and you have no other responsibilities it's magical it is I haven't talked to Steve lately as you probably know eating Tony foul - your very close friends they arrived I think

[00:05:11] I'm the same day I didn't realize was that close that's interesting oh yeah they're quite tight let's talk a little bit about how that you basically got a doctorate level course in immunology in the late 80s early 90s and then a little over a decade later you would go on to write arguably the greatest account of the Forgotten pandemic how did you get interested in the Spanish flu well first

[00:05:34] I don't think that's a high bar there aren't that many books about Japan so I would hope but you'd say the greatest on the German considering the port city of competition it's a funny thing I wanted to write a book and go into this and one of the acknowledgments but there were four different acknowledgments as things developed the first was what initially came up then there was one to update it for h5n1 then there was one to update it for 2009 span

[00:06:04] Demick which was barely registered and then there was one at the hundredth anniversary in 2018 hundreds in of it so this story may have been erased for a space in the interim but initially I wanted to write a book on the homefront World War one culminating in the events in 1919 which I consider one of the most interesting years in American history I knew exactly how I wanted to approach that subject it was a very very big book and as a writer I live on my advance that my prior book rising tide was a best-seller but best sellers are not necessarily as lucrative some people think I was living on in advance and I didn't think I could get in advance the book the way I conceived it would have been take him in seven years at least maybe a little longer you just figure how much it costs to live decently for seven years plus pay your research expenses and you're talking about a lot of money I didn't think I could get an advance that large for that book but I thought I could write a book on the pandemic which interested me in probably two years and no more than two and a half years I drafted a proposal and gave it to my agent then I changed my mind to him I didn't want to write the book but an editor approached him after a story in The New Yorker appeared about digging up bodies to try to reconstruct the virus or find the virus anyway they made an offer which I didn't accept if I'd wanted to write the book it would have been enough I got mad at my age and I told him I didn't want to write the book then another editor came along and offered more money I thought well that's too much money for a book I can write in two years that will help me support the other ones I accepted the problem was it took me seven years a little over that the same advance divided by seven is a lot less than the advance divided by two so at the end I was looking at life as a graduate student for the first five and a half years that I was working on the book I wanted to throw the whole thing out the window Oswald Avery one of the characters in the book kept me going

[00:08:13] Avery came up with one of the most consequential discoveries in any science of the 20th century arguably the single most important one he discovered that DNA carried the genetic code solving that problem which actually grew out of his research on influenza and pneumonia put him through hell for 25 years and a nervous breakdown didn't publish for more than a decade and think you know what he went through kind of made what I was going through almost trivial and I would think of him almost every day finally after five and a half years book sort of came together and I was obviously happy with what I produced at the end and the reception it got it is a beautiful book and I probably read it in 2007 so that would have been probably about three years I guess after it came out and truthfully this is another very embarrassing story about six months ago

[00:09:10] I realized I just had too many books and I needed to start just getting rid of him giving him away I got tell me you threw mine out or gave it away I did I donated it to a library I got rid of literally 80% of the books I had and I remember doing this like six months ago kind of flipping through books and it's like a trip down memory lane I don't know if you've ever done this but you go through and if you're one of these guys like me who hoards books you go through and you think god I remember I read like and sometimes for me it's like I have a photographic memory I can say like our photographs the wrong word but sort of a temporal memory where I can say I remember reading this in November of 2006 and I remember what I was doing and

[00:09:49] I read this on a vacation here in blah blah blah and so it was actually a very cool experience going through and doing that but yeah the irony of it is about six months ago I'm sort of thumbing through my paperback copy of your book and it's like yeah this is a great one but you know what if I read it again

[00:10:04] I'll just do it on audible and maybe I'll have to go back and buy another copy so I can I think the events are the last couple of months have reminded us of the importance of that so I thought a lot about how much I want there's so much I want to talk with you on this topic John it's it's something that I think is relevant to where we are today which is I guess April 15th but it's going to be an equally relevant discussion a year from now and it would have been a very relevant discussion a year ago if we'd had it and if we'd known how important it would have been to learn from it but let's assume for a moment that most the people listening to this either aren't familiar with the story or maybe haven't read your book and let's start at the beginning because we're talking about a virus a swine flu virus so it's different from the virus that's on everybody's mind today which is a corona virus this is a different class of virus but a comparable idea in that it's a virus that originates in a pig in this case well acts like that well I was about to say actually I say I actually do want to touch on today the difference between what you thought at the time which is where this originated in

[00:11:07] Haskell County in Kansas and I know that in the previous couple of years you've actually come to another point of potential view on that so I want to touch on that but is that a good a place as any to start sure okay sure well I guess we could provide some more background the 1918 pandemic virus respiratory virus dumped from animals to people we don't know what animal jumped from the influenza virus has a separate gene segments as of the most viruses most organisms have a genetic code it carried on a continuous single strand whether it's RNA for a lot of viruses or

[00:11:43] DNA for some viruses and more advanced organism but we know seven of those eight gene segments are avian one looks like it was mammalian not necessarily a pig so we don't really know what mammal it passed through and we're not certain that it passed through a mammal at all so to designate it as swine flu I'm not sure I'd agree in fact there's very good evidence that people gave the 1918 virus to swine rather than the other way around but I mean said that the pandemic killed between 1500 million people you adjust for population that's 220 to 440 million people today it killed two-thirds of them and are markedly sort of short period of time generally 14 or 15 weeks from late

[00:12:34] September through December 1918 it was a very mild spotty first wave in the spring of 1918 which did not spread worldwide and was very hit-or-miss in the countries that did hit then there was a third wave in 1919 I began in February yes extended through the spring and that's basically the story of the pandemic in very very short order so let's go back to the Haskell County

[00:13:03] Kansas we're in the final year of World War one so we're kind of latter part of the winter or early part of the spring 2018 and some doctors there kind of noticed something right right the first report anywhere in the world any language that I could find of a lethal form of influenza was actually in Pasco County Kansas southwestern western part of the state near the Texas border there was a very astute physician in that County named Laureen ina who reported this lethal form of influenza to the US Public Health Service although that account was not actually published until April you know I found the record you know since it was a the only report in the spring in public health reports I decided to check out the weekly newspapers figuring there would be some delay in publishing the report and found out there was several months delay anyway you could trace by name people whose families had someone suffering from pneumonia who went from there to

[00:14:13] Fort Riley for training as soldiers or visiting somebody there you several people by name and they arrived in early March and like clockwork right after their arrival a couple of days the first reports of influence in that camp so I thought that might be a site of origin in rural Kansas and actually published a scientific article in the journal translational medicine which was run by

[00:14:42] Franco Marinko whom you may know I knew Franco very well you know okay close friend of mine still is and that actually got some attention and had some credibility with some but since the book was published and since that article was published there's been a lot of research on influenza we found out that China actually did not have a grievous experience in 1918 so best based on the fact that they did not suffer huge numbers of deaths and it strongly suggests that there was prior exposure to that virus so I think it's more likely that it started in China there are other hypotheses out there including

[00:15:25] Vietnam and France for that matter France in 1915 we will never know where it actually did start at any rate roughly half the army camps in the US were infected in the spring even though not very many civilian communities were although New York City and Chicago were Los Angeles didn't suffer a single influenza death in the spring the studies that were contemporary there are several numerous ones both in the United States and

[00:15:53] Britain by Nobel laureate named MacFarlane Burnet in Australia these studies all concluded that it was most likely that influenced who was carried to Europe by American soldiers in the spring of 1918 that happened to be a pre mild wave we're not a lot of deaths wasn't noticed at all in any civilian community in the United States at the time retrospectively there have been some that have been identified and over the course of the summer my speculation is that the virus mutated became much more virulent and in mid-september it's simultaneously in lethal form at

[00:16:38] Africa and Boston but actually the first lethal wave of the influenza occurred in Switzerland that was noted in July there was a US military intelligence report from Switzerland which said this disease is being called influenza but it's actually the black death of the Middle Ages can we pause there for a second John and put this in some context so we talked about sort of the sort of pandemics to end all pandemics and I just want to kind of put this in context is it safe to say that the bubonic plague of the 14th century if my memory recalls is the greatest pandemic of them all yeah easily in terms of proportion of the population who were killed an estimated quarter to a third

[00:17:26] Europe the subtitle of my book is the deadliest pandemic in history and that's true in the sense of the numbers of people killed but as a percentage of the population there's no doubt plague of the Middle Ages killed many many more than in quantity so do you think that the same virus that killed a reasonable number of people starting in Haskell

[00:17:51] County is the same and by the way that's the same virus that probably went to France with the soldiers do you think that is the same virus that came back in October of 2018 and as you pointed out basically knocked out 2/3 of its victims or do you think it was a totally different virus well I think the evidence is overwhelming that it's the same virus it's a staggering mutation between these two right there are people

[00:18:19] I respect or at least one word it's not so much that they think it's different virus they're yet to accept the fact that it's the same virus I can go into detail as to why I'm convinced it's the same virus if you like I would love that ok number one in New York City there was a careful study of the spring outbreak even though relatively few people died it was exactly the same signature of demographics which is very unusual for influenza 1918 the peak age for death was 28 it's a so-called W curve usually influenza kills the very young and the elderly that was not the case in the spring and it was not the case in the fall and both of those patterns are highly unusual that's number one number two in fact I actually did write a article for journal infectious disease on this the first wave exposure was very protective against second wave illness a couple of NIH epidemiologists helped me write that paper alone assignments in and cecile the bloob very good the d me ologist on influenza the first wave provided between 59 percent and 89 percent protection against illness that compares to a vaccine today which in the last 20 years has ranged from 10 percent to 62 percent protection so it's much better than a modern vaccine number three when they reconstructed the virus and stuck it in ferrets it was highly lethal much more so than any other influenza virus sorry John that's from the first batch meaning the first wave no they reconstructed the genome Geoff tobon burger sequenced the genome by extracting it from slides from lung tissue the Armed Forces

[00:20:10] Institute of Pathology he's now at NIH taken from patients who died in the first wave or the second wave second wave well actually he's now found that's another reason he's now found a sample as early as May which is the same virus ah well that would be the most compelling of all of these things correct well I mean just the perhaps I think the epidemiology demographics

[00:20:36] I think the immune protection it afforded is pretty compelling evidence particularly the immune protection but certainly the fact that they've got of a sample from a which is the same virus that's pretty good evidence as well interestingly in terms of immune protection the first way protected against the second way but need the first nor second wave exposure protected against the third wave which started in

[00:21:01] February 1919 will gonna include a bunch of figures to accompany this podcast John because I think that as you describe these things I mean those of us who spend time reading about it can picture what you're describing which are these three Peaks you've got this first little peak in the spring of of 18 and then it's if you just saw it by itself it would look devastating just based on the absolute numbers but then it is soda

[00:21:25] Wharf tin a relative sense by what comes about in September to December of that same year which I mean basically is like Everest next to Kilimanjaro and then you do have a third peak which is even bigger than the first peak probably by 3x that takes you into 2019 so I want to come back to sort of implications of that as we go forward but one of the things about this that is interesting when we look back is we don't think of the world as being very connected in 1918 there were no airplanes you had to cross by ship and do all of these things you just wouldn't think that this thing could go as much as it did and yet there are some really nice videos out there that show you a temporal view of where infections popped up over time and it's kind of amazing how quickly that second wave grows what is your sense of the movement of the second wave of that how did it and it maybe we can just for simplicity focus on the United States but I do want to come back and understand places like India that we're just decimated first you don't need steam power to move a pandemic in the 1600s influenza managed to cross the

[00:22:40] Atlantic Ocean and devastate Virginia in Massachusetts not to mention the Native American population Guns Germs and Steel is sort of a great example of this you know right or better than Guns Germs and Steel you've got McNeill and then you've got one of my favorite books of all time which I highly recommend to everyone by

[00:23:02] MacFarlane Burnet I mentioned him earlier Nobel laureate called the natural history of infectious disease which is just an incredibly good book and quite accessible to a layperson so we were talking about timing my guess is the virus seeded itself largely around the world and then erupted takes a while to get a pandemic started but once it got going it was moving pretty fast although the the army which has very good data and had great epidemiologists in their study which wasn't published until the 1930s they had tremendous amounts of data took Wow to assemble at all and publish it they said that in their army camps beginning in late July and early August in retrospect they could identify a steadily increasing uptick in pneumonia in the camps which if they put it on a graph was that essentially a log advance whatever the appropriate terminology is to describe that increase and then it erupted of course and this was the notice in their camps independent of the return of the virus to the United States which first occurred in Boston and enabled facility essentially enable barracks and then spread to Camp Devon's which is about I guess 30 miles northwest of Boston maybe a little more than that where that was the first army camp that really exploded with the deadly form of the disease how much was the transition of the first of the second wave and the propagation of the second wave made worse by the war I mean I'll start on pointing out the two issues one is just the proximity and physical nature of war and prior and sort of the fact that soldiers could become such effective conduits and vectors but also in terms of the media's response to this or the government response to this well in terms of the government response to its major I'll talk about that in a second terms of war spreading the pandemic I think it accelerated it's a little bit maybe by a few weeks or something like that the outbreak in New York City for example preceded any outbreak in army camps it's also another reason why I've backed off my Haskell hypothesis Haskell did precede New York City by a couple of weeks but it's hard to figure out how it would have gotten from Haskell in New

[00:25:34] York City although it certainly could have happened anyway with New York having a well-defined spring outbreak and Chicago also it's pretty clear it would have gotten any everywhere eventually and sooner rather than later and whether you have ten people getting off a ship from New York to England or France or whether you have a few thousand soldiers getting off a ship really doesn't make that much difference in spreading the pandemic just difference in timing but with an reproductive number close to two you catch up pretty fast even if you start with one index case much last ten or twenty so I think the war accelerated the spread but I don't think it's responsible for the spread it just happened a little bit faster in terms of the other question about the response that was a major factor and I think the death toll possibly certainly in the fear and in some cases chaos that was generated the government had created this infrastructure because of the war the federal government I believe more than any other time in its history including the McCarthy period or the

[00:26:51] Civil War was determined to control the thought of Americans and they had a law that made a punishable by 20 years in jail if you to quote utter right print or publish any disloyal scarless or profane language about the government in the United States so you could curse the government you just broke the law they weren't kidding about this they actually sent a congressman to jail for 15 years under the law this was upheld by the

[00:27:22] Supreme Court it's where the line came about you can't shout fire in a crowded theater that came from that Supreme Court decision upholding that law they also had a propaganda arm called the committee for Public Information which was determined to quote keep morale up unquote and the architect of that committee said truth and falsehood are arbitrary terms there's nothing and experience tells that one is superior to the other when I had to say all that mattered was the impact what if you're saying so that propaganda arm was going to minimize anything that might depress the American public because they feared that would affect the war effort so the pandemic fitted into this construct by the way that makes me feel not so bad about the world we live in today it suggests that history can repeat itself and maybe the pendulum can swing back a bit I go around quoting

[00:28:20] Hegel everybody quotes sandiana I like Cagle Hegel said what we learned from history is we learn nothing from history contrary anyway as a result of this approach to maintaining morale in quotes a national public health leader said this is ordinary influence by another name it was referred to as Spanish

[00:28:45] Influenza even though it didn't start in Spain another national public hell leader said if you have nothing to fear if product or precautions are taken but people pretty soon and throughout the country most localities the local public health commissioner echoed these approaches the press was complicit it was fake news because they were not reporting the truth because they were only saying nice things but everybody knew it wasn't influenza by another name ordinary influence by another name there were deaths in less than 24 hours at the

[00:29:20] Fuhrer symptoms that was unusual but it certainly happened what was the typical course I mean you mentioned that the are not reproductive number approached to which made it more contagious even than garden-variety influenza but it's real superpower was not that it was a more aggressive spreader it's the actual pathology of the disease that's probably its superpower and I used that term horribly because evolutionarily that's not a superpower for a virus a superpower virus would kill nobody would have an R naught of infinity and kill no one that would be the best virus if you were thinking about it from Darwin's point of view but this was a deadly virus what was the typical clinical course the typical course was was ordinary influenza but in the West the case mortality was about 2% much worse than that in the less developed world not because the Western medicine was any better but because in the West a lot people had some cross protection from having been exposed to other influenza viruses and in the less developed world that was not the case they were quote virgin populations unquote naive immune systems but the 1918 virus like coronavirus but unlike most influenza viruses could bind to cells in the upper respiratory tract which made it easily transmissible but it also could bind directly to cells deep in the lung which meant you were starting out essentially with viral pneumonia those were the awful pathologies where some of the symptoms in the book I quote one physician writing a colleague that people were turning so dark-blue from lack of oxygen that he couldn't distinguish colored soldiers from white soldiers in african-american

[00:31:09] I'm quoting him that of course spread rumors of the Black Plague when people's pallor turned so in that color and that virus also unlike most influenza viruses could pretty much attack any organ it was initially misdiagnosed as typhoid as dengue this cholera nosebleed was quite common in some army camps they reported 15% of soldiers had nose bleed it was also possible for people to bleed from their mouths and from even their eyes and ears which are of course other mucosal membranes that's pretty scary particularly for a layperson so to be told this is ordinary influenza by another name when you're seeing symptoms like that and you're seeing people die rapidly it gets your attention and what it means is you stopped trusting anything that you're being told by anyone in authority I think society is based on trust when Trust evaporates society begins to fray and in some places it got pretty bad there were reports of people starving to death not because of lack of food but because no one had the courage to bring them food this happened in cities like

[00:32:26] Philadelphia which I focused on in the book but also according to Red Cross reports of that things like that happening and we're all communities occurred as well the story of Philadelphia's interesting one tonight I really want to come back to it as a case study and then contrast it with other cities obviously you contrast it quite eloquently with st. Louis but also San

[00:32:45] Francisco and others I want to talk about that but going back to the pathology of this illness it really seems like I mean typical influenza you get a little bit of a I think of it as sort of it you stun the immune system you get this immune paralysis that can often result in a superimposed bacterial infection and all of these other things that come to bear and anybody therefore who's susceptible to super infection meaning people who are hospitalized already in the kamil environment I mean those things sort of become problematic but as you pointed out there was something really distinct about this pattern a victim here especially in 1918 in that second cohort which is this was knocking off people in their 30s the way we would normally see people dying in their 70s and 80s and the idea being here that it was peak age for death was 28 suggesting that the stronger your immune system was the worse you are exactly the same thing people are dying of today acute respiratory distress syndrome your immune system releases as you know cytokines which the immune system has some very lethal weapons the virus when it was in the lung the immune system attacked it with everything it had and the battlefield was along which was being essentially wiped out in the effort to destroy the virus exactly the same thing is happening today and those people who are dying of coronavirus now

[00:34:12] I will say probably a majority of people in 1918 died of secondary bacterial pneumonia there are some people who think that 95 percent of the deaths were bacteria on pneumonia I think that is mistaken it's difficult to quantify how much was bacterial pneumonia and how much was directly because of the virus my guess would be 1/3 to 40% would be directly a virus but that's a guess I certainly think it's a lot more than 5% as some have hypothesized and just the anecdotal reports from very good pathologists suggest that that was not the case and even today bacteria and pneumonia following influence as in a percent case fatality rate with all the antibiotics we have back then it was 35% that's actually unbelievable I didn't realize it was that high today by the way 8 percent today seems a pretty high number but to your point these people are already incredibly compromised based on what they've been through to get there so let's go to Labor Day 2018 set the stage again just remind people where we are you had this awful virus that ripped through the

[00:35:30] United States in some pockets in the spring it killed what maybe 25 50 thousand Americans by that point I've never put a number on that or seen a number on that it's really hard to say yeah I mean directionally it's like less than 1/10 of the total population that would ultimately die which was about 650,000 and Americans correct roughly yeah 676 50 is 675 or the numbers that

[00:35:57] I've seen yeah so now fast forward we've just enjoyed a summer of relatively low mortality domestically the virus of course has been doing something else abroad I don't think people realize it at the time but the war is about two months from being over right that was not common knowledge like diverse people were gearing up for Spring Offensive in 1919 and the war and in Philadelphia they need to raise money there's a bond that basically the government has to borrow money and there's no better way to sort of do this than to kind of showcase what the money is gonna buy you and have a parade right correct and fact that wasn't us Philadelphia was around the country September 28th there was a

[00:36:42] Liberty loan parade a lot of cities but in Philadelphia by then the virus had already established itself and the medical community was unanimous that the parade should be canceled they were right in telling reporters this reporters were writing stories about it editors were killing the stories as I said earlier the press was largely complicit with the morale-boosting approach that the government took the local public health commissioner was part of a corrupt political machine he's a perfectly good person but didn't have the backbone to stand up to it and tell you how corrupt that machine was it elected a United States Senator a few years later and the Senate controlled by the same party refused to seat the guy that's pretty corrupt when the US Senate won't seat somebody wins an election when he's a member of the party that controls the Senate anyway the parade went forward and pretty much like clockwork 48 72 hours later influenza exploded in Philadelphia became one of the hardest hit cities in the country within three weeks 4,500 are dead I something like that in total about 14,500 over the course of pandemic and get back to the press to tell you how complicit they were it's when they finally close schools banned public gatherings closed saloons theaters no church services stuff like that one of the local papers actually said this is not a public health measure you have no cause for alarm unquote I mean how stupid did they think people were but that contributed to the breakdown of society contributed to the fear and the terror when you can't believe anything you're being told and obviously by then everybody know perfectly well that was a public health measure people were dying all on them how did that information get around because obviously we take for granted today how electronic information basically I mean it creates so much noise that it's hard to know this signal but back then you had a very different problem which is if you lived in Los

[00:38:56] Angeles at that time what would be telling you that people are dying like flies in Philadelphia if the formal media is not doing anything about it well you wouldn't necessarily know what was happening in Philadelphia particularly back then because it's funny I didn't write a lot about Phoenix in the book but I it was too redundant with what it happened in Philadelphia a little bit different but I did a lot of research in Phoenix and interestingly when the disease first hit Boston they were writing about it when it was in New

[00:39:30] Orleans they were writing less about it when the disease was actually in Phoenix you could not find a word about it in the Phoenix paper you know on page 14 they had a death notice of somebody that was about it there was not in the headlines hardly ever so it was strictly rumor and again that contributed to the level of fear you didn't know what was going on which gets into maybe to jump ahead or or not when the Bush administration started the pandemic preparedness planning and the

[00:40:07] Bush administration launched a major initiative seven billion dollar bill that did all sorts of things vaccine technology investment research create vaccine manufacturing began the national stockpile anyway I was asked to participate some of the early groups which were coming up with so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions what are you doing you don't had drugs and my message in these groups was always at the step one is to tell the truth that people can deal with reality they can't deal with when you let their imaginations run loose that's when you really get into trouble if you give them the straight facts that it's much easier to handle in a monster movie it's always scarier before the monster appears on the screen imaginations are very powerful things let's go back to Philadelphia I've seen video footage of what can only be described as horrifying because as terrifying is an uncertain I guess as the last couple of months have been with respect to the unknowns around the coronavirus when you look at morgues that can't accommodate corpses and when you also understand how little people understood about microbiology at the time and so they know enough to know that this is contagious they know enough to know this is respiratory contagious but as you pointed out there's a breakdown in society from not knowing how and when and if you can help someone else and what do you do when someone dies I mean there are these stories of bodies that just were left out on the street because the risk of actually having to go out and take care of a body and dispose of it could potentially expose you to more and I mean to me that's again 14,000 deaths doesn't sound like an enormous number I mean New York will likely eclipse that New York City obviously adjusted for population

[00:42:00] Philadelphia would have been more and time but it's in part the speed with which it happened and also just the fear of who's next and I think the other thing is seeing these young people dying in a way that you just you aren't used to I guess if I'm gonna play devil's advocate for a moment without the benefit of hindsight is there an argument that one could make that says look the public health officials or the people who should have been doing the right thing didn't want to create an unnecessary panic in the other direction without knowing more I'm sure this is an argument that you've heard a hundred times what is the counterpoint to that if there is one as you say that's the counter-argument but I think I already articulated the argument in favor the truth number one the imaginations more powerful and number two if you ever expect the public to do something you want the public to do you better have credibility and once you lose credibility you can't regain it if you start out telling the truth even by the way when the truth is we don't know I mean to me that's the biggest challenge the government has right well that's okay too yeah if you say we don't know and but we'll know when this test is performed and we have the results you can go down the line as to why you don't know and you can then say when we will know so you provide information and you can retain your credibility even if you don't know I think that's the only way to go my standard line is I don't like the phrase risk communication because it implies managing the truth you don't manage the truth you tell the truth you know I would be in these working groups and I mention da Henderson earlier da and I became friends because we were always in agreement that seemed that in these groups sometimes opposed by others but on that one point of telling the truth I never got any pushback from any of these groups I participated in the

[00:44:08] National pandemic plan which was the outgrowth of those working groups certainly incorporates the idea of transparency as does every state plan the problem is someone has to go out and execute that pandemic plan someone has to go out face the camera and tell the truth obviously that has not happened there are other countries where it has happened including Germany which has done light years ahead of us in ending coronavirus or Singapore and no doubt other countries just not in the United

[00:44:46] States going back to the Philadelphia Story how would you contrast that with what happened in st. Louis which you use as a counterpoint well st. Louis intervene very early in terms of what we call social distancing now and at least partly as a result of that they had a much more benign experience than most other cities on a per capita basis it's not clear to me that a hundred percent of that is attributable to social distancing we don't know nobody's ever looked the informations ascertainable but I didn't have time to do the research whether or not they had a spring wave for example which I am convinced I think you've demonstrated did provide protection against the fall wave in New York City for example didn't do anything they did less than any other city they didn't close schools they didn't close saloons they didn't close theaters and into anything and yet New

[00:45:40] York City had a relatively benign experience I think because of its spring wave same thing in Chicago now whether that was true in st. Louis I don't know but st. Louis did act early and aggressively in terms of social distancing measures they were less extreme than what we're doing now but they were imposed early and early actions very important if you do it before the virus is widely disseminated and the community can be effective if you wait until people start dying all around you by then the virus is everywhere and those measures are not going to be nearly as effective if they're effective at all

[00:46:22] San Francisco had some interesting policies right weren't they so strict on how they enforced masks that the police had authority to shoot a person in public who is not wearing a mask I miss that you cannot you're wrong they did require by law people where master were several cities that did that the thing that makes San Francisco interesting they were the only place I know of that really did tell the truth I'm sure there must have been at least some other places certainly I didn't study every wall of one hundred biggest cities in the country but in San Francisco the mayor labor leaders business leaders medical community all made a joint statement huge type full page in the newspaper where I'm asking save your life now that is a very different message then this is ordinary influenza by another name you have nothing to fear of proper precautions to take so wear a mask and save your life this is a life-threatening disease and you better take action they honestly believe the max were the effect of they did next to nothing or probably nothing in San Francisco actually suffered forgot the exact number but they were fourth or fifth highest excess mortality in the country but what that message did do was secure the community the community did trust what the leaders were telling them in the community instead of frame as a society in some cases almost breaking down in San Francisco that City functioned better than any other place that I know of in the sense that for example when schools were closed teachers volunteered as ambulance drivers whatever was needed as opposed to running and hiding which was happening in other cities where the leadership lied and as a result people felt it was everybody for himself or herself or their families in the hell with the community so after the pandemic despite the fact that San Francisco had a very high death toll the Chronicle wrote an editorial saying that in our long history the city despite the tragedy this will be one of the most glorious episodes in our history because of the way the community came together and function I don't know of another city anywhere that could made a claim like that which is really a counterintuitive claim when you think about both the general statement one would make about pandemics which is unlike natural disasters acts of war and terrorism pandemics tend to divide people not unite them due to the isolation and fear and then secondly this pandemic happens to be the worst of the bunch you'd think that if anything this would have decimated communities and yet you have this counter example do you think it is this culture of abject honesty from the outset that played them main role in that I think that was accurate I think in most disasters people do come together I live in New

[00:49:32] Orleans and I well that's what I'm saying most disasters yes I'm saying but there's something unique about these pandemics that people talk about saying no actually these do more harm than good in terms of social cohesion well you know if you look back at the plague and so forth in the Middle Ages the terror that was out there a quarter third of population being killed yeah I would say that's true plus the unknown factor so you had everything working against you and the black death I think it's almost like a control experiment supporting my hypothesis that telling the truth is the best way to go and that it can pull people together and make even a pandemic and even in a pandemic people function as they do in other disasters trying to help each other the reality is I can't prove it quantitatively but in terms of anecdotally I'm in the French Quarter which is deserted there not a heck of a lot of full-time residents in the French

[00:50:35] Quarter there are some but people around here neighbors whom I don't really know a few blocks away asking me if my wife and I go for walks they're asking if there's anything they can do for me a couple of people were younger I'm over 70 so it's my wife yeah that volunteered to get groceries for us I have a neighbor next door who's a dentist who immediately went to his office and donated all his masks and gloves to a local hospital he's unusual and was also in the sense that he did a medical rotation with interns in addition to his dental school so he's volunteered to go to hospitals and perform procedures that he's capable of doing and take some of the stress off health care workers which of course exposes himself to a lot of risk

[00:51:24] I get the sense around here that people are coming together again it's anecdotal and it's very localized even if I'm right but that's the attitude nationally that's a pretty big plus what a pivot for a second and talk about two things we can do them in either order you prefer one is I want to visit India a little bit because I was kind of astonished at the mortality in India it's almost hard to fathom and then the second unrelated thread is really the I don't know much I don't recall much about the factors between the second and the third wave so in either order you want to talk about those as we continue through this journey well we can go and either order you want and because it may be a short discussion let's stay on the domestic thread and talk about how much of the dying down of the second wave before the resurgence of the third because it doesn't appear to have been just seasonal or do you think that the seasonality was the main driver of that no I very definitely do I think it's seasonality

[00:52:28] I think the virus change as I said earlier either first or second wave exposure seemed to protect against the third wave so that suggests a reasonably dramatic shift and the virus and what is referred to as you well know antennae drift I should have said drift instead of shift and they yelled of influenza that's actually a meaningful term of art

[00:52:53] I can't prove that come to think of it I don't believe that Jeff table and burger who's the one who's done to all the sequencing of old viruses I don't know that he's got a viral sample from 1919 maybe he does I should ask him to be very interesting by then most of his samples not all of them but most of his samples came hard to the army by the spring of 1919 that probably weren't that many soldiers I have influenza they would been discharged so they may not have samples so I think the virus drifted enough to escape the immune system it was lethal by any standard 1919 was lethal by any standard except the fall wave in 1918 it was the second worst year of the century or that we know of in terms of influenza deaths what was the morale of the country like at that point when you have no reason to believe this isn't going to continue indefinitely I sometimes find it interesting to try to imagine going back in time not knowing how the story ends and thinking how could you concoct a story here that is really frightening and to me it would be as you're in the midst of the third killing wave this is the new norm probably most Americans were relatively unaware of the first wave at all so to them it probably was the second killing away that doesn't take away from the point you're making and honestly I don't know in the book I was trying to focus if you ask me what I write about I will tell you I write about power I may be the only person who sees it that way the influenza book in terms of characters that I was trying to focus on the scientists because they were the ones who had power to confront pandemic and to her lesser extent actually I focused on the politicians because they affected the course of the pandemic by lying to the public and so forth so I did not spend much time well particularly I didn't look at newspapers and things like that for for sources because that was vague knows back then because they were working with the government to minimize things the war ended there are so many other things going on I don't really know the answer to your question certainly there was concern I don't get the sense from the little research that I did in the area there was a kind of terror erupting that accompanied the second way but I really don't know and what to make of India about 20 million fatalities in India correct at least in fact the original estimate of the death toll which was in 1927 studied by the American Medical

[00:55:37] Association a guy named Edward Jordan infectious disease expert looked at the entire world and they originally estimated 21 point 7 million people died that was largely because they extrapolated the case mortality rate from the West where they had semi-good data to the rest of the world which turned out to be wrong my speculation is clearly those populations that had not seen in the influenza viruses before had terrible mortality forget about case mortality and isolated island in the

[00:56:11] Pacific Western Samoa 22% of the entire population died 9 case mortality 22 percent the entire population and with that's a very good number we know exactly how many people died there in India it's hard to imagine that that country had not been exposed to influenza viruses throughout the country and yet I can't think of another possible explanation for their tremendous death toll and you can look at British Army you've got Indian troops in the same camp as Caucasian British troops and the case mortality for the

[00:56:49] Caucasians is 9% in a case mortality for the Indians at the same place at the same time is over 20% and it's not because medical care was any different cuz medical care didn't make any difference all they could do was supportive care and keep you hydrated that was about it maybe I see you down if you had a fever there could have just been genetic differences there could have been certain things about the way this virus binds maybe this was a virus that could have disproportionately affected

[00:57:21] Southeast Asians potentially more than Caucasians just based on properties of how the virus worked or to your point which i think is seemingly the more Lodge the Occam's razor here would be just a difference in immune preparedness exactly the naive immune system but we don't really know I've seen epidemiological studies which ranges high is thirty million in India but I haven't really seen a good hypothesis at explaining why all told about four to five percent of the world's population died that sound about right well you can do the math it's pretty simple 1.8 billion people so 50 million dead would be about two and a half percent roughly 100 million would be about five percent the thing is two thirds of the dead were aged 18 to 45 so when you look at that demographic yeah that's a staggering impact on life expectancy yeah an aggregate life expectancy yeah and particularly when you throw in the period short period of a few months during which most of those people died and then you go into other narrower demographics and according to

[00:58:37] Metropolitan Life over three percent of all the factory workers in that age group died not case mortality 3 percent of the entire population of factory workers and that age group died in the period of weeks pregnant women there are a whole series of studies which range from 21% to 71% case mortality miners according to Metropolitan Life over 6 percent of all miners in that age group died again in a very narrow period and it's even shorter than that 14 or 15 weeks because influenza would pass through a particular community anywhere from 6 to 10 weeks so the time frame is very compressed when people are dying so it was a pretty horrific period to live through the the question it might be a little bit of outside of your area of expertise but oh great eight happy to pontificate something I know nothing well you might why did we roll into the 1920s with an enormous economic tailwind and not hit a depression until a decade after this pandemic when you would think that something that knocks out that much of a country's population would have actually precipitated the economic downturn immediately following this like why is it that by the time this thing rolls to an end in 1919 1920 the country managed to resolve itself economically was that more on account of the war being over like what do you attribute this to if any thoughts there actually was a recession that was fairly deep but very short-lived right after the war and indeed after World War two there was a lot of planning and anticipation of the same thing happening after World War two it didn't happen after World War two it did happen after World War one but again it was brief you're talking about four million soldiers or more plus however many were in the in the Navy suddenly thrown back into the work force so there was great dislocation and unemployment but it was pretty brief you had pent up demand you had an adjustment as factories went back to making civilian products instead of tanks ships so there was a dislocation but then it did pick up in terms of the attitude culture people usually ask me what impact I thought the pandemic had again it's very difficult to quantify or be precise about my own senses people understood it was there it was part of their consciousness I think it may have contributed to the sense of ennui in the 20s that party today cuz who knows what's happening tomorrow in 1933 when the Nazis rolled into the Germany into

[01:01:30] Berlin Christopher Isherwood world Berlin stories from which a great movie Cabaret came he said you could feel it like influenza in the bones so he expected his readers to understand that sense of dread deep within you that you get just from seeing the Nazis show up I think that analogy the fact that he made it is a powerful statement by the same token there is very little that was written about it John Dos Passos one of my favorite writers got influenced on a troopship it was a pretty bad place to get it and he hardly mentioned it in any of his novels it was just not that much written about it which is a puzzlement not only to me but to a lot of other people in 2009 when h1n1 was coming I'm guessing your phone was ringing a lot yes what was the fundamental difference from a viral adji standpoint between the 2009 h1n1 swine flu and let's just think about the second wave version of that same virus well the reality 2000 I was very very strange because it was almost two entirely different diseases the overwhelming majority of people who got sick had a relatively mild case of influenza but for those who were seriously ill it was 1918 that virus h1n1 well 1918 was h1n1 virus also but the 2009 virus could bind directly to cells deep in the lung what was the genetic similarity between those two do we know well I write about science but

[01:03:14] I'm not a scientist I know that it's referred to as you probably know a triple reassortment of viruses meaning that there were three different influenza viruses that were involved in making up the genome of the 2009 virus some of it probably went back I think did go back to 1918 but most of viruses circular human viruses circulating today

[01:03:40] I have some of 1918 floating around in them so I can't really answer your question too clearly that have been a lot of cross protection from other circulating viruses you the vaccination or the frequency with which people had influenza vaccines and continued exposure to influenza and perhaps greater medical care no I think it was simply the virus primarily one thing that's also interesting about 2009 the peak deaths the age of the Dead was very similar to 1918 I forgot the exact number whether it was 27 28 or 29 or maybe even 30 but the average age of the people who did die was very very young much different from ordinary influencer and very similar in 1918 though most of them did have comorbidities let's have forward not to where we are it's a different type of virus it's a corona virus not an influenza virus they have things that are common they have things that are different what have been your observations so far I'm sure you have assimilated a great deal of information and though you're not a virologist you're obviously incredibly erudite with respect to your understanding of not just the biology of these things but also the epidemiology of them and the role that governments media etc play let's just start with biology let's say it's kind of you to say I don't know how much I it's nice of you to say that I appreciate that I hope what what I say is correct I know I believe it I do sort of cross reference my thoughts with other people who are very involved in pandemic preparedness vaccine production and so forth who you know I became friendly with back in the

[01:05:27] Bush administration and since then Obama administration as well so if I have an idea I will send them an email and ask them if I'm going to embarrass myself if I say but they are to your question as I said earlier coronavirus like 1918 can bind directly to lung cells in lung obviously it's different binding sites but still it's deepened along as well as upper respiratory that's the main similarity the main difference is the to Batian period which creates a nightmare for managing this virus then we have questions about immunity we don't know the answers to sort of presume that I guess a work that I've seen recently suggests that you can more or less semi safely assume you're going to have immunity for a year and maybe longer if you've survived the disease fact I won't use instacart because I think it's unethical to expose people to the virus the person who is getting groceries for me now actually did have the disease and did recover so she's kind enough to get groceries for me and

[01:06:49] I don't feel an ethical problem asking her tell me because I think she probably does have immunity recent recovery but in terms of the time you know the incubation period for influences generally two days and might run as long as four but it's usually shorter this is 2 to 14 days the average incubation period is five-and-a-half to six days triple the length of time for the average incubation period for influenza so that makes each generation is going to be that much longer the disease itself takes much longer to develop in the body it takes much longer to pass through the body so the whole length of time the duration is much much longer than influence I said earlier in 1918 or for that matter seasonal influenza it'll pass through a community normally six to ten weeks and then you know hear about it until the next season or in 1918 and until the next wave came and this is not going to be like that also the social distancing to the extent that it's works and it is working is going to add further duration to that the whole process of coming out of this is just tremendously complicated do you think that the response to this has been appropriate has been overly aggressive has been not aggressive enough in certain areas potentially in New York I mean what's your overall take on this on the response of course

[01:08:20] Trump is a disaster incomprehensible is failure to respond his failure to lead you said the federal government is a backup I always thought leadership meant you are in front failure to mobilize resources incredible that FEMA in 50 states compete for the same resources instead of FEMA taking over and allocating it through the states the obviously trivialization of the threat for two months all these things are almost off the scale and then cutting noise saying he's withholding 500 million dollars from the World Health

[01:08:59] Organization in the middle of a pandemic yeah Stephen King would not be believed if he wrote these things in a novel so what else can you say about this guy states are buried I'm in Louisiana I think governor here John bel Edwards has done pretty well reasonably early I think the mayor and Orleans also acted pretty early I know there's Mardi Gras flame for Louisiana being in New Orleans being a hot spot which may be the case but if you look at the timing when my Mardi

[01:09:33] Gras appeared and when the February I guess 25th was Mardi Gras it was not a single case in the state of Louisiana at that time that we knew up there were probably cases obviously there were Mardi Gras spread any but all that goes back to the testing debacle which unfortunately I think partly as a result of CDC and I am I respect I regard for

[01:09:58] CBC but on this one not great than FDA in the bureaucracy but also Trump and the failure to take this seriously the failure to develop an infrastructure going forward I've seen a number that says we're going to need three hundred thousand people for testing and contact tracing and so forth when we come out of that this I don't think one person's been hired for that at this point we should be building that infrastructure up even while we're waiting for the testing capacity to develop that should be done simultaneously there are countries who've got this pretty right and again not just the

[01:10:36] Asian countries like Corinne Singapore and Taiwan and Hong Kong but Germany very much like our country except for the leadership what Sweden is doing now it's too soon to perhaps tell but what's your take on the for lack of a better word the natural experiment going on in Sweden right they're basically saying look we're going to pursue this through the landscape of herd immunity while protecting the vulnerable yeah we're gonna take a selective approach to taking those people who are most at risk now we've had the luxury of watching how that's played out in the rest of the world but we're not going to shut our economy down and they're what they're basically saying without saying it explicitly I don't know if they know that this is what they're saying they're basically saying we completely disagree that the case fatality rate is one to two percent we think that the infection fatality rate is probably closer to that of influenza 0.12 0.2 0.3 percent because we believe that there are far more impatient Ematic people out there than we appreciate therefore creating a much larger denominator and that's synonymous with saying you're gonna get to herd immunity quicker number one it will get to hurt a minute nearly quicker

[01:11:46] I've heard well without catastrophic findings yeah the thing is the infection mortality rate and the case mortality rate or fatality rate or often used interchangeably but they're not at all the same they're not that's right if you did a serological study to find out how many people were infected with influenza the numbers that influenza case mortality I'm convinced would drop from 0.1% way off the scale way below that because there are people who are exposed to the virus I mean Sir serological studied infection rate anybody who responds who's immune system responds to a virus and which you can find Sarah logically so there are certainly people who are infected by influence or any other pathogen who never developed the slightest symptom or the slightest illness of any kind and normally a case fatality rate is just that it's a case meaning somebody has to be to present to a physician so you can't really compare the infection fatality rate with the case fatality rate now it's a very good point John is if you're gonna do this apples to apples you need serologic IFRS for both going forward where can we bend the arc of history where do we five years from now look back and say on April 15th had we gone down this path it would have been a better outcome than if we'd gone down this path what does that look like well I mean it's sort of the same thing we still have an administration that has demonstrated no leadership and is foundering in reality it's not going to happen if Trump got out of the way and left it to Tony poverty in those working groups I mentioned earlier about what planning for a pandemic what'd he do we discussed who should be a spokesperson and we were unanimous that it should not be any politician because what any politician healthy human services secretary or president or anyone else a substantial portion of the public I mean how popular the politician was was not going to believe him or was going to have some kind of inherent negative response to anything the person said so we sat around and we figured the perfect spokesperson would have been everett

[01:14:21] Koop but he was already dead I think it was at the time when the second best would have been Tony Fauci so we now have Tony Fauci I think where he allowed to be the spokesperson that would go a long way toward figuring out what to do I think controlling expectations is important I think by trying to promise that we're coming out on this day or the next day whatever it is and then you don't do it that makes compliance that much more difficult it is what it is is the saying goes Trump's not going to change he's not going to get out of the way the economic concerns are real the management of those concerns is extraordinarily difficult obviously we can't stay locked down month after month after month but we do need to get that infrastructure in place for testing and monitoring if we have enough social distancing to get ahead of the virus the way that will never get ahead the way South Korea and so forth have because we started so far behind but we might get a little bit ahead of it and of course as you know the Asian countries and elsewhere where they have been successful the virus is surging again still nothing like the numbers that we're seeing in the United States but the virus is going to be with us probably forever there will be a new human disease hopefully natural immunity will provide significant protection in the future to everybody the second time around the system sees a virus it should be much more efficient at dealing with it and then of course the hope for a vaccine people seem to be pretty optimistic about that so I didn't really answer your question like no actually I think you actually did and then some I think you provided kind of a greater insight around it I guess the last question I'll ask you is are you optimistic is there a silver lining here that that this has been a large enough jolt to our systems that we will now not only go back and remember the Forgotten pandemic but perhaps put into place more of the pandemic preparedness stuff that people like you and others for whom you're not just new to this have talked about for many years I know now my goal is silver lining people don't have to remember in 1918 anymore all I have to remember is 2020 clearly there will be a significant investment monitoring emerging diseases much more so than there used to be in fact West Nile which I guess technically was an emerging disease but it never killed more than 300 Americans a year if you understood the natural history of that disease it was never going to be a serious threat to human health if you are hoarse you might be in trouble but for humans not so bad and yet West Nile was getting more research money than influenza was when West Nile service that's a remarkable statistic yeah influenza just didn't get the respect to quote Rodney Dangerfield didn't get no respect h5n1 surface and things changed suddenly nations around the world took it seriously as I said the Bush administration passed a seven billion dollar bill to invest in pandemic preparedness had we had the investment over time that has come in the last 15 years we probably have a universal influenza vaccine by now but we didn't going forward obviously there'll be a lot of work on coronaviruses thankfully SARS and MERS did emerge or we wouldn't have the knowledge base we have now which given us a huge head start on drugs and vaccines for this you know and probably there'll be some serious money spent on preparing for any emerging pathogen which would probably be a virus might conceivably be something else most likely a virus as I'm sure you know there are plenty of animal viruses out there and as development encroaches more and more upon what used to be the wild we will encounter more of those viruses and they're all threats John I want to thank you for not just the work you've done leading up to this but also just for taking the time today to talk about this I know you're highly sought after at this time and you're probably tired of talking about this and there's probably other things you'd rather be doing to take your mind off as but enjoy very much enjoyed talking to you
