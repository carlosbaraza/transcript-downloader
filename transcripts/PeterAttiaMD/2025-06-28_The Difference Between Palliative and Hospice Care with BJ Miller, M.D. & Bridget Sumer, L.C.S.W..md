## AI Summary

Here's my analysis of this portion of The Drive podcast episode on palliative and hospice care:

1. **Executive Summary**:

## Transcript

[00:00:00] Let's take the step back and yeah help people understand the difference between paliotative care and hospice care. Yeah. Great. Um so uh I sort of think of it as like paliotative medicine is the big umbrella. Paliative care is a big umbrella. Um and hospice care is sort of like the very end or the the sort of um backside of the umbrella. Um palative care is a medical specialty usually provided by a team for folks with a serious illness. Um serious illness can be defined lots of ways and is defined differently in different health systems uh kind of depending on how they're staffed and how their pal of care programs are kind of created to function what what purposes they're serving but um some of the and BJ you jump in at any points but uh some of the big differences is that um with paliative care generally there's no limitation around um any disease directed or modified dying therapies you might be uh pursuing um and you don't have to be dying inherently um or even clear that you're facing death. You could be diagnosed with a very serious cancer that actually has pretty robust treatments and you could live for quite a long time um meaning many many years many years. So in that situation what is the objective of the paliotative care team? Mhm. Um to think really holistically about who is this person?

[00:01:27] Um where are they in their lives? How do they make sense of what's going on? What do they understand about their illness? Who's supporting them? Um all really grounded in this. Are there ways that we can help this person feel sort of as well as possible? um to treat the symptoms related to serious illness, to treat the symptoms related to the treatments of different serious illnesses. Um uh but in the context of a whole life, which means, you know, you could have on a clinic day, you could be seeing two people that seem on paper generally the same, right? Similar age, you know, demographic, backgrounds, diagnosis, and be dealing with really different things when you walk in the room.

[00:02:12] Um what would you either Yeah. I mean no matter how you slice it the goal is is the focus is quality of life. Yep. Period. Whether it's p of care or hospice. And by the way for both Bridget so it's inherently interdisiplinary as Bridget was saying that's why Bridget's social worker and I'm a medical doctor but we work with chaplain nurses music theatlogologists potentially art therapists volunteers. when the subject matter is suffering and quality of life, you know, there's no one discipline that has a lock on that stuff. So, but whether it's p of care or hospice, the focus is really on helping someone feel as well as possible and that is an inherently holistic question because it gets at their identity. It gets at their physiology as possible as defined by them. Yeah. Right. And so for someone that could mean very aggressive pain management and for someone else they could have a different relationship to the experience of pain and they wouldn't put that at the top of the priority list. They might put more concrete or relational kind of supports you know higher up on their list. So our you know the beauty of our jobs and our work is to meet this person in this moment in time and identify what's up for them. what's most important and sort of where where it is that we get to meet them to work towards quality of life as defined by them. So what is the transition then for an individual from being under the broad umbrella of paliotative care into a more narrow defined level of care is hospice. Yeah.

[00:03:49] I mean I think there's the there's some idea you know there's some like world of ideals in that and then there's what actually happens and the reality in this country is that um folks are admitted to hospice very very late you know the length of stay um on a hospice program in this country something like a 3 week average and so it's actually quite little bit of time um and when I think about when hospice is a good fit for folks. I think about um wanting to stay out of the hospital.

[00:04:28] Mhm. Being in a place where they are ready to or being forced to grapple with the reality that there is not um anything left to do to change what is happening in their body, to change the cancer, to delay the neurologic illness. um uh and or folks that are more explicitly ready to be supported in their end of life care or in their transition and and just done with chasing the treatment, you know, done with chemo. Yeah, maybe there's it may be you that chemo might have something more to offer them in terms of life spent, but they are just electing to be done with that. So whether the whether chemo and other things have run out of run their course and there's nothing left to try which is often the case or they feel done with they're telling us that they're just they don't want to try anything else. Either way they would much more likely to be hospice ready. Now you're saying the average length of stay in hospice and and really there are as as I'm aware of it and so correct me if this is not correct. There seem to be three paths to hospice. There's hospice in your home where you go back to your home and a hospice team comes there and cares for you in your home. Yeah. There is a paliotative care ward inside a physical hospital that provides hospice care, but it's still within a hospital. And then there are outpatient hospice facilities, dedicated facilities for hospice that are not hospitals. Would those three encompass the the how hospice care is delivered or is there another one? Sort of in terms of sites of care. Okay, this is where it starts can get really wonky.

[00:06:13] It's complicated and you can shut us up. There's so many different there's so many tributaries, but to kind of back up a little bit that may be orienting for the audience here. So, as Bridget's I'm totally correct, pallet of care is the larger umbrella. Um, hospice is this sort of subset of pallet of care devoted to the final months of life. So to be real clear, same philosophy in a lot of ways, but by insurance and reimbursement lines and by policy designation, you can get pal of care alongside curative intended care. You cannot do so in hospice. When you go onto hospice, you have to give up that curative intended care like and not just that. I mean, you can't have an IV line generally generally speaking. Yeah, generally speaking. So there is it is a the way it's set up is a crossroads. We'll make the point that dying and living look a lot alike. But in the man-made world of policy and health care structure, there are some important forks in the road. So one of them to go on to hospice is you no longer have access to or don't want curative intended care and things that go with it. And also someone somewhere has to certify that should nature run its course, you likely have six months or less to live. So those are the two forks in the road to qualify for hospice. Pal of care those are neither of those applies for pal of care. So that's a really important distinction.

[00:07:37] So I'm trying to kind of and one other point to make there is while pal of care is the larger umbrella hospice is the older one. So we started in this country with hospice and since the 1982 when Medicare got in the business we had those restrictions and then people in the n 80s and 90s realized like why are we waiting till the final weeks and months of life to deliver this kind of loving care and so the p of care was born as a younger bigger sibling to encomp to get outside of those restrictions. So it's a wonky history. Well, what's interesting is you just said that hospice care was the original and it was 6 months of life expectancy and today we're at a point where median or mean is 3 weeks in hospice. Yeah. Well, if that's true, and we think about what we know about what an individual looks like when they have 3 weeks left of life, this is usually a person who's already in delirium, already in the early stages of organ failure. This is a person who probably is already spending more than 50% of their time sleeping. Um, and what I guess I'm hearing you say, or maybe I'm imputing, is should they have moved into hospice sooner? Have they have they been unnecessarily discomforted by pursuing therapeutic intent until that 3WE mark on average?

[00:09:04] Uh Brad, do you want to jump in there? You go first. Yeah, I would say as as in broad strokes unequivocally in general, the answer is yes. I think we know that patients and families wait too long. they're suffering more than they need to and taking on treatments that are no longer helping them for a longer period of time that there's a what can feel like a charade portion of care. Um, and there's a lot of reasons like patients and families not wanting to look at that piece of the puzzle yet. Denial is a thing, you know, and also referring physicians perhaps is the the bigger reason that they are not seeing the writing on the wall or don't want to or whatever else. Um, so it's very often that the physicians don't bring up hospice until way late in the game. So for many reasons, I think it is a generally true statement that we wait too long to in uh invoke hospice.

[00:10:00] We wait too long based based on our own stated goals of feeling at peace and having some comfort towards the end and not wasting our time doing things that don't help us. I'm Peter Aia.
