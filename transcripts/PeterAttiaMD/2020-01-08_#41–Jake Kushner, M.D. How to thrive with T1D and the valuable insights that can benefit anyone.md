## Description

Original release date: 2/18/19

In this episode, Jake Kushner, pediatric endocrinologist specializing in helping people with type 1 diabetes and Medical Director of McNair Interests, discusses the best strategies to live and thrive with T1D, especially as it relates to diet and exercise. We also discuss why many patients who control their blood sugar with high amounts of exogenous insulin are at a substantially higher risk than people who can control their blood sugar at lower levels of insulin. This concept has great implications for non-diabetics as well considering the increasing prevalence of diseases related to insulin resistance. We also cover some of the basics, the history, the increasing prevalence of type 1 diabetes, and more importantly, what we can do to help kids with this disease, and their families.

We discuss:
-How Jake became interested in type 1 diabetes [5:30];
-The pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes, the increase in prevalence, and the role of beta cells [17:00];
-The role of body weight and BMI in the risk of developing T1D [27:00];
-Genetics of T1D and the risk of inheritance [32:00];
-Hemoglobin A1c [36:15];
-Insulin: the amazing story of its discovery, its effect on cellular metabolism and IGF-1, and why the hell it’s so expensive [39:15];
-Diabetes Control and Complication Trial: blood glucose and the complications associated with diabetes [54:45];
-Cognitive impairment, epigenetic changes, and other dangers associated with high, peak blood glucose, and big swings in blood glucose levels [1:09:15];
-Depression, anxiety, and other challenges of living with T1D [1:15:30];
-Jake’s realization that the current standard of care of T1D is inadequate [1:26:15];
-Managing diabetes with exercise [1:30:15];
-The Bernstein method, and protein’s impact on glucose and insulin [1:36:15];
-Jake radically changes his approach to treating patients [1:45:00];
-What other tools are there for controlling T1D? [1:49:45];
-Is the ketogenic diet appropriate for those with T1D? [1:52:45];
-The most important lessons that can be applied by the non-diabetic population [1:59:00];
-The two dream measurements Peter wishes were available [2:04:00]; and
-More.

## AI Summary

Here's my structured analysis of this episode of The Drive with Dr. Jake Kushner:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focuses on Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) management, featuring pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Jake Kushner. The discussion covers the history of insulin discovery, modern treatment approaches, and the importance of low-carbohydrate diets in managing T1D. Key themes include the psychological burden of T1D management and the relationship between insulin levels and cardiovascular disease.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- T1D affects approximately 1 in 300 people [00:15:22]
- About 30% of children still present with DKA at diagnosis [00:12:13]
- Hemoglobin A1c of 9% associated with 6-fold increased risk of death [01:03:02]
- Protein converts to glucose at roughly 10g protein to 6g carbohydrate ratio [01:46:36]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) is essential for T1D management [01:50:31]
- Lower carbohydrate intake reduces insulin requirements [01:38:11]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Regular insulin better for protein coverage than rapid-acting analogs [01:50:36]
- Exercise can reduce insulin requirements by up to two-thirds [01:03:02]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Medications mentioned:
- Regular human insulin vs. rapid-acting analogs [01:50:36]
- SGLT2 inhibitors (discussed regarding risks) [01:56:04]

5. **Exercise & Movement**:

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic

[00:01:04] I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming

[00:01:23] I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not solutely nuts for so if i don't feel that way about something i don't know how i can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads i've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our shows members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:28] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level it makes sense for you I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription my guest this week is dr. Jake Kushner a close friend and a pediatric endocrinologist who specializes in helping manage people with type 1 diabetes in this episode we go into great detail about type 1 diabetes probably the biggest takeaway from this episode is that diet can help people not only with type-2 diabetes but also type 1

[00:04:32] Jake discusses some of the recent findings in an approach that one of the pioneers in this field dr. Richard Bernstein champion for several decades now managing carbohydrates and protein to manage insulin and glucose and if you're thinking well I don't have type 1 diabetes why does this matter to me the answer is anybody with a pancreas is going to benefit from this and obviously those with a high pancreas which is effectively what is happening in type 1 diabetes we also discuss why many patients who control their blood sugar with high amounts of exhaustion as insulin are at substantially higher risk than people who can control their blood sugar at lower levels of insulin this concept also has implications for everyone else as I said because the word exogenous and endogenous can be interchanged quite easily when it comes to insulin we cover some of the basics the history the increasing prevalence of type 1 diabetes and more importantly what we can do to help kids with this disease and their families and the non diabetics out there learn from them and their disease so without further delay here's my conversation with Jake cush

[00:05:34] Jake thanks for coming over man hey Peter thanks for having me it's a pleasure what do you think's the probability we will get through this discussion today without one of my kids barreling into this room absolutely zero especially given that I met both of them and they're incredibly rambunctious and cute well you met two boys but there's a girl too okay oops she's much more well-behaved so you're in town I guess we can't talk about it it's black ops mission right no it's actually so I'm an advisory council for Sanofi and I'm I've been an advisor about this drug so to go thousand which is part of a new class of drugs that will hopefully benefit people with type one diabetes these adjuvant therapies molecules that you take in addition to insulin I've been involved in this program now for close to seven years and I know off mic we've spoken a little bit about some of those compounds they're super interesting not just for type 1 diabetes but potentially type 2

[00:06:27] WTA's and frankly if you subscribe to the idea that lower levels of glucose when slin are just better overall there may even be other applications so before we get into that we met it's been three or four years now I mean you met in Houston over dinner one night yeah and I gave you credit for this recently on a podcast that hasn't yet released but it will release it was actually you who first told me about CGM right although it was officially Kevin Sayer Dexcom that got me fully hooked so you know whenever I'm talking to somebody and they ask me about a question that has to do with type one diabetes I generally say like I know very little about this condition but you should meet Jake

[00:07:08] Kushner because not only does he get it but I think his outcomes are pretty unique I think we're seeing more people move towards the realization that you and people who think like you have but so you're a pediatric endocrinologist did you always know you wanted to do that well I was trying to decide in between being a pediatrician and being a molecular biologist and my parents are basic scientists and you know there was a well-worn path in between molecular biology and endocrinology so that was a really typical thing back in the mid 80s and I thought I would do that and the classical path as an endocrinologist is to go and find a rare disorder and discover the molecular basis for it and find some unique product that you could then replace and provide it and then you're good to go and there's a lot of inter chronologiste who who made quite a bit of hay on that paradigm and so I was also interested in pediatrics I was trying to decide in between all these things when I was an undergraduate at

[00:08:04] Berkeley and working pretty much continuously in basic science research labs all the way through Berkeley and then for several years afterwards as a research technician first at UCSF and then in Oregon so I applied a medical school and I get in and I think I'm gonna be a pediatrician and my mother was greatly disappointed that I didn't become a basic scientist she she viewed

[00:08:25] Sciences much more compelling than than becoming a pediatrician and you or any doctor for that matter right the there could be no greater letdown to you know scientific parents that you would shy something as as low as medicine and I was literally the only kid in medical school whose mother was disappointed that I didn't end up going graduate school it makes you my dad was very disappointed that I went to medical school too so I found myself there I thought it was gonna be a pediatrician did my clinical rotations and that it totally reinforced it and I just love being on the Morton interacting with kids and then ended up as a pediatric resident at Brown and had again I had worked in molecular chronology as a researcher before I went to medical school and was enamored by endocrinology in general and I applied and got into this program at Boston Children's so there I was in this incredibly busy rigorous unbelievably complicated place and that's when this this crazy thing happened in my life and so I thought I was gonna find some esoteric metabolic disease to work on and you were at the right place to do it because for the folks listening who might not know this there were probably what four major pediatric centers in North America

[00:09:40] Boston Children's obviously in Boston sick kids in Toronto chopped in Philly and maybe Texas Children's would that be in the top four yeah and UCSF that's right would you CSF actually make the top five at the time it did okay incredibly strong so I sort of thought I would do this and I'd find some esoteric disease like maybe work on calcium or you know but as a first year endocrine fellow were running around an incredibly busy service and were interacting with families of children who are newly diagnosed and it's such a commitment with type 1 with type 1 diabetes and it's so compelling so we would take all the ER would call us oh there's a child who's been diagnosed we come in the next morning and meet these families and you know there's a tearful exhausted overwhelmed mother there's a kid who literally looks like she's been like shot out of a cannon you know with multiple IVs and scars and her in her arms from blown IVs and we have to try to work through this idea that they were gonna be insulin dependent for life and

[00:10:45] I just thought wow this is really an amazing and challenging problem and it has so many aspects of medicine that I appreciate it has most importantly human elements but there's also basic science the diagnosis is I mean I had one experience with this before I got to medical school which was in college I had a really good friend because I won't use her name just in case I need to put her identity and she was amazing she was my lab partner mhm we're just great great buddies she was a stud athlete she was on the rowing team she was like the perfect physical specimen of you know and we used to sit together and we were in two classes together and she was like maybe four or five months into that school year and she couldn't stay awake anymore she was like falling asleep in class constantly and I remember sort of nudging her and being like hey you're burning it too much like the practices are killing you and the labs and blah blah blah like you got to get this under control and she's like no no no I'm fine I'm fine

[00:11:44] I'm fine and she just couldn't stay awake to save her life and she was losing weight like crazy and she was lean to begin with so she was you know probably six feet tall mm-hm and might await 140 was her fighting weight and you know she was now down to 125 or something like that and of course she was going to the bathroom all the time and of course I'm just a dumb engineer I don't know anything I don't realize this is such an obvious you know sign of somebody who's going to be in a medical school and you can't die but it's really difficult for everybody well this was an instant undergrad oh yeah yes before I even knew I wanted to go into medicine but yeah sure enough she comes back one day with she's like oh my god you're not gonna believe this

[00:12:23] I finally went to the doctor and all of sudden for the rest of school she takes insulin and for the rest of her life you know and these are people to see healthy people they're cruising around living their lives there's nothing obvious that contributes to their risk and then they start drinking a lot and peeing a lot and they lose weight and they essentially are in a state of profound catabolism and their bodies waste away because insulin is such a really pivotal signal for a directionality on metabolism and they decide to break it down and it's amazing if beguiles everyone who's up there close there are so many misdiagnosis around type one diabetes about 30 percent of children still present with DKA that is to say they've had prolonged illness and no one's thought that they could actually be quite ill so when to be clear when they present with diabetic ketoacidosis it means that they have somehow managed to slip through the cracks nobody's figured out that the glucose level is through the roof right or that they're becoming acidotic one of these other things and what actually brings them into the hospital is aseptic like situation where they're you know their blood pressure is falling and they're becoming unresponsive yeah they hit the metabolic wall at at that point they're only on this earth for a matter of days or a week or two without insulin and it's quite common for very young children to present in decay it's less common in older people they typically have more compensatory reserve so they have more the autoimmunity proceeds at a slower rate as you get older and so the diagnosis becomes more and more confusing the older than onset of the disease and this phenomenon actually progresses into adulthood to the point where there are people our age who are diagnosed with diabetes not otherwise specified who think they have type 2 and they're skinny but in fact have cryptic type 1 diabetes they probably have autoimmune antibodies and they have some degree of a loss of beta cells and this phenomenon explains some of the adult onset diabetes that you just don't quite understand how is this person diabetic and so fast forward a few years from where I am and I want to come back to where you were but by the time I'm in medical school I had only been exposed to people who had type 1 diabetes which is ironic given the prevalence difference between type 1 and type 2 and

[00:14:45] I remember in a pathology class in my first year they said well you know I forget what the number was at the time but they said about 95% of the cases of diabetes are what we call type 2 or adult onset diabetes and I remember thinking to myself the professor must have made a mistake I've never seen this type 2 diabetes thing they talked about but I've seen a lot of people not just that friend in school but I went on to see other people and knew of other people though I didn't watch them through the diagnosis so what is the prevalence today notwithstanding this late onset type 1 diabetes that will we'll come and talk about later but just directionally how many people in the

[00:15:22] United States have type 1 versus type 2 or indeterminate ok so type 1 is approximately one in 300 people and the typical age of onset is around nine and they live into adulthood and and many so into their 80s or even 90s they have of course reduce survival because of complications but it's an incredibly common illness it's the most common life-threatening medication requiring illness of childhood yeah which is amazing when you go back to where you were at Boston Children's Hospital I'm sure for any pediatric endocrinologist to be working on glycogen storage diseases or inborn errors of metabolism is interesting intellectually but the scale upon which those diseases afflict children is trivial compared to what you just described and when you're working in a fancy medical school it's quite sort of tempting to focus on a rare unique condition that most people don't get a lot of exposure to and sort of bypass the really common things but for me type one diabetes was the elephant in the room it was just so compelling and I ended up being the first clinical fellow at Boston Children's in 10 years to go into type 1 diabetes where any of your mentors they're disappointed in the way that your mom was that you were sort of and I want to say slumming it because they don't mean to suggest that that's what it was but that you were stepping off the pedestal of the esteemed academic institution no I ended up working on type 1 diabetes at the Joslin

[00:16:48] Diabetes Center which was an amazing place and and there was also in Boston also in Boston there's a long August tradition of academics there they were a little surprised that I was interested in going after such a tough problem and again clinically type 1 diabetes is an immense problem as we'll get into because the clinical treatments are just so difficult and ineffective and variable in their response so let's talk a little bit about the pathophysiology of this presumably people listening to this who already know everything about it and want to get to the fun stuff will will skip this well timestamp it so they can jump ahead but I think it is worth understanding cuz there's definitely some confusion you obviously alluded to the fact that this has an autoimmune component if not the main component so what based on everything we know today is the pathophysiology of this condition okay well I guess we could say just from a very high level there are clearly genetic as well as environmental contributors and so we know that it runs in families and we know that certain regions or certain behaviors predispose but if you actually get down to the molecular pathophysiology what you see is that it's an autoimmune condition largely driven by t-cells but there is also a contribution of b-cells and because of that you can detect antibodies in the serum that indicate autoimmunity and so we generally believe what happens is by some combination of bad luck and possibly genetics and possibly the foods you eat due to a very very modest degree this stochastic phenomenon begins to move forward whereby the beta cell which secretes insulin begins to dump off antigens and the antigens begin to provoke the immune system locally and some of those immune cells start to destroy beta cells and dump out more antigens and let me take a step back for the listener the pancreas of course is this gland yeah thank you no no that's fine the pancreas is this gland that sits in the retroperitoneum so it's not in the abdomen proper but it's behind the stomach and about 95 percent of the pancreas by mass serves this exocrine function which is it's mostly there for local digestion it puts enzymes into the biliary stream that ultimately aid in the proximate digestion if things come out the stomach however about five percent of the pancreas by mass including these cells called beta cells right but presumably you'll tell us a little bit about alpha and Delta cells it's an endocrine organ versus an exocrine organ which means it's secreting systemic hormones into the system so I remember learning that in medical school and being surprised because I'd heard so much about beta cells and I was like wait they only make up 5% of this pancreas like they're a relatively small contribution to this enormous organ right and essentially insulin is only made there except perhaps in tiny quantities in the brain and so that yes these islands of cells these islets of langerhans exist floating in a sea of the a sinner or exocrine component and they make insulin uniquely unlike any other tissue and perhaps because they make these unique antigens or these unique cellular products like insulin and some of the other apparatus that are required for for glucose stimulated insulin secretion when they begin to dump off their antigens and prove auto-immunity you can get this sort of death spiral where ultimately the end result is a progressive autoimmunity where you lose beta cells over time and

[00:20:13] I don't think that there's any one single for instance virus that can be conclusively ascribed to autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes it's clearly not related to directly related to your BMI or your body mass index or your body weight though it's certainly a contributor and also genetics are which which way does it seem to contribute high or low in populations again it's not it doesn't hold up in individuals very well but but in populations the heavier you are the more likely you are to have type 1 which implies either that the work of the beta cells contributing to the autoimmunity or alternatively the work of the beta cell and the relative beta cell insufficiency reveals this autoimmunity that otherwise would have been cryptic we've seen a rise in the incidence yes and of course then the prevalence of type 2 diabetes that's very difficult to ignore and I've written about that in other places and you can chase that all the way back to the late 1800s and it tracks pretty well what has been the relative change in the incidence of type 1 diabetes so it's doubled since 1960 and it appears to be continuing to increase and so one possibility is that there are these environmental factors that are increasing for instance obesity alternatively there could be viruses or other things that were exposed to and in other possibilities that were simply better at diagnosing it so we know for a fact that some infants that are diagnosed now with new onset diabetes would have been the kids who you thought had died of sepsis back when you were in medical school so we have a greater awareness that this that this autoimmunity can happen to kids as early as five or six months of life and at that point they don't present with the classical signs and symptoms it's really incredibly aggressive they look like they have gastroenteritis and weight loss and if nobody bothers to check a serum glucose you might never know that they in fact have life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis and new onset type 1 diabetes it's a disaster I suspect it was because I knew we were gonna be speaking today but last night when I was putting my littlest guy to bed who's about 16 17 months old I remember I was looking at him and I was playing with him and I'm biased so I think he's as cute as all hell

[00:22:33] I remember thinking what would happen if this guy got type 1 diabetes like how would we figure it out like how long would it take us to figure out oh my god check his glucose and it scared me actually because it's like I think about this stuff night and day and I realized it would easily escape me for a long time and to your point they don't have the reserve they don't have the physiologic reserve which is just doctors speak for they don't have the buffer between life and death that you know you or I would have and actually might have much more aggressive autoimmunity meaning it comes on quicker the right rate of decline of endogenous insulin production is much faster yeah they they might present with 90% of their beta cells gone because the autoimmune destruction from 100% of their beta cell capacity to 10% could occur in a matter of months almost by definition must and a kid in six months old but if you know I'm 53 if I got type 1 diabetes I could smolder along for years and again I have a friend who is my age who is essentially my height and weight and he has new onset diabetes and we think he actually has cryptic type one and he and it's slowly smoldering it seems to be slowly progressing it's been very difficult to precisely make the diagnosis and I want to come back to that in time for at least one reason which is for people out there listening there's there are people getting caught between these cross hairs that are potentially being misdiagnosed outside of the intellectual exercise of getting it right which we love to do as doctors are their treatment implications that are more relevant in other words if you have someone who's walking around with quote-unquote type-2 diabetes but they're really late onset type 1 are we also potentially caring for them in care so I'll park that because I there's so much I want to go back to in type 1 but between the two of us let's try to remember to come back to that so I didn't actually realize the b-cells played a big role but I guess that makes sense so I thought it was just a cd4 cd8 cd25 problem but it's beyond that yeah there's this idea of an antigenic spread so again if the beta cells make very unique things and when you break them open and destroy them you begin to dump them out there is both the B and a t-cell response and we know this because we can test for antibodies in the serum of people with type 1 diabetes and they make unique antibodies against insulin and GAD glutamic acid decarboxylase as well as a protein tyrosine phosphatase called ICA 5:12 and so those antibodies are commonly used in the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes which we believe to be a t-cell disease but again that doesn't make any sense because antibodies are made by B cells so there must be some contribution and the the definitive proof of that was in a New

[00:25:32] England Journal article that was done by my friend the late mark Pesce vets and he used in a huge clinical trial rituximab which alters b-cell function alters the ability of the B cells to make antibodies and they were able to delay the course of type 1 diabetes so they were able to intervene in a subset of patients that were progressing slowly enough they presented with positive GAD antibodies but they still had beta cell production you whack them with rituximab you at least take the B cell component out of this and if the control patient isn't having that you now create a kaplan-meier curve for a beta cell that's right that's right and so they were only temporarily able to alter how much did they delay the onset so rituximab is quite potent so the circulating antibodies were reduced dramatically they only gave a single set of infusions and if I understand remember this study correctly they got a response but it was not statistically significant at a year based on one single dose I'm not sure what will pull it up yeah okay are there any other autoimmune diseases that share this phenomenon that you're aware of where you have this b-cell t-cell component well I think it's true of a bunch of the other immune endocrine disorders such as for instance autoimmune thyroid disease where you can get thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies and again we largely think that that's a t-cell mediated disease and by the way autumn

[00:26:56] II and thyroid disease is associated with type 1 diabetes or vice versa meaning patients who go on earlier in life to develop type 1 diabetes would be much more likely than patients without it to go on to get Graves disease or some of the other autoimmune thyroid disorders yeah typically type 1 would present first and then they can get

[00:27:13] Ottoman thyroid disease but they can also get adrenal disease and we also see for instance rarely Syal itis and which is Ottoman disease of the salivary gland and even rarely autoimmune boof Rytas of the ovaries as well as precious anaemia the ability to produce b12 and so that's presumably an autoimmune disease of the cells that make b12 Wow I didn't actually realize that there was so much overlap between these let's clarify one other thing that I'm sure someone's wondering one thing that parents I think are pretty mindful of is what do we have to feed our kids to minimize the risk of them getting anaphylactic reactions to nuts or things like that right even the consequences of such things not to get off into the weeds but it's probably worth explaining why that's a completely different process than what we're talking about with the autoimmunity respect to the endocrine show so not to put you on the spot and I'm happy to fill in the gaps but what is it about a kid when they eat a peanut that leads to an anaphylactic reaction and why is that a totally different type of immune response well I should just say in terms of anaphylactic reactions for peanuts it turns out that you probably want to eat peanuts to avoid the anaphylactic that's that is not amazing that is certainly what we believe now right I think the literature has become crystal clear that early exposure is better right but again that's a very different type of immune response isn't it yes that's that's mediated by IgE right that's a hypersensitivity more than an autoimmune response is that correct yeah so borrowing from that though do we believe that there are any exposures that are withheld from kids that may be predisposing them to beta cell destruction or do we think it has much more to do with these diffuse genetic issues which I want to come back to these quote-unquote environmental issues and then of course what it seems to be the majority of it seems to be stuck plastic so there's no one precise thing and moreover I don't believe that parents who are listening this could say okay I want to make sure that my kid doesn't get type 1 diabetes so we're not going to eat any enriched carbohydrate and then we'll mitigate that risk completely however that said in populations you can see these very subtle differences in in type 1 diabetes risk depending upon the body weight of children which implies that the standard

[00:29:24] American diet may be predisposing the population in aggregate ever so slightly towards more type 1 diabetes which is a scary thought yeah the challenge of course is because the environmental contribution is so much smaller here than it is and type 2 diabetes yet we don't know if we could be looking at genetic differences that could explain that in other words we can't do the experiment as easily the epidemiologic comparison I guess to be more rigorous in my terminology of comparing a u.s. population to you know pick a completely different population that is genetically completely distinct and environmentally distinct we'd get we could get fooled by that right yeah but there is a pretty nice study using the t1d exchange data which is a large consortium clinics around the United

[00:30:09] States and in fact and there's a paper that was published by Maria Redondo and several other friends of mine describing explicitly these relationships in between body weight and the potential risk for type 1 so then you remember just directionally when a child goes I don't even know kid body the BMI is like my little guy who you just saw who's like 97th percentile in height weight and 95th percentile in head circumference I was looking at his little pediatric sheet the other day cuz he went to the doctor and he was like

[00:30:38] BMI of nineteen point four so the kid BMI z-- mean I don't know how to think in those BM eyes but I was gonna say like what's the difference between a BMI 16 and a BMI 20 like how much of an increase in relative risk do you see pediatricians like me never able to memorize the these things you've got to put it on it you know we have to plot it on it alright so so there's growth curves for both height and weight and head circumference and weight versus height or we're also body mass index it's just so complicated and different curves or boys and girls yeah

[00:31:10] I know okay so question one out of the way is is there anything I can do or a parent can do to reduce the risk of our kids getting type 1 diabetes the answer is probably not other than if you want the wind a little bit at your back as opposed to a little bit in your face if your kids can be of closer to normal BMI than not being aware that it is a possibility and being able to inform yourself and your neighbors and your in your school teacher undiagnosed type 1 diabetes is very dangerous for children and we need to do a better job of detecting it early yeah with one in 300 kids getting it that is I mean that's that means in any given school 1 to 3 kids are being diagnosed a year which is interesting because I just don't have that recollection you know i but it may speak to this issue you've talked about which is we just under diagnosed it we've sort of talked briefly about genes but obviously this is not going to fall in the category of single gene mutations like the glycogen storage diseases or some of the other errors of inborn metabolism do we have even a quasi sense of how heavy the genetic contribution is and what those genes may actually do from a functional standpoint we understand it pretty well and though there's there's still a lot to be learned so it's complicated in that there's essentially two different themes of the genetics of type 1 diabetes 1 are these HLA alleles like this is the human history compatibility like this and there's there's certain alleles that are quite common in the population that when combined place people at higher risk and so there's something called HLA dr 3 and dr 4 and these alleles tend to run quite frequently in the u.s. population and as a result people who have type 1 diabetes typically will have about a tenfold risk of having a child with type 1 diabetes relative to the to the general population and to be clear is that assuming they inherit the same HLA type or independent of the inherited pattern of their HLA because if you're if you are HLA to dr your kid has a is that is that a co dominant inheritance is your kid 50 likely to get that assuming your wife doesn't have that yeah but what happens is it's so common that your wife may have that and so just statistically because children end up having it the people who have type 1 diabetes often have these alleles and also these other minor alleles that contribute each very small amounts but in aggregate quite a bit so the analogy I use is it's sort of like let's play a poker game if you will we're gonna play a poker game where on your left hand we're gonna play 21 and on the right hand we're gonna play five-card stud okay and so when you deal me and and by the way the winner is the one say 21 you mean blackjack blackjack exactly blackjack at my left hand and five-card stud on the right and when you're dealt the cards you have the HLA alleles which is blackjack because there's only a few and they sort out however they sort out and the right hand you're playing five-card stud and in fact there's a huge number of combinations that could come in five-card stud but together those two hands determine the risk and so it's quite complicated because you can't draw direct line in between one gene or a group of genes but in aggregate the statisticians think that that people are approximately six to ten fold at greater risk if you have somebody who's have type 1 to have a direct relative and so if you're someone with type 1 that's still not a reason to get completely panicked because right that means you're it's still unlikely your kid is gonna get type 1 diabetes right if you have a disease that's hitting 1 in 300 and you have a tenfold increase it's gonna hit 1 in 30 there's still a it's 97 percent chance your child is not going to have type 1 diabetes if you do but it would have been a ninety-nine point seven percent chance hopefully if you hadn't if I'm doing my math right but there are these families I've met them you know I met one family where all three sons had type 1 diabetes oh and was the age of onset comparable in each of these children it doesn't necessarily online that's kind of an interesting and surprising element yeah and actually I at one point cared for identical twins who were discordant for type 1 diabetes well that's I was gonna ask you that what is the twin concordance identical versus fraternal so identical twin concordance within the first few years is only around 50 or 60 percent but by adulthood what is it by adulthood it's approaching 80 percent so there's a big cohort that dr. George

[00:35:46] Eisen Barr studied many years ago so over time those are the people that discordant genetically identical twins are probably the people who would have they have diabetes not otherwise specified but in fact they have type 1 that's that's cryptic and the fraternal twins which would at least allow you to hopefully as much as possible normalize the environmental similarities but somewhat reduce the genetic variability or the genetic similarity do you have a rough sense of what the concordance is for those by adulthood I don't know the exact number but again I think it's they're approximately tenfold relative to the general population got it

[00:36:22] Wow so let's fast forward a little bit and get back to what we talked about over dinner in Houston a few years ago again it was either three or four years ago but it was the fall I remember it was a fall at that point in time I had spent very little mental energy thinking about type 1 diabetes because obviously

[00:36:42] I'm not gonna take care of somebody with type 1 diabetes it's so far outside of my skill set and so I sort of remembered a few things because in residency 2 of my co residents had type 1 diabetes which is wow that's pretty unusual in a cohort because the categorical residents in general surgery for our year at

[00:36:59] Hopkins there were only seven of us right and two of the seven had type 1 diabetes and I you know I talked with him a lot about it and I sort of remembered directionally their target was a hemoglobin a1c of about 7.5 and they lived on crackers and orange juice where they're sort of staple foods to manage these bouts of hypoglycemia and I certainly remember one of my buddies it wasn't uncommon if in the middle of an operation one of the nurses would have to come and put a little straw behind his mask and he would have to drink some orange juice to sort of you know manage his glucose levels and then when you and I sat down for dinner you said you know your average patient is walking around at something like 5.7 5.8 5.9 hemoglobin a1c and that immediately caught me off guard because I was like oh that seems very different from what I sort of remember so how did you get from wherever presumably you finished your training and entered your practice I'm guessing that was sometime in the late 80s early 90s

[00:37:57] I graduated from fellowship in in 2000 okay so over the last call it 15 18 years how did you evolve your thinking around targets for where the hemoglobin a1c and I guess I should take a step back and also explain for someone what the hemoglobin a1c is since I'm so critical of it in general by the way you've probably heard me rail on the futility of it the hemoglobin a1c of course measures the amount of glycosylation or how much glucose is sticking to hemoglobin and if we take the assumption that hemoglobin has a relatively finite fixed predictable life before the red blood cells themselves get broken down we can measure the hemoglobin a1c and then impute the average blood glucose and that's of course the exact opposite of what we would do with CGM where you were actually measuring the average blood glucose and imputed what the hemoglobin a1c would be so the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is made today solely on the hemoglobin a1c being greater than 6.5 percent it no longer relies on the insulin or glucose level during an oral glucose challenge remind me a hemoglobin a1c of 7.5 corresponds to an average blood glucose of approximately what 160 yeah I think that's right well post the table - it could be 150 but it's directionally in that book right right so for someone listening to this thinking god that's that seems a little high why was that chosen as such a goal okay so we should first just talk about the DCCT which is the so-called diabetes control complication trial which after the discovery of insulin by

[00:39:35] Banting and best in 1922 in Toronto right in Toronto that's right so we're coming up on the 100th anniversary of the DCCT at the discovery of insulin can we detour for two seconds and explain how they how Banting and best did this because it's really one of those beautiful stories in medicine yeah it's so amazing and there's a book by the way which is by Michael bliss called the discovery of insulin and if anybody has a vague interest in type 1 diabetes they should run and by this because it's just so amazing and bring tears to your eyes prior to Banting and best what happened to children with type 1 diabetes children or or adult or adults so at least in the 19th century nothing so these people would present with weight loss and history drinking and and urinating quite a bit and over time they had to manage their expectations and then they would expire and it was I assume usually from complications of diabetic ketoacidosis yeah and so it would happen in a matter of weeks some cases days in some cases months then along came Alan and Alan created this amazing so called Alan diet and that was essentially a low calorie high fat nutritional regimen that had almost no enriched carbohydrates and if you use that approach they were able to extend life to a few months in some cases a few years but it required incredible precision and dr. Joslin and others had adopted this approach in a desperate attempt to extend life but other than that there was nothing you could do when people just wasted away so it was one of these things that people feared greatly because if your kid got type 1 diabetes that was it you were gonna watch them disappear and you said this earlier and I didn't interject but it's probably worth reiterating you talked about how important insulin is you use the term catabolic but in contrast to its role which is as such an anabolic gatekeeper and therefore in the absence of it you enter this catabolic state so talk to me about what you mean by the anab ilysm of insulin ultimately insulin is a key factor that's regulating virtually every cell in the body and and it's essentially deciding whether a cell is in a state of feast or famine and so if you're in feast it's time to take nutrients and park them in the cell and if it's famine hey let's mobilize some nutrients and make them available to keep the organism alive and so it's a master regulator of your state of metabolism and so if you take a normal none diabetic human and you fast them for 24 hours you discover that they're circulating insulin values especially if a healthy an adult or exquisitely low but if you then take that same person you give him a 75 gram Buccola challenge you can get their insulin values too exquisitely high levels so it's a dynamic hormone it's changing rapidly in response to meals and everything else and it's helping you to sort of take these nutrients and park them away now in the fat cell I think most people have a vague notion of what's going on there's basically one door into a fat cell of a certification or Ria's Tara fication and then there's the door out which is lipolysis right an insulin acts very prominently at both of those so free fatty acids and triglycerides are highly regulated by insulin at both ends of that adipose cell what is the insulin doing at a muscle cell it's promoting glucose I've taken it in to skeletal muscle and it's a dynamic process it involves glute for these glucose transporters and essentially the glucose transporters are normally sitting in the cytosol and they translocate to the cell wall and now all of a sudden the muscle cell becomes permeable to glucose and glucose is pumped in so glued for is a passive transporter as long as it's going across the cell membrane glucose enters freely the active part of that is the insulin signal that tells the glue transported to go from the cytosol across the membrane right and then so taking the other extreme of that which is when someone is fasting or starving which is effectively what's happening in type 1 diabetes at the cellular level they don't have insulin how does the lack of insulin promote the breakdown of actual muscle so this negative nitrogen balance could because I'm assuming that well a lot of that muscle that breaks down is used for gluconeogenesis wouldn't that patient if you're measuring urinary nitrogen levels also be in a profound negative nitrogen balance yeah every step of protein metabolism is I remain of the major steps are influenced by insulin as well so you're out there making proteins or you're breaking them down it also also influences the glycogen that's in skeletal muscle and heart and kidney so in the presence of insulin you're putting more glycogen into skeletal muscle or in the absence you're gonna you're gonna break it down or also with just work boy it's a thin razor's edge that hormone too much of it really bad stuff too little of it really bad stuff as long as you can it's a pretty wonderful hormone and it because it's so fundamental to eukaryotic cells it seems to also influence things you would never even imagine like for instance lifespan and aging and so it's really it's really a deep and fundamental signal around where cells are do you have a great sense of how insulin relates to IGF it certainly plays a role in the inverse relationship between some of the binding proteins so we know that as insulin level goes up sex hormone binding globulin goes down and therefore high levels of insulin we'll all things equal reduce the level of circulating androgens because more of them are being bound up what's the relationship between insulin and the binding protein for IGF IGF binding proteins 2 3 etc I'll probably get this wrong but I think it's AI g f1 can go down in the presence of high levels of circulating insulin acutely and it's a one way to be able to diagnose a very short term hyperinsulinemia this is something that we often struggle with in

[00:45:31] Pediatrics we bizarrely even have some people who will take away too much insulin trying to pretend that they have hypoglycemia by some measure and then we go and measure in the blood and you can actually measure for IGF PP 1 and it can be down so the bp1 goes down so in many ways IGF would go up then if the if the binding protein goes down the free IGF should be going up with insulin right assuming I remember this correct well that's sort of what I see clinically right the more hyperinsulinemic a patient is all things equal to higher you tend to see their IGF and that's always been my assumption as to why just based on the parallel analogy with the

[00:46:05] I'm ashamed to say I'm too lazy to have like spent the time looking this up well the other thing I would just point out is that I insulin and igf-1 really are intensely overlapping in the way they work and insulin does not bind as a monomeric hormone it's actually a dimer and it can be a heterodimer say you can have two insulins or you can have an insulin and igf-1 or you can have two

[00:46:29] IGF ones and they can bind to receptors and there are even hetero receptors where it's an insulin receptor and an igf-1 receptor each bound by their cognate ligands Derek Laroy at Mount Sinai has done kind of work for years and when you block these heterodimeric receptors you can completely alter metabolism implying that the role of igf-1 on glucose homeostasis is really quite powerful yeah and and we probably won't get through it today but there's also a IGF and its relationship to growth hormone is actually quite interesting when it comes to diseases because it seems to have very different effects on different diseases there are certain diseases that seem to go up in risk as IGF goes up and there are others that seem to go down whereas insulin seems a little less confusing but we'll will obviously come to that so in the late you know 1910s when Banting and best are working with dogs do they know that they're trying to isolate like do they have a sense of where to look for this hormone yeah so

[00:47:26] Banting has an idea actually the story of how he comes up with the idea is amazing and really surprising so he's a surgeon and a dead end practice in London and this is London Ontario and in Ontario and he can't make his mortgage he's a he's a veteran of the world war at that time there had only been one and he's trying to get this general surgery practice going but he's bored and he doesn't have that many patients and so he he's a reader and he's thinking about ways to try to contribute any reads in in this journal article which describes how people who have stones in the pancreas end up with these strange islet like structures or islands of cells and so essentially what happens is the pancreas first of whatever reason if it's obstructed by a stone and it has a blockage what you end up with in the residual after the pancreatitis occurs are these weird round cellular structures and so it had been known from a couple other scientists that there might be something in there that was involved in diabetes so he comes up with the idea of wow maybe what I could do is block the outflow of the exocrine pancreas which makes these digestive enzymes force the pancreas to eat itself alive and then I will take this residual muck that comes from the pancreas and try to purify whatever is within it to see if that is some sort of that might be useful for type 1 diabetes it's a genius moment that comes to him in the middle of the night he writes it down michael bliss actually found the notebook page from his bed stand where he wrote this so then he goes to you every set Ron toe which is this very sophisticated place and he meets and he knocks on doors and he finds this guy he was a famous professor of metabolism he says I got this incredible idea I want to isolate this thing that must be in the pancreas that would be the treatment for type 1 diabetes and the guy's like you're out of your mind he's a bit nervous a really cool idea let me tell you about it and what happened is this professor is about to go on break for the summer and to go off to Scotland and so he leaves

[00:49:41] Banting with a very short lease he says look oh yeah I'll allow you to do a few experiments and I can give you a few resources but you basically got to finish your experiments by the end of the summer and so Banting is there and then he essentially gets a medical student who has the dumb luck to draw this crazy experiment with Banting and that's that's Charles best so there they are on in this cramped hot you know laboratory in Toronto and amazingly they are able to isolate this substance that has the ability to lower blood glucose in dogs and they're doing this in dogs as well or is it that's right so they do these so what they do is they carry out this intervention the pancreas eats itself alive they get this this muck and they were able to isolate some crude extract and then take it and put it back into a dog that they've removed the entire pancreas of and lower the blood glucose it's like this incredible moment

[00:50:36] I mean in this is 1922 what's even more extraordinary is that they're able to take this observation and then they eventually fairly quickly do an experiment or they lower the blood glucose of a medical student who has type 1 diabetes with this super crude extract so they're able to prove that it works in man and so then they write the paper and the you know the paper gets rejected you know in it and and then they're able to submit it to a Canadian

[00:51:07] Journal and it gets accepted that low Canadian bar that's like been the secret to any success I've had and they ultimately won the Nobel Prize it's amazing and if you think about night by the way it's sort of one of like every year there is a nobel prize awarded in medicine or physiology i believe is the designation there are a handful of them that stand out in a way that can't be described and this is one of them the Banting and best nobel prize is you know one of a handful of places where the trajectory of clinical practice was altered dramatically ya know i think just by virtue of the fact that we're both physicians we can be we can feel proud by association that our profession was able to do something so remarkable how long was it before recombinant insulin was used because after Banting and best they were still using insulin from animals yeah purified from pigs it's amazing it went on for years and years and they would take these these giant vats and was either from beef or from pigs it wasn't until the 80s if i recall that they figured out how to make insulin inside of e.coli once you know Paul Berg Genentech yeah yes yeah so there's an amazing article about the molecular biology of modern insulin and you know that was basically a race and it was a bunch of it really was it's a biotech arms race to figure and it's some of the greatest stories in science are of that arms race of the 80s they knew that human insulin could be incredibly useful for this population and part of the reason is if you're taking a foreign product like Pig insulin you can develop antibodies and some kate in some cases those antibodies can be blocking to the point where insulin you start to have to increase the doses greater and greater so human insulin was known to be a goal and they were eventually able to produce it

[00:52:56] Genentech did this they sold the rights and now there there are multiple modern human insulin on the market not to get into a controversial topic but can somebody explain to me and you can you can opt out of this question if it's too politically sensitive but can somebody explain to me why the hell recombinant insulin is still so expensive well what's interesting about recombinant Celyn as it used to be cheap so back when I was a fellow a vial of insulin which is a thousand units cost about 25 bucks and that would last that could last a well-managed patient for a month a month or more right and and today what is a thousand units of recombinant insulin 300 plus maybe $400 u.s. right now I know a lot about economics and I kind of forgot my tables of inflation but I feel like that haste inflation a little bit so how is it that we have more competitors in the space better technology today and we've watched a log fold increase in the price of this stuff that must be driving a lot of people nuts including those who can't who don't have insurance and frankly the insurance companies themselves that have to pay this it's a disaster on many levels it's really a disaster for people who are on the margins of society but one modern care and are willing to pay for it but they can't get insulin at the same price that for instance you could if you walked into a pharmacy in Spain you could buy a vial of insulin for 25 bucks there it's three or four hundred dollars here the difference unfortunately is that the federal government is how shall I say a promiscuous customer so they are have thus far have not been able to drive the price down because they're willing to essentially pay whatever the the the sellers charge and that's a big problem and it speaks to the lack of market influence in things like insulin so now let's go back to where I distracted you from a long time ago which is you finish your fellowship you're a card-carrying pediatric endocrinologist who knows how to target high ish levels and we were about to talk about the trial oh yeah that explained the complications that basically led to the why we care about this okay so if the discovery of insulin is like the first real modern chapter in type 1 diabetes then the diabetes control complication trial is tat is chapter 2 and it's based on a brilliant and very clear idea which goes if people with type 1 diabetes are at risk for terrible complications and we haven't really said this but they're at risk for all the complications that people with type 2 yeah type 2 diabetes get cardiovascular disease and kidney disease and diabetic retinopathy and blindness and limp amputations well actually I'm glad you brought that up because I've been a little delinquent in my job as hosts and taking things for granted can you explain why people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes have so many of these complications that we refer to

[00:55:55] I guess loosely as microvascular complications and we'll get to the macrovascular of course but just start with those ones you mentioned why why the amputations why the blindness the blindness is from abnormal vessel growth and it appears that there are these weird locations that can occur and there's a series of damages that happen in the vascular endothelium and then there's new vessels that are created and the new vessels are fragile and they can ultimately break and bleed and the kidney some it's a very different set of mechanisms but basically very high glucose can alter the epithelia of the kidney that's involved in filtering blood and making urine and then why the amputations of toes and things like that yeah so that's altered healing from a couple of things so one is that there's something called diabetic neuropathy where the nerves simply don't work well and exposed to high glucose they lose their responsiveness and so sometimes people will for instance have a wound in their foot but they're not able to actually realize that they have that wound and so then they also have abnormal healing because the micro vasculature isn't behaving appropriately and the sum total can be very bad diabetic wounds that fail to get better with antibiotics and ultimately result in amputation and this is like the most common cause of preventable amputation in the United States it's also the most common cause of preventable blindness in the United States and probably also renal feeling I was just about to say it's gotta be the leading cause of kidney disease so the relationship between the average blood glucose which we proxied by this hemoglobin a1c and these complications you mentioned that's a monotonically increasing relationship correct pretty much yes so the DCCT really figured this out so at the time they did they designed this trial they're thinking well this all this terrible stuff has happened these people would happen diabetes and so there was a group of people who thought well it's just genetics you know it's obvious because we have two patients and one who has pretty good control the other one is pretty good control but one gets complications what were the years of enrollment in the DCC so this is in the late 80s actually mid 80s and it was reported out of the New England Journal

[00:58:06] I believe in 1993 and prior to that you're saying it wasn't obvious that the differences in these complications could be explained by the differences in their average blood glucose that's right and there were endocrinologist who believed quite strongly that it was foolish and perhaps even dangerous to carry out a clinical trial to test the basic idea so the core idea is does tight control ie near normal blood glucoses confer protection from diabetes complications and the primary outcome measure was were micro vascular it was kidney and I and the reason that these physicians who we can look back at now and obviously with with the benefit of so much hindsight sort of consider that their views were silly they weren't bad doctors right there they had something to be afraid of on the other end of this they were concerned about hypoglycemia so so they'll talk about that for a moment that's it that's there's got to be a really bad boogeyman on the other side of this for people to be so worked up about letting glucoses get really high so the issue with type 1 diabetes is we think that high blood glucose is are conferring risk of complications but the problem is you can't just throw in a bunch of insulin and then normalize glucose because you will cause somebody to go low and with type 1 diabetes the crux of the problem is the volatility in blood glucose so it's not just so simple that you can figure out the amount of carbohydrates you're gonna eat and take some insulin and your blood sugar is gonna be normal because even if you eat the exact same thing every single day as anyone knows who has type 1 diabetes and

[00:59:37] I only know this because of friends who have it your level of stress how much sleep you had last night how much exercise you've done or not done Frank can even in the presence of the identical foodstuff produce completely different insulin requirements and the other things in food like fat and protein also alter gastric emptying and the end result is a tremendous amount of slop in variants in the system and so we in the medical field often have this fantasy that well we can just come up with some sort of formula for here's your insulin to carb ratio and so

[01:00:13] I tell you that and then you're supposed to follow it and then if you come back and your blood glucoses aren't exactly perfect I the physician would say well you obviously didn't follow it your you know they use this terrible tournament as a non compliant which means you you didn't comply with what I told you to do it's grotesque in no format or no arena is it more ridiculous than this one when you realize how difficult this is and as

[01:00:39] I learned from a patient of mine actually this was actually probably the first person I was ever involved in the care of as a medical student and we became very good friends he ultimately died from colon cancer but he was a pilot and after during one of his bouts of you know sort of remission he took me to flying and he actually let me fly once we got up he you know he took his hands off the stick I had a stick and I was flying and he said you got a look at the horizon don't look at the instruments because if you look at the instruments you're gonna constantly be chasing them and you're getting to this pilot induced oscillation and obviously that's called instrument flying which you learn to do way down the line but as a total rookie you have to be able to fly off the horizon and it was amazing to me how much easier it was to fly that way and in some ways that's what happens when patients or physicians would get frustrated with this inability to manage this is you you tend to go too high then too low then too high and too low and then you are vacillating wildly in these glucose levels and again yeah you see these huge sine wave excursions and and some of them can be credibly volatile so

[01:01:42] I'm going to go back to the DC CT so they have this idea that they're gonna somehow normalize blood glucose but then there are some people physicians who say well that's a terrible idea because you can't actually normalize blood glucose cuz you're gonna make a bunch of people hypoglycemic so there's a group of people who are arguing against the DC CT there's another people including Elliot

[01:01:59] Joslin they're saying no we need to understand if we can reduce the risk of long term complications so they carry out this trial it's intended to be a 10-year clinical trial and they it's fourteen hundred and forty one patients they're relatively recent onset type one diabetes they're largely late teen and adults and it's a very difficult trial to do because there were no established best practices to achieve near normal blood glucoses at the time so the average hemoglobin a1c for the population is around 9% at the time that was just what where they were that's the lowest glucose you could have to not have hypoglycemic events right yeah and sort of that's where people were in order to not dump massive amounts of glucose in their urine and sort of look okay and in some cases people are taking insulin once a day quite often people were taking in some once a day and someone who's got a hemoglobin a1c of 9% is not going to live a normal life their life expectancy is truncated dramatically and their quality of life is going to be even by their 40s they're going to be quite compromised yeah so we know now from

[01:03:02] Swedish studies that somebody with the average hemoglobin a1c has about a orwhat of 9 of 9% has approximately a six-fold increased risk of death and a six-fold risk increased risk of cardiovascular disease and so that's shocking and again these are healthy people who are doing their best but the system just didn't work so in the DC CT they they say we want to normalize blood glucoses in the population and try to get them from 9 all the way down to the non-diabetic range somewhere under 6 and they put together all of these centers and what they did was they mandated conference calls and on the conference calls they shared best practices they crowd-sourced it if you will and so they didn't have any idea how they were going to achieve their goals but they ended up ultimately learning how to do it and it involved phone calls and involved frequent visits and cajoling and they're able to reduce the MNC from 9 to 7 percent in the population they intend to do this for a decade there's a safety and monitoring board that's following the curves the primary outcome measure is diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy and the safety and monitoring board sees a huge difference in between the control and the intervention group and they stop the trial and because they and the reason is they felt that this was 7 years in and they felt that they there was now unethical in the yes it was unethical to deprive the general population of what they have learned so so they stopped the trial there's a giant talk of the American

[01:04:38] Diabetes Association that describes these immense differences there's a paper that's only known that's in the New England Journal of Medicine it's amazing wonderful paper and it changes type 1 diabetes forever because it says that we can begin to reduce complications and the work that we do is incredibly important for this patient population in some ways it makes the field of modern type 1 diabetes care because it says there really is something you can do other than holding hold somebody's hand and look for complications but on the other hand it actually breaks the field because we don't have the apparatus to routinely achieve the kinds of outcomes that the

[01:05:18] NIH was able to do because they had near infinite resources they spent over a hundred million dollars for a relatively small number of patients hundred million dollars for 1400 patients over seven years yeah that's a staggering sum of money where did it go I mean I know not being critical of that I'm just saying like what was so expensive about that study coordinating centers and you know buying people's time to be able to care for them to call them cajole them there's a lot of there's a lot of work that was done Wow that I did not realize it was that expensive and that's 30 years agos dollars yeah I could have it wrong we'll have to look this out okay yeah we we've got the team to look that up but but I'm guessing directionally you're right that it was it was a copypasta mount of money yeah was there a sizeable or noticeable increase in the hypoglycemic events would that tighter control from 9 to 7 yes there are many more hypoglycemic events and there was weight gain and so when they jack up the insulin people found themselves eating more carbs and eating out of the hole and over time was that actually the case that they know that the people who gained more weight consumed more of one type of food than another no not necessarily but practically if your blood glucose is low the only thing that's gonna get your purse back up is carbohydrates oh so I see so it's they were chasing carbs when they were overshooting on insulin right and this is one of the continual problems with type 1 diabetes is if you jack up the insulin and your blood glucose is low there's only one thing you can do to get your back up I guess you could go out and you could exercise and intensely but it won't happen fast enough so acute carbohydrate is essential so we don't really know not to get off on a tangent we don't know if those patients gained weight because of the hyperinsulinemia per se as a primary driver or if it was sort of not necessarily a root cause but more of a tangential driver that ultimately forced more of this sort of hyper phasic response indirectly to compensate you're asking a really important question which is is the weight gain in type 1 diabetes absolutely obligate is it coincident with type control and it was argued by many that the only way towards tight control would be weight gain and by the way in the years since the DCCT what we've seen is a huge number of people with type 1 diabetes have gained weight and some cases uncontrollably and that is a really serious problem and moreover in that the people who have gained the most weight have had poorer cardiovascular outcomes there's a weak

[01:07:44] Association so I'm gonna just talk about the bigger picture of the DCCT so that the trial only happened for seven years and then the cohorts merged back to the same blood glucose and now they're followed for 25-30 years wait a second when they merged did they merge to seven or merged to nine yeah and they merged to eight so what happened was the people who had hemoglobin a1cs of nine learned the benefits of tighter control and they did their best and the people at seven no longer under the you know grip of the best-in-class care drifted up to eight that's right became where people landed it became the new normal with a significant standard deviation and within it some people just had better worse and then you follow these people over the subsequent 23 plus years and it turns out that there are immense differences in in major kidney disease and in cardiovascular disease and even death so the people who at least for seven years had tighter control versus less tight control but then for 23 years were identical to their peers still retained some benefit from the seven years yes thirty years earlier in cardiovascular disease which is amazing and death so that what kind of hazard ratios do you recall I'm not sure I'll be able to remember it off the top of my head we'll link to all this stuff at least in the primary outcome measure for the for the cardiovascular trial it's approximately 1/3 less of the primary outcome measure so that's really exciting and it suggests that if you were able to routinely achieve blood glucoses in the near normal range you could drop your risk for cardiovascular disease accordingly to something that was approaching a normal healthy non diabetic person that's pretty amazing but it also puts a lot of pressure on us as a field so if you were to have a device a magical device that could measure someone's glucose in real time mm-hmm and you were to put this on somebody 30 years ago back when the standard of care was you know minimize the hypoglycemic events we're gonna tolerate a hemoglobin a1c of 9% can you estimate what the standard deviation of glucose would have been on that measurement do you have a sense of how high that could have been yeah because I put continuous glucose monitors on teenagers who don't listen to me about some of those numbers yeah so you might see blood glucoses up around in some cases 180 or 200 with a standard deviation of 100 and so again poorly controlled typing you know my standard for myself right which is under 20 90 plus or minus if I'm fasting or on a you know sort of ketogenic diet I'd like to see it plus or minus less than 10 and when I'm just eating ad libitum it's sort of less than 15 yeah a hundred is amazing a hundred means you're bouncing around non-stop which you never normal and you feel so bad for these patients because even if they intermittently decide okay today's the day I want to get this right like you just can't chase that down that is so difficult I don't even know it's hard for me to physiologically even think about what's happening in those patients and so that kind of volatility is just driven everybody insane because they think like there's got to be a better way there's got to be a better way and you know anybody who lives a type one diabetes they're constantly being asked okay well what about a cure I hesitate to even use that word but like some sort of definitive biological therapy and you know and we've heard it all along about the possibility of stem cells or or some sort of maybe an auto loop pancreas that would measure your glucose and administer insulin or maybe some sort of beta cell regenerative therapy or something that combined with something that shuts down the immune system so those three concepts are constantly trotted out as potential avenues but from what I can tell as a scientist many of those things are years and years and years away decades maybe even centuries and so the problem is like what do you do now to support people who live with type one diabetes how do you reduce that volatility so I remember reading us a paper a few years ago who's actually right after you and I met that I got more curious about this and especially then once I started wearing a CGM which was shortly after that and have basically never taken it off I started to figure like I started to think okay well from my angle it's how do you use these in people who don't have diabetes to drive better health right right and one of the questions I wanted to understand was was there any evidence that variability in blood glucose per se beyond the average so if you have someone whose average blood glucose is a hundred plus or minus ten or fifteen versus someone who's a hundred plus or minus thirty is there a difference well the hemoglobin a1c would give you the same answer and even the average glucose does and I believe I found some data that suggested that cognition was impaired during developmental years by higher variability yes and I think it was even independent of absolute glucose level and that was very frightening to me not individually because I was out of that loop but thinking about kids with type 1 diabetes who now have yet another complication to be concerned with which is cognitive impairment if the variability of glucose is too great it's well known that you know diabetes complications are increased with increasing anyone sees so kind of surprising piece of this is very short exposures to high blood sugars can't completely change gene expression in a whole bunch of genes like endothelial cells so there's a school of thought that says that diabetes complications are really around the exposures to these weird toxic levels of blood glucose that can occur what do you think toxic is how high well you know they always do it experimentally by turning everything up to 11 so you never really know yeah but what you can say is it is surprising and weird that a short almost evanescent exposure to a very high blood glucose could change the way genes behave and cells in a dish and so that that suggests to me that diabetes complications may not be so simple as a sort of on/off and between glucose and hemoglobin or glucose and some other protein you could have permanent profound changes in the way a cell behaves based on intermittent exposures to very high blood glucose so whether that's volatility or it's an absolute lesson oh wow but it still puts it just like nature to with us like that I mean you have to deal with some epigenetic change in response to a glucose but man it's so unfair but in the end it shows you that we had a very superficial understanding of diabetes complications years ago and again now there's a whole rich field that's devoted to this idea of these windows of hyperglycemia permanently altering these important cells that ultimately contribute to diabetes complications you're making me question my elaborate cheat meals sometimes it's just I'm admit this now to you and everybody else a couple of days ago I was like you know

[01:14:38] I've been so good for so long I've been doing my this than anything and like there are just a handful of junk foods I can't get enough of and one of them is mini wheats so I decided to have a box of mini wheats that's not a typo it's not a bowl of mini wheats a box of mini wheats right meaning if you have a big enough bowl you can put the Box in the bowl so I had a box of mini wheats in a bowl and boy if you really want to know why that's not a good idea just wear a CGM and not to mention the splitting headache I had like an hour and later yeah I get headaches I mean I thought I was gonna die I I'd feel better if I had six drinks I think my head would have hurt less my blood glucose hit like 170 now again that's in the grand scheme of things probably not that high for someone who's got type 2 diabetes or type 1 diabetes but for someone who's not diabetic that's a pretty staggeringly high I haven't seen a level at high in years and you think like hey these these these mini wheats are promoted as like healthy part of a healthy breakfast and so imagine there's no one's eating a box but yeah but you know if you think about this in the context of your kids imagine dropping your kid off who if your kid has type 1 diabetes you drop them off at a birthday party and there's cake and there's no grease free son and there's Cheetos and all this stuff is essentially carbohydrate and if your child is and none of them are real carbohydrates that's the problem right it's all like these fake carbohydrates it's one thing if they were like alright we're gonna grind up some wheat and you know you're gonna have a piece of bread like which has its own issues but yeah these things that you've described are they're like they're basically IV infusions of glucose let's imagine that you drop your five-year-old off at a birthday party and you know they have diabetes and you give them and they're wearing an insulin pump and everyone knows what they wanted what they're supposed to do and out of sight of all the adults the kid eats two cupcakes that's the equivalent of the of the box of Wheat Thins that mean no hope but it's funny you bring up Wheat Thins that's one of my kids favorite things as he called them Whedon's but knows many weeks anyway oh yes yes it's just nonsense it's basically breakfast dessert so again this thing was really perplexing for me and part of you know when I really understood how challenging it all was was spending time with people who live with type 1 diabetes and looking and seeing what they do and I didn't really get this as an endocrine fellow and we had this standard feel about okay you're gonna check your blood sugar before each meal and at bedtime and then you're gonna eat certain number of meals that involve certain number carbohydrates and we had this fantasy that we're just going to sort of make people live in what I call the diabetes ICU which is a prescribed number of carbohydrates and timing and then we're going to sort of work towards making sure that everything was very predictable and then blood glucoses would be near normal much of the time and I lived in that fantasy world unperturbed by reality until I became close friends with several people who have type one and then I began to see what they what they do so for instance I my friend Mary

[01:17:50] Ann is a pediatric endocrinologist who works at Boston Children's and one time we were at this restaurant and she's we're at Bertucci's you know so pizza place and she and and she has type she has type on diabetes and she's eating a Caesar salad and I see her picking the croutons out I'm like what are you doing and she goes oh Jake I can't eat these things I'm like what are you talking about she's like if I eat those these carbs my blood sugar will just go loopy so what I discovered it let's just pause for a moment you know all of the molecular biology you know how many grams of carbs are in that right you've been managing patients through their food with insulin and now you're watching one of your peers pull out what's probably 15 to 20 grams right of croutons yeah but it's virtually like it's something that wouldn't even alter your blood glucose and yet she's saying to you if I eat these things now I'm really gonna be chasing this for a while and she said and I won't be able to figure out the right dose of insulin because of all the fat that's in the salad dressing she goes I've just found that it's easier for me to not eat this stuff so I looked at that and I realized like this is the ultimate hack this is somebody who figured out like the ultimate biohack she's trying to make her blood Sugar's near normal all the time she discovered a group of foods that she needs to avoid and so she avoids them and what did she figure out

[01:19:13] I mean presumably most of what she needed to avoid was carbohydrates but where there's some that she found and and I assume she did not have a CGM at this point in time that's right so this is all on finger sticks yeah this is doing it the really hard way it's just testing 10 times a day or something yeah yeah do they even have feeling left in their fingers at this point but quite often they won't so they go after and people use finger stick testing will use one spot over and over again and it becomes numb and that's a way to be able to do it without pain and I just know from when I'm doing a lot of finger sticking like the bruising and the discoloration and the discomfort and and

[01:19:50] I think to myself you know it's one thing when I'm doing this as a grown-up who's choosing to do this it's quite another thing for a kid who never signed up for this to be going through this amount of pain yeah and for their parents and for the parents to think about all the other things that could happen like for instance we you know unfortunately we have kids who disappear so we have teenagers who go off to college you know and they party with her friends and potentially take the same dose of insulin that they would have taken and they have fatal hypoglycemic episodes and that doesn't happen often but when it does it's devastating it's really awful and that sits in the back of parents Minds and that kind of anxiety means that nobody ever really just gets to be a parent or a kid because there's this constant fear of is what's my blood sugar is it high or low and and I think of it as a cognitive load it's the burden of having to think non-stop about your diabetes and if you can imagine that volatility the roller-coaster blood sugars that are going up and down you're gonna have to think about it non-stop and I think that the cognitive load in some ways is probably a really pivotal factor in the anxiety and depression that's associated with type 1 diabetes so there's a whole category of very complicated mental illness and that people with type 1 diabetes have approximately 45 or 50 percent will have depression or anxiety and it can be really debilitating and of course we don't really have any way of knowing is what percentage or what amount or proportion of that debilitating mental illness is resulting from the physiology of the hyperglycemia the glucose fluctuations and the hyperinsulinemia or the relative hyperinsulinemia versus this much more difficult to track metric of the cortisol levels that accompany this stress or other things that we couldn't even measure if we wanted to that accompany that as you put it out like that phrase cognitive load I mean what's the current thinking on that I didn't realize that there did you say 40% yes ashin yeah but that seems almost impossible to believe well I'm imagine let's imagine you have type 1 diabetes and you've lived with it for 20 or 25 years and and right now you're a little bit hungry and you're trying to figure out what your blood sugar is gonna be and you look down at your CGM and you get a number and you're thinking well like what do I have to do and when do I have to time the dose of insulin and will I get it right and think about the last time I gave insulin and I didn't give it right and I had that hypoglycemic episode and you know was embarrassing and so I'm it's a big really serious challenge in that I try to quantify the what I call the cognitive load using a diabetes distress scale and it's an adaptation of a published distress scale and I basically say to people okay I want to talk to you using a Likert scale a 1 to 10 scale about your diabetes related distress and so it's on a 1 to 10 scale and one means you know you have diabetes but it's not holding you back at all it's there it's in the back of your mind it's not bothering you you get to do what you want to do and the 10 means you have diabetes and you can't think about anything else and it's pretty much omnipresent and it alters your ability to carry out the things you want to do so if this is on a 1 to 10 scale so what's the median score for a teenager who has had this disease for five years or more who's on a high carb diet yeah 7 or 8 and I've seen people who have hemoglobin a1cs that are approaching 14 who are doing basically nothing to care for their diabetes teenagers who are really struggling and when I described this to them their answer is tears pour out of their eyes and because no one has ever actually asked them how do they feel and they will say a 10 but they can't even admit it because no one has ever considered that they have this terrible burden what they think is you know this kid doesn't do what everybody wants him to do you know he has got a hard head he's not listening to us but in fact the kid is not doing anything is thinking about it non-stop and it's racked with guilt and shame and and this is not just true of teenagers it's true of adults because the adults want to do a better job but they lacked the tools and the support to be able to carry it out and they blame themselves so this endless cycle of blame and shame and negativity is unfortunately in many cases reinforced by the medical establishment because now you've come in to get a hemoglobin a1c of 14 and what do you get you get spanked yeah you get you get a lecture about how you need to do a better job you told you're not compliant you might even be threatened with being fired by your doctor unless you do a better job you know you might not be able to make appointments here there's a privilege to come and see the

[01:24:51] Enola just and so people end up in this weird cycle of antagonism towards the medical establishment who apparently don't know that much about type 1 diabetes and certainly aren't empathetic about it and then their loved ones who are like well why can't he or she do a better job failing to understand him really complicated it is and there's no well-worn path in the journal populace on how to get to a better spot and so one of the really crucial elements of this which is so bizarre is that this diabetes distress or this anxiety or whatever it is is ego-syntonic and so it doesn't feel foreign people are depressed or anxious and they just think that this is the way life is going to be forever they can't imagine another world where they would feel better they just think that life sucks and when you get them I've worked with people where I've actually had the privilege of working with a few people who have dropped their hemoglobin a1c z' in half and the experience changed my life you can get somebody from anyone see of greater than 14 down to under 7 and when they talk about it they're astounded by the changes in their ability to think and feel and you know see the world around them and and the love that all these people who who were trying to help them have that they couldn't even recognize yeah that's that's very very powerful I don't I don't have anything that I could even think to add to that let's go back to the pizza store you need to shop you're watching your colleague what was her name Mary it is

[01:26:28] Mary Ann quinion you're watching Mary Ann pulled the croutons out of the Caesar salad and it it plants a bug in your in your mind right right how long from then until you've discovered this continuous glucose monitor a little contraption so only about four or five years I was a fellow at Boston Children's and it worked in a basic science research lab studying insulin signaling with Morris white and then I go off and I get my first job as an assistant professor at UPenn and I'm there and I set up so okay so you're at chop actually right so you're right yes you're bouncing around between the biggest children's hospitals in the world and I set up a lab studying beta cells and my idea was that I was going to use basic science to advance outcomes for people with type 1 and I have this background and a bunch of passion and trying to figure out ways to grow new beta cells in the hope is we'll be able to find some way to to do that safely and reliably and I also have a clinical practice that's focused on type 1 and other endocrine disorders and along the way I become very close friends with people who live with type 1 and I start to talk to them and follow them and I start to meet some of the reps that is the sales representatives for various companies including one who herself has type 1 diabetes this is Natalie Bellini so she's she's an amazing person who has type 1 and she's wearing this device which is this black hockey puck it's this Dexcom thingy what generation was that it was the very first and so this is approximately 2,000 maybe 7 and I thought well this is amazing because it's it's obviously a consumer device it's approved and then give it to patients and they could wear this thing and then they could figure out ways to improve their glucose excursions and actually I several of my friends went on them and what they discovered was the devices were incredibly frustrating because if you just wear the device and again iudex come or is this one burnt that's that's a company that's making a continuous glucose monitor and what they do is they take a probe that goes into your interstitial space say in your belly it's a very small needle and it sits in the space and what it's doing is its sampling the interstitial fluid which is the clear fluid that exists in between cells which roughly correlates to bug Lucas but is delayed by about 8 or 10 minutes and so the device essentially has glucose oxidase which is an enzyme and it's stuck onto this platinum wire it's basically an enzyme on a stick and so when glucose comes by and it does the enzymatic conversion it generates a charge which is transmitted down the wire and the change in the wire charges is transmitted to this hockey puck like device that tells you your glucose so that's pretty cool and it blows my mind when I see it working regularly for patients and my thought is okay we're gonna we're gonna prescribe these for all of our patients and then they're gonna figure out how to make their but glucose is better but as it turns out that first generation of C GM's was a dismal failure and the uptake was incredibly incredibly small in the population of people with type 1 diabetes and part of the issue is we didn't really know what to do so when we looked in the toolbox of trying to help people so they could live with type 1 diabetes we didn't find much other than badgering them to do a better job you know oh you need to check your blood glucose 20 minutes before the meal and give yourself insulin 20 minutes before the meal and do that in a very reliable way so that your blood glucose is normal but that's not realistic and for that matter no one really knows that they're gonna eat so there's a major problem in that we live in this fantasy world in medicine where we think people just need to carry out their lives with more precision and that will be the answer but the reality is variance is contained in human behavior it's just what we do so that idea badgering people doesn't work and then maybe it's exercise so okay as it turns out if you're a marathon runner and you have type 1 diabetes your diabetes control is much much better and part of the mechanism is via this insulin independent glucose uptake into skeletal muscle via a and P kinase so there's a whole there's two different pathways whereby glucose gets into skeletal muscle one is via the insulin dependent pathway we spoke about that before that goes to glute fourth the insulin independent pathway is working through exercise and scale and work of muscle and AM P kinase is this amazing enzyme that is seeing the energy status of the cell and if you if you alter the energy status of the cell through a tremendous amount of work you can basically drive a bunch of signals that go to tell the glute for to translocate to the membrane and skeletal muscle so now you get insulin independent glucose uptake in Scala so it's still through glute 4 right but it comes from inside the cell activation I assume yes mpk right activating ampk sends the glute 4 transporter up and in a non-athlete what is the relative difference between insulin dependent and the ampk driven glucose disposal in the muscle I'm not exactly sure but I can say that if for instance I take a kid who has type 1 diabetes and we have stable insulin doses and then they go on like a ski vacation with their parents and the kids are you know mostly playing video games and hanging out and then they go off to Vail and they ski for six hours a day those kids can can require non-stop carbohydrates until their parents figure out that they have a problem and then they end up on insulin doses that are reduced by two-thirds so the effect can be traumatic and normal non exercise dissociate glucose homeostasis I think a lot of is it is insulin driven and so as you carry out more and more exercise you invoke this pathway more and more yeah it's so interesting I need to look into this more because I've never I can't believe it didn't occur to me to look at the patients with type 1 diabetes to answer this question I've always wondered what the relative difference is and you know if you're taking metformin which is activating ampk and if you're exercising like crazy you should be able to dispose of glucose with lower and lower insulin levels right and so we can obviously measure this that's right in a oral glucose tolerance test the problem is we don't know why we don't know what it is that's is that that they're more sensitive to insulin mm-hmm which is that's a two-hour discussion out of it salad which you and I'll have over dinner right after this or is it that no their each unit of or heterodimer of insulin produces the same magnitude of glute for translocation but they're experiencing a benefit of this AMPK version in other words how much of the insulin sensitivity is really less about insulin and more about AMPK I think for people who are very athletic and who are focused on trying to reduce their body fat it can probably be a huge contribution and we have these adults who have type 1 diabetes who are down to 20 units of insulin and a normal 70 kilogram person would be on 60 or 70 units of insulin so the marathon runners who are thin of course they have very thin body habitus but many of those people are putting in 60 70 80 miles a week or on tiny doses of insulin so again so we got I have a patient by the way with type 1 diabetes who uses 5 units of insulin a day Wow he walks 6 miles a day minimum sometimes 10 and he does not really consume carbohydrates outside of vegetables in how much body fat I've never seen a higher out of panic ttan and lower leptin in a human

[01:34:16] I've ever measured or he is a lean mean machine yeah so those people are just my heroes it's so I'm thrilled to hear about this so if we're looking the toolbox we find like badgering people to do a better job maybe exercise and then like what else you got and so I'm looking around and I'm looking at this

[01:34:35] I'm going back to the exercise thing froma do you see a difference in I don't like the term aerobic but it people know what I mean by aerobic exercise versus strength training yeah I think that people who are doing distance who are that they actually have more contribution of this ampk pathway and that Laurie Goodyear has studied this for years and years she's at the Joslin and again there's this ampk exercise associated pathway is incredibly potent but it's all distance I don't think it's strength and then do you think there's a difference between going out and running 10 quarter-mile repeats at staggering intensity where you're burning through glycogen and the muscle verses you know so that would only be what a total of 2 and a half miles of running versus going out and running six or seven miles at a much lower intensity do you think there's a difference between those two yeah I think there's a huge difference but what I hear over and over again is the people who are the the distance athlete so the people were able to dramatically reduce their total amount of insulin and but again there's there's a relative debate and this is not well studied so you'd like to really care at a proper study with high-intensity exercise versus very slow long duration exercise but this idea of trying to sort of hack the system to reduce the total exposure to insulin and therefore reduce the volatility and the hypoglycemic excursions that's really exciting and I suspect that the people like your patient who have you know down to eight units of insulin these people have really cracked the code so when did the Dex come for you was it around Gen 4 that had really started yeah I'm a real impact you know the g4 was a special device so for me it wasn't just that that we replace the hockey puck at least in my life that the transformative thing was learning about dr. Richard Bernstein in his book and do you know Richard well I will only talk to him on a teleconference I I'm on a low-carb physician teleconference it happens once a month and I talked to him regularly then you got to get me on this how am I not on this I'd be very curious to just be a fly on the wall will I is there any chance I can get invited yeah so it's run by Verta health and it's focused on type 110 Verta yeah so it's low carb and type one and it's physicians who are very much interested in the intersection of type 1 and low carb yeah that's really cool I've never met dr. Bernstein but I've read his book and I've spoken on the telephone with him he's very graciously extended an offer for me to come out to his clinic and spend time and I would give anything to be able to make that time I just haven't been able to but it's safe to say he's kind of the guy who spent more time doing this and has more clinical experience in this than probably anyone else and because he did it with himself right it's amazing he actually got a Y acai blood glucose test her and has been using it at home forever so he's been blood glucose testing before anybody else did and he had this essential core idea which was carbohydrates caused by glucose excursions and that he has the so-called rule of small numbers which says that if you consume more carbs you need more insulin and therefore there's a greater opportunity to make a mistake and so if you've consumed fewer carbs you will consume less insulin and you'll have fewer mistakes it's a very simple idea it's laid out along with a ton of practical tips in his book he's incredible he figured this out and will link to his book but it's called the dr.

[01:38:11] Bernstein so diabetes diabetes solution yeah it's a Bible it's a tome and it's for type 1 and type 2 and it includes all sorts of pearls not just on straight diabetes but also diabetes complications it's really shocking and he had and again this is like the 11th or 12th edition he's been doing this for years and years he has a private practice he's in his 80s he lives in Westchester

[01:38:33] County New York and is working out and incredibly healthy so he figured out that if he avoided in carbohydrates and if you give medium and long acting insulin to cover protein and fat and basal metabolic requirements that you get blood glucoses very very close to normal and he typically prescribes a low carb high protein diet it's not low carb high fat it's not ketogenic what have we learned from Bernstein's experience on how insula genic protein is because that's somewhat debatable right I mean clearly protein stimulates some insulin and certain in right in vitro studies suggest it can be very insula genic what is the real-world experience tell us about that in my patients with type 1 diabetes who consume protein and don't cover it with insulin they can get these massive glucose excursions and we think in general there's a ratio of around 10 grams of protein to end up being 6 grams of carbohydrate but the problem is the kinetics are not immediate so you don't get gluconeogenesis in a matter of seconds it's delayed over hours if we had and doesn't it also depend on their nitrogen requirement so in other words you could have which is obviously true with glucose but you could have two individuals who are similar that the crude metrics say each of them gets 40 grams of protein but one of them has just finished exercising or lifting weights and the other one hasn't and you're going to presumably see very different glucose responses correct but the vast majority humans were at homeostasis and overall if you look at the USDA requirements is suggesting we need to consume 56 grams of of protein and then and the net result of that is approximately 6 grams of protein that go into metabolism so excuse me 7 grams so there's a net excess that's 49 grams that ends up being approximately what is that 30 grams of carbohydrate but another interview consuming high protein if you sit down to a 12 ounce you know ribeye and it also has fat which will delay the absorption the sum total of that could be 80 hundred grams of protein that turns into glucose that is at this massive slow wave that rises and stays high for much of the evening after you eat it which could be very frustrating so a lot of people who had type 1 diabetes think okay I'm gonna do this sort of low carb thing so instead of eating the pasta I'm gonna have a piece of fish and and some vegetables but there's no carbohydrate cool I don't need to take any insulin but then you get this weird glucose excursion that comes from the protein and the essence of the Burnstein method if you read his book is to try to cover protein with insulin and he uses regular insulin not short-acting humalog or novalog and the idea is the regular insulin is a' which is human insulin has a peak of onset within approximately an an hour or two in at last for six to eight hours and so it roughly very roughly corresponds with the kinetics of what protein will do to your glucose so what's unique about Bernstein is he's using this ancient form of insulin human regular human insulin instead of these very rapid acting analogues because the protein is absorbed and turns into glucose in a delayed fashion I've never really understood these rapid onset insulins because they seem to get back to this oscillation problem of I mean so the first observation of Bernstein is more hydrate means more insulin more insulin means more vacillation but now you're introducing another effect which is short-acting insulin causes more rapid changes in the glucose which can more easily result in you making another decision after that amplifies the signal instead of dulls the signal right so to go back to your analogy of the plane potentially what it means is a plane that can much more rapidly gain or lose yeah and you can get into a lot of trouble and unfortunately the insulin pump companies and even the insulin companies have advocated an approach that says look people who live with type 1 diabetes have tough lives we need to support them and they should be allowed to eat what they want and they should just cover for it and the problem is you end up with these crazy oscillations and the oscillations are associated again with a tremendous burden of illness and this cognitive load and this fear and this anxiety and you'll have to forgive my sort of snarky is Imboden want to sell more insulin - exactly because you've consumed well first of all everybody gets a pump and then there and then they're told that this is the way to feel normal your unshot so you go to pump and then you can just eat what you want and then and then then of course you consume insulin and you gain weight and you need more insulin so yeah and I'm not I am so not the conspiracy guy like but I also believe it's important to understand incentives and I don't think farm is evil I think far more good has come from the ability of being able to sell insulin and sell insulin pumps and all these things I really do think these are a net positive but I also think we have to keep in mind there there are modifications that you can make and obviously you live this with your patients that can give you 80 percent maybe of the of the joy that comes from eating I mean let's be honest I think to eat a restricted diet to eat a diet that is far fewer in carbohydrates you're giving up some pleasure there's just no doubt about it but if you could give up 20% of the pleasure of eating and get 80% more benefit in your health you know those are the kind of asymmetric benefits that

[01:44:17] I think in the long run probably you know pay off but but there it's still not easy I had to figure this out for myself and I had seen peep do low-carbon I didn't really understand it and I just started doing it myself so I gradually cut back carbohydrates and told approximately four years ago when we went low-carb as a family and my wife cleared out the pantry there were no more enriched carbohydrates in her house but he had teenage girls who were one was in college and one was going off to college and like I can I can remember the day and I had wanted to do it she wanted to do it we just decided to try it and so we went low-carb as a family and then we've stayed on it ever since so actually these days I'm probably katatak I wouldn't be surprised if my beta-hydroxybutyrate is well above one right now so when did you start to I mean I guess not now that I'm thinking about it it was we were probably at the g5 by the time you and I met and I remember you showing me data and I really think at the time your patience averaged about 5.7 and their hemoglobin a1c which is as normal as normal gets yeah and part of it you know it took me a while to understand the power of this and I say you also noted by the way that they had fewer hypoglycemic events yes and patients who were walking around at 7:00 yes the incredible thing is that you can reduce the excursions and people have very few lows and again I read

[01:45:39] Bernstein and I also learned of a recent Facebook group which is called type 1 grit type-0 and EG RIT and so that's a group of people who are followers of the Bernstein method and it's an amazing group of people who are supporting each other and you see CGM tracings and you see foods that they eat and you see happy kids or adults and you might see somebody complaining about their healthcare provider who didn't have a clue about low-carb and it's just sort of a conversation that happens in private amongst people who live with type 1 or those who are who have a loved one and there's also health care providers like me who are part of it and again so it took me a while to understand it and to understand its nuance and to start to iterate it but for me the real turning point was changing the way I practiced medicine so the problem with endocrinology is the schedules were so tight and the only way

[01:46:36] I could see patients was every you know 20 minutes or 30 minutes and to try to talk to somebody about something as complicated as living with type 1 3 or 4 times a year and also renew their prescriptions and go through their labs and document and all this stuff was impossible and I just decided for my own sanity that I needed to change my practice and so at the time I had a very small amount of clinical responsibilities because I was mostly in the research lab and I also had administrative responsibilities so what

[01:47:06] I decided to do was to make sure that that when I saw patients I only saw them at the end of the day and the idea was I'd see them starting at 4:30 and that we would just spend as much time as it took and then I would added on other patients but for instance you know some endocrinologist will run from room to room to room to room I only need one room because I'm gonna see a patient for an hour and then when we're done they leave and the new one comes in I don't need to run back and forth there's nobody else so I made a conscious decision that I was going to be more inefficient that I was gonna spend more time with people it's possible I was gonna spend much more time doing clinical work for the few patients that

[01:47:48] I saw but I wanted to carry out experiments just to try to determine what sort of impact I could have and the crux ative of the idea was if you have limitless resources that you make available to a patient and you really try to listen and understand and support people could you have transformative outcomes and fast-forward several years what I've discovered is that some people who medicine is essentially given up on you know these teenage kids who have hemoglobin a1cs of 10 or 12 or 14 who are basically on a superhighway to death you know these are the people who are going to have their first heart attacks when they're 35 that you can do a lot and help them and they feel paralyzed and they're looking for somebody who can really understand how difficult it is and to provide a level of comfort and compassion and sometimes the first five visits you end up talking about almost nothing at all but you're establishing a rapport and they get that you're gonna be in a different mold then maybe the other end just thirteen and so you know I try my hardest it's really hard for me because

[01:48:55] I love to talk but you know I try my hardest not to talk and to just ask open-ended questions and to be there and in general I found that if I'm asking questions and allowing them to have the space that we can open up and ultimately they can begin to acknowledge that it's really difficult they're looking for new ways they're eager to try it but they are distrustful of this idea that I'm just gonna sort of give them a short list like a recipe and then run away and expect them to do it so it requires patience and as this is especially true of teenagers who you know that feedback loop of giving them information and seeing them act on it is is delayed by all their growth and development and everything else and and especially with teenagers it's so important to suspend disbelief and to be there for them in a patient and loving way even if they can't immediately respond in the way you want so we now have in the toolkit of treating patients with type 1 diabetes we've got exercise we've got continuous glucose monitoring right we've got carbohydrate restriction are there any other apps or technologies or things that you think are paramount to helping or foods for that matter meaning packaged foods that are particularly used yeah you know in other words if you're a parent and you're listening to this if you're if you're a person and you're listening this who has type 1 diabetes and you just this is all news to you you're listening to this tenure this is totally blowing your mind what do you need to go out and get to get started well I mean CGM is essential and

[01:50:31] I'm assuming are there any insurance companies that are not covering CGM for type 1 plenty and Isis Christ seriously yeah well part of is a huge fraction of people in our country now have these high deductible plans so they're on the hook for their health care expenses and when their kid is healthy and everyone's healthy they're good and all of a sudden it gets diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and it's like ten thousand dollars a year yeah ten thousand dollars right the insulin cost alone can just kill these families on the CGM anyway so but CGM is really important and then in the toolbox there's a few other key thing but the the most important thing is information so you gotta have

[01:51:08] Bernstein's book you should be following type 1 grit which is this Facebook group which I'm again which is a wonderful place to learn about low-carb but there are wonderful podcasts and also some terrific YouTube videos talking about the intersection between low carb and type 1 I want to put in a plug for an organization called low carb Down Under ok which is really a wonderful group of people at dr. Roger Taylor in Australia in Australia yeah dr. rod Taylor is an amazing character he's an anesthesiologist in Melbourne and a passion passionate advocate and supporter of all things low carb and his organization goes around the world doing

[01:51:49] AV capture of low carb talks and so on YouTube they have a YouTube channel with over 8 million views on various low carb things including some terrific talks on low carb by for instance dr. Troy Stapleton who's a radiologist who got type 1 diabetes himself and figured out how to hack it using low carb where does he live he is in Brisbane ok he's an amazing person very nice so there's this growing community of low carb nerds who are trying to help people with type 1 and again there's a bunch of different places where it's happening there another really nice resources Adam

[01:52:25] Browns book which is called bright spots and land mines and he works for close concerns and he wrote this book essentially as the manual for diabetes that he wish he had been given and it contains lots of tips and tricks about how to think about living with type 1 and it's from wellness and to exercise to sleep all the way to very practical tips around low carb and nutrition and type 1 how careful does someone with type 1 diabetes need to be if they go on a ketogenic diet obviously in patients with a normal pancreas even those who are somewhat compromised by type-2 diabetes I'm not aware of any case of ketoacidosis right diabetic ketoacidosis but in patients with type 1 who have no insulin production that would have to be a real concern wouldn't it well I think that there are some interesting intersections in between hardcore I'm not talking about generic low carb or low carb high protein all of the Bernstein method but let's talk about the people who were trying to get into nutritional ketosis with a beta hydroxy butyrate that hovers around one to two well those people have a couple of unique problems and and one is diabetic ketoacidosis as you mentioned again for the folks to understand why that's the case in you or me even when

[01:53:43] I'm fasting you know and I fast for a week at a time my beta hydroxy butyrate level will reach six or seven millimolar right but it's not gonna reach 10 millimolar it's certainly not gonna reach 12 or 14 which is where we start to see the acidotic changes because eventually that ketone is going to get elicit some response from insulin right in the person who has no beta cell reserve that that ketone can go unabated so prolonged fasting and a person who lives with type 1 diabetes is probably a bad idea because you could get your beta hydroxy butyrate to six or eight or ten and you could get start to feel sick another issue is it's a new phenomenon called u glycemic decay u glycemic diabetic ketoacidosis and we're seeing this in these sodium-glucose cotransport ur inhibitors these sglt2 inhibitors and it's a very bizarre phenomenon but in people with type 1 diabetes who go on these sodium-glucose cotransport or inhibitors they can get a strange form of decay where their glucose is not elevated and it has confounded the field and there have even been deaths associated with us there's currently clinical trials and full disclosure I've been a consultant on one of these programs does this only occur in patients with type 1 diabetes or can patients with type 2 diabetes who are the predominant users of the sglt2 inhibitors also get this u glycemic ketoacidosis we think it's mostly type ones but it may also be type twos and the problem I think it's probably mostly type ones and here's the issue like how do you get this patients with type 2 can get DKA but largely it's at NU it's a onset it's not established disease the people who have type one who have decided to take these drugs by the way this is all off-label and I'm not at all advocating it there are clinical trials and we're trying to develop appropriate safety and monitoring for this listeners shouldn't be given free license to go on these things so there's really complicated but again if you're on a really potent glucose lowering agent which is what these sglt2 inhibitors are and you have type 1 diabetes and your insulin is infusing from from your insulin pump into your belly and the catheter plugs and it stops infusing insulin then normally you'd look at your

[01:56:04] CGM and you'd see ok my glucose is rising I must have a problem but if the glucose lowering agent is essentially dragging all that glucose out into your urine essentially what what it does is it's dragging away glucose which is the primary biomarker of life threatening insulin deficiency elevated blood glucose is the primary biomarker of life-threatening innocence efficiency of people who live a type-1 so when you look at your glucose and you see that it's normal and you're on an sglt2 inhibitors it creates a situation of what I would call cognitive dissonance where people just don't understand that they're in trouble and there may be a delay in between when they when they had to plug in their catheter or some other an interruption of insulin infusion and when they actually end up recognizing it and so I think that they end up receiving medical care away later it's also possible that they have elevations and ketones from these sglt2 inhibitors the beta hydroxy butyrate a little bit higher in the sglt2 treated population compared to the controls ok so that phenomenon a you glycemic DKA might also extend in rare cases to people with type 1 diabetes who are on nutritional ketosis and the way I think of it is some of them may have depleted glycogen because they're not fully fat adapted and many of them will have very little carbohydrate in their intestines because they just don't consume that much carbohydrate so those people if they have a plug in their insulin in their catheter might not see the same sharp rise in blood glucoses that you normally would and they might have a delay so this is all associated with pump use in other words we don't see this in people who are not using a pump well we also see it and people who forget to take their shots and oddly enough people with type 1 diabetes do forget shots on occasion especially the teenagers kids that I've cared for so yeah there's so many more things I want to talk about well one thing I want to just mention is is the intersection of nutritional ketosis and hypoglycemic awareness so there are people who are in hardcore ketosis who have circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate or one or two who become completely immune to low blood glucoses and I had a patient called me up and he was dr. Jake guess what my blood sugar is I said what he was 25 I said why are you calling me and not taking carbohydrate because I feel fine so what was his BHB Oh like two or three so he had done to George Cahill experiment where he had this and he Hill subjects were like 6 millimolar 7 millimole 2 or 3 relatively low to be thriving it yeah 25 milligrams per deciliter that's fairly over 1 millimolar and so so he has hypoglycemic own awareness and sort of to quote Peter teal like is this a feature or a bug if it's a feature well he's he's hyperglycemic unaware but he's fine he's bruising around and he had the gumption to call me up if it's a bug well maybe the the Delta in between his book glucose when he called me up with a book because at 25 and a fatal low might be from relatively small I have no idea there are many other things I want to chat about but based on some time constraints I know we need to wrap this up so maybe we'll have to come back and do a discussion about two other things I wanted to get into which is sort of the future of this I certainly remember being involved in the care of patients who got pancreatic transplants that's obviously a transient solution that often comes accompanied with a kidney transplant there are certainly beta cell transplants which have really not been that successful though it's always one of those things where it seems like it's just a year away from being perfect there's xenotransplantation zuv beta cells when you take the beta cells from another animal or something that's non-human that has all of its own problems associated with the immune response you talked a little bit about stem cells and then of course we've alluded to you know fully implantable or even non implantable but fully autonomous pancreas is so that's a whole other topic that would be great to come back and talk about but I'd like to close on one one other question which is if you were to reflect on everything you've learned in caring for patients with type 2 diabetes what are the most type montessori type 1 I'm sorry type 1 diabetes what are the most important lessons that would extrapolate to the non diabetic population when I look at the cardiovascular outcomes and the weight gain associated with hyperinsulinemia in type 1 I'm really shocked and again I think you have this unique population where you see the insulin that goes into them and you see it's direct impact on weight gain so we know that people consume very high carbohydrate diets and gain a bunch of weight in type 1 diabetes they're there at risk for cardiovascular illness and to me that just says that there's something about the standard American diet that's making us sick and ultimately we will be at risk for cardiovascular disease that's the primary thing that humans will die from what do you think it is about hyperinsulinemia that seems to drive this because this is the thing that I've always found fascinating is that so when you look at something like so let's look at the type 2 diabetic cohorts when you have patients who are using drugs like metformin which are lower in glucose to achieve better outcomes versus drugs that raise insulin because the patients with type 2 diabetes still have the ability to make insulin you can in both of those examples get the same glucose level but in one patient there's a higher insulin level those patients have equal microvascular outcomes but they have different macrovascular outcomes that's right which physic is a sort of natural experiment to suggest that the insulin is playing a bigger role on the macro vascular disease that glucose is playing the role in the micro vascular disease yeah and in the case of these

[02:02:01] SDLT inhibitors you know they're the first drugs that have really shown a profound impact on cardiovascular outcomes this is secondary prevention for cardiovascular disease in people who have already had an event into who also have type 2 diabetes so epic of flows and it's an amazing drug when reduce the cardiovascular complications by 40% and the drug essentially directs glucose into the urine and it suggests that circulating insulin values themselves might be in some way contributing to cardiovascular disease the simple answer is I don't know there's a lot too rich to bacon I mean do you think it is due to endothelial injury some people claim it's all about the kidney and fluid and the amount of salt retention and something else but to me as a basic scientist who grew up idolizing dr.

[02:02:54] Cynthia Kenyon and the amazing work that she did in C elegans from the daf-2 our complex those papers suggest that when you make a modest alteration in insulin signaling the worm lives twice as long and that fundamental observation has now been borne out in model organism after model organism but she did that I mean it's tough to it I mean I've I'm so familiar with Cynthia's work so I don't want to bore people with all of my nuanced thinking on this but it's hard to make that exact comparison to us right because that was a modulation of daf-2 and f-16 so they were she was upping FOXO effectively and downing IGF and to get the real step function change in longevity she had to calorie restrict the worms as well so there are so many moving pieces in those models that I guess well if look if you don't know the answer that means it's that we've still got some thinking to do on this I but but I want to go back to your patient the one you told me about who's super healthy who's on six units of insulin yeah I just I think that those people may be telling us something he's thin he's active he's on very little insulin and he's quite vigorous and I just wonder whether carrying out these tricks to try to reduce the your circulating insulin could be incredibly beneficial well part of the reason I love the CGM is it's the best proxy I have for what I don't have which is an area under the curve of insulin I'd love to some people ask me sometimes if you could wave a magic wand and have something that doesn't exist what would it be and my first answer is a metabolic signature for a toffee G my second answer would be every night I'd like to go to bed and have a little readout that says this is the total amount of insulin your pancreas made in the last 24 hours can you imagine adding that to the list of my aura ring the CGM all the other things I think are really really driving benefit in terms of health but to be able to actually know the a you see the area under the curve of insulin produced every day would be remarkable and amazingly someone with type 1 diabetes gets that for free they just have to look at the syringe and know what they injected yes so if there's one thing that that patient with type 1 diabetes has over the rest of us that don't it's that they can know at the end of the day exactly what their AUC of insulin is well we can only estimate it tangentially by looking at the things we look at which are you know meaning someone like me can look at average glucose and standard deviation of glucose and just try to minimize those as an indirect proxy for that AUC of insulin these people are really amazing and and the most successful are so dialed into their physiology they're doing quantified self before it was even a term yeah exactly well on that note
