## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music] AA so good to sit down with you brother you too thanks for having me so much to talk about but I feel like I just want to start with kind of getting a sense of the first time you heard about this was it was it a call from Darren like how did you even get involved in this project yeah I had a call from Darren it'd be G back on three years now and uh he said I want to do this series a docu series uh called Limitless on longevity and he said I know you're a fit healthy guy but we want to dive into the science and put you in some pretty extreme uh intense physical emotional situations and see how you fair and you can be the the guinea pig as far as the longevity science goes and um I said why not and initially it was supposed to be about a a three- we shoot and I know you and I have talked about this a lot the uh once Co hit the show got spread out over two and a half years and really it transformed in the best way possible I think um due to having hell of a lot more time than I think we'd first anticipated we were able to flesh out each episode explore the science in

[00:01:16] Greater detail I was able to grow throughout the experience and have different opinions on myself different opinions on how I approached health and wellness um so yeah I'm really proud of how it turned out and and I think was a lot due to the time span we able to shoot it on so kind of going back to this first of all I can't believe they bait and switched you on three weeks of shooting because like even before Co I was involved in four weeks of shooting so I don't know where that where anybody thought initially it was two and I was like I can't fit that in my schedule then it was three and then two and a half years so um and we joke about it right what do we call it Relentless we're GNA do a title change limited I was gonna call it um so where were you in had you you were done Avengers by that point yeah what did I I done Avengers uh I think I was doing the Press tour about the time this came up and uh yeah hadn't done love and thunder so I remember uh three years ago almost to the day I was sitting in my apartment here in New York with Darren

[00:02:22] Ruth uh Ary I mean every every you know sort of like the core group from nutopia and from protozoa and at that point so call it November of of 2019 they had the idea for six episodes it was still a bit foggy and it's kind of amazing how quickly they morphed that into that first shoot when we started in in January um was there anything about it that you had apprehension about doing

[00:02:48] I mean besides the time obviously time is a is is an issue based on your schedule but you know were you nervous worried anxious about doing this because this is not acting yeah I I was to be honest so I had never hosted anything before and it's one thing to you know hide behind a character and and and behind the mask of whatever individual you're playing in a film setting but then to to be yourself you know I've done obviously plenty of interviews and so on but to be in a situation like this where it was not only looking into the science but dissecting kind of my abilities and and seeing what my my limits were in in in one regard and um you know there was there was there's vulnerability that's required there I they had to be authentic so I you know didn't want to hold back but it's um yeah it was it was a little more of a hesitation or a lot more sort of thinking about it um as how I was going to come across and was it going to be genuine was it going to be appreciated or not or you know the all sorts of silly kind of doubts and and questions start to to creep in that I wasn't normally sort of thinking about um and then the thing transformed anyway as far as my initial was there any hesitation around taking a taking on the show I I don't think any of us knew what it was going to be you know the the three or four weeks that we'd talk about even when you involved and I spoke to

[00:04:16] Darren the last couple of days about this he said yeah it was a very different beast at the beginning and due to the time but also um I think due to what I was willing to do and the commitment I had for it it was allowed to evolve and become something bigger and um as did the challenges you know there were discussions about cold water immersion and we're going to do ice bars and so on and then it was like let's go to Norway and let's you know swim in in the Arctic

[00:04:45] Ocean and sort of uh became more and more epic uh as it went on it feels like you and I don't want to project this but so so correct me if I'm wrong but as I watched you because you know one of the things about this that was kind of a joy is how close we became as a group like you your team me D like the whole group kind of Co it's like you seem to trust the team even more and more as time went on and gave more and more of yourself because again you know everybody sort of got involved in this with the expectation this was going to be you know bracketed in terms of time and Co in part but also I just think the you know the the breadth of expectation of what this could be expanded the scope so much do you get the sense that you were willing to give way more of yourself as this thing went on that maybe you had committed to upfront absolutely and I think due to what you're saying about there's a trust there with the people I was working with

[00:05:47] I knew on paper that these were the experts in their field and all of you were going to take care of me and advise me the right way um but it's like you're working with a director and each of the experts in each of these series were kind kind of leading the way and they're at the helm and I was following and if I have a good relationship with my director and I and I trust them and that only comes through um experience and time spent then I'm going to give more of myself and and um take more risks and and not feel like it's going to be exploited in any way so the the first episode that we filmed was the fasting one look I'm going to do it with you and yeah it makes it a lot easier to go through this with somebody else so okay good good we'll we'll suffer together we will we definitely gone a day without food before I think I get pretty pretty cranky when I miss a meal certainly detrimental to my my happiness it's a pretty long time why why four days why not why not longer I mean what what is the what is the benefit with four days by that number 3 to 4 days is probably that window at which we do enough to change how your body is interacting with the absence of nutrients to basically do kind of a reboot on your system oh really do you think I'm going to be able to hold it together can in your experience you see a lot of people the first time they do it succeed in the next four days there is no doubt in my mind there will be a period of time in which you feel sluggish or tease yeah emotion kind of grumpy grouchy whatever um but you know if you really stop to think about it this idea that we kind of live today where we're sort of surrounded by unlimited access to food and we can eat three meals and snack in between them that's a it's a relatively recent addition to our species right and our ancestors would have gone days without food all the time and and not only did they have to do that they had the ability to in a period of starvation actually go out and

[00:07:57] Hunt I don't I feel that I think that shows third or fourth in the sequence um what did you know going into that and what was your expectation uh just that I had never fasted before and and I knew that this was going to be and I don't think you knew how long it was going to be or anything like that I mean we sort of sprung that on you in real time over that dinner we did I think the initial discussions were around like intermittent fasting and restricted sort of feeding windows and then it was like oh maybe we'll do a day or a couple of days and you're like no we're doing four days and uh by the way I suggested three did you I did and and they said no no we're gonna go one more because I said I wouldn't normally have a patient go more than three days yeah on the first one good and they pushed it they pushed it to four it was uh yeah I don't know I mean as we talked about many times the uh my expectation on kind of thoughts around would I be able to do it or not I think we're in line with yours I thought look we're going to commit we're going to do it but um we kept discussing you know you you kick into ketosis on day two you know and maybe day three and then got to like day four and I'm like n I'm not feeling any of the sharpness or alertness and then right in the afternoon when we went spear fishing probably at the right time too it kicked in and things started to sort of percolate I I I remember saying to

[00:09:22] Tanya I think it was tatan it might have been somebody else but I think it was tatan as we were getting ready to head out on the boat M I'm I'm that was the moment when I kind of realized how uh how sort of strong you were because I felt like you didn't have that much time to prepare for that exercise and it wasn't under ideal circumstances it's one thing to say you're going to do your first fast it's going to be for four days and it was hard enough I mean we worked out every day we had a bunch of other things that we had to do but then learning an entirely new skill around breathholding and spear fishing MH I mean would be challenging under any circumstance how much of that do you remember you know it's been almost three years since we filmed that but how much of that do you remember and was there ever a moment when you thought I'm not worried that something's G to happen to me but I'm worried that I'm not going to be successful yeah I think that was that was most most the episodes as I'd get to you know just doing the Arctic swim or doing the four-day fast or climbing the

[00:10:22] Rope I kept thinking if I don't complete this exercise it's not really an episode or it's pretty anticlimactic IC and so that it was definitely healthy amount of fear there kind of motivating me um but I don't know it also coming back to the why of it and why we're doing it and understanding the specific purpose of each challenge was you know on one hand looked like they were trying to kill me but on the other hand was like there was an incredible amount of information and knowledge and support and science there that says you do this you do this consistently you work this into your daily routine then the benefits are exponential so let think about Norway because that was we filmed that in I think February right we went right from

[00:11:10] Australia maybe had two weeks off and then we're all in Norway um my recollection of that was a beauty like I couldn't imagine um so we were there to do this thing but it was in this place that you would normally never go to I feel like we took like three flights to get there or something crazy um again Ross spoke about this a little bit last night which was it was another example of you were being asked to do something much quicker than you would normally do so right I think you didn't how many what was the first day you jumped in that water because it's different than an ice bath like you can sit in an ice bath all you want it's totally different experience to jump in the ocean when it's 36 degrees fenhe yeah some of the um episodes I was able to train for specifically probably the the strength episode that was on and off over the course of six seven months and then I had injuries and so on but the cold water immersion I mean I did a couple of ice bars back in we were doing some in Australia back in Australia and that was that was new to me and then I was talking to Ross about it and the sort of overarching idea was that um you know they were talking about um developing Brown fat you know we're going to monitor that and Ross is like no not in four days this is going to happen and so it became as much a adaptation uh around cold water immersion as much as it was sort of a resilience test or just a um grit head down go for it uh because the first time we jumped in the water in Norway and we were in there for four and a half minutes and that that was longer than any ice bath I've had but it was snowing

[00:12:51] I'm breathing in you know freezing cold air um and windy and it's windy and and I'm also moving you know you you sit in an ice bath and there's a couple of Mill of water that starts to heat up if you stay still you're treading water then none of that's happening um so a lot of it was trusting Ross and listening to

[00:13:12] Ross's voice and and just kind of again back to what you said about the the trust if I didn't have Ross there coaching me through it having also done it and even to even more extremes uh I would have questioned it to no end and in particular on that actual on the actual swim itself halfway I threw I was like every part of me was like you're dying get out of the water this is ridiculous yeah explain to me and to folks watching and listening what it feels like because I have never been in water that cold I've done long swims at about 49 degrees MH and even at that temperature which seems bommy compared to 36 I mean that's a big difference right it feels like you're on fire oh yeah it actually feels like you're in boiling oil which I think most people wouldn't understand how is that possible that you can get in something so cold and The Sensation is that of being lit on fire and then the other thing that I think is I'm curious to whether you felt it as well is the breathlessness like it it starts to take your breath away yeah it definitely it I mean I'm not I to sound overly dramatic but it was one of the most painful things I've ever done and again in comparison to the oar is very different the big thing was putting my head under water again an iar remind me did you have your plugs uh I don't think I did no and the big difference by the way oh yeah but I I was standing on the on the on the shore and all the training we'd done was Treading Water head above water and Ross is like let's go for a proper swim tomorrow I was like

[00:14:38] I don't I just don't want to do it mate I'm just saving it for the day or you know the afternoon when we actually shoot it I'm just going to go for it because if I experience and I think in hindsight if I had have experienced how painful it was I would have been even more doubtful um so I was standing on the edge and he said we want to warm up as much as possible before you get on and strip off and dive in and he said and then when you get in just take a second to try and adjust before you put your head under and we did the warm up I walk down to the edge and I didn't even know if they were rolling but I was like

[00:15:09] I'm out of here I'm in the water and I'm off and and Ross didn't even have time to jump onto the the boat that was know chasing us along I jumped in just started going and the first like I don't know maybe 25 3040 M I was like got this you know what I'm going all I I'm coming back I'm doing I'm doing two laps and out of nowhere once the initial sort of adrenaline went I felt the most extreme headache pain right through all through and to the back of my eyes the front of my head everywhere and I started I was looking at the bottom as I was swimming and I started getting really dizzy and then I all of a sudden stopped and I was like I'm going to throw up like it was that painful and then I look and I've actually swam off course a bit and I've started swimming toward where the couple of the camera guys and they're like the buoy that way go that way so I head down again and the whole time I'm just like nah get out get out get out get out and then I have another voice in my head have Ross's voice there saying come on fight fight dig in and I just started going for it but what starts to happen is your arms and legs are just like lead balloons nothing works and I I didn't even you know I felt like I was swimming like this a little chicken and you can't keep your fingers together so your fingers start to spay you can't hold the water and it's just like it was it was nly um and then I got to the buy and they're all cheering and stuff and you know

[00:16:37] Darren said I was waiting for a big celebration I was like I couldn't move I was I was going to die and then the jet ski pulls up he's like well done mate and I'm like I you help me on mate I can't lift my arms and they dragged me up onto it and then the same thing would have got on the boat everyone's like cheering and Ross is like get out of the way and he came in with a blanket and little Beanie and sort of started warm me up and so on um yeah it it was wild but the I've never felt the Endorphin kick and the sort of elation that I felt afterward it was incredible and I just remember this most Serene peaceful um state in a of everything and we are there in Norway it's the most stunning backdrop but just this wonderful sense of calm and um overwhelming sort of joy and I think it that it comes with anytime you achieve something that you think is impossible or um overcome some great challenge or you know in the face of diversity or whatever you you have overcome it there is there such a beautiful feeling and maybe think about people who you know climb Everest and do extreme Feats all the time and the rest of us are wondering why the hell would you do that

[00:17:51] I believe it's for that that moment that post feeling was pretty special and I remember it for a long time well I I think there's actually something within that it's not just the accomplishing the feat it's the um it's the temporal juxtaposition of being so low and so high right like I don't think you know how we don't feel speed like if you're on an airplane yeah you don't feel it you feel acceleration in other words we're only wired I think to feel a rate of change right and I think that's true of emotion like if you're constantly in a state of bliss everything is going well all the time I don't think you feel profound Joy um so I think the in part I me I think there's a physiologic expectation for what you experien we'll talk about that in a sec but I think what you're also experiencing is four minutes earlier I thought I was going to die yeah and even if the upper part of your brain knew you weren't The

[00:18:43] Reptilian part of your brain absolutely believed it you were dead yep and then four or five minutes later you have this unbelievable surge of positive emotion I don't think you can find a period of time in when just four minutes you can go from your absolute lowest to your absolute highest I think that's the thing that's the that's the juice yeah absolutely and with no negative lasting injury Etc you know yeah for sure I mean of all the things in Limitless right the strength stuff the endurance stuff the mental challenges all those things you know the hardest one to make the case for this will make you live longer is go and jump in the Arctic Ocean and swim however I think about the benefits of cold water I think that is something everybody should get get used to exposing I mean just this morning right like you know you I breakfast had to really quickly go up shower come get over here I still made time to spend 30 seconds to a minute in the ice water of the shower in the hotel yeah and I love that feeling of the first time you get into the Ice Water you feel a yeah right you feel that little thing and um I mean there is really compelling evidence at what this does to brain chemistry and I

[00:19:50] Al so that's the other thing that I think you're also experiencing although in your swim it was to a much higher degree than just taking a cold shower and ice bath but I think probably being flooded with endorphins and neurotransmitters that are very posi M absolutely and you still do this I mean this is still kind of a part of your routine you're constantly taking an ice back yeah and it's probably about exactly what you're saying like the Endorphin kick but also every time I get in the ice bath whether

[00:20:16] I'm somewhat used to it it it's still it's still brutal but the moment you get out like you say you've gone from one extreme to another so it's an instance of a kick of Happiness um but I find even like you know just from inflammation repair um the general mood uh my if I had you know wake up in the morning and I'm feeling off and I'm achy and I'm not in the space I get have a hot shower and like I'm still a bit doughy but I jump in the cold and completely different it's a GameChanger so does Elsa join you do your kids join you no one of my kids often tries to jump in for not that long but gives it a go yeah and Elsa does it too we have a sauner and an ice bath set up at home and um it's the best it's the best rehub I I couldn't agree more single best investment I've ever made was the sauna cold plun your home definitely so um let's talk about strength so Chris you obviously spend a lot of time working on your strength training what type of program do you do

[00:21:20] I mean I over the years training for different uh different roles and for Thor in particular was about getting big and mass I do shoulders one die arms another back chest legs got it okay still okay MH obviously he's in amazing shape most of us would look at Chris and give anything to look like that but there's always room for improvement there are more than 600 muscles in the human body and for longevity you've got to make good use of as many as possible so when I assessed Chris's muscular power and efficiency this flexibility and

[00:22:08] Agility I found he could be working a wider range of those muscles that's it let's go two one that's it done and he could improve his stamina I think that was I think an awesome episode because I think in this is a great an example of where Co really benefited the series yeah because you know the initial challenge for strength was was kind of an interesting challenge but I think the one you ultimately ended up doing was better yeah um and you know my my only view on this was like from a scientific perspective what can we say about strength and Longevity and or Fitness and Longevity and and really like kind of grip strength cardiorespiratory

[00:22:55] Fitness you know would be top of the list and that's why I think think that that challenge was a perfect challenge because it's grip strength it's topend cardiorespiratory Fitness yeah it initially um yeah initially it was I was going to be in a harness and pulling a car across a section of land and Ross edley had done that um I think for 20 hours or something crazy so he was like

[00:23:20] I'll train you to do that uh and we were doing it and I did like I did a good month like pulling a sled in the backyard I had a little um Polaris dune buggy thing that I was pulling for a bit and it just started to like aggravate my back and joints and everything and um then so we transitioned then to the

[00:23:40] Rope climb and as you say it was probably more on point as far as the science around um strength and Longevity and then I so I started do training for the Rope climb I'd never climbed a rope before and Ross had also done a feat like that and so was was training me um he said to me look you want to be strong but you don't want want to be heavy the heavier you are the harder it is to is going to be to get up that rope so I had a 3 m rope in my house and um that's 10t for the Americans yeah 10 10t in my house and I was going kind of three4 of the way up and just jumping off and back up and down and doing Loops like that and one day I jumped down and blew my ankle out and I rupted all the ligaments and tore ligaments and uh what happened by the way like was there anything different that day the UFC was on right my mates were in the Next Room and was in the gym where my my house set up and then I quit starting I'm like I'm just getting in 15 minutes and I'm up and down and it must have been like you know last one and I just jumped off and I had a mat there and it just I just rolled my ankle and um it just blew out then straight away looked at it was BL and and Utopia and all the team from naio were in Australia ready to shoot I think it was next week so called him up and said this ain't going to happen and I had a doctor have a look at I said yeah this is not good um and that was the rope that was the foot I was going to Anchor off as I was pulling myself up and for folks that have seen Thor you've got kind of different bodies in there obviously I assume the biggest you were in Thor was that scene when you were in front of

[00:25:07] Russell Crow yeah is that yeah I'm I'm that by the way I was that size for that afternoon and kind of I fluctuate through the film obviously you you pick your windows and your days of kind of you know where to be your biggest um and this was like I had been training with Ross prior to that and quite intensely and learned some pretty unique special things and and how to just kind of blast the body and and and do the most effective intense workouts and when and what to eat and so on so I was schooled in that more so than I'd ever been before so I had an opportunity to get stronger and bigger than I ever was um but the timing of it didn't line up with this event and so Ross turns up and and I tried I hadn't been using the Rope at all cuz

[00:25:54] I'd been working and we started doing it and I was just heavy and I was getting like three four pulls up and I was just like everything was tightening up and so on so we had about two weeks where um I just stopped lifting weights completely um and it's funny I don't know you know every time if you've ever put on a big amount of muscle that it doesn't take long for your body to go okay this is we can switch gears now and so I started doing a lot more Road pools and and sled pools and um got down to down to the

[00:26:23] Blue Mountains where we shot and there was a and what was your weight doing during that period of Time how much weight weight were you dropping uh I mean it was only a few weeks so a little bit but I was still did you make an effort to reduce your intake as well cuz you were eating two weeks two and a half weeks I I stopped lifting weights I I reduced my calories pretty dramatically and maybe lost a couple of kilo would have been like 209 or something but still heavier than I should have been for it um yeah we get to the Blue

[00:26:49] Mountains and it's the most beautiful setting and there's the cable cart across two mountains is a th000 foot off the ground and um we go out on this cart and they throw the rope out and it's 100 ft the Rope which is three four times longer than I've anything I've climbed in my training or anything so again this became less about well you've trained for this and more about just again grit and and will and just get up there and um and I just remember Ross kind of at the top of the cart going make it a fist fight make it a fight come on big man from the door's [Music] opening got the r going

[00:27:38] out oh don't look out there Soul hits me and all the little voices of doubt that have been pushing aside in my mind start sort of getting louder and louder I'm looking down and I'm thinking that is not something I fancy doing but I cannot let Chris see any moment of doubt in my mind at all switch on switch on switch on switch on yeah I'm good we

[00:28:21] go really

[00:28:40] so I'm getting winched down and it feels a lot longer than 100 ft I don't want to look back up cuz I'm like this is so much further than I've ever climbed how long did it actually take start to finish uh it's probably I don't know probably a couple of minutes it's a long time to be there's no there's no yeah there's a harness that will catch me if I fall but none of it is helping me up the road and uh I was surprised the quad burn was one of the most gnarly things more than your hands more than your forearms both biceps and forearms um I mean when I got off I was I had like claws I couldn't I couldn't extend my fingers that were locked um but my quads and especially my right leg kind of doing the push and the so how do you feel physically now from a strength perspective uh in terms of like how this is kind of morphed your training a little bit I feel it's it's more specific my training now you know it I used to I used to just sort of go in I still do to it to to an extent like and just start throwing weights around and go you know okay biceps you know I go back and I got chest and shoulders and just as heavy as I could as much as

[00:29:55] I could and when I was a bit younger I could get away way with doing that and then now it's like oh jeez I'm just not warmed that up properly or you know you're kind of hitting everything too many times and so just being smart about the training and and that came from working with Ross and my trainer loky as well um and we did uh it just targeted much more targeted approach um he has really interesting intense ways to work out though it's everything is about sort of um explosive energy like light up your uh was it your parasympathetic nervous system and just switch on sympathetic probably yes what do you got sympathetic par sorry sympathetic yeah and fire up and just explosive up and then slow negatives um that made dramatic differences I got far more gains than than I had previously training like that now you actually I don't think I've told you this by the way but you know in the process of kind of going through a lot of your genetic stuff which we're doing now right like so kind of we'll talk about this in a second but kind of doing this you know we actually found that you you have um a very favorable Gene around muscle fibers so yeah yeah yeah so so I think that um you know we're we'll talk a second about kind of like a gene you have that that we wish we could erase but on the flip side you got you got a pretty favorable

[00:31:11] Gene around fast twitch muscle fibers yeah so I think you know you sort of have a genetic predisposition to be muscular and to be strong and to be explosive it's I've always even I was lean when I was younger but as soon as I started even when I was playing footy you I was 17 doing more push-ups whatever I would I would grow and um it's you know I've always had of work my ass off in that space But it yeah I I do feel um I've had some some benefits there it's a it's a great um variant of a gene to have as you age because one of the Hallmarks of Aging is actually atrophy shrinkage of these fast- twitch muscle fibers shrinkage in Norway definitely different type different type but yes yes yes so as we older these slow twitch muscle fibers are shrinking in everybody and that's why people are losing strength and power and explosiveness most rapidly as they age much more than they're losing endurance slow fiber right so you know one of the things we always talk about our patients is hey we we need you lifting weights all the time yeah you start early and you never stop lifting weights and the heaviest you can lift is the better because it's only through lifting heavy weights that you can really get those fast twitch type to muscle fibers firing so the fact that you kind of have a genetic predisposition to have more of them is a good thing good which then brings us to kind of like some of the other stuff we talked about so you know one of my earliest memories of this whole experience was um in December of 2019 we took advantage of the fact that you were in LA to get some blood work done and you know Darren said look here's the deal you and Chris are going to sit down in January in Australia to kick off the first bit of shooting um and I want you to walk Chris through his blood work just as you would do with a patient the very first time um and I said okay great so we get the I get the blood test back about two weeks before

[00:33:09] I'm supposed to go out to Australia and I see something in it that I'm you know I say Darren I can't walk him through this for the first time on camera it's not that's not fair to him and I know you guys would like I mean I know that that's what sort of the drama is but this is a bit too much um but I can't tell you Darren what it is so without telling you you need to trust me that this can't be done on camera for the first time this one thing you can do the whole Lab but just one thing so so I asked him to sort of trust me and he did and then that and then we connected so well he he called me first yeah he kind of in a panic and was like you've got to call Peter Tia something's come up and but I don't know what it is and I was like oh God what this how long have I got left what's happening and um and so

[00:33:56] I was kind of rattled before we even got on the phone we did sort of the million-dollar workup on you we've got every blood test one can get and I've looked at every Gene in your body six ways to Sunday and overall your Labs look fantastic and I think looking at you from the outside it's clear how much you take care of yourself but we did find a couple of things that are a cause for concern right some of the genetic testing that we did looked at a gene for a protein called APO e you have a very rare combination which is you have two copies of APO E4 a set from your mom and a set from your dad and what does that mean exactly that means you have an increased risk of Alzheimer's [Music] disease how much oil probably somewhere between 8 and 10 times higher than that of someone in the general population yeah right okay you know you're uh I don't know you're constantly thinking you're going to live forever especially as a young individual and then to all of a sudden be told oh this may be the thing that might take you out was like whoa kind of flawed me for a minute you know it's hard to imagine but it's my belief that if we take every step possible we can reduce your risk to that of anyone else mhm sure in fact I don't think you you'll believe me when I say this but I think you will in time you having this Gene is probably a blessing because of the motivation that will give you to yeah it's this is going to motivate you to take steps today that most people your age would never think about until they're in their 50s or 60s sure

[00:35:58] I hadn't had too many patients that had this combination of APO e44 uh it's it's not a very common genotype it's only about 1% of the population so I've probably only at that time had maybe three patients that had it and truthfully two of the three of them kind of suspected it before the blood test based on their family history yeah in one case about a 40-year-old woman Total shocker and so I remember just sort of trying to say look this is a gene that really increases risk of Alzheimer's disease but it's not a deterministic gene and that's I think just look something someone like me can take for granted because I'm sort of in this space I understand that but I think that's a that's a hard concept to explain to somebody who doesn't eat sleep and breathe genetics which is you have this

[00:36:49] Gene and it doesn't guarantee this thing is going to happen and there are some genes that do by the way there are certain genes that if you have the gene you have the gene for Huntington's disease you're going to get Huntington's disease this isn't that kind of Gene but it's increasing your odds and that's the bad news and then the good news is the earlier you know this the more you can do to mitigate risk so that's that's sort of that was my message but what did you hear I mean h how how much do you think back to that yeah again I I knew nothing about the science or the sort of the markers and so on outside of that one conversation and so I hung up and I was trying to explain it to my wife and I was like yeah I'm not really sure what he just said but I think I you know I'm more vulnerable to Alzheimer's and uh and then we had another conversation and I wish we'd had more conversations immediately after because

[00:37:44] I did spend sort of a week going what does this mean what's G to happen and how long have I gotten I was and I'm trying to talk to my parents about it and they didn't know much about it either um my grandfather um has um has Alzheimer and it's you know been very tragic to to watch and so they were aware of it but didn't know in any great detail about the the gene combination that we were talking about um but as you say it was just a a good sort of kick in the ass and a reminder to you know do what I can whatever's within my control and within my power to give myself the best Fighting Chance um and you know whatever work I'm doing for brain health benefits the rest of my body and the rest of my life anyway so yeah we turned it into a into a positive you know one of the things that was sort of interesting about filming this is we obviously came out we filmed it and we did everything in duplicate for those episodes right we did it where we did everything we talked about all this stuff we went through all this stuff and then of course it was also done which is hey we there's a really good chance that we're not going to want to talk about this particular aspect of

[00:38:48] Chris's Health publicly so let's redo that whole thing but without that yeah and I think for about two years it was we didn't know which version of this was going to happen obviously the decision was 100% yours why when and why did you decide that you wanted to be be public with something so personal once I understood more about it um but also well the same reason it's motivated me to make positive changes I thought well that's a great opportunity for anyone else out there who may be in the same situation um to either go and get checked or to understand more about brain health and see what they have within their power to to make that change um so I thought oh it's a I don't know it's a missed opportunity to um motivate others to do the same if I don't talk about it and then we they cut together two two versions of the episode and the other one was just kind of fell flat and didn't you know so this had there was no um it didn't overd dramatized or exploited or anything I think what they did a great job about was it just became relatable it became and this is what most series was like look he's a human being like you or I and you know the sort of superhero costume aside this is an individual who has many the same challenges and and and uh and is up against the same things that all of us uh so even though you have two copies of the apoe4 gene which is a very rare combination you know 20 to 25% of the population has at least one copy of the E4 Gene and even though that doesn't increase their risk as much as the increase that you experience it still does in fact even though it's only 20 to 25% of the population that has that Gene that group of people makes up about two-thirds of cases of Alzheimer's disease so I do think you know I applaud you for doing it and I'm really glad you did decide to do this because I I've always said I really wish every single person would know their apoe genotype early in life yeah um and there and there's a lot of resistance in the medical community to this truthfully there are a lot of Physicians who would say look no one should know that there's nothing that can be done about it why would you burden somebody with that knowledge yeah and people like me and

[00:41:02] Richard isacson Kelly and neas you know people I work with I mean we fundamentally disagree with that Chris we we think that is complete nonsense and we think that this is absolutely a condition through which uh you have an enormous um lever arm to mitigate risk and if if that's true which I wholeheartedly believe it is then not knowing that information early oh for sure is Criminal yeah well and also as wish saying that whatever I do in regards to you know protection and arming myself with you know the sort of tools to have have the best chance it benefits everything else anyway you know we talked about exactly um you know reducing stress levels more mindfulness practices um the certain training I do nutrition my sleep habits all those things made a dramatic difference in every other part of my life too so you know one of the things we all talk about is SAA right BEDA convinced that regular saers can boost my long-term Health you know now that we just got in here Chris let's let's take your pulse all right yeah you're about 64 beats per minute but we've got this temperature cranked up to about 195° fah so let's see where you are in couple of minutes I guess I got to get used to this hate yeah we're uncomfortable right now because we're hot and in response to that our body is trying to cool us off yeah and so it's pumping harder so that your heart can quickly get the blood to the outside of your body and just as exercise is known to help with cardiovascular disease I think sauna has a number of those benefits as well how much of a fan were you of sauna before we shot that Series in Norway and then really kind of got into the science of why it's likely it hasn't been proven yet to the same extent that some things have because so the dats but it's so overwheling in the same direction with every single study I think we're quite confident it is you know I know you've always enjoyed it but has that taken on kind of a more urgent role yeah definitely I mean and definitely during during having shot the show it's made it um or it's become a bigger part of my daily routine uh often after a workout and again I don't know what the sign says but I know I feel great after doing it same with the ice bath and so for sort of mood elev thing then I'm I'm All About It Well I I

[00:43:30] I would say even if you know the emphasis and the benefit of the heat shock proteins is less than what we think I I agree with you I think just the psychological benefit and the Sleep benefit I mean I the difference in my sleep between when I sauna and when I don't is so noticeable that and we you know then again are we going to question the benefits of sleep I don't think so I mean I there is no doubt even with if

[00:43:53] I've been training a lot and I wake up achy in particular you know like I've had issues with my back over the years if I wake up and i' get in the sauna in the morning and I do an ice bath or either or like I I feel 50 60% better and the sort of you know that's the thing you lie in bed all night you're in you know that position and you're everything starts to kind of I don't know lies dormant and um becomes uh I don't know there there's no fluidity there you know what I mean you wake up and you're stiff and sore and then you get into one of those spaces the hot the cold or the uh all the hot and instantly

[00:44:28] I feel like everything's just kind of lit up and a awakened so when we think about kind of the uh the last episode which is the one that we saw in the premiere um we were talking about this over breakfast today but that benefit that episode maybe more than any other really reaped the benefit of Co because it had so much more time to flesh out you know when I think about what the first version of the final episode was supposed to to look like if this was kind of blasted through in 2020 I won't restate what that episode was supposed to be but it was kind of gimmicky yeah it didn't work I didn't think it would have worked and then what it became is unbelievable yeah what um what was in your mind how was the evolution of that episode because I did you have much of a hand in the in the creative side of that or were you kind of just a a passenger uh I was a passenger and I was kept in the dark intentionally Darren didn't want me to know much about it it was a an immersive theater Mak experience and I'm glad I didn't know because I feel like I would have had preconceived sort of ideas and then expectations and I wouldn't you know couldn't have helped acting a certain way or reacting a certain way based on that so to go into it blind and just open and um ready for whatever they were going to throw at me or throw me into was was exciting and different to the other episodes everything else was about being prepped in some way and learning and understanding um some of the science prior to shooting whereas this it was about all I knew was it was about the acceptance of death all I've been told is that I'm about to jump forward 50 years into the future and spend the next 3 days living the life of an octogenarian re thank

[00:46:24] you the architect of this strange challenge is Dr BJ Miller a world-renowned pallative care physician his work centers on unlocking the transformative power of accepting aging and death dying offers us something we can change how we see it what we do with it how we play with it Chris is about to take part in a truly unique experiment ready my old man uh I don't know I mean ask me in 3 days time maybe what did that suit feel like uh just uncomfortable and um incredibly restrictive and I talk about this in the episode the way people then spoke to me because I knew I couldn't hear properly and you know there was this condescending sort of patronizing tone of you know how you hear you know people and some you know some some of the time talk to elderly you know and um it made me immediately go Oh my God I hope I don't do that but incredibly isolating too you know your Visions diminished and and as I said you can't hear restricted so everything is has been uh has been pulled away all the sort of your abilities that were there the hour before I put it on and also not having 50 years to transition into that was again one extreme to the other in the opposite direction to what we talking about before you know there's so many things about that episode that are beyond beautiful one of them to me it's just a very subtle thing is that all of the residents of that place were not actors yeah and what was it like kind of interacting with them because you know you watch the episode it's like a you know slightly over an hourong episode but I assume shooting it was days minimum three days three days um so you have a lot of time on that

[00:48:17] Set uh I I I reckon some of those folks didn't necessarily know who you were prior to that I any of did to be honest yeah which must have been a great relief was it was it was really nice it was um it was unique and different on so many levels that that that episode uh but to be in a retirement village with elderly folks who you know were there for the fun of the episode but were just genuine and truthful and honest and um didn't hold back with anything that were thinking and and there was sort of the no filter um approach to was it was great it was refreshing you know I think being in a sort of Industry where a lot of people do know who you are and a lot of the time you're sort of supported in what you're doing and everything's kind of tried to You Know M be made um or be accommodating as possible that was like no you're one of us now and um it was fantastic it brought me straight back to Earth if I drifted previously well uh having known you for many years now I you're you're you're pretty down to Earth but but I still think that that must have been even another level because you're so far out of your comfort zone this wasn't the this there's no superhero component to this no I was a lot more nervous about that episode than anything else it because it wasn't something I could fight or muscle through or just put my head down you know grip my teeth and go for it I had to be completely open and vulnerable and accessible and confront things that I had never really thought about that much and interact with people who were at the end of their days um or who had dealt with death in very Extreme

[00:50:09] Ways or um come close to death and so to go from sort of one environment of physical sort of challenges and Feats and then go into this emotional state was was a real shock and an adjustment and I I'm so proud of what the episode is and became because it um it's unlike anything I've certainly ever done but unlike anything I think that

[00:50:33] I've seen before in the dark spice several moments that really stood out to me um I'm guessing you didn't know BJ Miller's story before that episode no I didn't no and because it came across as really genuine when you're hearing it for the first time on camera it it looked to me as though that was the first time you were hearing so it yeah um do you recall what that felt like because it seemed like you got quite emotional and I'm curious as to yeah what was more emotional was it the tragedy of his story or was it more how moved you were by his resilience and how he overcame it to do what he's doing comination of things um he's one of the most Unique Individuals I've ever met this is something saintly and otherworldly about him he is such a beautiful individual um certainly his story um shook me uh and also the strength now that in which he reflects upon it and his attitude toward what happened to him was so inspiring um it made me you know I was in a I was really exhausted coming into that episode I was at the end of a you know felt like a fiveyear run of different films and work and we were shooting this series throughout and I was I think I was more vulnerable than I'd been in a long time just out of exhaustion but also out of the questions that were starting to circulate through my head and a lot of them were to do with you know disappointing my life and and um am I proud of what I've done am I you know what's next um and all I kept thinking was I have been sprinting through life and the moments and opportunities and I'm grateful for them but I've been very quickly going to the next one the next one next one and I was in a in a bit of a state of um what's next and and what's the point and who am I and all of these kind of uh questions that I hadn't sort of been able to analyze but were there in the back of my head and my mom had said something to me a few days before that she she'd had this experience where she came pretty close to what she thought was going to be her death in a very to the moment um and she's fine now but said oh you know I wasn't at all afraid to go because I realized I'm so thankful for my life and I'm so happy that everything I've had and all the experiences I have and I thought well what a beautiful feeling and then in that moment I think

[00:53:14] I was talking to BJ about it and I got really emotional because I realized that I just I'm not ready yet you know I I have all these beautiful things around me and family and friends but I I I can't go yet this is not this is not my time and and and it was strange because we're manipulating everything in that space to make me feel like I I'm GNA die I'm must to think about my death what how I would want it to be and so on but I had this this sort of sense of urgency of just

[00:53:44] I'm not ready and it made me think about my kids and how they're growing up and things are changing so dramatically and like oh I just I want to sit I want to I want to soak it in I don't want to be in a Sprint anymore I want to be more present I want to be right here and appreciate everything that's in front of me and and um again I it it I tried to articulate that a few times and and I I I feel I don't know if I hit the nail on the head is exactly why it's it something in me sort of um felt so fra fragile at that point um but yeah it that whole experience sort of shook me to my core and made me want to slow down and just race home to my family and my kids and not jump on another plane and travel and work and do anything else you know it was it was we in the best way I think the time when you were sitting on the bench next to Natalie was sort of equally profound at least it appeared that way as an observer I assume it's the same you weren't aware of Natalie's story and you're probably sitting there thinking why are they having me sit and talk to a 27-year-old very normal healthy appearing woman yeah yeah definitely um again um just such a again that what she said particularly was there's an urgency from her to shake people and say wake up it doesn't last forever you know it it it could your the end could come at any moment so make the most of it and love and laugh and live with a sense of gratitude and joy and um incredibly inspiring and and heartbreaking hearing what what what she's been facing at such a young age too um and I'm really thankful that I had those conversations and I was forced to think this way and had this realization now not when I'm 80 you know I'm glad

[00:55:45] I'm not sitting on my deathbed going ah damn I should have done this I could have done this I finally i' done that so I don't know I feel like this is sort of an Awakening or sort of shake up or whatever you want to call it um came at the perfect time for me you and I talked about this like last month I think but you haven't had more than two months off in about 10 years right yeah pretty much yeah so I we've had you know during Co but even then I was still working on prepping things and so how how do you reconcile the the fact that you work so hard and you've been so successful and with that success has come so many wonderful things right it's you've got wealth you've got Fame you've got a platform right we're sitting here talking about more people are going to know what the apoe4 gene is and why they need to be tested and what they can do about it because of this episode because of this series than anything else that would have ever come out of the scientific literature ever and all of that is attributed to the fact that you have a platform to do this so there's all of these amazing things both to you personally and and to

[00:56:57] Society at large that come from this but at the same time that's not sustainable um you once told me a story about something your daughter said when you kind of half jokingly suggested to her you might retire do you remember what that was yeah yeah um yeah I was talking to her and as I've done feel like I've been doing for a long time to my kids I'm like you know every time

[00:57:20] I've left to go on another trip or going back to work I'm like it's not long you know I'm just soon I'm going to take some downtime and I think you know my daughter sort of rolls her eyes at times these days and says yeah sure and I um I said and then this time I said look you know when I've done with this tour I'm

[00:57:35] I'm having a big chunk of time at home and she goes oh great awesome it' be fun and and I said yeah and maybe maybe I'll just maybe I'll just retire maybe maybe this is it maybe I'll stay home with you forever now and she's like no dad you can't and I was like why and she goes because kids love seeing you play Thor and it was just beautiful kind of moment of like oh yeah maybe it does there is a purpose to it you know I think for me it's I've been chasing my career and and I've been doing it for a number of reasons but you know it's been my journey and there's a sense of sort of guilt that comes with that of sort of chasing down my dreams all the time and when you have kids it's not about your dreams anymore it's about theirs and I have a family to take care of and um I was really sort of questioning kind of what I've contributed done and hearing her say that was like a you know a beautiful little moment and so I I don't want to retire and and you know for a number of reasons but um I certainly want to replenish and you know fill up my cup again I feel like it's uh it's just been sort of flat stick for so long now um and I've loved it and I'm very thankful for it but I need to have you know a chunk of time at home now of yeah get

[00:59:06] reinpold you had a you had a very restless mind you would you would wake up a lot in the middle of the night and you'd have a thought and you'd fixate on it and sometimes it was a very rational thought like you know I'm worried about the success of this film I'm worried about my relationship with my wife I'm worried about like these were all very normal things to be uh concerned with but but they would wake you up yeah right and and and you wouldn't be able to go back to sleep and then sometimes they were things that maybe seemed less rational um which by the way I'm not being critical of you because every one of us has those very irrational thoughts it must be irrational stress it definitely affects my sleep and this is this is going back a few years you know this is not such a big issue these days but um actually it's not true it is yeah like I'll go to sleep fine and then at 2:30 there's a shot of adrenaline and my brain will just start going through a checklist of things be like does that bother me does that oh that one yeah good let's think about that let's tear that

[01:00:15] apart are you getting nervous a bit now a little W of um Na

[01:00:29] sometimes I don't even know why and I wish I could deal with that stress

[01:00:38] better just got a whole lot real not just because it sucks okay but also it could be killing

[01:00:53] me how how has that changed and has this has the series given you a different perspective on anything that has has given you more peace yeah definitely um I think generally I'm sleeping better than than I was back then uh I think just running in a a state of fight or flight constantly and you know what but that was required for me to become an actor you know to to for me to leave Australia with you know not a whole lot of money in the bank and live on people's couches and audition and audition and you know do go go through that sort of grind and be told no a million times and still you know obsessively be pushing forward requires um huge amount of um compulsive obsessive sort of you know self-motivated um drive and then the problem is you then start to achieve those things and I'm no longer in the same sort of fight that I was but I'm still acting like I am my internal sort of environment is still thinking it's you know running away from the dinosaurs or whatever you know goes back to sort of yeah to our sort of ancestral um you know makeup and so you know my the the more comfortable I get the more I sort of rationally talk myself through hey it's all okay now you know like you um you know you can afford to do this and this and this and you don't have to um worry so much about it not working out um some of that dissipates but it's there all the time you know and and I'd be lying if I said um that I had a complete handle on it but again I don't want to kind of dismiss it too much because it's what got me here and it's a tool that I will still need to use at certain times it's just monitoring that and um I don't know I hear a lot of people talk about that though you know people in the sort of friends of mine sports players and so on with that what's required to get them to that place it's a blessing and a curse you know and it's it's a hard thing to switch on or switch off sorry once you've once you've opened the gates yeah I think that's a very common thread for people who have achieved great success and when when you think about your motivation right when you think about um the love you have for your craft um is there a way to use excitement more than fear like how you know because I I think back to you know your beginning right as you talked about you know you you you've spoken a lot about and I think you even did in some of the episodes you spoke about how you know one day you found out your father you know like wasn't going to be paying off the mortgage anytime soon like you sort of had this realization of the fact that your parents have done so much for you and your brothers with the means that they had yeah but you wanted more for them and so part of your fuel for Success was like I want to take care of my family as well not just the kids that I'm going to have which you didn't yet have but like these people who you love so much um and there's a bit of fear in that right there's a bit of like yeah like Do or

[01:04:16] Die yep but at the same time there's also a real passion you have for what you do yeah um you're in other words you're an artist right and so artists enjoy making art is it about Shifting the balance of what's the fire like where where's the fire coming from is the fire coming from a place of fear is the fire coming from a place of love I mean do do those do those go back and forth for you from time to time in different seasons I used to get um I had excuse me uh very intense like performance anxiety when I was first acting and I W it was debilitating I would go to auditions and

[01:04:54] I'd want to throw up but be shaking and then even when I got jobs and I don't know how I was getting jobs based on how nervous I was in those auditions but I was then be on a set and it was like I couldn't think or see and I felt I was going to pass out like and I had I was fighting that for years and and you talk about fear or excitement and I remember reading something that took a series of tests with um athletes um performers musicians um actors whatever anyone in a sort of adrenaline fueled sort of space and they said okay before the event are you nervous or excited and some of them said they were scared out of their mind some of them said they were they were pumped the interesting thing was they all had the same physical response yeah elevated heart pulse Etc clammy hands

[01:05:44] Shor of breath all the only difference was how they labeled that feeling and so for me that was a real light bulb moment and I thought oh okay so when this feeling comes up up and I'm about to walk onto a and and you know I programmed myself to say uhoh this is bad fear this is fear this is a negative yeah I then went nope this is this is a positive I'm my Spidey senses are up now I'm going to be able to think faster react quicker

[01:06:12] I'm going to see clearer I'm going to you know my vision will be sharp and it was and that was all it was was a decision then to see it differently um then sort of you know as time goes on I think the fear does have its place though you know I think you sort of what I've heard people talk you know that the fear pushes you your purpose pulls you and both of them need to have equal sort of um relevance in the conversation and it's a bloody good motivator too you know the half of these challenges my my fear of looking ridiculous if I didn't complete this task or the fact the episode wouldn't have worked you know that kept me going but also the sort of purpose of why I was doing it get me going so I think they both deserve conversation just it's about balance and if and if um either of them get too much attention then you know you have too much of oh my purpose and my thing there can be a lack of humility there you know the fear I fear I fear has I feel has um allowed me to have more of a self-deprecating sort of sense of humor about myself and the world and the work and and hopefully kept me humble too what was the first role role you had where you allowed yourself to think I I

[01:07:31] I'm I'm going to make it well it's interesting the first Thor film I thought great this is I mean the game certainly but which year was the first Thor film um oh God was it 2010 I think yeah yeah um I thought this is good I'm I'm kind of in the mix but I didn't know if the film was going to work I didn't know if we were going to do an Avengers film weren't the first choice or were you wasn't there something funny in the audition there yeah there was um I auditioned initially and didn't get a call back I got some pretty bad feedback and um what was the feedback just no good just just really direct feedback really like minimal feedback which is like you're not even we're not even going to give you any sort of you know constructive criticism or anything it was just kind of minimal and nothing and um and I was shooting a film in

[01:08:23] Vancouver and my little brother calls me up and said oh they're going to fly me out from Australia to La for this film Thor and I was like what and he was like yeah I I send an audition on a tape and I'm going over I'm like that's awesome man congrats wow what you know and then the trades I think variety or deadline come out and it had like the six final um guys for Thor and Liam was one of those people and I was with Jos Weeden and Drew Goddard on it was cabin in the woods and they both said what the hell's going on here this your brother and I go yeah and he goes why are you in the mix you should be th and I was like no know

[01:08:57] I didn't get a call back so none of them ended up getting it and they reopened the casting and um I got a chance to do an audition and I sent in a type and I was called back in to meet with Ken Brer and do the audition and I just had a very different attitude about it I didn't put anyone at pedal stol like I did the first time I had like there was a little yeah that my brother had gotten there and I hadn't and it was a good motivation and um and and it was about perspective you know and then I was able to walk in that room and give the best version of whatever I had to offer as opposed to people pleasing and going in going is this what you want or is is it this or this way and then you know there's nothing um there's a lack of strength there I think they needed the character to be assertive and so I had a lot more sort of presence in in that space than I did the first time round and then uh then got the part how long does an audition take well I mean it usually you have a few days to learn it sometimes you have they call you at lunchtime and they say come in this afternoon and read and um but the when you're actually there in front of them it can be again depending on how well or bad it goes it could be five minutes it could be two minutes it could be an hour and I've had I've had both I've had like people answer the phone Midway through my audition when I first got to town they just be like yeah yeah cool oh yeah yeah yeah and I'm like

[01:10:21] I'm supposed to be still going and just like yep that's great thank you very much we'll call you and like my God it's it's good brutal you get enough of them and it's you either become numb to it or it destroys you how do you hear about rush so Ron Howard um was making the film I didn't know anything about

[01:10:39] Formula 1 um it's because you didn't know me I didn't know you I didn't know you and uh and I and my agent had called me and said oh you should do an audition and Rod said oh look I've seen Thor he's great but he's not right for the character you know um he won't fit in the Formula One car and I said uh I said well I'm not that size and he said yeah it's okay and I said I'm doing I'm doing an audition and I watched an interview with James Hunt and my hair was kind of long enough that I could kind of style it exactly how his was and um and I had you know been practicing the accent and did an audition and he saw it and went okay cool maybe had he already picked

[01:11:15] Daniel for Nikki I think he had yeah yeah I mean you know my feelings on that film yeah like if you were able if you were getting a dollar for every time that film got watched by by me I would you'd be even more wealthy M I'm de I'm I'm I'm so thankful it's such a good movie I you would know it better than I do at this point I haven't I haven't seen it since since the premiere are you kidding me it's hard to watch yourself you know it's um do you did so you don't take your kids to Thor and or they don't watch it around the house I know you take them to the premiere but like yeah um no I take them to a that was the first premiere I talken to but um I'll watch it once yeah or twice or if I'm producing it then I'm

[01:12:01] I have to you know stick through it a bit more but um it's you know and it should be uncomfortable I think yeah there there something narcissistic about enjoying it too much so if we're sitting here in five years and your life is better than it is today especially in accordance with the final episode of Limitless right meaning you're running less um the balance between purpose and fear is more in favor of purpose than fear you feel more connected to your kids your family what has to be true what are you doing look I don't think it's um this's another thing that came up in the episode I just want to S of clarify I don't feel like I've been doing anything wrong as much as I've just been in the storm of it you know and

[01:12:55] I have a beautiful relationship with my kids and my wife and my family it's and I'll be there with them but my brain is pulled in a million other places and so for for things to be even better um would just be about like is it just about a state of mind or does it mean it's it's both because in the episode I was talking about this and I said I was being asked to imagine what my death would look like and if this was my final moment who would I have around me where would I be and I realized it's in the living room with my family and friends and that's every other weekend you know

[01:13:33] I have it so it was as much a moment of it's already right here in front of you change your attitude and also in addition to that was okay I want to do this even more now and I have an opportunity to do that because I'm not in the fight or the Sprint anymore and um so it would be to be more curated with my choices and and and have more time pre and post the film to to prepare and decompress as opposed to just piling one after the other um does that mean more directing you know Shifting the balance a little bit I think it's who the directors are you know I think um working with people that are at the top of their game and I've been so lucky work with some wonderful people um but to I just work with George Miller and to continue to work with individuals like that where I'm learning from them it's a collaboration but they're at the helm they're steering the ship I don't have to feel like I got to police anyone else there you know um is the dream and then you're inspired by those people and you're doing it for the right reasons it's from an artistic space and an expression as opposed to you know a financial one oh it's a good payday script sucks but I get paid well you know which I've done a few times you know um and so yeah to be be more CED to my choices and you know have more Stillness and more calm either the side of it Chris I think uh you know I think about the last three years and I I think about the the when we started this thing in in January for me one of the most unexpected joys of this because you know

[01:15:12] I I really only did this because of Darren you know Darren and I were were and remain such good friends and the chance to do something fun like this with him was the motivation um but I think you know a very pleasant surprise for me has been meeting you and meeting all the people around you um and it gives me great comfort as now someone who's become a close friend of yours to know that you are surrounded by these amazing people you know like Ben and

[01:15:37] Aaron and Zach and your family and your parents and your your brothers I mean you you are rich Chris you are rich in in people um and I I I suspect that's actually probably your greatest asset so it's it's been a real privilege to to be a part of that well well must been wonderful getting to know you too mate it's it's been the biggest joy as the people I've met through this experience and uh the knowledge one thing but the friendship's the most important and so thank you buddy yeah man thanks for sitting down with me yeah [Music]
