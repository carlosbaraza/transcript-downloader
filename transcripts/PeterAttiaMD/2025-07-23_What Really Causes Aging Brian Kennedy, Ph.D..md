This clip is from episode #357 ‒ A new era of longevity science: models of aging, human trials of rapamycin, biological clocks, promising compounds, and lifestyle interventions | Brian Kennedy, Ph.D.

In this clip, they discuss:

- Goal: Resilience Against Disease – Whether we can become so resilient that we stop dying from disease
- Longevity ≠ Escape from Frailty – Even supercentenarians show notable physical decline, despite their impressive ages
- Healthspan vs. Lifespan – Focus is placed on extending the period of life when people feel good, not just living longer
- Slow Aging vs. Stop Aging – Aging research is framed as two questions: how to slow aging today, and whether it can ever be reversed
- Cardiovascular Disease Is Most Preventable – Despite being a top killer, cardiovascular disease is ironically the most avoidable due to current tools and knowledge

## AI Summary

I'll help analyze this excerpt from The Drive podcast with Brian Kennedy, though it appears to be only the beginning segment of a longer episode. I'll structure the response based on the available content:

**1. Executive Summary**:
This segment of the podcast focuses on fundamental questions about aging, featuring Dr. Brian Kennedy discussing the challenges in defining aging and the limitations of the "hallmarks of aging" framework. The conversation explores whether aging can be reduced to mathematical equations and debates the interconnectedness of various aging mechanisms.

**2. Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Discussion of the "hallmarks of aging" paper from 2013/2014 [00:02:09]
- Introduction of "pillars of aging" as a related but distinct framework [00:02:09]
- Observation that interventions like rapamycin affect multiple aging hallmarks simultaneously [00:02:09]
- Emphasis on inflammation as a central factor in aging processes [00:05:06]

**3. Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Focus on maintaining homeostasis rather than targeting individual aging mechanisms [00:03:28]
- Consider the interconnected nature of bodily systems when approaching health interventions [00:03:52]

**4. Notable Quotes**:
"Aging is a healthy aging is about maintaining homeostasis" - Brian Kennedy [00:03:28]

"The idea that aging is 12 different things and you just need to fix all 12 of them is completely wrong" - Brian Kennedy [00:03:52]

**9. Follow-up Questions**:
1. How can we better measure and quantify inflammation's role in aging?
2. What mathematical models might best capture the complexity of aging?
3. How do different interventions affect multiple hallmarks simultaneously?

Note: Many of the requested sections (5-8, parts of 3-4) cannot be completed as they weren't discussed in this excerpt. Would you like me to analyze additional segments of the episode?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] What do we think is actually causing aging? You know, we've been debating what aging is um uh for the longest time and uh you know I think we would argue for two hours in some conference room somewhere in the world and at the end of it we would come up with the definition happens and then you die. You know it's it's really just it's frustrating. I don't even want to talk about it now. on you know Vadim Gladesev has uh has been on like a evangelical rant about how do we define aging we don't know how to define it he asked that question at every conference and I I think it's a fair question uh and we all throw our hands up in the air and so the idea was we have a lot of data now a lot of human data um and aging researchers are beginning to try to model that data uh but they're not modelers you know I think most aging biologists or at least myself if I have a skill it's intuition it's not writing equations and code you know and but the physics people the theoretical physicists as especially they know how to model things and they model things based on physical principles that are that are proven right and so we we've been trying to bring these groups together and because I believe maybe the only answer to your question is that we have to write it in equations and so uh early days on that but I'm excited about where that's going and do you think that these will be explainable through equations or do you think that this exceeds our level of intelligence to understand and it's really going to be up to a black box that contains a neural network to understand this and maybe we take a step back actually so for the listeners they've heard us on this podcast talk about quote unquote hallmarks of aging um maybe explain to people what the hallmarks of aging are which I I don't mean like list them all, but the concept of them don't I wouldn't put you on the spot for that. Um, but the idea that has been proposed is that there are hallmarks of aging. And why is stating those not the same as answering the question that you, me, and everybody else is struggling with?

[00:02:09] Well, this is kind of an existential crisis with me because the hallmarks of aging came out in 2014 or 2013. And then I wrote another paper right after that called the pillars of aging which is kind of the poor stepchild of the hallmarks of aging and that was um because there was an NIH conference and there were seven topics discussed and they asked me to write a review on calling them the pillars of aging so I did but even in that review I had the seven pillars of aging but I connected them all with lines because I don't really think that these hallmarks and pillars which are like the pathways in the cell that are thought to be driving the aging process you know, inflammation, you know, epigenetic changes, these kinds of things. Uh, they're all interesting to aging and you can modify them or they get modified if you slow the aging process, but I what strikes me is how entrained everything is. So, if you take an intervention like rapamy that slows aging, it can impact all of the hallmarks. Um, and so I don't really I think those are like outputs or ways you can look at aging, but they're not that nobody is really just targeted. The idea that you can target each hallmark and then you'll live to live forever is is not going to work because it's really the network that connects the hallmarks together. And to me, aging is a healthy aging is about maintaining homeostasis.

[00:03:28] It's about, you know, maintaining a responsive network in your body that sort of keeps you in equilibrium, responds to the events that are happening during aging, the stochastic events, the damage that's happening, and it keeps you functional and and that network is highly malleable. You can influence that network by drugs or behavior. Uh, and if you do, you get benefit from it and you can read it out as an improvement of all the hallmarks.

[00:03:52] It's not like one thing of exercise affects only this hallmark. Um so I think it's the hallmarks was good because it it it drove interest in the field. It's part of the reason a lot of investment came uh in the biotech sector but uh it also is misleading because I think the idea that aging is 12 different things and you just need to fix all 12 of them is is completely wrong. It's really about m your body knows how to function in a healthy way.

[00:04:20] It's about trying to maintain that and maybe improve upon it. So do you look at the hallmarks which I believe have been modified since the original paper and a few others have been added. Do you see an a rank order or a seniority of them in terms of causality? So for example one of the hallmarks is mitochondrial dysfunction.

[00:04:40] Yeah. Now one could say that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs independent of another hallmark of aging which you've listed epigenetic change. Alternatively, you could say actually it's the epigenetic change that occurs stochastically and that that is driving mitochondrial dysfunction. And if you reverse the epigenetic change to the previous epigenetic layout, you will correct the mitochondrial dysfunction.

[00:05:06] How do how do you think about the interconnectedness through the lens of causality? Yeah, I think that the primacy issue is a major one. I I like the idea that mitochondria might have been one of the primary drivers. Also, you know, every time we do an experiment, we keep coming back to inflammation. All of the interventions that extend lifespan, reduce chronic inflammation or almost all of them. And then every time we create a new biologic aging clock, which we're doing a lot of now in my lab, you know, and we do principal components and figure out what the main driver is, it it's always related to inflammation. uh and so I I think there's something it may not be inflammation may be a response but it's so central that uh a lot of the interventions I think are working by dampening inflammation but to your point inflammation could easily be a readout statement yeah it yeah but it it's certainly when you modifi I think when you modify it you get an outcome you know so it's not just an endpoint that you look at how are you measuring inflammation
