In this special episode of The Drive, we have pulled together a variety of clips from previous podcasts about cardiovascular disease to help listeners understand this topic more deeply, as well as to identify previous episodes which may be of interest. In this episode, Peter highlights the importance of understanding cardiovascular disease and why early intervention is critical. He also provides a primer on lipoproteins and explains the fallacy of the terms “good cholesterol” and “bad cholesterol.” Allan Sniderman discusses the metrics measured in routine blood work – along with the limitations of those standard panels – before explaining why apoB is a superior metric for determining risk. Additionally, Tom Dayspring explains the casual role of apoB in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and the therapeutic goals for apoB concentration, and Peter explains how early and aggressive lowering of apoB could change the landscape of cardiovascular disease prevention.

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This special episode compiles clips from previous episodes focusing on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), cholesterol, and apoB. The discussion emphasizes why ASCVD is the only inevitable disease of our species, the importance of early intervention, and why apoB is a superior metric for assessing cardiovascular risk compared to traditional cholesterol measurements.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- ASCVD is inevitable in humans who live long enough [00:03:38]
- Over 50% of first heart attacks are fatal [00:06:04]
- Over 50% of men will have their first cardiac event before age 65 [00:06:04]
- Women experience cardiac events about a decade later than men [00:06:04]
- Atherosclerosis begins with fatty streaks and develops into plaques [00:08:31]
- ApoB is a superior predictor of cardiovascular risk compared to LDL-C [01:03:02]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Consider early intervention for apoB reduction [01:16:03]
- Monitor apoB levels starting in late 30s/early 40s [01:16:03]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Target apoB levels below 60 mg/dL (5th percentile) [01:08:54]
- Consider more aggressive treatment if calcium score is positive [01:14:00]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- Statins mentioned for lipid management [00:57:51]
- PCSK9 inhibitors discussed for achieving very low apoB levels [01:06:13]

5. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- ApoB concentration [00:34:02]
- Coronary calcium score [01:07:55]
- LDL-C and HDL-C [00:34:29]
- Total cholesterol [01:07:55]
- Triglycerides [00:39:24]

6. **Notable Quotes**:
"No cholesterol, no life, period." [00:12:18]

"Atherosclerosis is really the only inevitable disease of our species." [00:03:38]

7. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What is the optimal timing for beginning apoB reduction therapy in different risk groups?
2. How does the benefit/risk ratio change at different apoB levels?
3. What role does genetics play in determining individual response to lipid-lowering interventions?

This analysis captures the main points but there's much more detail in the transcript. Would you like me to expand on any particular section?

## Transcript

[00:00:01] foreign [Music] welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter attia this podcast my website and My Weekly Newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness full stop and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level at the end of this episode

[00:00:38] I'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to Peter attiumd.com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode [Music] welcome to another special episode of the drive as the podcast is now over four years old we realize we've covered certain topics in a variety of ways across multiple episodes we realize of course at times it can be hard to piece together this information and it's also difficult for new listeners to be able to go back and keep track of information that's been covered in great depth in previous episodes as a result we wanted to release another episode that is kind of a compilation of clips from previous episodes we did this before and it was a huge success so for this one we want to focus on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ascvd cholesterol and apob this episode includes Clips on why it is so important to care about ascvd the role of cholesterol in ascvd and why I don't think anyone should refer to cholesterol as good or bad and finally we look at why APO B is an important metric to track when looking at your lipids I put these clips in order of what we think is the best way to listen to them from top to bottom and also provide some commentary in between Clips to give you a little bit of context our hope is that not only will you understand this topic better but you will also be able to identify some past episodes you may want to go back to and listen more deeply final thing is that some of these clips are taken from amas so if you're not a subscriber we hope this gives you a little bit of a sneak peek of what's covered in those episodes this is still a fairly New Concept we've only done this once before we got great feedback on that which is why we're doing it again so if you continue to like this please tell us and if you don't tell us why so without further delay I hope you enjoyed this special episode of the drive [Music] what we thought would be important is just answering the first question which is why should someone care about this it's such a complex topic why is it important for people to put the time in to really think through and understand it it really starts with the ubiquity of this disease and its assault on human longevity people have probably heard me say this before but atherosclerosis is really the only inevitable disease of our species cancer while prevalent with aging and dementia while prevalent with aging do not appear inevitable the way atherosclerosis does so not everybody dies from atherosclerosis but I think to my knowledge everybody dies with it assuming they live long enough so you have a condition that as I said is inevitable is ubiquitous also I think based on what you're going to hear me talk about today we know a lot about this condition and we really have tools to mitigate it to me that's the reason you want to really understand this the impact is huge and the tools that we have are also huge so again we talk about longevity longevity has two parts

[00:03:38] Health span lifespan the lifespan part comes down to delaying the onset of chronic disease of which this is the most common chronic disease so you can think of a couple of different paths to get there but really the two biggest risk factors I am putting smoking aside for a moment which is a very straightforward behavioral risk factor in terms of less clear behavioral risk factors the two biggest are clearly hypertension high blood pressure and lipid abnormalities and that's the one we're going to focus on here so atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease will just abbreviate ascvd for short is really what we're here to talk about as we get started on this topic Peter I think we have people who listen to this podcast of all ages young old everywhere in between and I think it's a common thought for people under 30 40 even some people under 50 where they're just like this is something that only affects old people I'll think about this when I'm older but right now it doesn't really affect me how would you answer the question in its basic form of isn't this just a disease of old age and why should those people who think that not just shut off the podcast at this point and instead continue to listen and continue to put in the effort probably have told this story before and if not or if folks haven't heard it I think it's worth hearing again right I remember in sort of my first year pathology lecture in medical school the pathologist said what's the most common presentation for a first heart attack so if a person is having their first heart attack what is the most common thing that they will present with that's the terminology we use in medicine and of course the hands shot up chest pain being the obvious nope that's not it nausea nope that's not it a left arm pain no that's not it and it was a trick question of course the answer was sudden death the answer was that over 50 percent of people's first heart attack is fatal now the good news is today that number is a little bit less it's probably slightly below 50 percent but that's still a staggering number now another way to think about this is through the lens of understanding the age distribution of people who have their first major adverse cardiac offense so that is a heart attack stroke or sudden death due to one of those if you don't mind Nick pull-up figure one this graph shows the age distribution for both male and female in the United

[00:06:04] States in terms of these incidents I think the easiest graph for me to look at here is the one on the right total annual events and what you can focus on is the first two bars that is the bars that are for people up to the age of 65. so if you look at the male bars which are the darker bars you can see that the sum total of those two bars slightly below 25 slightly above 25 percent the implication of that is over 50 percent of men who are going to have a cardiac event in their life will have it before the age of 65. and for women you do the same exercise you can see that it's one-third of women so it's clear that there's a shift in time and that women while subject to the exact same burden of disease seem to experience it about a decade later still fully one-third of women are going to have their first cardiac event which is going to be heart attack stroke or death as a result of those things before the age of 65 and a little over 50 percent of of men will be in that camp so as we're going to talk about in this episode that's not the whole story it's even more compelling to care about this when you're young when you understand how long it takes for this disease to take hold and the implications therefore for prevention the most sobering thing for me when you look at this is it's not even the 50 percent under 65 it's almost the especially for males the almost 25 percent under 54. and especially when we get to what we get to later which is for that to happen to someone who's 45.50 that doesn't mean it started two years earlier right and so I think it's pretty crazy when you see these type of stats laid out how it creates that shift in your mind around why you should care about this [Music] what we need to do is first almost step back and look at what exactly is ascvd I think people have to understand what it is to then really understand how it comes about how to think about prevention so what do you think the best way to walk people through in a relatively simple form what this disease is

[00:08:31] I'll explain it at a high level now and I think we should go through it in some detail in a moment but the pricey on this would be that as cbd's a disease State characterized by the deposition or the buildup of cholesterol more clearly or more rigorously sterols which include cholesterol and phytosterol in the artery wall it initially starts as something called a fatty streak which

[00:08:54] I'll explain in a little bit more detail later and then it later consolidates into things called plaques and these can ultimately lead to a reduction in blood flow and of course it's this reduction in blood flow that leads to what's called ischemia ischemia is the reduction in blood flow and therefore the resulting tissue damage that occurs to the heart is what results in a heart attack which can be fatal depending on the amount of the cardiac tissue that is impeded from appropriate amount of oxygenation to have this disease you don't have to be obese you don't have to have high blood pressure or things of that nature it's really a question of the cholesterol in your blood that's really what defines the disease so the essential condition of atherosclerosis is the presence of cholesterol in the artery wall which by the way is not necessarily related to the measure of cholesterol in circulation which we will talk about in great length and although these often coexist patients with cholesterol in their arteries do not necessarily have to have co-aggravating factors such as high blood pressure diabetes obesity family history smoking all these things that exacerbate it you mentioned cholesterol a few times and obviously it's a topic that's been talked about on more podcasts than I can even count or recall right now but for this conversation can you define cholesterol just in its simplest form so everyone's aware of exactly what we're talking about as we're going to get into kind of the more nitty-gritty cholesterol is an organic molecule that resides in the lipid family so we typically characterize these molecules by their solubility in water and this is a not soluble in water molecule so it is a hydrophobic molecule and I think the easiest way to sort of picture those things is to think about oils so if you took an oil like olive oil and you poured some of it into a cup of water you you would immediately see what it means to have a hydrophobic substance in contact with something which is the ultimate hydrophilic substance water right so they repel each other now of course cholesterol is about one of the most important molecules in the body to be clear if we didn't have the ability to make cholesterol we would cease to exist in fact you couldn't be born without the ability to do this there are rare genetic conditions that impair the ability to make cholesterol and these are uniformly fatal why do we need cholesterol there are broadly two things that cholesterol is essential for the first is that they contribute heavily to the cell membrane of virtually every cell in the body so cells are actually kind of fluid things spherical things and what allows them to have that fluidity and what allows them to have membrane channels that allow things in and out of them is the cholesterol layer that forms the membrane and secondly cholesterol is an essential substrate for the production of some of the most important hormones in the body cortisol estrogen testosterone it's also essential for the creation of bile acids which are necessary to be able to digest food so the Mantra that I like to say is no cholesterol no life period you should put that on a bumper sticker on your car just roll around Texas with that guy no I think that's great why don't we look at and discuss Peter how does as

[00:12:18] CBD come about so before I jump to the figures I want to make one other point that I should have made a moment ago and that is the necessity of the body to make cholesterol so I think most people when they think of cholesterol will probably first think of what it is that's floating around in their bloodstream but we'll very quickly turn to cholesterol within food because it turns out that when you eat certain foods you can also eat cholesterol so everybody knows for example eating eggs means eating cholesterol and a natural question is what is the relationship between the food that I eat that contains cholesterol and cholesterol you're measuring in my bloodstream and the short answer is very little and the reason for that is the cholesterol that we eat is in a form that the fancy term for it is called it's esterified so it has a chemical bond that swings between an intermediary oxygen and then another side chain from just a straight mechanical problem that is too large for

[00:13:18] The receptors in our gut to absorb so most of the cholesterol that we eat is in fact excreted out of our backside we don't bring it into our body and therefore most of the cholesterol that we are going to talk about today is actually cholesterol that we have made and that's transported between cells through these things called lipoproteins [Music] one of the things I remembered from pathology a so it's the first of the three major classes you take in pathology with something that the professor said which is he said no doctor has more experience with what it is to have heart attacks than Pathologists because 50 percent of the people who have a heart attack die on their first heart attack so he said I'm seeing 50 of the people who have a heart attack and their first presentation is death so I kind of remembered that and it's a very sobering fact to think that half the time and again I don't think that's true today but I think 25 years ago that was the case the numbers are probably a bit better today it might be a third of first events are fatal but nevertheless it was sobering so you have this sort of weird factoid that's again off in the recesses of my brain somewhere and then you hand me this textbook and it actually made sense with what he said because in addition to going through in great detail the pathological staging of atherosclerosis it was littered with autopsy sections of coronary arteries of people who had died for other reasons and notably they were quite young so here's a 26 year old male victim of a gunshot wound here's a 27 year old female who died in a motor vehicle accident here's a so-and-so and so and so and when you look at their coronary arteries you realize they already have atherosclerosis they already have oxidized

[00:15:29] Papo B bearing particles engulfed by macrophages and thickened intima and while they may not have calcification in their arteries yet or the types of plaque that would rupture within the ensuing weeks or days or months they nevertheless had atherosclerosis and they were in their 20s and in their 30s so all of a sudden what this professor said 20 some odd years earlier made sense which is this was now an explanation this was a bridge to explain what otherwise seemed hard to understand atherosclerosis it's a disease in the tissue and almost everything that lipid people talk about is in plasma and if we don't understand the natural history of the disease how can we construct a strategy to prevent it and although much of my work has been on

[00:16:23] April B the more important part I think has been on understanding how the natural history of atherosclerosis should direct our prevention strategy what that leads to is that every major guideline in the world bases their selection of subjects for Statin prevention on the 10-year risk of disease and that was a huge step forward in 1980 and 1990 but it totally or not totally but it very fundamentally makes prevention of premature disease almost impossible when you plug in the numbers to calculate somebody's risk for any of the risk algorithms that American College of

[00:17:19] Cardiology 2019 aha multi-society you plug in numbers that belong to the that particular patient and what comes out is what you think is the risk for that particular patient it actually isn't but what drives that calculation is the age and the sex of that patient things like cholesterol blood pressure they contribute mentally to the actual calculation of 10-year risk so what that means is if you're 35 well there is a give me a risk calculator for you but if you get to 40 almost everybody's risk is low at age 40. and it is until you get to about 5560 that risk gets you over the threshold for the American prevention guideline treatment so prevention really starts at 55 to 60. but half almost half of all infarcts and strokes occur before the age of 16. so how can that be what

[00:18:32] Starry and his colleagues established was for the first three decades or so of Life the disease begins gets a foothold in the artery but it's only in the fourth decade that you start to develop the lesions that can actually precipitate a clinical event but risk is low and yet the event rate is high how can that possibly be well the answer is stunningly obvious which we've published there are a ton more people under 60 than over 60. so the rate of events is low but the absolute number of events is high that's problem number one problem number two is say you get to 60 and you didn't have an event well the disease was developing and extending during your 30s 40s and 50s so by the time we start to try and prevent an event the disease is well advanced in the arteries that to me are the two fatal flaws in the 10-year risk approach and we published a paper pointing this out in Jama Cardiology a few years ago board nordiscard and his colleagues have done exactly the same thing with the European guidelines you can't beat these numbers so rather than what Starry taught me and it took some years before we could develop the methodology of course risk is a good concept of course it is but we should be selecting people also based on causes

[00:20:17] I can measure your APO B pretty precisely I could measure your non-hdl cholesterol a little less precisely but pretty well and I know it's yours when I calculate the risk if I said okay Peter you're my patient you're a healthy guy I calculate your risk is 4.1 percent now what does that number mean is that your risk nope it means that out of a hundred people at 4.1 percent 4.1 of them will have an infarct but we know that within that category there's a tremendous variance in real risk not everybody's at 4.1 some are higher some are lower some are dead on so if I had two risk algorithms the philosopher AJ air the English The

[00:21:14] Logical positive he was actually darn good on probability there's a real challenge predicting singular events I'm either going to have an infarct in the next year or I'm not it's not really a probability it's either I am or I'm not if one algorithm said I had a 10 risk and another one said I had a 15 or 20 percent whether I have an infarct or not both of them were right because they said there was sort of a chance you could and there was a far larger chance you wouldn't when we say people should be treated with a risk above 7.5 percent that means 92.5 percent of the time nothing will happen well that's not a great incentive

[00:22:01] I think for helping people understand what's truly going to happen so the way we can deal with this and what we've done is develop What's called the causal benefit model we measure it non-hl or apob and we can project the risk over 20 or 30 years if you're 30 years old the period of time you should care about is up to age at least to 60 and so if you were in a group let's say and let's say I make you 35 again and I say your chances of having an infarct or a stroke before you're 65 or 30 percent now that's a number you can deal with that's a number that has meaning and we could also calculate how much the risk can be reduced by starting at age 35 or how much you lose by starting at age 45 or how much more you lose by starting at age 55. [Music] this next set of Clips is a deeper dive into cholesterol the limitations of the standard cholesterol blood panel and an important segment on why I think no one should ever refer to cholesterol as good or bad [Music] so I recently posted something on social media about my frustration with the way that the press and frankly even sometimes the medical establishment writes about cholesterol referring to good cholesterol and bad cholesterol now if you've ever listened to me on podcasts you understand that I talk about this in great detail but a number of the comments suggested that there were a lot of people that are kind of new to this discussion they haven't necessarily followed me they certainly haven't heard the I don't know literally 25 hours worth of content on cholesterol over the last four years on my podcast and they were kind of looking for a little bit of call it the tldr version of cholesterol and I thought this would be a great excuse to do it so if you want to understand why I wail on people when they say bad cholesterol and good cholesterol you have to really understand what cholesterol is and why that type of imprecise language is unhelpful to put it mildly okay so let's take a step back what is cholesterol so cholesterol is a lipid it is synthesized by every cell in our body that means every cell in our body makes cholesterol okay so why do we make this stuff well this stuff is super important for every cell in our body wouldn't make it it's essential for the creation of a cell so a cell when you look at a picture of this cell in a book or online or something they look like two-dimensional structures right they're sort of these flat things but really that's not what cells look like that's kind of a cut open cell projected onto 2D the reality of the cells are three-dimensional and they are fluid they have to be able to be more than just perfectly open spheres so what gives them that fluidity is their membranes and it's the cholesterol within the membrane that provides that fluidity it's also what allows

[00:25:10] Transporters to go across the surface of cells these Transporters are what allow various things like glucose ions hormones Etc to Traverse cell membranes so it's important to understand that if we didn't have cholesterol we wouldn't have cells if we didn't have cells I wouldn't be making this video and you would be here to watch this video no cholesterol equals no life full stop there are things that are almost equally essential for life that go beyond that cholesterol is the precursor to some of the most important hormones in our body which ranges for things like vitamin D to cortisol to estrogen to testosterone progesterone Etc it's also essential for bile acids we wouldn't be able to digest most of our food without bile acids especially fatty foods so the list goes on and on as to why cholesterol is essential so why does the story not end there why are we having this discussion well when it comes to something as essential as cholesterol not every cell in the body is capable of making enough cholesterol to meet its individual needs so the body has to be able to traffic cholesterol so there are certain cells that tend to be net exporters of cholesterol the liver for example as a general rule the liver makes more cholesterol than it needs whereas there are parts of the body that need more cholesterol than they are typically capable of making especially during periods of high stress so those parts of the body need to receive cholesterol and this poses a little bit of a problem because the main channel that we like to use in the body to transport things back and forth is of course the circulatory system it is not the only system we have a lymphatic system but the circulatory system is the system that we tend to use most to transport things like this now there are lots of things we transport in the circulatory system and we do without any difficulty we transport glucose about any difficulty we transport electrolytes without any difficulty we transport lactate without any difficulty why because all of those things that I just stated are water soluble and of course the circulatory system is made up of plasma and proteins that's what your blood is the plasma being basically the water of the cell and so things that are water soluble like all of the proteins hemoglobin and things like that things that I already stated glucose electrolytes they're soluble in water and therefore they transport easily but as I said at the very outset cholesterol is a lipid and if you remember a little bit from a chemistry class you'll know that a lipid is not water soluble it is hydrophobic as opposed to what we say is hydrophilic so things that are hydrophobic can't move in water just as you would dump olive oil into a glass of water you would quickly realize how much they repel each other so we have this totally essential thing that we have to move around the circulatory system otherwise we would die and we can't do it directly because the medium through which we need to transport it repels the thing we're trying to transport aha there's a solution we need to create a vehicle that we can transport this in and that vehicle is called A lipoprotein and as its name suggests lipo and protein it's part lipid part protein and it's engineered in a way that the lipid part is on the inside the protein part is on the outside protein is water soluble so now you create this spherical molecule which on the inside you can package the cargo that is hydrophobic repels water and on the outside you have a coating that is hydrophilic it is attracted to water and moves effortlessly through the water and that's how we transport cholesterol now broadly speaking these lycoproteins traffic in two types of families a family that is defined by apob which is a lipoprotein that wraps around it or an

[00:29:18] APA like the protein that wraps around this spherical larger lipoprotein and APO a there's an apoa family there's an APO B fan technically there's two apob families there's an apob 100 and an apob48 I'm going to ignore the APO b48 right now that just exists on chylomicrons and we could do another class on that on another day but for now we're going to focus on apob 100 which defines the lineage of lipoproteins that are terms you've probably heard of vldl IDL LDL LP little a and the APO a lipoproteins

[00:29:54] Define a totally different class of these called hdls so what do those names mean anyway vldl IDL LDL HDL they all refer to another feature of the lycoproteins that is distinct from the APA lipoprotein that wraps around them which is their density so if you think about a high school experiment where you take various different substances and you put them into water you might notice that you can separate how they would float now water is kind of a bad example of how that works because things are typically binary behaving in water either they're sink or they're going to float but I think that gives you a conceptual understanding of the difference in density density is mass over volume and a higher density object relative to a lower density object will sink versus float so if you take all of those lipoproteins that I mentioned all of the

[00:30:50] APO B ones all of the APO a ones and you put them in a certain type of gel in the lab you can see a separation of them based on their density and the highest density ones of those we just call the high density lipoproteins the hdls you have more than one apoa on an HDL and you have different subclasses of hdls and hdls are really complicated and we don't even come close to understanding all the ins and outs of them which by the way is why I get really annoyed when people say having a high good cholesterol is good again what they really mean to be saying is having a high HDL cholesterol is good and while it's true that on average higher HDL cholesterol is associated with and traffics with metabolic Health in a way that low HDL cholesterol tends to traffic with bad metabolic health you can absolutely not tell by looking at an individual based on how high their

[00:31:48] HDL cholesterol is if they're in good shape or not because that single snapshot of how much cholesterol is in the HDL tells you nothing about the functionality of the HDL and it's the functionality of the HDL that matters I'm not going to talk any more about that because I have an entire podcast coming out on HDL biology where we'll go into that in great detail but it should be stated that efforts to raise HDL cholesterol pharmacologically have by and large mostly not exclusively but mostly failed in improving outcomes okay so over on the LDL apob side the most abundant APO B100 or apob for short lipoprotein is the low density lipoprotein that's the one that gets called bad cholesterol and again on the apoa side we have HDL which gets called good cholesterol so a couple things I want to say on this one if you're talking LDL you are referring to the low density lipoprotein if you say HDL you are referring to the high density lipoprotein but if someone says what is your HDL what is your LDL they're asking for a laboratory metric they are asking incorrectly there is no laboratory metric called LDL or HDL there is HDL cholesterol LDL cholesterol abbreviated ldlc and hdlc there's ldlp and hdlp which is the particle number of LDL which can be counted via electrophoresis or NMR of course my preferred way to count the number of these particles is to look at a B the APO B concentration to me is the most important number you want to understand to predict from a biomarker standpoint your cardio metabolic risk a CDD risk because it captures all of the atherogenic particles so apob counts the total of the ldls inclusive of the lp little A's the ideals although they virtually never exist they have such a short resonance time and the vldls which can become problematic in people with metabolic syndrome and high triglycerides so apob gives you the total atherogenic burden of those lipoproteins and therefore I think it's the preferred metric by which we want to assess risk but if you want to look at

[00:34:02] LDL you have to look at LDL C LDL cholesterol and HDL you look at HDL cholesterol now is the cholesterol in the HDL any different from the cholesterol in the LDL no of course not therefore it is totally erroneous to say HDL is good cholesterol and LDL is bad cholesterol no instead what is true is that ldls themselves as lipoproteins are

[00:34:29] Bad actors because of what they do what they do is they go into artery walls where they get oxidized and they basically dump their oxidized sterile contents into the sub endothelial space which elicits an immune response and a whole bunch of other things that lead to atherosclosures which I'm not going to get into now but the point of this discussion that I want people to understand that ldls and hdls are lipoproteins if you want to talk about the cholesterol you talk about LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol but the cholesterol in them is the exact same and there is no such thing as good cholesterol or bad cholesterol and so you just have to be careful when you see things written that are written through that lens because what it tells you is the person writing this doesn't understand the basics of lipids and lipoproteins and if they don't understand the basics of lipids and lipoproteins because what I just told you guys is literally the 101 on this subject we didn't get to the senior level class let alone The Graduate level class and this is complicated stuff once you get into that level so if someone writing to me is butchering the 101 you can stop reading because whatever else they're saying they're undoubtedly screwing it up so there it is there's the TL VR on lipids [Music] if a doctor gets a report now he gets total cholesterol triglycerides non-hdlc ldlc hdlc five numbers do you think he actually looks at any of those numbers he's trying to do a good job he does but let's say the triglycerides are high can he do anything with that nope because everything is based on ldlc so he's got in reality four numbers that are doing nothing let's explain that to people Alan because you and I know the ins and outs of that very well but I think most people here don't understand the difference between the calculated and measured LDL so let's start with that and then let's talk about how vldl has been estimated and let's bring this all back in terms of some other work you've done which is understanding the role of triglyceride in apob so let's start with the basic you go to the doctor you get a set of labs done and the LDL number comes back at 140 milligrams per deciliter is that actually what it is or is that an estimation that's an estimation it's almost always a calculation and there are at least eight different methods to calculate LDL cholesterol so if there are eight different methods they don't all give the same answer or you wouldn't have eight different methods LDL cholesterol can also be measured directly that assay has never been validated in disease patients and no one has ever published a paper showing that it's more accurate in terms of disease identification then calculated

[00:37:29] LDL cholesterol and yet people have paid good money for that lab test there's no question that the number of LDL particles is a more accurate index of risk than the LDL cholesterol the vldl cholesterol because the cholesterol that's in the very low density lipoprotein particles the particles that come out of the liver that cholesterol is atherogenic there's a lot of triglyceride in that particle so the people who measure triglycerides say well the triglycerides are high that must be the problem and there's no question that people with high triglycerides are at increased risk of heart disease but the people with the high triglycerides were at increased risk of heart disease have a higher number of LDL particles and vldl particles it's the particle okay when you're measuring the triglyceride you're just measuring a blob of liquid in a bunch of particles and you need to know the number of them so it's an important number in the sense of If You're A lipoprotein guy trying to figure things out if it's extremely high it increases the risk of pancreatitis but I haven't seen any solid evidence that triglyceride itself is pro-athrogenic what's atherogenic is the cholesterol inside the vldl particles it's the number of those particles that get into the wall now there's a complicating reality because in general all I need to know is the apob but there is a disorder called Remnant type 3 disciplineemia and that's a very specific highly atherogenic condition that manifests with high triglycerides high cholesterol but get this you know low apob so when I measure my lipids in apob

[00:39:24] I can recognize that but if you don't measure the apob and this applies to most of the people who are listening to this podcast if they go to see their doctors that condition can't be diagnosed [Music] a lot of Clips will focus on why I think APO B is a superior lipid metric to LDL cholesterol or even non-hdl cholesterol when trying to predict risk [Music] are you optimistic I mean is this just a question of time I mean in 10 years will kids in med school be learning about apob instead of LDL

[00:40:06] I'm pessimistic you're up the 2019 guidelines were very pro-ableb the evidence from mendelian randomizing like the newer Technologies mendelian randomization they've just been slam dunk for apob let's explain that to folks because I want to talk about the causality of this and this might be the perfect way to actually explain the causality of APO B in the context of this tool so can you explain to folks what a mendelian randomization is where people see this all the time in studies but I don't think it's entirely clear for the average person what it means

[00:40:41] I'll try okay it's not my expertise but I'll try the conventional ways of taking things apart with prospective observational studies like Framingham there's a limited amount of the certainty of your conclusions because of confounding you can't deal with you take measurements at age 20 and you follow someone for the next 30 Years well a lot of things change in the next 30 years that you don't have a handle on your inferences are probable but not causal what mandelion randomization allows you to do is to come a lot closer to causality because for example you can identify groups of genes that are associated where changes in the gene are associated with a little lower cholesterol or a little higher cholesterol and when you lump together a bunch of those different genes that can have different makeups because you can change the makeup of a gene pretty easily you can see fairly substantial differences in cholesterol so what you've got is information on somebody that's fixed at

[00:41:54] Birth and you see is that associated with a difference in outcome you've gotten rid of a lot of stuff in the middle and what a number of mendelian randomizations have shown is that APO B includes all the information in triglycerides LDL cholesterol and even HDL cholesterol it sums them which in the sense of vldl and

[00:42:19] LDL makes perfect sense so there are caveats in mendelian randomization you can't just push a button and say give me the answer but George Davey Smith really arguably one of the founders have been dealing with randomization or not arguably he was he's the author of a number of the mendelian randomization saying APO B incorporates and therefore Beats triglycerides and LDL cholesterol so that's a huge level of information that isn't even mentioned in almost any of the guidelines yeah so let's make sure people understand everything you just said because you said a lot of things in there when you prospectively follow a cohort the way the Framingham cohort was followed or the Framingham Offspring or the Mesa cohort or any of these cohorts have been followed you can take a bunch of people and you could measure their

[00:43:17] APO b or their ldlc or whatever metric it is that you're trying to determine if it in fact has a causal relationship to the disease of interest you can follow them over decades and you would demonstrate as has been demonstrated that the people with higher B higher ldlc higher non-hdlc and lower hdlc all have a higher risk of developing atherosclerosis over time but it's hard to say that that's causal just based on that information because over the ensuing 20 years that you follow them they are free to make other choices that may impact those variables of interest and other variables so the mendelian randomization attempts to get around that by saying at the time of I was going to say birth but really at the time of conception we all get randomized to a set of genes we get assigned a set of genes I guess they're not perfectly random because they come from our parents but for the purpose of not changing they are indeed a random assignment that is fixed if we can identify which genes map to which phenotype and we can figure out the genes that map to the phenotype of our interest namely driving up or down a variable of interest such as APO

[00:44:40] B then we don't really have to worry about the confounders that occur in between because the genes can't change just to put a bow on that basically now when you see a difference in outcome it's much more likely to be causally related to the phenotype of interest because the gene has not changed that underlies it now what are some of the ways that we can get tripped up with mendelian randomization I mean there's some pretty big ones yeah before we get there HDL cholesterol was the rage okay the total rage because the epidemiological evidence couldn't be clear in fact it was four times more clear my recollection was that Framingham demonstrated low hdlc was four times more predictive of cardiac events than high ldlc am I remembering that correctly I'm not sure it's that multiple yeah but it's multiples and it turns out as we know now at least from the CTP Inhibitors that you can't manipulate HDL and change outcomes and that's one of the elements of demonstrating an overall causal relationship and the mendelian randomization show HDL is not causal whereas they show apob is and cholesterol is too by the way those are two very important studies Alan I mean and both of those have been in the last 10 years yeah it's a incredibly technical advance in being able to examine questions and look at numbers of people that are would be unimaginable in conventional studies the mendelian random they're always talking hundreds of thousands of people because they've got these huge data banks with genes and those numbers get you around the confounding of things you have huge numbers but it's like any methodology no method is perfect this one can mislead you to particularly when you've got a sequence of associated variables for example people show using

[00:46:49] Mr that triglycerides were quote causing or associated with increased risk but when you took into account the non-hdl cholesterol or the apob disappears so when you've got a linked metabolic chain you've got to be careful that you've gone to the end of it you've got the real actor not act one leading to that you've got the real Persona dramatis which is why it's surprising that HDL didn't at least at the first order demonstrate causality because there's no doubt that phenotypically the high triglyceride low HDL phenotype is so associated with metabolic syndrome but it makes up two of the five criteria that's an incomplete description that's like you describing your self as six feet tall I wish and not giving your weight and letting me guess your BMI you cannot characterize any phenotype without the apob it really drives me around the bend when people speak saying I got somebody because I got their triglycerides that are HDL well I say okay what's their repo B how can you pretend you've evaluated the system when you haven't counted the number of anthrogenic particles because they could be normal they could be high or you can have a type 3. they don't know and it's not a phenotype there is no phenotype without putting an apple b in there they're lipoprotein particles they're disorders of lipoprotein particle metabolism of course the triglycerides in cholesterol are important but my analogy if I didn't do a good analogy there but it's so fundamental that it drives me to distraction as to why you wouldn't want to know a core element of knowledge but it doesn't seem to bother many of my friends you walked through the pathophysiology of how the APO B bearing particle wreaks havoc in the artery wall many many years before we see clinical events and you also mentioned that there are other factors that can amplify or exacerbate that I can't remember exactly how you said it but that was the gist of it well two of those things that are widely accepted to exacerbate risk are smoking and hypertension in fact smoking and hypertension probably carry a greater risk for atherosclerosis than apob or is that not the case it all depends the way you think about it because if you just say what's the risk somebody with hypertension faces they have high risk I have no question but then you say what is hypertension the last 30 or 40 years there have been almost an infinite number of basic science studies on hypertension and when you were in medical school and even before that when I was in medical school we talked about pathophysiology of hypertension and what strikes me is we don't talk about the pathophysiology of hypertension anymore but the basic science goes on in rats which is healthier than ever and there isn't anything I know of that's come out of that basic science that's been clinically useful in the last 30 years the drugs we use we use them because they work so what is hypertension it's a higher blood pressure than we should have and where is the disease that produces that higher blood pressure is it resistance we don't have a clue okay we don't have a clue and it strikes me it's the same thing as much of the debate in lipids about April B or the drunk looking for the key under the light because this is where the light is not where he lost it everybody who's anybody has the same Viewpoint my bet is it's in the proximally order my bet is that it isn't that complicated we lose elastance in the proximal aorta and that's systolic hypertension thank you very much what could accelerate that process what's the mainstream view that this is renal when I read hypertension I get lost because I get page after page after page of peripheral arteriolar tone and very complex metabolic studies and very sophisticated animal models there's some renal left it's a miasma for me an absolute miasma I hadn't heard about the proximal aorta so say a bit more about that well this is me the proximately order is elastic and if you look at a flow curve a hydrostatic pressure curve

[00:51:44] When We're Young it's rounded because as the left ventricle ejects blood rapidly into the aorta the aorta expands so it absorbs some of that energy you know that wind castle that they mentioned in school that's not that big a deal but the energy is partially captured partially regained but the wall isn't battered the wall can give way me personally just in the middle of my brain imagine that if those elastic fibers start to go then the walls stiff so now when the left ventricle ejects blood the pressure goes up more rapidly and it falls more rapidly and diastole and that's why you get systolic hypertension with normal diastolic pressures so my bet would be if I was not the age I am I would be looking at factors like cardiac output again which used to be way back winter factors that alter the behavior of approximately would have as much as something that's to me pathophysiologically much more likely to be involved so once

[00:52:55] I got hypertension okay then I've got a driving force to push particles into the wall and so you think it's the actual increase in the pressure of the plasma and the response of the wall I think there are responses to the wall the wall thickens up it gets harder for particles to go through does it also damage the endothelium do you think that plays a role that's right I don't understand endothelial dysfunction it's more a language thing to me than it is a reality I know the endothelium is critically important it functions abnormally and that's endothelial dysfunction how that fits into the overall thing I don't know my bet is apob particles are part of the process of inducing endothelial dysfunction but I don't know that clearly experimentally so going back then to the question at the top does it make sense to even compare hypertension to apob they both seem to play a causal role is one more causal than the other or is that a silly question because they're not binary and static I think that's not the right question I think our blood pressure goes up as we age

[00:54:04] I mean hypertension involves so much of the population it's not clear to me what the word disease means the prevalence as we age is so high that to me it's becoming almost a aging process because we're lasting a lot longer than we were probably designed to go so you have this repetitive injury to the proximal aorta it gets a little progressively less able to deal with it so by the time we're 50 what percent 60 percent have higher blood pressure I mean the figures are staggering is it really that high I'm not sure don't don't quote me on that but it's high high but doesn't apob also rise with age it does rise with age but not that much when we look at people at age 35 we can pretty accurately categorize the group they belong to at age 35 not that they won't change someone so if you're high at age 35 you've got about a 95 chance of Staying High five percent will go out of the high

[00:55:08] Zone they won't go low low so if you're high at age 35 hmm I wouldn't bet anything's going to move you down that's why I think it's such a good signal for when we should start thinking about treating people and if you're low some people go from low towards high but the majority don't and we keep following them but if you're high no we've published a fair amount of this if you're high it's not a hundred percent but it's about 90 percent that you're going to be high is there a gender difference at least clinically I seem to see women as they go through menopause experience dyslipidemia that men wouldn't experience over that same decade or even five-year transition I think there are changes and apob goes up with menopause I'd like there to be more data I think part of the reason that's held apob back is that people didn't measure it so they were sort of well what I measured has to be important because I can't answer your question hopefully more data will be coming but I agree with you people can change it the menopause so I'm not saying we don't keep looking at people but when you have somebody at age 35 to 40 who's High the odds are high that they're going to stay high are we doing a better job treating hypertension than dyslipidemia I have no idea the incidence of coronary disease is going up in the last five years and that's despite Statin therapy and that's the Obesity diabetes so I think we've been too quick to congratulate ourselves at how well we're doing there are many reasons that treatment is not succeeding as well as it should and I think the complexity of the lipid phenotype of the lipid model is part of the answer it's easy for me I get the April B where I want it to go yeah I mean an explanation for your observation would be if in the last five to ten years the incidence of atherosclerosis or major adverse cardiac events is rising despite the advances we have you would argue or could argue that if we're measuring ldlc and that's our proxy for treatment but as dyslipidemia is growing in the metabolic context meaning if you have more medicine and more insulin resistance and more type 2 diabetes we know that those phenotypes are associated with greater discordance between apob and ldlc suggesting that you have a greater and greater portion of the population that is being undiagnosed or being under-diagnosed because you're treating their ldlc and you believe that it's lower than their risk actually is because their APO B is higher I know you know what I just said

[00:57:51] I hope the listener understands what I just said yeah what you just said was important it's another example an unfortunate sad example that trying to quantify lipoproteins based just on lipids is not adequate you're not capturing all the information that you should [Music] back to kind of the macro Point here around apob which is a greater coalescing around the idea that that apob concentration matters so I think it's very well understood that two of the biggest risk factors for cardiovascular disease are smoking and hypertension I don't think there is any ambiguity that cigarette smoking and high blood pressure increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and they both appear to do so through a mechanism that weakens the endothelium or creates an injury to the endothelium the question now becomes as you put it

[00:58:55] Tom how Ironclad is the story that it's the APO B bearing particle in the presence of injured endothelium that is the Trojan Horse that begins this destructive trajectory of taking that cholesterol into the sub-endothelial space becoming retained undergoing this chemical oxidation process which then kicks off an inflammatory response that paradoxically as an attempt to repair the damage results in what can be a fatal injury there are other hypotheses for example there are people who note and we have I mean look I have a patient in our practice Tom you've weighed in on her case walks around with a total cholesterol of 300 and something an LDL cholesterol of 220 milligrams per deciliter an APO B of A 170mm grams per deciliter she's in her late 60s and her coronary artery calcium score is zero we have elected to not treat her with any lipid lowering therapy in other words there are exceptions to this how do we reconcile that well it's the human body in medicine as you know not all smokers are going to come down with lung cancer or chronic obstructive lung disease why not if that's such a horrible risk factor I try to explain this a color and I've certainly seen cases like you say where oh my God if I was just going to say give me your April b or whatever cholesterol metric you're going on three drugs right now you've got no choice and maybe the old days we approach people that way but no more I think you have to individualize your whatever risk factors you discover that might wind up causing atherogenesis and then figure it out so particle number is certainly a major factor that might force it in but not always and the daily of function although you can certainly if you review the history of this and how do you really determine endothelial function not everybody has serious endothelial dysfunction who winds up with atherosclerosal particle number itself and some people can just make the particles go in I think if we take most adults who's not going to have a little bit of endothelial dysfunction so I agree with you it's a combination of something about atherogenic particles be it their number and the daily dysfunction but I'm talking more and more now when I discuss any type of lipoprotein I don't care which subgroup you want to talk about I think we certainly have to know it's particle concentration but I like to talk about particle quality so what are the other attributes of any lipoprotein that might contribute to its athergenicity or in some perhaps not understood meaning make it relatively it's not going to generate atherosclerosis and there are certainly have to be things like that going on so as we're getting smarter we're looking at other components of the lipoproteins that could be other proteins that are on them that could be their complex lipidome and trying to see aha can that help us discern whether in you a given particle concentration is more worrisome than it is in the next and the next person so there's a lot going on and also from the gist of this conversation listeners will know atherosclerosis atherogenesis is a multi-complex multifactorial disease and that's why even when Peter and I if we consult on a case and we realize in this person we have to beat up able B and get their particle numbers to a more physiologic range we don't stop once we do that we examine in great detail for other things that might be injuring the endothelium or the arterial wall and see are any of those treatable or so so we're getting a little bit smarter on lipoproteins but there certainly is more to it than just particle number do we think that there's a limit to where the benefit of reduction becomes diminishing or even J

[01:03:02] Curves in the other direction so we discussed it in the first episode significantly we did so again with Ron Krauss it wouldn't be you know the worst idea in the world a couple of years from now to sit down and do it again and re-examine the data but but again I think the causal relationship between apob and atherosclerosis is as strong as virtually anything we see in medicine for which you can't do the perfect experiment where you have to rely on natural experiments nevertheless maybe it's not entirely clear what the dose response looks like so if you have somebody whose apob is 160 milligrams per deciliter there's a risk reduction that comes to lowering it from 160 to 100 and lowering it from 100 to 80 and lowering it from 80 to 60. what do we know about the risk reduction in lowering it say from 60 to 40 to 20 and I ask both what we could infer pharmacologically and non-pharmacologically in other words from the mendelian randomization versus the pharmacologic well even using pharmacologic trials and mendelium randomization you're going the concept you're going to come across with is lower is better and with the pharmacologic thing we're modulating things that either have clinical trial proof that if you lower them it's good or the mendelian uh randomization looking at genes where that drug might be doing something it works now you do need a few apob containing lipoproteins they do traffic other lipids they traffic fat soluble lipoproteins but we must never confuse a beta lipoproteinemia where nobody or that person can't make them or hypo beta lipoproteinemia where they make a few enough to traffic those other things that A lipoprotein might have to traffic but even the guidelines where they examine people base looking at their

[01:05:00] Baseline APO b or LDL cholesterol the first thing they suggest at least in the higher risk people is try and get a 50 reduction and that's where most of the bank for the buck is going to be now if you still have options that you can lower it further yeah the trial show yeah there is incremental reduction events but it's a much smaller absolute risk reduction and dropping at the 50 or so so I don't know if that answers your questions so most people don't have the type of levels where with modern

[01:05:33] Therapeutics with modern lifestyle we can more often than not attain physiologic concentrations and if I want to talk about APO B that's probably under 50 milligrams per deciliter if we can get there that's what the newborns have that's when you go in clinical trials if you take it down that low you see your most risk reduction and so far at least with pharmacologic lowering of apob with the currently FDA approved drugs there is no signal of harm yeah again it's funny you because I was just about to say with the current crop of drugs specifically the pcsk9

[01:06:13] Inhibitors we are routinely seeing patients who easily can get an apob into the 20 to 40 milligram per deciliter range you and I actually sat down a couple of months ago and did a calculation to estimate how much cholesterol is actually contained in the circulating lipoproteins versus that which is in cell membranes you remember doing this with me not per se but uh and we're developing equations you're the master of that well it was one of these things right it was it was sort of like look you know when you look at a person's plasma glucose level you realize pretty quickly it represents a tiny fraction of total body glucose and similarly there's such a concern about plasma cholesterol level but you know given how essential cholesterol is it's understandable why people would be concerned that low cholesterol could be problematic but once you do the calculation and realize virtually all of the cholesterol in the body is contained within the cell membrane or within the steroidal producing tissue the circulating amount is a very narrow window into the total amount of cholesterol and therefore a reduction of say 60 milligrams per deciliter to 50 milligrams per deciliter of APO b or even something more extreme like a full fifty percent reduction of total cholesterol 200 milligrams per deciliter to a hundred milligrams per deciliter does not represent a significant reduction in total body cholesterol that's a very important

[01:07:55] Point all right let me repeat it you have a total body cholesterol that you measure in the plasma that says oh it's 200 milligrams per deciliter that goes down to 100 milligrams per deciliter let's say the LDL fraction reduced from you know 150 to 75 or something someone might say God you just cut cholesterol in half that can't be good for you given the importance of cholesterol but my point is no you simply cut the amount of cholesterol being carried by the lipoproteins in the plasma in half that doesn't capture the majority of the cholesterol yes thanks for refreshing my memory what you're talking about now it's really pools of cholesterol throughout the body and I think I'm so glad you brought this up because this is just not even understood even in the lipidology community we have a total body cholesterol they're basically three pools there's your brain and nothing we're talking about today has anything to do with brain cholesterol it's a separate system it doesn't interact with the other cells in your body or certainly with the cholesterol in your plasma so if it's not in your brain where it's cholesterol in your body well it's either in all your peripheral cells perhaps some more than others or it's circulating in your plasma and if it's in the plasma where is it does there itchy ween sea amount bound to albumin there's more bound within all of the lipoproteins that are trafficking in your body meaning your

[01:09:22] APO B and your APO A1 particles but believe it or not if I wanted to search down blood cholesterol for you I would suck out your red blood cells and extract cholesterol from them red blood cells carry far far more cholesterol than do all of your lipoproteins put together and the other crucial point you made subtly and I hope everybody understood you the amount of cholesterol within your lipoproteins has no correlation with your cellular cholesterol or even your red blood cell cholesterol so whatever however you're modulating some

[01:09:58] LDL total cholesterol HDL cholesterol metric that tells you nothing about what might you be doing to the cholesterol content of your cells so don't have a panic attack if you're making LDL cholesterol 30 because I can assure you virtually every cell in your body even if that's your plasma LDL cholesterol has more than enough cholesterol because it can de novo synthesize it it can put it in its cell membranes or other organelles that require cholesterol if it's a stereogenic steroidogenic tissue can produce a little more or perhaps delibidate someone so there's no cell that's being deprived of cholesterol in the periphery when you are modulating lipids through lifestyle or drugs [Music] so on ascbd I've also become far more aggressive on the timing and magnitude of apobee reduction so take a step back and ask what are the leading causes or modifiable causes of ascvd The Big Three we are pretty unambiguously smoking hypertension and Hyper beta lipoproteinemia which is just a really fancy word for saying too many lipoproteins that have apob on them so that's LDL IDL vldl LP little a by measuring APO B why I'm such a fan of measuring APO b as opposed to just measuring LP LDL particle number or LDL cholesterol number is we have one single number that captures the total concentration of apob and while that's pretty well associated with non-hdl cholesterol which is a far better surrogate than LDL cholesterol it's still better and that's been demonstrated than I think we even covered that in a previous podcast where we went over the discordance between non-hdl cholesterol and apob so now the question becomes well when should you start apob reduction and how much should you lower it and I'll tell you I used to take a point of view that if a 40 year old had an elevated apob let's just put some numbers to this right so the 20th percentile of APO B is about 80 milligrams per deciliter I used to say that let's say somebody was at the 50th percentile they're 40 years old their calcium score is zero and they were ambivalent about lipid lowering therapy and let's assume that they're not insulin resistant and you've done all of the things that you can do reasonably with nutrition I wouldn't push that hard I've now taken a very different stand which is I've basically taken the stand with others that I've taken with myself which is the evidence is overwhelming that infantile levels of apob are not deleterious in any way meaning an apob of 30 to 40 milligrams per deciliter which is the level that children would have poses not only no risk to children as evidenced by the fact that I mean that doesn't require an explanation but as evidenced by what we see in the literature on adults with levels that have been pharmacologically reduced tells me that we need to be lower and the amount of time it takes to see a benefit tells me we don't want to wait until there's an issue in other words if the reason we begin therapy is because somebody has a positive calcium score which again we covered this in great detail so for people listening we have a dedicated ascvd AMA which goes into heavy detail for about 90 minutes on all this stuff where if this is of Interest that's a great AMA that goes super deep on basically all of the reasons why I think my point of view now is treat early and treat aggressively and I will now also make a very bold statement again it's let's start with the thought experiment right if the thoughts experiment for colon cancer was do a colonoscopy every day on a person's life starting at the age of 30. would you eliminate colon cancer deaths I think the answer is yes and similarly I would say pharmacologically lower apob to somewhere in the 20 to 30 milligram per deciliter range for everybody in the population while someone is in their 20s can you eliminate ascvd and I think the answer is probably yes in other words I think what you're basically going to do is eliminate death from atherosclerotic causes and that would need to be started in 20s I think so yeah very early on yeah so again how do you take that thought experiment and turn it into a practical implication because I don't think it's practical to take every 20 year old and obliterate their APO B although it's clearly something we do in the subset of patients who have significant genetic abnormalities such as the cluster of genetic abnormalities that coalesce around a condition called familial hypercholesterolemia we certainly do medicate those patients usually as teenagers so this is not some completely crazy idea but I think practically what it means is basically by the time you're in your late 30s or early 40s if you have any measure of apob that's even north of the 20th percentile that should be completely lowered so in
