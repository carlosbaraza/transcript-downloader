## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia

[00:00:10] hugh it's so awesome to have you here today although i do wish we were doing this in person we've been talking about it yeah we've been saying well we'll let's wait and do this in person let's wait and do this in person but between all that's going on i think this is the next best thing so i mean the best part of in person i know i know the conversation is great but the cooking is off the charts you're cooking you and jill combined to like a crazy good dinner there's another whole avenue there for you i don't know i still think some of the meals i've had at your place have have blown my mind even more and including the meals i haven't had do you remember the day i came over to your place i think i was on day six out of seven on a fast yes yes and you and deb really really thought you were gonna get me to cave and i instead i just walked around the kitchen smelling it and and i respected that yeah hey but i can't really take any credit for the meals at my house you can take the credit for the ones at yours i mean right down to sourcing the food i'm impressed yes yeah i know you appreciated that um actually that that that that's sort of i want to come back to that because there's an interesting story about that that uh some some of those meals but this is kind of a different podcast for us we've talked about this a lot and we thought that what would be fun today um is not just that i'm interviewing you but in some ways that you're interviewing me and i think that's in part because you're the most curious person i know and that's evident any time you are sitting down with anyone i've watched you interact with so many different people even just in the few minutes before we were getting this podcast recording when you were talking to nick um you're just immediately obsessed with and interested in every detail of what another person knows and how they've come to know it and stuff like that and so i think in the past couple of months as we were thinking about this it became clear there was no way i was going to be able to get away with just interviewing you because you were going to end up asking me a bunch of questions anyway so we said well why don't we just acknowledge that this is going to be a discussion and not an interview yeah no i it's my favorite way to do it anyway i i often in interviews no matter what and i've done a lot i always try to ask questions because i get bored of talking about myself anyway and if you think about my job my job is human nature like observing it if you're an actor and you're not curious about people it's going to be a real struggle so i i do want to start with this idea of because it's actually something olivia asked me yesterday you know i said hey you know olivia i'm talking to hugh tomorrow blah blah blah and she's because you know she's very interested in music and she said will you ask him a question for me said sure she said when did he know he was good enough that he could make it in his chosen profession and i said i don't know that's a good let me let me ask him that i think when when i got cast and i got the job at the royal national theater in london so i'm i i'm now 28 i've studied for four years at college you certainly don't know that i mean the stats on college and i went to probably one of the top two colleges in australia three-year full-time program the stats are maybe five percent actually make a living from that so there's 18 people chosen in a year so i certainly didn't have it there and then i came out of the gate and got quite a bit of work straight off the bat which was i was super lucky don't let's not forget i was 26 so i needed to work and uh but when trevor nunn i auditioned for trevor nunn for sunset boulevard in sorry i should i just give you some context sir trevor nunn is one of the great theater directors of all time and i was a huge fan from his work at the royal shakespeare company but also les miserables nicholas nicolby you name it he was just one of the greats and and so when he came to australia doing sunset boulevard i actually didn't want to do the musical i wanted to go i was an actor who weirdly got into musicals and i thought i got to get out because i was getting pigeonholed into that world and i i said to the casting director listen i don't want to be in the show and this is the like the most presumptuous thing i'm ever going to ask of you but i would love to audition for trevor like he's my hero but i don't want to do it so i totally understand if you tell me to you know get stuffed and she said ugh all right i'm just going to put you in so i went along and i auditioned and trevor i could tell it went well it was like an amazing hour that i spent with him and unusually it was in a theater so i was there i had this feeling of what it was going to be like working with him and i remember thinking if he offers me this i'm going to do it because i need to work with this guy it was just so clear and really that was the turning point when someone like trevor none kind of and then he took me to london to do oklahoma that's when i thought all right that was the turning point for me and and he was the one who gave me that confidence to see okay so you're getting work in sydney and australia can you make it overseas and he was the one who gave me that it's it's interesting um is it sort of like being an athlete where you you you with obviously a different life cycle but where you know you show these glimmers of greatness early on but you're still constantly evolving in the craft um so for example consider like a tom brady right you know everybody loves to talk about oh my god you look at him in his combine you would have never predicted what he could have done of course he's the back up to drew bledsoe and and and you know if if bledsoe hadn't have got injured in the 2001 season who knows how long um he would have sat on the bench but then once he got his chance all of this preparation he'd done in advance he was sort of ready to unleash it on the nfl um right did you sort of feel that you were in this constant state of pent-up potential and you just needed an opportunity to demonstrate it or was it much more incremental than that still is incremental yeah i still i i marvel at those people who have the i know what i have to offer give me a shot give me the ball give me the ball like come on coach i i marvel at that kind of confidence i've always had the courage to say give me the ball whether i felt like getting it or not and i realized that that was essential at some point you could in fact i was pretty scared of drama school and i just had a rule if i just put my hand up when they said all right we need someone to do the scene or we're doing put my hand up because mainly because i didn't want to sit around for an hour and a half being scared whilst watching everyone else i just wanted to go so if you and i were bungee jumping and i was scared i'd be like here i'm going first i'm like so i but really and i think some people saw that as courage but or confidence but it wasn't it was more i i just wanted to make sure that i didn't miss an opportunity to try and to grow and i think for me what happened with something like trevor nunn it wasn't like ah yeah i'm gonna be great in this or this i just felt like a thoroughbred running in the paddock like ah this just feels so good and by the way part of my head's going this is sir trevor nunn who's worked with judy dench patrick you name it ian mckellen like the greats and we were having this kind of great sort of rep rt i could just it felt like a match and that feeling of a match just made me go all right yeah i deserve to be galloping in this paddock and hopefully that'll continue um what about you you are one of the most this is i'd written down some questions this is not one of them but you're obviously one of the most successful doctors in the world and listen to a podcast you know when was the moment where you knew that you could look after some of the most demanding high achieving people on the planet you know that's tough i i don't probably the same way that you would say it it's not entirely clear i don't i don't think that i i don't feel like i've got to some point where yes i can do this and and everything i think there's a there's a constant sense of am i doing enough am i learning enough what am i missing what am i forgetting what could i be doing better how can we make this process better but what i think i can say is it was probably in the it was probably about a year ago that i stopped feeling like an imposter so so that was a big transition right that was a big step forward which is um there was this sort of lingering feeling of what if you're what if you're just nowhere near as good as people think you are right um and i think i'm over that now which is only a year ago yeah only a year ago to get to the point of it's okay nobody is perfect um and you don't you know you're not representing yourself to be all-knowing um and you're not an imposter was that the drip drip of achievement or was there a crystallizing moment yeah that was that was a lot of therapy actually right yeah that was learned on the couch not not it so that actually became that was a big challenge to my identity i think that was also recognizing like how much of identity is wrapped up in what you do versus who you are um and i and i think so part of it was like kind of releasing my identity being involved in my work wow which is an ongoing struggle right how do you remind yourself of that do you have a way of demanding yourself yeah i think honestly like kids are probably the best part of kids are a great reminder of that which i know we're going to talk about a lot but i think a lot of the things i do are have the potential to warp my head around my identity so exercise you know driving a race car shooting my bow and arrow medicine all of those things have the potential if i'm not diligent to consume me in a way that also um sort of determines my self-worth right but if i anchor to my eulogy and not my resume which is sort of my um i think i've shared this with you but that's that's kind of like my mission statement in life is make your eulogy better than your resume um then i just say look um these people here these little people these these kids are the ones that are gonna matter at my eulogy so sometimes i'll come in the house after shooting really poorly and i'll see my little boys running around and uh it's just much easier to now dismiss the thoughts of how frustrating it is that i can't shoot that well today when i sort of see them playing and realize well if i play with them they don't even know the difference and i think that's true of medicine as well right so brilliantly articulated i just need to drill down on you said am i doing enough i i completely relate to this i'm i'm an overworker the job for me is what do i really want to achieve and how can i do it with less because i think insecurity has let me do overwork and that i guess i'm asking you that question the am i doing enough which certainly helped get you and i to where we are today right because we probably did work harder than other people we never stopped but it's clearly not actually not a disciplined recipe for wellness or happiness or being a good husband or good father right um how have you made that transition very very slowly do you worry that you won't be good enough if you don't worry about being good enough you know this is something i i've spoken at length with esther perel who's someone you know well and and have come to respect greatly um yeah when i wrote out my recovery contract a year ago a little over a year ago um this was a very important part of that recovery contract which was being able to on a daily basis journal about the trade-off that you describe which is if you start to prioritize your eulogy over your resume you will make deliberate trade-offs that may sacrifice your performance in the short run and you have to be able to accept that and you have to be able to write about that in a sort of dialectical way which is it is okay to say goodbye to an opportunity today in exchange for something that you value more in the long run um and it's and it's okay to acknowledge that i think was her point right in other words don't just yeah so don't just just sort of shove it under the rug and say well i'm just you know i'm going to be much more focused on my family and less focused on my craft and act like that doesn't matter no that's a very deliberate trade-off and it's okay to acknowledge that that's a trade-off and it's okay to acknowledge that you might pay a price for that in the short run so how specific is the journaling i'm not a journaler give me can you give me an example yeah if i was reading it what would it look like i i um i actually enjoy journaling a lot i i think it's one of my favorite activities that augments my mental health um i you know you and i have spoken about it but i you know for me therapy is a very important part of this i'm i have a number of therapists actually and i i'm involved in you know right sort of i do sort of regular psychotherapy i do something called dialectical behavioral therapy which is something i'm really interested in and i've become more and more fond of as a tool to help me change behaviors but in that journal is sort of where a lot of thoughts go in an unprocessed way and in fact one of the chapters of my book which you've read you're one of maybe six people who's read it actually that chapter basically wrote itself because it was simply extractions from the journal i basically just went back to two volumes of my journals and literally just sat down one day this was actually at esther's recommendation and put sticky pads in piece in pages that meant you know that sort of took me back through the story and then the next day literally just wrote 26 000 words basically into that chapter out of out of those journals so um i i recommend it for a lot of people i i do think that it's a it's a it's a great way to process info and um you know it's private i've never shared it with anybody um so no one's read it directly um but it's a it's a place where i can be as honest as i can be anywhere it's a great can i talk to you about oh yeah that chapter i won't mention i mean it was a great privilege to read you were the first person to read it wow yeah i i remember being incredibly moved by it it was so articulate and honest a vulnerable smart and you could tell it was years of synthesizing everything and i remember i think the first thing i told you after reading it i think it was chapter it said chapter 15. i think it was chapter 15 that's right i said dude for me that's got to be chapter one i said because if i'm going to you if i'm picking up your book because i want to improve my life whether it be my longevity my health my this my body yeah i might think i want to improve my blood pressure results or whatever but actually in the end we all just want to be better humans right we want that eulogy to be stronger than our resume and that was one of the greatest examples of teaching that i ever heard which came from your ability to go i've failed here here i've learned this i've learned that and i don't think i've ever heard that from a doctor before to be honest and and it made all the other chapters go sure tell me what to do about blood pressure tell me how to train tell me how to i'm in like because i could see where it was going and i'm i just yeah i can't wait for people to actually read it um even if they only read that first chapter they'll you'll get a lot from it yeah it's it's and it's it's so interesting to to know how it's going to shake out um you know just now that book is being you know it's in the process of undergoing a major revision it's far too long um so that book when it's submitted was 180 000 words it needs to be chopped down by a full third so um but i've said a couple of things to to the editor and one of them is um i feel strongly about this chapter staying in the book because there was even some discussion about just discarding that whole chapter um because it's it's so different from the rest of the book um and as much as i'm afraid to put that chapter out there because in some levels it's all my mistakes right it reflects so poorly but but i also think what you say is true and what we'll talk about i think more is true which is you know living long without living well in terms of mental health it's sort of it's it's a form of torture in a way and i i want to obviously talk about the fountain which is one of my favorite movies that you um are in and um and i want to explore some of those themes when we get there yeah well i imagine like i was thinking when i you know when i was asking i said we have stuff in comedy but it is different for actors i mean in some ways every time i do a job you're open to criticism from critics or people or bloggers whatever but i actually feel the internal pressure from your industry other doctors academics is more brutal in fact i like if i do a job leonardo dicaprio doesn't write an op-ed and go you know what this guy is the worst he's like your fellow actors my [ __ ] about you behind closed doors but you your fellow actors are not getting out there trashing it whereas i think that's a real thing and tell me if i'm wrong but in the medical industry there is but i'm sure i think it's tough sharing your feelings i think it's tough no you're on a much bigger stage you're on a much bigger stage and you i don't think in the history of you what do you what's what performance are you most proud of on the screen

[00:19:06] there's elements of the fountain i'm going to say elements i'm super proud of les mis that was some really frightening stuff for me and elemental stuff logan because i knew that was a 17-year journey to get to that um there are moments in prisoners in [Music] um moments in the prestige the first movie i ever did which no one has ever seen called erskine bill kings which we shot in three weeks first time i did a movie um i actually i'm proud of a lot of stuff in the front runner which you know it didn't come and go but it didn't quite land in the way i guess we all hoped um it's sort of it's moments i've very rarely kind of come away from a film without criticism personal criticism that's my point right is is there's no matter how great a job you do there's always someone given the stage you're on that's going to say something that is it represents a total lack of understanding of what's what actually took place and um so so in that sense i think that i think the criticism that uh that uh that an actor or an athlete a professional athlete or a politician and look in our culture today politician's a dirty word but i i got to believe there are some of them that are still good and so you know think about a job where a 60 approval rating is amazing like that if you're if you're a politician a 60 approval rating means you're exceptional and that means 40 of people can't stand you um speaking of approval ratings i love this statistic you know these q ratings right do you know that you have the highest q rating in australia your q rating which is a measure of popularity and likability is 99 and i think the next person after you is 67 yeah it's a i i a friend of mine who runs foxtel which is like a big sort of cable network in australia and he did come from marketing originally in pr but anyway he rang me and he he told me this why did he tell me i think i was going to do something like a commercial for something he goes so the curating is more around if you're going to endorse a product yeah how much do you trust this person exactly yeah um and he rang me and he said dude for the last eight years you've been the number one guy by such a long way and he said but here's the thing i know you're gonna hear that and all you're going to think is what there's one percent who don't like me what do i have to do to get the one percent that's exhausting that's probably that and i laugh my head off and there's certainly an element of truth to that well that's why you absolutely could never go into politics the worst i when i did the front runner people said oh you want to go to boston no in fact when i said when when i did you did you spend time with gary hart by the way in in prep for that movie yeah yeah i went and spent time with him and let me just before i forget when i asked told my dad i was going to go and study acting and i sort of wanted his blessing berry my dad never gave advice about there was you know he always thought it's your choice and then after i make a decision he'd let me know what he thought which was super frustrating at the time but now i think incredibly wise and disciplined but i said i'm going to act and he goes i definitely think you have the talent but i think you're too thin skinned that was his comment to me so i've always kept that and actually it was helpful to me i don't read reviews i'll get a i'll get the temperature of the wire someone say what's what's the temperature here what what's the basic idea but once i start reading particularly when you're doing stage it gets into your head and actually a compliment is sometimes worse than a negative the negative can fire you up oh yeah i'll show them oh yeah really you know but a positive like it can can kill you but but that's so they're sort of different right there's the review for on screen where you can't do anything about it the work is done it's out there then there's the review on stage where you're going out night after night after night so do you do you think about those types of reviews differently totally so i really don't look at the reviews for on on stage again i'll just try and find that the thing because like for example i did a show called the boy from oz it was back in 2003 we did not get well reviewed i did not read any reviews but my feeling on opening night being on stage was like man this is landing like this connects with people this is i can feel it's great so i remember we got together on the next night we were back on and we were in a circle and our producers came and they did one of those don't worry we committed to the show and i remember looking around oh what's going on how bad was it and it turned out it was not great and so in in theater particularly new york back particularly back then if you didn't get a review from the new york times it could kill your show because a lot of the other reviewers followed that most people look at the new york times and it depends ticket sales depend on that so under movies it's not always dependent on that so anyway we ended up but i i could just i was like no i feel this connects i really feel it connects and we ended up being kind of a massive hit and it did actually i could feel people came back and back back one woman saw it 200 times out of 400 shows that i did it was people just i could feel and by the end we were like you couldn't get a ticket so in that way i'm kind of glad i didn't read those reviews because i knew no one knows better than me and all those other actors not even the director i know when it's landing a bit like a comedian on stage and you you know something is landing or not and someone could write a review and it will but film is different film you're removed from it you're not in the editing process uh unless you're part of that door directing it and you never really know how it's gonna land and i do actually now think i've sort of grown up a little bit and think it's worthwhile reading really good reviewers to see what their take is on it but i think i was always basically scared to read what the hell is this guy doing in on the screen like he's not that good i don't understand it blah blah and that something like that would just bring me to my knees that's what always scared me i think do you i mean so so does deb have the same sort of relationship like when you are doing something or when she is doing something can you not read for each other i mean is it is it harder to to see your spouse going through something that you deem unfair and and and then do you have sort of an agreement that says look you can read these reviews but i don't want you to share with me the the nitty-gritty of it you can give me the gestalt if it's productive for me like how do you navigate that yeah that's exactly how it works so you know i remember i did my did one man show here on broadway and deb came down to me she goes i read them all and they're amazing and i know you don't want to read them but you have to read this it's in the new york times and you need to read it so i read it and i was like deb i don't think this is a great review she goes what are you talking about it's amazing and i said i don't think so it's there was a line in there that i remembered to this day um all hugh jackman asks of his audience is that you love him loving you loving him and i kind of went hey what but in my heart i knew that was like this is kind of [ __ ] he's really he you he he wants you to think that he's really there for you but i'm not sure he is it stuck with me today i remember going right red reading it going is that am am i anyway and deb was like oh my god i'll never give it to you again but i kind of in a way what i didn't want to hear i kind of it might have been a throwaway line from the review i don't know but it's certainly but ultimately i think it helped me because it made me go all right really look at yourself is that the real me because i'm doing a one-man show it's like elements of my life how much am i manipulating that to show you what the version of me i want you to see this which is i guess what that line is about and how much of it is actually me and that's a work in progress for all of us i like if i do that show now i would say i'm more authentic than i was 10 years ago um but it's a good question like and deb is like a lioness like i mean she'll just want to lop someone's head off if they give me a bad review like she she she's very very protective i'm sure jill is the same for you right yeah i mean jo well this is funny so jill really has enormous disdain for social media which is really the place where people are going to attack you the most uh right you know for example you know recently i put out a number of podcasts um that that dealt with vaccines vaccine science and sort of the a lot of the misinformation around this and you know not surprisingly you're going to get a very small vocal minority of people who are just going to attack you over this kind of stuff um and do so in a very personal way you know not you know almost it's almost impossible for these people to say you know this is your interesting take on the science but have you ever considered such and such no no it's usually like you're in the pockets of pharma you know you're an idiot literally i had one person compare me to adolf hitler um and say that what you're doing is propagating so much lies that are gonna hurt so many people that uh you know you know this is like hitler killing jews so when you have this type of vitriol um coming at you jill's view is why do you even do this like why in the world do you do this why would you ever you know have a single account on social media that even gives people an opportunity to comment um what's your answer it's that look i don't really look at these things that much frankly it's very rare that i look at them and it's even rarer that i would respond maybe once every six months i have a lapse in judgment and i'll actually respond to someone like that trying to clarify something and i'm right i'm oh for 20 on ever changing anybody's mind who's in that stage so you'd think after like the first time i would have learned like when someone comes at you with that like that you can't talk rationally with them um joe rogan gave me really really great advice a few months ago after a particularly awful uh attack he said because i said joe how do you cope with this like how in the world do you because you must be you know you're such a polarizing figure and he just said post and ghost post and ghost whenever he put something up he never ever ever looks at a single comment um right so um you know in in some ways that's our analog i think yeah but in the end i guess you're doing it because i i i i can't imagine you do you care about those people who are saying you're adolf hitler no i mean when someone says something so ridiculous it it that doesn't faze me i think what does bother me though truthfully is that i know that a lot of the people who have really warped views about science will suffer for those views like science is a hard topic and i think scientists have not always done a good job explaining it and i think that people do sometimes pay a price for this and so i think in some ways i just i have empathy for people who are i think being misled um and obviously i have you know incredible empathy for for parents you know of of kids with autism who think you know this vaccine did this to my child even though there's not a shred of evidence to suggest that but but it's i understand of course you want to have someone to blame for this and um so i think if anything i just want to be able to to to offer those people you know some hope that says hey you didn't do this to your child um right and and so that's that's part of what i think makes me a bit sad i think that's why your book is a bit of a game changer for me in that it's incredibly humanizing i think a lot of people feel with medical stuff or with doctors they want confidence they want to feel like what they're getting is the right answer because i'm i don't know i don't haven't done any science i don't know should i take this pill or that pill so you want the confidence but sometimes they can come across as arrogance i guess from some doctors and and then people want to question it and lump it in with some kind of government conspiracy i don't really understand that but your book i think will go a long way to just humanizing it and saying hey i can be wrong by the way and i've been wrong and here's how i've been wrong and and here's what i've learned from it but you know i've done a lot of work on this and this is you know this is the way forward i i want to kind of ask you something about i've never asked you this before but you live in a world of of data in many ways right and you you clearly kind of love data i think you you love the puzzle of it and math and i've you know you've helped me out some things where i can you you love solving i want to do it this way which has amazed me have you ever gone against the data with your gut like your guts just said um he really should stand on his left foot and turn around four times and there's zero data on it or the data might say this is ridiculous have you ever ever gone with the gut instead of the data i'm sure i have at times um this is a ridiculous example but probably the best example of my life um choosing to marry jill right like if if um i remember you know we were dating when i was in residency and um it was i just didn't think i i was i was i just at the time was so focused on my work and i just wanted to be the best surgeon in the world i mean i was so maniacally driven hugh and how she even put up with me i'll never understand like every you know we're already working 110 to 120 hours a week in this hospital and when i would get out of the hospital i only had two priorities exercise and more practicing and reading so i would have to read i i made a commitment to read i don't remember exactly what it was but you know something like 15 pages a day out of surgical textbooks i ended up spending a few years summarizing the top shelf of my bookcase which was i forget i think it was like 17 000 words of surgical text into 150 pages and then i also would practice doing these very delicate anastomosis every night with my surgical instruments in these models that i had built and so when we were dating like even before we would go out for dinner i would have to do these things and she'd be sitting there twiddling her thumbs sitting on my bed while i'd be doing these things and then i'd even make her come over and inspect it i'd be like you know put the magnifying loops on and look at that do you think that's perfect is that you know could that and we it became a joke um but but really i was like and even she had sort of like this thought of like you know this is a guy who will never put me first right he will always put his work first did she articulate that to you then not not then but later on right this is actually a very personal story but which i guess i'm sharing now but um we we the week before our wedding really we really collectively had second thoughts um and and and we sat outside i remember exactly where we were and thought maybe we shouldn't do this you know maybe i'm just not the kind of guy who's ever going to want to be married and and that's that and and i guess you could argue that was sort of the data talking to me the data was saying hey you know surgeons have a divorce rate of you know rex and did did you initiate this talk yes i did no it was 100 me um and then something in my gut just overrode that and by the end of that i i decided that no there's something here that i don't yet understand and it's going to be more important and i will say and you know you now know how my life has turned out it turned out to be the most important decision i've ever made because i don't think i'd be doing what i'm doing without jill in other words when i think of all of my um all of the all of the the the difficult things that have come in my life having her as the base of my support has been the most important thing and it's she is a unique person uh everybody would say that about their spouse i suspect but it so so it's it's it's that she's the right person for me right she she is the right person for me and that would not have been apparent from any amount of data but i do think my gut probably sensed that sensed an ability for for an unconditional love that probably even transcends what most spouses could provide yeah i mean it's clear from the outside that you meant to be together again that's a gut feeling you get i actually i have a a a little bit of a similar story the beginning of my relationship with deb who is down the dead you okay if i tell the story about you at the restaurant remember the story of you and the restaurant early on talking to someone else and i'm like oh she wants to break up with me remember that story okay you okay with that all right um so early it's two or three weeks in but i i just had this feeling two weeks in and now deb and i met on a television series she's the star and it is my first job so we started dating two or three months into it but uh both of us it's an un like you never date your co-star that's the biggest cliche it kills the series the whole series was about this kind of sexual tension between in the prison between the psych psychologist played by deb and the prisoner me so everything was wrong about it anyway getting through that we get together we're there and so happy and i'm falling in love and i am just like this i've never felt like this before this i didn't really know it could be like i didn't know that there were human beings like deb on the planet i didn't know and i was super happy being single first job out of drama school 26 happy days and we go out two or three weeks and never spend a night apart we go out to dinner i i want to say there's 14 people at the dinner i sit down sort of on one corner and deb sits in the literal opposite corner on the other side and i'm like fine you know whatever like that's okay um and at one point i was telling a story and the whole table was listening to my story or i can't remember what it was but i remember looking down and deb had her back turned to me talking to someone next to her so apart from deb and that person everyone's listening to me and the thought just came into my head or more in my gut oh she's trying to break up she's trying to break up with me and that stayed with me for the dinner when we get in the car i just knew it and i said and this is not me at all me up until that point was if i'm getting the data that someone wants to break up with me i'm out first i'm i'm out like if i i'm not waiting there to get dumbed i'm gonna like see ya like so i i'm there and i'm in the car and i turned to dev and i said you're trying to work out reasons to break up with me aren't you and she i remember she goes yeah yeah i said i get it i said listen i know you're scared remember it was my first job there was a star at the time her new year's resolution was i'm not going to date any more actors and definitely none under the age of 30 right and i'm 26 year old actor in his first job like i was her worst nightmare and i remember these words came out of my mouth without i still to this day doesn't didn't feel like me i just said well i understand you're scared i get it i guess i would be too but don't worry i know we're going to be together for the rest of our lives i can feel it so you better just get over it and she just laughed and that was kind of it that was sort of the moment like and you there did no she's not no i thought i agree anyway so that i'm forever grateful i mean i do i knew and i'm the most you know me i'm very indecisive i can't whatever lunch have this or that or super indecisive and somehow we're dead because one of those moments just went oh this is absolutely clear and it is the greatest relief and when you get that i i always say to people just if you get that moment just go with it because it's turned out obviously been one of the greatest blessings in my life we're just celebrating 25 years together and it just gets better and better and better and there's no way i would be here or as happy or who i am today without it can you think of we got that in common for sure yeah yeah do you do you have any other moments like that i i um when i grew up in canada there was this sports network called tsm the sports network and every night they would show a highlight called the tsn turning point where they would pick one game and there was one play in one game that totally changed the game and so i've always had in my back my mind this idea of like you're the tsn turning points of your life and that was obviously one of them for you right that's a very important decision had you fallen into your default state which is to run run totally different life what are some other moments that you've made enormous maybe at the time they didn't feel like enormous decisions but they totally changed the arc of your life whether it be personally or professionally yeah uh i'll tell you a little one which is i just want to tell you this because it's a little freaky and i think it goes back to i was brought up in a very religious household my father was converted to christianity by billy graham so we lived that sort of life very much every holiday was church this and i remember praying every single night for most of my childhood through till 1516 that god just tell me make it clear to me what you want me to do that's all i ask i actually do not care what it is it could be anything but i want to know that i'm on that path the idea that is in christianity that i was taught was there is god's will it's a narrow path it's easy to go off it and most of the world would distract you from it but stick with it so i went and auditioned for a drama school after i done a degree i majored in journalism and before i went off to do that career i thought i'm going to audition for this drama school because long story better i'd spent time doing a play and just loved it and it was clear to me i loved it more than i did my degree so i went auditioned when i got in and that's a long story i just got in have you asked had you acted before had you done any acting before only amateur so i did amateur all through school even at college i was in local community plays and i did a play at college uh in my last semester which made me realize i was spending way more time on the play than my thesis and everything so i thought someone's off here i might just spend a year while i'm waiting i'll do this course and i found this course that was in sydney i wanted to do a course in england but i couldn't afford it so i wanted to do this one in sydney and i got in and i opened up the i remember opening up the letter and it said you're accepted and i was so happy and at the bottom it said please make payable your check for the tuition of three and a half thousand dollars now that's not gonna sound like a lot of money but in australia when i was growing up you didn't pay for tertiary education so university was free yeah it's now not quite like that but i was like i hadn't even thought of it and i just finished a degree my dad had helped me and i was like three half grand i don't have strain enough ah whatever i screwed it up i put it in the trash and so i thought oh well there goes that they're not meant to be and it's gonna sound like an exaggeration i swear to you it's not my grandmother had died three months before and the bequest came to me the following day and a check for three and a half thousand dollars and i'm literally fishing through my trash can which of course i never emptied anyway so it was there and at that time i wasn't as as sort of maniacally into christianity that way but i was like oh that's just super clear so that's that's sort of a tsm moment but not really of my own doing in a way um but then i at the end of that year i was offered i i got an audition for neighbours which is a soap opera but it was like a seven o'clock at night um beverly hills 90210 yeah yeah melrose place it was a massive show in australia huge in england i mean the amount of people have come from it uh is as actors that you would know is extraordinary i got offered a role it was it sort of came out of the blue i auditioned i got it and all of a sudden i'm like oh my god i've got to roll and i remember the contract it's two thousand dollars a week i'm like two thousand what am i going to do with two thousand dollars this is unbelievable two-year contract this is crazy but i was in the middle of auditioning for a major drama school i auditioned it went well i got a call back i went again the contract hadn't come through for neighbors so i just kept sort of auditioning and long story short i got offered a spot and i had a weekend where i had to decide and i remember i had an agent back then who was begging me like going what are you doing or thinking you must what are you talking about this is neighbors this is a job you must do it and i went to my dad who i as i've told you before he wasn't really in the business of giving advice and i said that i just don't know what to do i see both sides i don't know what i should do like my agent's saying go into the thing earn the money and go off and study you'll have money and you'll have experience you'll be in front of a camera and then keep studying i said but dad i just don't trust myself once i start working then i'm going to do the training and i don't feel i deserve an audition at the royal shakespeare company which is where i want to work or the national theatre i have and i don't think working on anyone doing all this and i remember he said to me he goes phew i can't answer that for you well that's the decision you have to make you're 22 and this is your choice great thanks dad i was like and i went off i decided i'll just put it away don't think about it by the next day it was just clear to me that idea of i want to work at the royal shakespeare company i when am i going to get the training that makes me feel i deserve to audition for that a bit like you you want to be a great surgeon you didn't want to just i'm going to work in that that little place down there i've got the job at least i can do that kind of work you know no i wanted to have the opportunity to do everything so in the end i decided i went to my dad and i said that i've decided to go and go to drama school and not do the job and he goes oh thank god oh i'm so happy i said what i said you knew all the time i guess yes but i just if i made the choice for you then i would have denied you that moment of maturing and growing and it would have forever been dad told me and i i remember that to this day but that that was one of those great tsn moments for me at turning points your relationship with your dad is is kind of amazing um how old were you and your mom left i was eight so i was eight when mum left um but she had been unwell first year and a half of my life uh i'd spent with my godparents so i i think mum went into hospital when i was about with postnatal depression major when i was about three months old she went into hospital so i was with my parents for the for that period then i came back and i remember periods where mum would be just going away for a week which i guess was some kind of reset or maybe i i actually don't know if it was like an official sort of facility or rehab or just getting away by the way five kids yes and you're the fifth right you're the youngest yeah i'm the youngest so uh yeah so when i was eight she left i don't think she ever played in fact i know she didn't she told me she didn't plan to leave for good and it just sort of did and she wasn't in a great place and and her mom was not well so she went back to look after her mom in england and so i did so my dad from when i was eight my older sister i think was 15 or 16. so he brought up you know from those ages he brought up all of us he's sort of an amazing man in that way it's like if you think about what that decade must have been like he i don't think he had a moment to himself for 10 years i don't ever remember like there was sometimes he used to he was an accountant at price waterhouse and he used to travel for work and i actually remember now i know we travel when i had young kids like just the first two days when you travel when you have young kids is the greatest thing when when you go somewhere there people hey do you want to go out and go shut up no i want closer curtains i want to go to bed at eight o'clock i want to sleep and then i want to wake up and i want to read the entire newspaper from front to back or the other way around and i want to drink coffee i don't want to talk to anybody but he had an incredible incredible time but that that decade i in in many ways i learned many of my i guess ethics hard work from him for sure how much do you think that your mom's departure impacted this perfectionism and this insatiable probable desire to sort of please people um do you feel that that was either conscious or subconscious subconscious for sure um it certainly rocked my world as you can imagine i was eight but i remember people thinking oh you don't really under i remember them saying it doesn't mean i i'm like i totally understand like i think we underestimate eight-year-olds and also i have older brothers and sisters so i certainly have learned after that more about the dynamics of the relationship but i was never and i can't say this for all my siblings i don't want to speak for them but i don't ever remember being super angry with mum and i i on some level i always had a kind of connection to her and a sort of understanding that she loved me that she had done her best like on some level i think i always felt that that it was certainly a whole for sure and i had a lot of fear that got exacerbated from that sort of i guess you'd call it anxiety now i didn't at the time just scared of lots of things and i guess that unknowing i i can rationalize it now that that perfectionism in me is uh you've got to work really hard to make sure people don't leave right you've been really you're going to be your best and and it's interesting i just finished watching that great documentary by ken burns and uh lynne is it novick no no no i think so i always get her last name it's called college behind bars and it's about the bard bryson bard prison initiative about just anyway it's it's an amazing doco if you haven't seen it i highly recommend it and i actually it's not lost in my first job was in a prison playing a prisoner it just feels to me very similar dynamic like when you have some kind of abandonment or a hole my way of coping with that was i'm gonna make sure that i please every that no one's gonna wanna leave me behind but ever like that's not gonna be i i'll work whatever you wanna do i'll work hard i'll do this that in that way i think it's really i think it's sort of the opposite in some ways of people who end up being rebellious by the way my next brother up was really rebellious and all of that and i was the opposite i would i would do all the things my brother did but i never wanted anyone to find out i just wanted to stay in in the good graces of of everybody and that's that's how it impacted me that is such an amazing topic to explore as you know our mutual friend paul conte um who's really one of the most thoughtful people when it comes to understanding trauma and and certainly your mom leaving when you're eight if that's not trauma i'm not sure what is but one of the things that's so interesting in in talking with paul is kind of the the ways that two people in the same household even could have different adaptations to the same trauma um and and so one could one could move one way and your brother could move another way and yet those were both serving very important needs to to each right right they were both adaptations that were that were were serving you and and usually more productively than unproductively which of course brings us back to kind of how we open the discussion at some point those adaptations generally become counterproductive you know at some point those adaptations catch up with you and they start to become maladaptive instead of purely adaptive and i think that's the thing that people struggle with is understanding which again is another form of dialectical synthesis which is hey there was a day when this was a really good adaptation and and right and and it sort of got me to a certain place but you know now it's a little counterproductive and that doesn't mean that i can't embrace what it's helped me do what it's protected me from and yet there's still there's still uh a rationale to be made for changing things and improving well i i couldn't agree more i actually want to ask this uh to you because knowing your history in particular i i didn't know that you had that desire to be the best surgeon in the world but it doesn't surprise me when you did athletics or you did swims it wasn't a three mile swim it was a 50 mile swim it was like you would push yourself through crazy limits physical mental spiritual emotional i i need to there was that need to push am i right sure yeah so you know i've only recently read as a man thinketh it's like written in 1904 it's like this big it's a great book and he and james allen writes in that that the growth is is part of nature it's very natural growth and it is uncomfortable but it is the natural state so i think both you and i went beyond that natural state in our need to be successful or to achieve or to grow we would go through unusual amounts of pain or sacrifice you've done it i would say more than me i think your capacity is one of almost everyone i know has been so huge well now i know you're more sort of measured about it but what what is the line how would you coach your kids about what is the line where it's actually destructive and not productive this is such an important topic that i struggle with a lot and i talk about a lot with my wife um because i don't know the answer right like there's there are times i look back at my upbringing in my childhood and i think boy i'm so um i i i look back at the child and i i feel sorry for certain things that the child endured um but then i think but but look at what came out of that right look at the resilience that came out of that and um but then i think i don't want my kids to experience some of the things i experienced as a kid but i also want them to have the internal drive to do things that you know i i i wonder um how can that be created from a positive place because i do think most of my drive came from a negative place and i think so so it's important at least for me to separate the part that is above the surface that which one sees the striving the achievement all of those things from that which is beneath the surface which is is it coming from a place of self-love or is it coming from a place of self-flogging and i think in my case pretty much everything i did came from a place of self-flogging and therefore i think there's really no scenario under which that's the right thing um and i i i so so if if the answer is could you be sort of so first of all i don't think that's uniformly the case i think there are lots of people who achieve you know who are you know doing well in whatever it is they choose to do who can do it in a way where they're not sort of flogging themselves to get there right and what i want to understand better and one of the things i'm really interested in exploring as a parent is how do you encourage your kids to achieve the best that they can do but but not from this place of of beating themselves up to do it totally i'm asking my dad oscar who's now 21 was maybe four four or five or six i think ava was born and i remember saying to dad i said dad give me some advice you've had five kids like you've been watching we were on vacation what am i doing no no no no you're doing great no that's fine i said come on dad i had to really push him and he said you praise the kids too much i'm like oh he goes you know when oscar takes his plate off the table and puts in the dishwasher and thank him for that that's expected and i in that minute i was like oh yeah all of us and my siblings have this sort of need to do more to please and you know but sometimes i go what sort of worked you know in some way it works but what is that balance i i don't i for my dad i do praise him too much because i i guess i want to focus them on i like following like the seth godin like i i read a lot of seth and i know you like seth that way of following your fear the thing that scares you that there's some illumination in that and having something to say and doing it for other people and then that way it takes care of a lot of stuff so there is a responsibility for every single person on the planet to be part of this community and i try to say that the kids like what what are you offering what is it you've got to offer and it's even if it's something you love there's going to be days you don't want to do it um but i want them to do it from a place exactly as you say of self-love ava just went off today to do a pre-act test i was just i texted her this morning i was mad with myself i didn't say it to her before she left um and i wrote this have fun today no test is a reflection of you who you really are just be curious and open love you and uh i'm sure she was like rolling her eyes when she read it right but i guess that's what i'm trying to be curious i i try to say to him when she goes to school i was like ask challenging questions today and you're like uh roll our eyes i'm like don't just do the good girl i got my grade and you know that i said the world doesn't need those people i was one of those i was school captain of my school and this and like that i always plan my homework and blah blah blah but that's not what the world needs and we'll order people who are gonna do what they love know when enough is enough more is not always better in terms of consuming or just achievement be disciplined about doing less all those things are what i'm trying to teach them speaking of kids how much have your struggled with being the son of you know famous people you told me a story once that i i thought was very touching about how devastated oscar was when he learned obviously retrospectively that john lennon had been killed and i mean first of all it's just amazing to me how how much that troubled him it really troubles so i would say he was eight or nine when he found it out and there were tears for i'm going to say on and off for three months three to six months there was a period where i genuinely said to deb i i've got to step away i think i've got to step away because it's too much for him because he was genuinely frightened we would go to central park all the time we would go to strawberries past the john lennon memorial and he just saw me as a famous person and i did try to explain to him that there's different levels of fame there is a mania with some people tiger at his height or bieber or you know but that's never really happened to me john lennon and the beatles that was a whole different thing but so when i nine year old for him he just found it really difficult he hated the paparazzi he hated the attention when he was a little kid like i remember he was about two people would come up to us at a table right they want to talk to me you know what people they want to talk to you so what they do is they come up and go oh hi to the kid hey look at you look so cute and it's like there's a way in right and people would come out and oscar would just go he would look at him go like and i thought that's the most honest response at this table right now right i just wanted to be but of course you know i i never want to be like that with people and sometimes people overstep they don't mean to they don't know or sometimes as kids but oscar was always brutal and so it was on and off and when he was a little older it never really left in a way until reason till he was like 16. he would if i said oscar i needed a why haven't you wanted to clean your room you've got to clean your room you know i'm just cleaning your room it goes well why would i listen to you when you won't listen to me i would say wait a minute he goes well you won't stop acting so why am i going to clean the room you know how that important is to me and so we really sat down and had a conversation about and i said i said you do understand like i didn't ever expect to be famous like no one ever does i don't think no not the actors i know you've got to draft school before he is and you hope you could pay your rent and if you don't you'll go and do something else but it's a really rare thing let alone be really sort of successful that's just a crazy thing that just sort of happened and i said well he said well why don't you just do theater like when you were just doing theater before the movie thing i understood people in the theater were you know they would clap you and then you would have your normal life i said you know well i really loved the films as well and i said to him it's not what i set out to do i didn't set out to be famous i'm not trying to hurt you you know i understand to be there for you and he looked at me straight in the face and he said so if you had your time again would you do it differently [Music] i was like wow i said that's a really confronting question if i knew what was coming and what how it might impact you i said i i would find it really difficult i might have done things in a different way but i said i probably honestly still do it oscar and not for the fame or the money but because the people i get to work with i i pinch myself every day like i'm having the most amazing time i'm working with incredible people so imagine something you love to do and all of a sudden you get to work with other people who you just can't believe every single day i said it's so fulfilling to me i never really got you just but i i remember thinking that's a really brilliant question for a 12 13 year old to ask it was a really difficult time and i remember there was a period where i thought if i was truly loving and i i should just drop it for whatever reason it's just too much for him to bear everyone on the other hand has always been really balanced about it i i'll tell you a funny story about that we arrived in australia after a 24-hour flight from new york and once we got through customs there were a lot of photographers so the way we would handle that is i would separate myself the family would go ahead it would you know split them up and ultimately they needed me in the photograph so and in australia in particular the kids are famous because deb is very famous too so they want the family shot so i would just separate myself and a neighbor just came back and started to walk with me i said oh baby you don't have to do that's fine she guess it's okay i said we're walking along and they're taking photos of us and i said how is this for you like would you prefer that i was just an accountant like my dad and you never had to go through this and she said that we just got off a first-class flight on qantas from new york to sydney i can put up with this for like 40 seconds and i thought you know let's she's just sort of super super balanced about it and kind of gets it she's just always seen me all right there's a bit of a trade-off here but no i'd still prefer to fly first class for 24 hours and put up with two minutes here you know yeah and then and then i've been lucky in the paparazzi thing just to follow up now i remember we came straight from the airport i was super worried and we were going down there to shoot a movie so i was there for 12 months they all followed us i'd rented a place and i'm like oh they know where i live of course they're going to know where i where i was renting and we pulled in and i could see behind me 15 photographers and i thought and an oscar's dark he was dark and i thought oh no we're back home we've got a year here with my family with his cousins with everything so i just said everyone go yeah you guys go inside and i said i'm going to unpack but i wasn't going to unpack i went out of the garage and i went out onto the street and i started walking towards him and you can see the cameras come up like oh this is great he's going to he's going to confront us yeah yeah yeah he's going to prove this is like gold for them that's what they want right and i one guy shane i said hey shane and he puts his camera he's sort of like the most senior guy i said can i have a word he comes over they'll put their cameras down they didn't quite know i said dude we're here for a year i said you could see the airport like this really bothers my son which means it really really bothers deb and i and i don't want to get in a situation where we're hiding inside a house in australia and i said so but i understand you need something so what do you need and he goes um we need you at the beach with your shirt off i said i'll see you there bondi tomorrow morning 8 15. so i literally had just made a deal i felt i made a deal with the devil but i thought in the second i thought okay this is the lesser of two evils i guess so i went down the next day and i trained with my mate mike and i said mike i'm sorry but i have a feeling there's gonna be some photographers when we get into the and he was hilarious he goes awesome because i've never looked better like he's the same age as me completely ripped and so he's like bring it on um so we go out there it was the most uncomfortable 20 minutes of my life because there were 15 of them and they were in the water up to their waist like it wasn't like we're on the beach i'd given them this permission and i was like what have i done what have i done this is so embarrassing so i have a swim i catch a couple of waves i come back in shane just nods at me and i said we're good and he goes we're good to their word never saw him again for 12 months wow not with my family like they would take me occasionally like if i was somewhere i get that that's fine i can live with that and other yeah so that was my little deal with the devil which worked out well there was i i thought some honor amongst them and i was pretty impressed that they kept that for for 12 months and it would end up being a great year for us you know there's so many things i want to i want to pull on that one of them is just the amount of energy it takes to perform and then the amount of energy it takes to not perform right so so there's there's a cl you know so to me the stage and the screen are very different and i want to explore them both in separate ways but let's go back to the greatest showman the the stage production right so when you came and stayed with us in san diego i guess that was two years ago right yeah um when you and erv came and um one of the things that amazed me was the whole purpose of having you come and spend a day and a night with us was to give you a break right it was like i don't know how many weeks or months you were into that but it was a grueling schedule it was hotel hotel hotel hotel deb and the kids are back home it's just you and irv you know i it's like you can't even leave your room you're having meals in your room i mean it's this it just it just struck me as you know a very difficult experience and we were like look we want you to have a totally normal day where we're going to work out in the gym we're going to do nothing we're going to have a home-cooked meal and but you know it just happened that like my my sister-in-law and her husband are in town the kids are in town so there's like all of my kids all of their kids everybody's there and like they worship you like no other because they don't understand you're not the greatest showman like they actually think you were the greatest showman right and what amazed me is actually that's a movie i should have mentioned too yeah ones i'm proud of i don't know why i didn't so yeah i couldn't believe because our thinking was okay hugh let's just make this we're gonna go to the gym go have a shower go relax we'll call you when dinner's ready but you couldn't wait to jump in the pool with the kids you played with them for like an hour and a half while i got dinner ready and i and i just remember thinking hugh this is your chance to turn it off like you don't have to perform here you don't have to please these kids this is you this is your window to not please anybody but just relax um and yet it i just i was amazed at how much first of all it didn't look like it was an obligation to you you genuinely looked like you were having fun but i was just i didn't know where the energy came from that that's really my question where does that energy come from well it it kind of energized me and it surprised it did surprise me because i i was very tired it's a game of exhaustion i guess the same for like during the nba season you're traveling in this and it's it's managing recovery and and like you you're really just doing your best and it's a bit monk-like um and when you get a day off because that was a day off for me it was a rare thing to be in the city without traveling and a day off um you think okay this is the time to recharge and when i was there we jumped in the pool like look if i i definitely would have jumped in the pool with the kid i love your kids and the kids were there and i would have done it for five minutes you know what i mean if and done enough to you know okay the kids have spent time with me they got to know me a little bit it just was energizing it was somehow genuinely fun first of all the kids forgot within five minutes i was a greater show and we were just playing a game and they got competitive and i sort of felt like a kid again and you realize sometimes particularly in a creative field actually i don't know if it's creative or not you've got to go outside your zone a little bit and it becomes an inspiration i i learned this when i was a drama school like my teacher goes if if you're an actor and you don't say yes when someone offers you a ticket to the ballet then you're not a real actor and i'll be like the ballet but i'm interacting he goes it's another creative art form you've got to you don't know where the inspiration is going to come from if you're just going to listen to the songs that you think you like and go to the movies that you like you're just going to stay in that lane as an actor like you need to mix it up right so i didn't mean to do it in a way it was like i have been on my own like i've been with the group and then you get to the stage and you've got 20 000 people and you're leading the group and tell you when you get home you just want to sleep and read and i was just missing my kids my family just being silly and playing in the afternoon where you don't care about whether you're overusing your voice or you know and again great food wine um those berries i remember awesome what was that that you put it was it what was it you brought the wine though that was the finest that was that was the that was the penrose right it was a pamphlet pencil yeah yeah yeah yeah and paul's grange which i'm happy to give them a plug because it's probably one of the finest wines i have i have since been procuring it uh not to the level of the bottle you brought that was that was that was one of the finest yeah penfolds um but anyway so that was that it it it was a joy it was a real joy and by the way couldn't you see it in a irv has been my like when i first knocked on the door to deb's house i was over there helping a change of clocks like i've known deb since i was 11. so and it's become one of my closest friends and he ended up working with me and still does occasionally on things but we both went away that night just going i didn't realize how much i needed that we're good friends family barbecue like a sunday afternoon just where you let loose you have a couple of beers a glass of wine good conversation and it was totally energizing yeah it was it was great and of course the next night when we came to the show i i simply couldn't have imagined what that was going to be like um because i had deliberately not read any reviews also so i knew nothing about this and it sounds funny but going into it i literally assumed it was going to be a stage version of the movie not realizing that it was actually more of a stage version of your life which included the movie and the opening tribute to your family immediately makes that clear right um right and it's so it's so moving it's so touching um that at the end i mean i i don't know if you remember the email i sent you that night when we got home but i mean i was i was really kind of it was very hard for me to all take in um and and and how gracious you are with an audience right and how much energy you give and that's the part that again of all the things that an actor can do it's that ability to be on stage night after night and put out that type of a performance because how many times did you do the greatest showman on stage performance-wise 92 92 right so on average let's assume that each person is only seeing it once so they're not going to go to multiple shows so you can you know you can largely figure out how many people have seen that but for each of them it's the only time they see it so you're the type of person who goes out there and every night you're making sure that they see the best version possible like you have to do that 92 times right very few people live in a world where that's the case i mean i think great athletes will often say that right this muhammad ali used to say that all the time right like right you know you may never see me fight again i want to make sure every person knows on this night they got to see the best version of muhammad ali um i don't i don't know where that i don't i don't know where that energy comes from actually because it's both there's a physical piece to it that i can sort of understand like you could be well enough conditioned and obviously you are but there's actually an emotional piece to that that i can't relate to well first of all thanks for saying those nice things and there's i i think for me the stage in particular whether it's an arena or the theater is as close to this spiritual i think my job gets i i've had moments on a sound stage where you're filming something it feels incredibly intimate and powerful and things are happening but you really get that feeling of this as a sacred space i get it almost all the time and i make sure that i do everything i can every night to do that so there's a few things for example triggers for me i never really wear aftershave i i just you know occasionally i do it but i usually do it on a special occasion so for me i always wear aftershave when i'm on stage because just that smell makes me go oh oh special night tonight this it's a visceral thing to waiting in the wings before i don't look through the thing i want to hear that sound of the audience gathering um i actually had an idea which i got talked out of on that tour of warming up on stage as people were entering i'm like why do we have to have this feeling of oh we're waiting for hugh and we're in and we're waiting and the show's going and then the lights go out and there he is i was like everyone does that what if they saw me on my foam roller and i'm out there and i just say hey what if it was more like in my living room and then we're still going to do the big opening and the lights are going to go out but what if we just dropped all this pretense of oh my god you came to see you know like anyway i i got talked out of that i think for security reasons in the end but um did you still get would you get nervous before each show yeah yeah which you know you mentally just go into excitement and but there's definitely a buzz there always is for me and and it comes out of that i want this to be a special night and for me when i go to the theater or to a show like i've been to lots of concerts and doesn't matter how good they sound or how big the production is if i feel like this is the exact show they did in portland oregon like i'm pretty sure this is the exact same show except hello melbourne hello sydney that's it i just wrote oh we're just sort of churning out the same show it just feels doesn't feel soul for me i i always want an audience member to go i was there on the night when you know that feeling of something happened that night because it is a special thing it's a yeah and i know what it takes and i love going to the reason i understand in the wings is because when i'm sitting in my seat i'm reading my play bill and i hear the hubbub and that i literally get tingle like i'm so excited i've always been like that since i was a kid so it clearly is where i'm meant to be but it certainly is important to me and i'm actually a an introvert by nature not an extrovert but somehow i can feel on a stage even like in san diego that night more relaxed i would stare say my heartbeat is even lower apart from when i'm dancing then when i'm just on stage i can feel very calm and myself i don't know where that comes from i think that's i don't know where that comes from it's just maybe that's born not made but that i certainly had that feeling and did you have to train yourself to do that because to be an introvert and yet to be able to be so energized by that type of an experience uh seems counterintuitive to me yeah well the reason i got into acting why i wanted to do it i i had i told you i was brought up in a very religious sort of upbringing i certainly that idea that there is a spiritual element to life there is a higher purpose to life to everything you do the activity in the end is not as important as fulfilling that and my definition of that is far broader than what i was growing up i certainly don't believe there is a literal heaven and hell and only those people who believe this set of beliefs are going to the heaven and everyone else but that's what i was taught growing up i don't believe that i don't think it's as linear in any way but i wanted to get into acting for that socratean idea of know thyself like in you know on the delta oracle there's just two words know thyself that's it understand who you are why you're here and acting for me was the way to do that for you it was medicine like and that was your path you meant to be clearly meant to be on right for me it was was acting so i was always more interested in that i can tell you now the most spiritual moments i've had in my life have all been on stage it's like the moment in moving stops and things are floating in a that feeling of timelessness where things can happen you can be singing a song but somehow you can be acting you feel a connection with 2 000 strangers 20 000 strangers we're just all sudden together that feeling of consciousness whatever that is i've only i've had those always on stage i i in a different way obviously with family and close friends you can get that moment but that's certainly that outer body experience that people talk about that spiritual experience for me has only ever happened on stage and that's why i always go back to it that's always my goal um why i was embarrassed by that line in that review he just wants you to love him loving you loving him i'm like oh no no that's not why i'm trying is that geez okay that's not my highest self that's my lower self if it's true i really want something deeper and so that's why weirdly on stage and i don't think i've learned it i think that's somehow a mass of everything i'm trying to do and be in this world of feeling completely at home and connected on stage it's where i have that spiritual meaning i guess is it different if deb oscar and ava are in the crowd yes yes and no like i really am trying to be it's actually wonderful to me like when you guys were there in san diego i really love it because i know in a way that you were seeing a different side to me and a real side of me if you ever see me on stage and i walk out and i do this i did at the oscars i did everything so my everything i do first off is i try to find their eyes now my kids look down because they're just terrified i'm gonna call them out i'll put a spotlight on them i always do this to deb because this is where one of the greatest gifts for someone who is sensitive to have a marriage with someone where you know that no matter what happens if i completely suck if i die if the career is over if whatever happens is over she's there for me no matter what so when we were together that that night of sunset boulevard she always says it was a real we were already married but she said you could feel i'd become a star that night like there was a hubbub and talk and she's there at interval and then after and all i remember was coming backstage it was excitement it was a big thing for me big my big lead role i guess in a way and i said i just need to see deb i see a bunch of people i came backstage i said i just want to see deb first and i remember i just held it and i said no matter what happens you're the most important thing to me like anything else and so now to sort of remind myself of that i always put my hand over my heart just as a signal to her to say you're the most important thing to me and it gives it just really calms me down so in that way it's different at the oscars it really helped because when you go out and this is when i was hosting the oscars if you see meryl streep brad pitt and like the front row front three rows just every star that's ever lived who are all looking at you like what were you thinking man like why did you say yes to this just to see dev it somehow puts that perfectionist in me just climbs it down who's okay no matter what happens everything's going to be okay um i feel like you've asked me a bunch of questions i think it's my turn can i ask you a real tough one can i ask you a tough one sure and i i actually don't ask this of anyone but i remember i was very moved you asking or just explaining in your book and you said it on this the eulogy qualities as opposed to resume qualities and of course as a doctor you've seen a lot of death you've experienced it you i'm sure you have patients who are facing it or faced it um are you scared of death yourself so it's really funny um you haven't read the epilogue of my book which i only wrote maybe a couple months ago and in the epilogue i actually answer this question for the first time and oh wow the because i i don't think i understood it until very recently i would say i had always been afraid of death uh not afraid of dying and they're they're obviously different right dying is the mechanical process of you know going away i think i probably have the same level of trepidation about that you know there's the uncertainty am i going to die in a car accident am i going to die this way or that way but but that's actually a far distant concern to me i think my greatest fear was my my fear of not being here and i think that fear took a dramatic step forward when i became a father and and i think the reason for that is the constant tension between what i'm doing and what i should be doing and and therefore i think my my initial kind of obsession with this topic of longevity which started about 10 years ago in some ways although i didn't know it at the time was really um trying to delay this thing i didn't want as much as possible which was leaving this planet without having done what i was supposed to do because deep down i kind of knew i was doing a bad job of it right which was not being a good enough dad not being a good enough husband not being a good enough fill in the blank so i think that through everything that i've gone through in the last year and so i'm i'm now i've got more confidence in those in in the stuff that i'm doing that i actually don't feel afraid of dying in the way i used to right yeah and then in that you i'm coming to grips you're going to answer that question you can answer those questions in the affirmative like yeah yeah i'm i'm doing my dad yeah exactly husband yep exactly yeah that's pretty awesome that's a great place to be i mean i think if i was just talking to a mate yesterday about that the idea of coming to terms with you know i've done enough like there's more i want to do but we've done enough takes a huge weight off i think for people like us that idea of having to do more let's talk about this in the context of the fountain right which is i think one of the most amazing movies i mean obviously you and i are both just such fans of darren um yeah and i just i think he's literally just one of the most gifted people imaginable yeah and what i like about that movie oh there's so many things i like about it but is that it's open to so many interpretations and i actually want to hear yours because i'll share with you mine and i i've never heard darren's i don't know if darren's actually spoken about what he intended it to be and maybe he didn't he has has he he has he has okay well before you see before you tell me i want to tell you what i think but obviously the theme of this movie is immortality right this is a big part of it how did you get inside that character of thomas tom tommy um how did how did that how did that challenge you and how did it make you think about your own mortality if at all hugely it was a so we you know 17 years ago now darren came to see me dude the boy from oz a musical i was playing peter allen and he just he said i've got a script for you and i read the script and i was like that i read it that night because i was such a huge fan i thought i don't fully understand this but i think this is about the meaning of life like this is this is as close as i've read to this is what it's all about and i just said i'd love to do it we spent a year working on it before we rolled one foot of film um i did year of tai chi we did yoga i had to be in there's a there's that position you have to sit in yeah yeah it took me a year to get my hips you know flexible enough to be able to do the lotus position and also just understanding the history of it and the mentality of it and the obsession of a man who i'm now literally as i'm speaking it i'm seeing some of the parallels with your chapter in your book right he's love for his wife who is sick and dying and his race to to heal her and cure death and he's obsession with that and the absolute need to cure death um when i spend a lot of time talking to doctors there's a lot of doctors who believe that's in some ways theoretically possible that we could cure every disease which is interesting probably another question i want to ask you but i had to go further inside deeper into my own emotional reservoirs journey and in many ways it was the most lost i've ever got in a character i'm not an obsessive person by nature i'm quite liberal i'm balanced even when i was partying with my mates i'd be the guy at three in the morning going you know what guys diminishing returns from here i'm out and then they'll be dead i'll be there till midday the next day and i was just naturally that's that was my thing or maybe i was too scared to kind of just fully go down the rabbit hole but um i spent and i'm so glad you called that out with daryl because he also became a great friend and this was actually in film the closest i got to a spiritual experience that would where the rolling camera and stopping your camera just blur and that feeling of living particularly when i was in the spaceship in that bubble there were moments where it touched on emotions for me where an hour later i was still crying like everyone's gone to lunch and i'm wrecked with sobs like he was touching on things and that was totally because of darren and his belief in the sacredness of a of a creative space um he's just a pure artist and you know funnily enough all that stuff you know the tim's talking about the ayahuasca and all of that which i'm not sure how much i i should say but this sort of came out a lot of that but this is way back when you know darren's always been a a searcher in the in consciousness the broader sense of consciousness the meaning of life the eternal immor immortality um and he's not afraid to ask those questions i feel like i've gone off track a little bit i like to found like i feel better it was certainly the most it was the only time i came home from a movie where deb said it took you three or four days to get your feet back on the ground it took me a while to get grounded again and and and i remember by the way with darren i've never really had this before but i i formed such a a creative bond with him that there was all that time in the spaceship where i was on my own and imagining and this where he's gone on to live you know forever darren would be right next to the camera my camera's here and he would just be right there now and i would ask for him so i said darren can i have you close and just him coming it would open literally rip my heart open um he just created a feeling on space in the space that was sacred and in terms of what it's about i used to ask him all the time like dude can you explain this and he goes what do you think that's how i think x y z and he goes yeah i said right but what's it about he goes no i'm not gonna tell you like it doesn't matter it's it's whatever it is for you as it is for the audience i go yeah i got it but come on so i remember i kind of i i would bug him about it all the time and when we went on the i we we'd be at press conferences and a panel and he'd get asked a question and he would start explaining the move and i'd be like looking down i'm like that's what that was about i was completely wrong like i'm literally i'm on the complete wrong page there and he would look down at me and just sort of smile at me like it's okay because it was true for you it is true um i actually don't i i wish i could remember exactly but i had that whole timeline like everyone asked which is the present so which is yeah and and i don't know why for me it resonates that the present is the present that's the way i find it that's the way it spoke to me was that the present was the present and right and that the past and the future were sort of metaphors and were you know sort of right spaces of of sort of emotional travel but that what was really happening between tommy and isabelle was actually her physically dying in front of him and him not being able to save her and him struggling with this loss of control and and this this this fact that we're mortal yeah uh i i i could be entirely wrong i could be entirely wrong that's what i thought that's what i thought uh and i think from memory darren at that conference was saying the future is the present wow but i'm actually not very confident about it i have to i have to uh what now i'll just bug him yeah um he's one of the most genius filmmakers and by the way so much fun like he's really really fun and a good funny guy super smart super interesting yeah i love him we we catch up all the time now and he's he's great i am i it's so bizarre that i i've forgotten again what the whole meaning is but to me i i sort of love the mystery of that movie like the it's sort of the mystery of life it is whatever you whatever we want to believe it to be it is actually this is the question i want to ask you manifestation right you hear all about it are you buying into it do you believe it i don't know i mean you know i think i i'm still in many ways sort of grounded to my science my reality um i yep dude what about you i'm a recent convert to it you're evolving yeah i actually my dad was always about it always this and in my head i'm like it just sounds nice and i i get the placebo effect if you believe something that's probably going to come true and certainly with fears like don't hit the tree don't hit the tree oh my god the tree right yeah you're thinking about obsessing you're heading that way but i used to think no and actually my life is a good example you should say i used to say to people like if i had manifested when i was 23 i wouldn't have thought up half the stuff that i've done or has happened to me not even a quarter of it i would have had far less sort of scope to imagine what could be so maybe i would have limited my life if that was true you know so that's not what it's about so like dev and i play back cameron we played backgammon a lot like probably 15 20 games a day really 4 500 a month yeah it's like our little back m is such a great game because it's five minutes like chess is like a commitment it's minimum 30 to an hour you just don't really often find that time right backgammon you can just go play one game three games anyway um i will when i was first introduced the idea i wanted to believe it because i was hearing it from a life coach that i still see to this day and i thought you know what i'm going to test this out i'm going to test this out and back him and it worked it literally worked this whole i was losing my for the month buying there was no way i was going to win i was like all right this doesn't make any sense that i'm going to win this month i have to win like 20 games to three or something like that [Music] okay i'm practicing close my eyes believe it feel it imagine it okay imagine your senses around that feeling when that dice is rolling it's a double six it's the fact the frustration of deb that i'm winning winning win could it be and i won and i'm like i almost didn't want to test it again because i was anyway i'm a recent combat but i imagine like even if you publicly said yeah i'm kind of into it you would probably get completely destroyed you would be professionally destroyed uh but anyway i'm just sort of this that's why it's a very unfair question but i i do find it fascinating and and it maybe for me goes back to my biblical religious sort of upbringing all that stuff in the bible of you can move mountains and if you believe it if you know what is prayer what is prayer to imagination then you hear coach k that famous letter to self have you heard that because i haven't let it to self no i think it was on cbs sunday morning used to do this thing where led it to myself so you write a letter to your eight-year-old self listen to coach casey and coach k would have all the players do it or no he did it he did it okay he did it for himself a letter to himself when he was eight and you can google it yeah okay no when he was i mean he did yeah yeah but a letter to his eight-year-old self yeah and he talked about he didn't say the word manifestation but the power of imagination he said there's one thing i could tell you all those hours spent imagining that you're hitting the game time buzzer when you're really on your driveway out the back and you're going past six defenders and and there you are layup and you win the championship and he goes that that those hours you spend are preparing you for the future in ways you do not yet understand but i actually think to me that's that's very plausible right i think that that's entirely plausible um because i think that is rehearsing a set of skills and and literally myelinating a set of you know uh channels in the body um that that do come into play right um where i can't where i can't come up with a plausible explanation is where it purely you know where it implies where it impacts randomness that's out of your hands right in other words i i can absolutely see how it can actually material alter the course of something you have control over um but i don't i i don't understand the mechanism by which it would go otherwise which of course is exactly the the great conundrum of how one reconciles religion and science right like yeah you know um religion makes sense to me in the in the sense of why it exists it exists because we had no tool to explain the natural universe until 400 years ago right right until until the 17th century there was no tool to codify nature right so if you think about how many thousands of years our species existed without a framework or a tool to explain what we saw why is it bright out why is it dark why are there stars you know why does anything happen well we if we don't have a tool that can say well there are gravitational forces and this planet is rotating this way well then you have to come up with something plausible and that something plausible becomes stories and those stories become the basis of of religions and and that's why going back to a question you asked me a long time ago i think that's why science is very difficult for people to understand it is it is not remotely innate evolution has not at all prepared us for it we have not been selected for it it's you know the scientific method is literally only 400 years old uh the idea of controlled experiments like this is a fraction of time in evolution's history right this is less than one one thousandth of one percent yeah so the likelihood that this would be innate to any of us is is preposterous right yeah and i'm sure there are some people for whom these ideas come more naturally than others but but you know just as there are probably some people for whom acting comes more naturally than others but the reality of it is if you want to be good at your craft you you've got to practice it and similarly right learning to think critically is very difficult and very unnatural we're we're wired to we're wired to pattern recognize and come up with stories right absolutely evolution evolution actually prepared us very well to do that because you were rewarded for that evolutionarily right right if if if you saw you know billy in your tribe what story do you tell your kids i i actually love to i love to try to explain science to them i i really do but if they say if they say dad is is god real yeah this is where my wife and i struggle a little bit i think my wife likes to demure a bit more and say well you know i mean i think that's you know she'll say more like that's a bit of a mystery um i i'll just say look there's no evidence of that you know you know and and and and that's you know i'll i'll just and again that really amazingly i haven't been asked that question directly but but what i'd like to be able to do is kind of not not get dogmatic with them and and say of course not that's a stupid question blah blah blah but instead say well you know it's an unanswerable question let's be honest right it's an unanswerable question right so maybe you'll find yourself being an agnostic more than an atheist but but but let's let's think through how would one even go about answering that question and how would you test some of the claims that would come along with that question you know things like that yeah so um this goes back to kind of what you said don't read don't you read your social media tomorrow there's gonna be a lot of evidence just plowing in yeah exactly so on this on this thought of immortality um let's talk a little bit about logan because i how much affection do you have for logan like you've he's been such a part of your life for so long it's like i can't imagine how you must feel for him because my affection for him is unbelievable right like he's not even real and yet i feel an affection for him the way i feel an affection for you now explain how that's possible right like you're a real person you are my friend i have affection for you logan is a character and yet i feel for him i weep for him i how is that possible that's a really that's a great question i think there's something archetypal about the character i'll go back to my personal connection with her but it's a very archetypal character it's been the basis of many the outsider the reluctant hero he's a mixture of where we want to be while most of us want to be like that's why he's so cool and i wish i was wolverine and marches to the beat of his own drum and and yet he's imperfect too which is so important completely imperfect so we can relate in that way um i have such effect when you act when you're acting you have to fall in love with the character you've probably heard that before it's but you sort of do you have to even if you're playing you know macbeth if you're playing someone who murders the king because he wants to become king on any level yeah this guy's a monster right but that's where shakespeare's brilliant you get inside his head in his ambition and you can see it coming you see his feelings it goes without saying every character i play there's some level of love or affection but with wolverine i've i felt at the beginning like he was teaching me it's going to sound weird because i'm a people please and he's the opposite right he he almost to his own detriment is an outsider i'm desperate to be an insider i will do whatever i need to be to be on the inside and so playing someone who was the opposite was so great for me so kind of relieving and fun and it was difficult at the first not a particularly happy set i didn't feel comfortable for quite a long time i didn't feel i really had uh the support on set in in just the very first one but just the first one okay which was what year was that 2000 99 we were filming and i was you know someone else was playing the role do great scott had the part and he got injured on another film and that film went over so they had to recast so i was sort of like i got cast they were shooting it was their third day of shooting and i was coming to do an audition on set so i was a bit of a last minute thing i could just feel a bunch of people like ah we had the guy like who's this guy and then i just don't think i found my feet for a while i was trying to i was came from the theater we rehearsed let's work it out together and it just wasn't that and and i felt very much on the outside and i actually thought i was going to get fired

[01:50:37] pretty reliably uh felt that i was close to getting fired and and the humiliation of that i remember spending a weekend talking to deb and i was just bitching to her about this person that person you know this situation and she actually said to me she goes um dave i don't think you've done enough work i said what she goes i can i understand why you're angry and probably a bit embarrassed and scared but it sounds to me like you actually you haven't done the work like in a really fun i spent all that weekend and i went oh that was that's another tsn moment that's right yep that's that's great from your wife great spouse to kind of hold your hand i know yeah tell terrible you poor thing and they shouldn't have done this and while we're there but you gotta pull your finger out and get to work yeah and i did and on that monday morning i went in and i instead of trying to make scenes work i just had like the first thing i did that day i had lived everything i had lived i rewrote it i did everything i said i'm not doing any of the i was like i just sort of took over in a way like i was forced because i felt like i was fighting for my life by the way that's something i've i've got i'm a pretty nice guy but if you back me into a corner you're going to see the wolverine in me that's definitely i definitely have that and it's appeared i've sort of got off track a bit but i just felt like i owed you a bit of an explanation of that first one so i felt in a way even closer to the character because of that situation then it was clear to me that people it was clear to me i was getting calls from the student you could just feel when things are turning around when you're in a position you're on set and they're not loving what you're doing it's like you've got a bad smell people just away you're not getting invited to the drink after thing and that you can just feel there's a jockey for don't get close so he's a nice guy that guy you but and then you feel them coming towards you right and i'm getting called so i knew that things were turning around i had no idea what would happen to the film at all the success of it no one knew that that was that was a bit of a shock to everybody i think but over the years my affection just got deeper and deeper and by the way people i remember people saying to me like are you doing another one like doesn't get boring all i wanted to say was like this character couldn't be further from me and it's like imagine you went to the gym you've got yourself into a greater shape and then you didn't go to that gym for two years and then all of a sudden said right we're back in the gym again he's like oh how did he how do you do it again it was always like that and i always had this feeling from the first one i was reading the japanese saga the first one i'm like this is this is the story we're gonna tell and you know i just didn't really have a say in it and so by the time we got to the last one where i had to say i was i was really adamant about what we were going to do and i'd always felt like i'd let the character down a little bit if that makes sense how so there was more to the character and i could easily rationalize that in an x member because you're one of um he's one of the more popular characters but you're still one of 12 characters and on any level if you're the writer you've got 120 minutes you have 12 characters you just don't you may have three scenes for your character and and was was prior to logan was origins probably the one that most featured you would that be right because you were an emergency yeah origins was what 09 origins yeah yeah which was unbelievable like i mean i've probably only seen it 51 or 52 times but i mean it's it's it's it's just unbelievable i still then felt frustrated that we hadn't got to the core of this character i just really felt there was a deeper story to tell and there was resistance for sure not amongst the key people at fox to be honest you know the key people were like let's go for it but then it was like oh if we go i rated it's probably 100 million we're leaving on the table you know we've spent all these years building it and then i said gotta call it logan because this is actually about more than human beings ah no like we've spent 17 years building a brand yeah harley davidson's harley davidson you don't all sudden call the harley davidson terry like that's a holly so that we need wolverine on the post and i said and me and jim like no and and again they went with it there's a lot of bold steps and i i guess that's why i was super proud of it because i knew it was going to be my last one i i had i know that and it just it just kills me to hear you say it still i know that's true and it upsets me so much i didn't want to have any regrets about it i didn't want to have any sort of because i then i would be doing another one yeah um probably because i would never lose myself you know so i just going back to your original question i just still pinch myself that i got to play such a great role that i feel at peace with it that i got it to do it in nine different movies that anyone who knows me from anything just knows that if they knew me before i went for the audition for and i wasn't getting the part like it's not so it was felt in every way it just felt like a great when patreon when patrick dies i mean when professor dies of course i mean first of all that is to me one of the most startling scenes in the movie that you just don't expect you know and what's so heartbreaking about it is how he doesn't realize it's he thinks it's logan right and um [Music] you know i i don't how deliberate was that very that was very deliberate and i i that's where like the writers and jim mangold they they just made so many decisions i was just immediately so proud of when i watched first of all patrick was incredible that scene prior to him dying he does that monologue which is admitting his failures and faults and his regrets and liv it's not too late for you live i don't live i know you can live like it's so beautiful beautifully written incredible his affection for your daughter is is unbelievable and he's basically trying to give you this one last chance to make it all right and then i you know i i remember sitting next to patrick stewart and jim mangold the fighter director who i've done three movies with is one of my closest friends in berlin so we go to the berlin film festival which i wrote down on a sheet of papers this is the type of movie that will premiere in berlin like film film this is going to be soon as a film not a superhero movie but a film about a real character so we're sitting there in that scene where and jim just directed this so well i obviously wasn't there because my character's in the grave spoiler alert if you haven't seen but where she walks up all the other kids walk off they've done the funeral she walks up to the x the two sticks that have been put in the thing she just takes it out tips it over onto its side into an x i could get emotional i could cry now just thinking about it weeping it was so because in many ways going back to telling you about my upbringing that idea of this is how you've taught i was taught when i'm a kid this is religion and at some point you have to become your own man and wolverine was always his own man but actually he wasn't really an insider in the end he was an x-men like he really was the epitome of what x-men i i thought the poetry in that moment and and we didn't know if we were going to kill wolverine or not when we started it really of course there was a discussion and we all said unless we earn that moment then it's a stunt it's just like oh it's one and it'll piss people off if we get it right it was that feeling that i had in that cinema or just wow and i remembered just grabbing gems like put my hands on their legs and i turned out patrick and he was just crying and you know we realized it was 17 years and such a gift in our business where you go in you meet people you become super close three months later see you later it's a really odd kind of business in that way um was there i don't even remember this actually it was at darren's birthday darren's 50th birthday you and i were sitting next to each other and we were talking about the last scene of logan because i had recently re-watched it and i sheepishly admitted i was like you're not going to believe this brother but the first time i watch this when logan says this is what it feels like i thought he was talking about death right i just you know and then of course the second time i actually understood what he meant has anyone else ever said that to you has anyone ever all the time really all the time that's a jim wrote that line i think it was jim i don't think it was scott but i think it was i'm pretty sure it was jim i when i read that i was just like i thought the same thing because the ultimate when i first read it i thought ah the person who's immortal effectively immortal and yet unhappy with life like is it must speak to you for someone who deals with longevity what's the point i've been around forever if you've got so much pain and lack of understanding where it comes from that my god this is what it feels like in the whole movie you get a feeling of someone who almost wants it to come like please take me out of my misery please please please but then it wasn't until we were doing it and playing the scene oh no it was before that when we talked about it i realized there's such a dual meaning to this people are going to take it in different ways again that's what jim jim mangold always says to me yes don't in a movie don't tell me one plus one equals two all right that's science tell me in one in science i want to know one plus one equals two but in r tell me one plus one equals three and then spend the movie proving it to me it's like making me go away and an end line like that is it's just such a great example of one plus one equals three it can work on both things i think aaronoski had knows that fully um that was a great birthday party by the way wasn't it i think it's literally the best birthday party i've ever been to in my i'm with you um can i see something i i feel weird i've i've i do want to ask you this it's more trivial than some of the subjects we've been talking about but when i was training for wolverine at one point my trainer said hey we need to mix it up i'm going to bring in this guy scott who's a professional bodybuilder and natural but natural bodybuilder and we're just going to train with him for a week and we might just pick up some tips so training with him at the gym this was when i did actually it was x-men origins i was in sydney someone comes up to him every 10 minutes at the gym and wants advice right no matter what he's doing and i never forget the first like he was on the lap pull down and he's doing it by the way a great thing i learned from him that i've used to this day i assume to be in his shape you have to just smash it he starts super light on everything like it's ah fun and builds up he doesn't do one wall upset then three smashing it lightly so by the time you're doing your third fourth set you wanna you actually really want to lift your body's got used to it it was such a great tip go light like it shouldn't feel like a chore all the time like oh yeah i can do this pull this easy a little more no problem and then you just want to go in and rip it so he's on the lap pull down and he could feel someone walking up asking about to ask him hey dude how do i get into shape right his whole life that's what he is and without tony goes don't eat carbs after three in the afternoon the guy goes up oh he didn't even ask his question he walked away i said dude how often do you guys literally tons of work someone was going to ask me that so you in your job as a longevity doctor must get asked every five seconds what's the one thing what's the thing you say on the lat pull down to that is the most important thing to change your life oh no he said one more thing he goes don't eat carbs after three you'll lose three to five kilos in the first month that was it [Laughter] oh gosh um look i think i think i think there are glib answers to that question and i think there are serious answers to that question i think um and by glib i just mean universal right so what's the universal truth in longevity gosh um if you if you're willing to exercise nearly every day like you're going to end up in a good place you know exercise is a very potent gero-protective agent right that's a very non-sexy way to describe exercise but it's it's potent right so it's it's it really has a strong impact it's diffuse it acts in many different parts of the body and it's very gero protective right it really slows down aging and you know if you want evidence of this just examine the opposite just look at what happens to people when they are sedentary um you know you look at someone who especially someone who's you know our age who gets laid up in a hospital bed for a week and you look at how far it sets them back you know it yeah if you if you're laid up for a week in the hospital it could take you six months to recover from that physically so so you very quickly understand the potence of exercise and and so i would just say don't underestimate the power of exercise which of course then gets into all the technicalities well how much of it should be zone two how much of it should be zone five how much strength how much stability and of course the devil's in the details there and then i think the other thing i would say is something we've been talking about all along which is don't underestimate the power of relationships because ultimately they are probably going to play a greater role in the quality of your life than the length of your life but that matters more what's what's the long you know the definition of i think the definition of hell would be infinite length and misery right so you know what i love that i love you said that about relationships i i i i my best mate started a charity gus he started a charity based on a doctor he did on male suicide and it was incredibly successful but his idea in this charity it's called gotcha for life with the number four but it's gotcha is the idea that never worry alone like make sure that you have some one and hopefully more than one where you can say anything everything and he goes and by the way like i have that in my marriage you have that in your marriage a lot of people don't but as long as you've got someone a mate that you can that actually that loneliness and the inability to unload stuff you need to unlock we as humans need to unload it um i think that's really vital from my medical standpoint no i i i look this is an example of things that things where my thinking has evolved so much right i i think that you know 10 years ago when i thought about this i just didn't find this to be this this meaning the the the sort of emotional side of this to be a particularly relevant piece of the puzzle um and right and i've evolved obviously as you know to the complete opposite end of that spectrum um and now you know it's one of those things that's often the case once you get to the other island you look back and you think what was i thinking on that other island you know because you you just you can't appreciate what you didn't know at the time right and i and i think that there's something about giving to someone else that and sacrificing that um i i think david foster wallace uh spoke about so eloquently in his um uh commencement address yeah this is water and and the way he the way he he talks about the these the myriad petty ways in which we can sacrifice for other people and that's you know that's that's a big part of what it's about and i i think that any parent recognizes that that on you know on some days it can be really tough to be a parent but you know you're making these sacrifices for your kids you know it's not always fun to be a parent right it's not always fun to be married it's not always fun to do all of these things but i think somehow finding the beauty in those difficult moments you know when your kid's having a meltdown or when your spouse is really pissed at you and you think it's unjustified but you bite your tongue like right there is value in that total and i think there is joy in that yeah my brother my oldest brother ian when my boy he's had four kids when my when oscar was born he rang me and he said i'd amen everyone's gonna tell you this is the greatest thing to ever happen change your life you're gonna be amazing and it's the best time in your life and he goes here's the truth some of that is true but it's also you can be so tired and angry and frustrated and a lot of it's going to be really annoying at times and it's going to be inconvenient he goes it's ok ok man when those moments happen just give me a call like it's okay it was so relieving because of course you're three hours sleeping like four hours sleep at night you're gonna be shitty you know at times and of course it is great too but parenting is i tell you i've learned some it the mirror gets you know shown up to you about of who you are so quickly as a parent yeah very nakedly um so how do you handle aging in your field right you're you're you're in a field where you are forever going to be judged by your appearance um i think the field is harsher on your female counterparts than you for sure for sure but nevertheless how do you how do you think about this process and how do you balance because you know you're becoming better and better in your craft and you're getting older and at some point i mean there are you know there's there's the clint eastwoods of the world where i mean they just seem to never be able they seem to transition into that age like as they go totally yeah i embrace it like i embrace it certainly 95 you know sometimes you go wow or you'll see a photo of your head you know where you looked and you go wow those bags wow like you look like [ __ ] and all that but in general i embrace it i i i've he'll kill me for saying this but uh the guy who did my skin cancer my basal cell i had a bunch of my nose so every time i go in over the years to do something on my nose and they're doing corrective surgeries like you know i could just do a little this bag it's easy i could just fix that or we could do that i'm like no dude and or or there's he goes i could take some fat from somewhere and i can pump it into into here and then you won't get that scar that divot because when you look from the side and i said nut and he goes it's my wall and i said it's my nose i don't have that i i kind of have that feeling of embracing it and i actually enjoy it if i'm really honest part of that i want to stay a movie star i've got to do that i've got to be is exhausting to me it feels pointless to me and i'm happy not to embrace it i mean it's like i've never really loved that side of it and it's exhausting relieving my real north star i look to is newman everything the way he did his career the newman's own the way he just kept his passions going and he did a lot for the actors union behind the scenes he did a lot on nuclear disarmament behind the scenes like yeah that's that's why you do it did you ever get to meet him once once it was awesome i was it was awesome he was he was fading at the time he was super skinny and clearly not well but yeah he he's my hero so thanks for today man you're a hero to many thank you and you've played many heroes uh and i i i thank you so much for your openness i know it's um it's a hard thing for an actor to do because you have this contract with us that says as long as we don't know you we can believe you right it's true but but as you can tell from me i'm i want to answer the questions that's why i'm doing it so you're right it's it's a bit of a tight rope but you help me walk out better than better than almost anyone else and i you know i listen we're friends but i also listen to your podcast and i think what you're doing is really helping it's helped me a lot well thank you for that i love you
