## AI Summary

Here's my analysis of the provided transcript segment about egg freezing with Dr. Paula Amato:

1. **Executive Summary**:
The discussion focuses on egg freezing as a fertility preservation option, with particular emphasis on optimal timing, costs, and success rates. Dr. Paula Amato explains that the ideal time for egg freezing is in the early to mid-30s, rather than the 20s, as this represents the best balance of egg quality and likelihood of actually needing the frozen eggs. The conversation also covers technical aspects of the freezing process and genetic testing of embryos.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Egg freezing costs approximately $10,000 per cycle plus $1,000 per year for storage [00:00:00]
- Women in their early 30s typically get 10-15 mature eggs per cycle [00:02:06]
- Recommended number of frozen eggs for a 30-year-old is 10-20 for a decent chance of success [00:02:06]
- Women closer to 40 might need 20-40 or 50 eggs for similar success rates [00:03:09]
- Modern freezing uses vitrification process to avoid ice crystal formation [00:03:43]
- Genetic testing results typically return within 1-2 weeks [00:04:19]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Consider egg freezing in early to mid-30s rather than 20s [00:01:29]
- Don't wait until late 30s when more eggs would be needed [00:03:09]

4. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Next generation sequencing is used for genetic testing [00:05:17]
- Primary focus is on chromosomal abnormalities (aneuploidy) [00:05:17]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"The sweet spot we think is like early to mid-30s. That's where it makes the most sense because you're about to kind of get to the probability cliff where it starts to really decline." [00:01:29]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
- What are the specific success rates for pregnancies using frozen eggs at different ages?
- Are there any long-term studies on children born from frozen eggs?
- What are the specific risks involved in multiple egg retrieval cycles?
- How does the vitrification process compare to traditional freezing methods in terms of egg survival rates?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] what's on the horizon medically for extending fertility. Yeah. So, there's a lot of interest in extending fertility, right? Like up until, you know, 100 years ago, women were basically dying at 50 is the average age of menopause. So, it's it's a kind of a recent phenomenon that we're actually living a third of our lives, you know, postmenopause, but and fertility starts to decline way before you go through menopause. So, there's a lot of interest in trying to extend fertility. Now, of course, egg freezing, which we haven't talked about yet, um is one of the ways you can extend fertility, and it works pretty well as long as you're young when you freeze your eggs. Um but again, it's a relatively recent phenomenon. Not every it's not you're not usually covered by insurance and it's expensive, etc. So, it's not the answer because you're paying basically half the IVF cycle to harvest and then you're paying to freeze. Yeah, exactly. What's the cost of freezing? About $1,000. Well, $10,000 for the cycle and then about $1,000 a year for storage. And you're recommending that women, if if a woman came to you at 20 and said, um, you know, I'm going to I just want to double down on my career right now.

[00:01:08] Uh, I want to do X, Y, and Z. I think I want to have kids. I at least want the optionality. When should I freeze by? Are you going to just say do it now because No. Yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't recommend all women in their 20s freeze their eggs because most of those eggs will never be used. So you'd be doing it for nothing because most of those women will probably not need IVF and get pregnant spontaneously, right? Got it.

[00:01:29] Okay. The sweet spot we think is like early to mid30s. That's where it makes the most sense like because you're about to kind of get to the probability cliff where it starts to really decline. Okay. Right. And if it doesn't, if you think you might want to have kids, but you're not in a place in your life where you think that's going to happen in the next few years, then doing it early to mid30s is is probably the time where it's most cost effective. Very high likelihood that you will use them. If not for the first kid, maybe for the second kid. Um, and you know, it might be worth spending $10,000 and $1,000,000 a year. Right.

[00:02:06] And do you freeze them? You freeze every egg you retrieve? Only the mature ones. Okay. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. And what's the for a typical 30 year old um you're going to get what we talked about earlier? Probably 10 to 15 per cycle. Sometimes more, but that's And how many do you recommend a 30 year old do? Yeah. So, there's some calculators online. So, the younger you are, the fewer eggs you need because more of them are going to be normal. So someone in 30, you know, I think 10 to 20 would give you a decent chance of success. No guarantees. There's never any guarantees. But even, you know, studies show that even if people use those eggs and then are not successful, the fact that they did something proactively, there's some psychological benefit in doing that. So even if you know, ultimately doesn't work out or you don't end up using them. Um, but at that age, maybe 10 to 20. Obviously, if you're, you know, as you get closer to 40, you might need 20 to 40 or 50, which is not practical for most people, right?

[00:03:09] Because you can't do that many cycles and it's expensive and there's risks involved. So, so I think egg freezing is a great option for for women. I also think as a society, we should try to make it easier obviously for women to have kids during their peak reproductive years in their 20s and 30s. So it's a whole different question but I think having options is is a good thing. Tell me what the freezing process is like. So the freezing process uh these days is one called vitrification it's called and it's like this special kind of freezing that doesn't result in ice crystals. So

[00:03:43] So how do you do that? And there's a process it happens in the lab. There's a machine I see that does it that lowers the temperature. And uh so the rate at which they lower the temperature right it's rapid. Okay. Okay. So, it's like a liquid nitrogen dump basically. Yeah, right. As opposed to old days when we did slow freezing. So, it becomes like a glassless glass-like state without crystals. But the it works really well and the survival is really high. And then you store them at what temp? Like liquid nitrogen temp. Yep. So, it's not like in your freezer. No. Yeah. At home.

[00:04:19] And And then how long does it take typically to get the genetic results back? Uh, typically within a week or two. Okay. Yeah. And what depth of genetic testing is being done here? Are you doing whole genome sequence or are you just looking at a handful of snips that are pre-identified as the ones that matter?

[00:04:39] Yeah, good question. So, it's evolved over time and I should say it's still very controversial because there's always a risk of harming the embryos. You're only looking at a few cells. So, is it really representative of the embryo? I mean we do it a lot and the data definitely shows that if you transfer a normal embryo it has a very high chance of implanting but the issue is recently has been are we discarding embryos that are maybe normal uh because we think they're abnormal based on the genetic testing but the genetic testing is flawed. It's a whole So presumably genetic testing is really easy to identify annuployy.

[00:05:17] That's chromosomal analysis is geared up to do that. Right. Okay. Right. So most of the time we're using something called next generation sequencing which is you know very high level sequencing but it's not whole genome sequencing. So you're getting targeted. Yeah. and you're looking mostly at chromosomeal abnormalities unless you know that the couple is a carrier for some genetic mutation that you also want to screen for.
