## Description

Original release date: 7/2/2018

Rhonda Patrick, Ph.D. and I go on a Nerd Safari into the jungle of health, nutrition, fitness, performance, and longevity. We visit IGF-1 and whether there’s a tradeoff between having high or low levels. We discuss the PPARs (receptor proteins) and genetic polymorphisms. Does Rhonda think there’s any benefit in a NAD+ booster for health and longevity? Can saunas lower the risk of heart disease, dementia, and all-cause mortality? We dig into those questions…and a lot more.

We discuss:
-What Rhonda believes differently today than she did a few years ago;
-The paradox of GH/IGF-1 in performance and longevity;
-The role of PPAR in fat metabolism and ketogenic diets;
-The possible genetic explanations for why some patients don’t respond well to a ketogenic diet;
-The health benefits of heat and cold exposure;
-NAD+; and
-More.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive with Dr. Rhonda Patrick:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features an in-depth discussion between Dr. Peter Attia and Dr. Rhonda Patrick, focusing on several key areas of longevity research. The conversation covers IGF-1 paradoxes, ketogenic diets, sauna benefits, and NAD+ metabolism. They explore how beliefs about certain interventions have evolved over time, particularly regarding caloric restriction and IGF-1's role in longevity. The discussion emphasizes the importance of cycling between different metabolic states rather than maintaining constant conditions.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- IGF-1 shows a U-shaped mortality curve, with optimal levels around the 70th percentile [48:19]
- Ketogenic diets can be obesogenic in rodents unless calorie restricted or time-restricted [09:49]
- Sauna use 4-7 times per week associated with 40% reduction in all-cause mortality [1:12:59]
- PPARα and PPARγ genetic variants may influence ketogenic diet response [1:18:19]
- DNA repair enzyme PARP acts as an NAD+ sink, potentially contributing to age-related decline [1:34:38]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Regular sauna use (20 minutes at 170-179°F) [1:18:46]
- Combining exercise with proper timing of cold exposure [1:25:12]
- Time-restricted eating within 9-10 hour window [1:28:48]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Ketogenic diet modifications based on genetic variants [1:32:06]
- Cold exposure timing post-exercise to avoid blunting hypertrophy [1:31:04]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- Exogenous ketones can increase blood ketone levels to 6 mmol/L within one hour [1:37:39]
- NAD+ precursors may improve health span, particularly in muscle and brain tissue [1:37:29]
- Metformin's potential impact on NAD+/NADH ratio through Complex I inhibition [1:36:20]

5. **Exercise & Movement**:
- High-intensity interval training can reverse decade of VO2 max decline in 24 sessions [1:03:41]
- Exercise timing relative to cold exposure impacts muscle hypertrophy [1:31:04]
- Strength training benefits extend beyond muscle to brain health [1:17:30]

6. **Nutrition & Diet**:
- Ketogenic diet requires careful protein limitation (100-110g) to maintain ketosis [18:59]
- Time-restricted feeding may enhance ketogenic diet benefits [09:49]
- Fasting may be more beneficial than chronic caloric restriction [06:28]

7. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Blood ketone levels of 0.5-1.0 mmol/L considered therapeutic threshold [1:32:06]
- IGF-1 levels should be monitored relative to age and health goals [48:19]
- Inflammation markers may be most predictive of longevity [1:08:43]

8. **References & Resources**:
- Dr. Valter Longo's research on fasting and cancer [52:31]
- Dr. Eric Verdin's work on ketogenic diets [09:20]
- Nature study on lemurs and caloric restriction [06:28]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"The more we learn, the less we know" [1:02:00]
"Exercise is probably one of the best ways to increase mitochondrial biogenesis" [1:29:09]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
- Optimal frequency and duration of prolonged fasting for stem cell activation
- Impact of metformin on NAD+/NADH ratio and DNA repair
- Role of genetic variants in determining optimal dietary approaches

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions I've gathered along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of those successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you with a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at

[00:00:34] Peter Dia MD com welcome to the Peter attea drive in this episode which I know is long anticipated I spoke with dr. Rhonda Patrick from found my fitness I suspect many of you listening to this know everything about Rhonda and have been fans of her for a really long period of time on the off chance there's anybody listening who doesn't know who

[00:00:59] Rhonda is I suspect by the end of this discussion you will also become a huge fan of hers and her podcast which is exceptional so I've known Rhonda for quite a while and just by the fact that we both consider San Diego home then we've just been busy enough that we just haven't had a chance to sit down together in quite a while so this discussion was kind of long overdue and it was sort of funny because as soon as

[00:01:22] Rhonda walked in we just jumped right into a really interesting discussion and then 10 minutes in I thought you know we should probably start recording because this is interesting stuff and so we did and similarly when the discussion finally ended we sat around from other 20 minutes talking about a bunch of stuff that I found myself thinking god I wish we were still recording this cuz it's super interesting so that's just basically to say I suspect Rhonda and I will speak again it at some point soon so don't worry if all of your questions weren't answered here the other thing about this podcast that was a ton of fun was that in the days leading up to it she and I had emailed each other a few times back and forth some ideas of things we would talk about and in the end neither of us really had any note sitting in front of us we just sort of sat there and shot from the hip and didn't follow a script or anything like that and didn't even get to half the things that in our emails we had suggested we would talk about that said all the stuff that we talked about is that I think Rhonda brings a great deal of expertise to so I don't recall the order but I know that we certainly touched on IGF and the growth hormone what I consider a little bit of a paradox which is on the one hand we have some evidence to suggest that elevated levels of IGF and that fasting may act in part by reducing those levels but at the other end of the discussion you you have some confounding and conflicting data around that we also got into a great discussion about the p par enzyme so P power alpha

[00:02:42] P power gamma one of the things that Rana does incredibly well on her podcast and I would encourage those of you who find this episode interesting who aren't familiar with her work to go back and actually watch some of her stuff Rhonda doesn't put out a lot of podcasts but the reason for that is the amount of work she puts into them is enormous so when she puts up a podcast on video there's explanations definitions and stuff scrolling across the screen so it's it's a unlike me who's incredibly lazy and can't even stand to listen to a podcast after I record it Rhonda is methodical in her ability to make that easier for the viewer so you'll learn a lot about this stuff you think we're going to quickly over it by probably going back to Rhonda's site we talked a lot about the possible genetic explanations for why some people do and don't respond particularly well to ketogenic diets and of course you can think of that in two ways there's respond as far as the ability to make ketones but then there's also sort of these patients that I described seeing where you put them on a ketogenic diet and everything seems to go wrong so at least biochemically wrong so now that's a very interesting discussion in many ways I think my favorite part of this discussion was the way it started which was the first question I asked Rhonda which was kind of a random question I think led to some interesting back-and-forth between us which was effectively what do you believe today that you didn't believe before and vice versa and I always find that to be one of the most interesting ways to dive into a discussion with someone who's buried knee-deep into science because if you're really thinking about science you have to understand of course that virtually all facts have a half-life and our knowledge is constantly evolving in many ways that's what makes the field so difficult to stay on top of but at the same time so interesting and so to me one of the marks of a very thoughtful person is someone whose beliefs are flexible and who's willing to acknowledge that something that they believed was once true or not true can be flipped and so I think you know

[00:04:43] Rhonda and I share that and I think it was actually really fun to see where her beliefs have changed over time so with that said I think the show notes for this particular episode are going to be very helpful and you can find those at Peter attea MD com forward slash podcast and I hope you enjoy this discussion at least half as much as I did I suspect it won't be the last so without further delay here's my conversation with dr.

[00:05:09] Rhonda Patrick Rhonda so great to have you here happy to be here it's great to see you again I can't believe we live in the same city and only see each other once a year if you're in well thank you for taking the trip up here today to my office my pleasure and I'll join the long list of people congratulating you on your 10 month old son thank you thank you I almost don't know where to begin because there are so many things that you know we share in common as far as interests but I want to start with a really broad question which is you spend so much time thinking about many of the same problems I spend time thinking about what do you believe today that you did not believe four or five years ago probably the biggest thing that has changed and what I now believe but I didn't four or five years ago even more is that one of the major modalities were you know how increasing healthspan which is you know the healthy part of of your life delaying the onset of age-related diseases the major modality for doing that that would be the best way to do it would be calorie restriction or dietary restriction so eating you know thirty percent less food than you normally would eat I used to really think that was the way to go for for doing that and

[00:06:28] I think that my beliefs have changed for that in that being the major modality for a few reasons one reason is because I think that actually so one of the things that that occurs during caloric restriction is a major drop in the growth hormone igf-1 and that's you know that's thought to regulate a lot of the you know improved healthspan effects at least in in some organisms like mice and and rhesus monkeys but I do I do believe now based off a variety of research from people like Valter Longo that periods of growth actually specifically periods of igf-1 are really important so you're not you know if you're constantly doing this calorie restriction then then you're you're not really gonna have that period of growth because you're chronically doing that and really interesting I don't know if you saw the recent nature study that came out it was in April this year on lemurs the so the the study essentially showed and these are you know I guess they're not human primate mole animal model but their lifespan is in a median lifespan is around my six years or something like that and I think their maximum is 11 or 12 years I don't remember but the caloric restriction did increase the median lifespan it also increased maximum so they like lived a year longer than typically and there's you know a lot of delayed onset of various degenerative diseases but there was a massive atrophy and gray brain matter in in regions of the brain that didn't occur in control animals which is just another sort of example of how you know sometimes some of these modalities that we we think are really good for increasing health span sometimes have other effects and I think that getting into the igf-1 I think will probably you and I will talk about that because we both have a shared interest in that but but the periods of growth and being necessary for health I think I think that's kind of kind of turning point in my mind and so now I actually think that perhaps even doing periodic you know prolonged fasts or a better way of doing that because you can you can get that igf-1 boost and you can get the the lower igf-1 among other things that occur but um I think we can dive into that if you want but I think that one could be done yeah I think that's probably one of the major things the other would be actually another interests that we share would be I think it was a lot more skeptical of of ketogenic diets about four years ago in terms of being great for long-term health and health span and I think that some of my my thoughts on that have changed a bit based off of more recent long-term studies in animals specifically in mice from work from dr.

[00:09:20] Eric Verdun and also from out of UC Davis showing that ketogenic diets in in rodents can inhale span increase meeting life span certainly improve cognitive function now the caveat there is that typically with a ketogenic diet in in rodents it's actually can be most the time is obesogenic and the way that these guys worked around that was they found that had they had to limit the calorie and what was interesting was that or or cycle them right well so dr.

[00:09:49] Eric Verdun the way they did that was by cycling it but UC Davis what they did was actually put a calorie cap and turns out after talking with dr. Sachin panda that they ended up being on a time restricted feeding schedule and so the ketogenic diet was you know they were basically eating all their food within a certain like you know eight or eight or so or nine hour window and then they were fasting for so you know it's kind of one of those things where you know in humans we don't we don't really know you know I don't know exactly know how people I've never actually done a ketogenic diet myself so I don't know exactly what people are doing if they're eating you know all the time or what so so I'm also intrigued by that and and in many ways almost have the mirror of your experience which was you know four or five six years ago seven years ago I guess is when I really really got into ketogenic diets was on a ketogenic diet for three years save one day and I wouldn't say I have any less faith in them today I just impersonally less interested and find it much harder to do so just as far as compliance with the ketogenic diet you know I think my life is just more complicated today in terms of travel and things like that and kids and stuff but the thing that surprised me with the recent because those two publications came out and sell right the ones yeah I was actually kind of surprised by a couple of things so one was what you said which was Eric noting that hey when we constitutively gave these guys this food they just they got obese that's really counterintuitive when you think about how ketogenic diets increase circulating metabolic fuels and that should down regulate appetite and I think in humans you know there's a huge debate about why do people lose weight on ketogenic diets are they losing weight because they're eating less were they losing weight because they're ramping up fat oxidation disproportionate to where they were before which drives up energy expenditure of course I suspect the answer is both in other words if you do the latter the former should happen so when people say why do you eat less on a ketogenic diet the question is really or the thinking would be are you eating less because you are basically eating yourself more because you're obviously oxidizing all of those fatty acids to make BHB or is it some other reason that you know has to do with the neuro chemistry of these things that go beyond sort of the metabolic central pardon me peripheral effects of it so that's the first thing that surprised me of that study which was why were those mice overeating was there something else in them because they couldn't have had that much secret they usually put sucrose in

[00:12:23] Mouse chow but there couldn't have been that much sucrose or they wouldn't have been able to get into ketosis and I think even previous studies like earlier in the literature showed something similar worried it was obesogenic now there was certain genetic backgrounds it also seemed to kind of little you know regulate that to some degree but what I was actually thinking so you brought up some really interesting points is that thinking of it in the context of like let's say they're they're eating they're constantly eating the fat or they're not they're not having a period of rest I know that for example when you're making malonyl-coa which is something that you do when you're oxidizing fat malonyl-coa inhibits the connoting pontil transfer is the basically the transporter to transport fatty acids in the mitochondria so if you constantly are making methanol koay because you're constantly eating the fat then you're going to start to have this inhibition you're going to start to then store that other the fatty acids in adipose tissue rather than caramelizing them right so it seems to me that we don't see that by the way with the exogenous ketones do we this is something I'm still trying to get and alone I I agree I'm certain I am I am extremely interested in exhaustion as

[00:13:25] Ketones approach like them okay you yeah yeah it's gonna bring you someone so I I really enjoy effects they have on on my brain so I've used them for like endurance exercise and I also like it for that as well I do notice that I have a little bit of a run longer than I usually stop at this point on the beach and like I can keep going another you know but what I really like is is for me it really helps with focus and lower anxiety levels so like I seem to be able to I'm always on to the next you know what's and and so this kind of helps me like stay in the now at least I and that could be completely Percy but I don't know but anyway so that's one thing that

[00:14:04] I like about that but to get back to your point I had wondered the same thing because what's the effect of exogenous ketones on normal fatty acid metabolism and the reason I'd wonder that is because there was a paper that recently came out where I think it was the one that was done in humans where humans they were given the beta hydroxy butyrate ester for endurance and it enhanced endurance performance but they found inhibited yes and also it inhibited fatty acid something to do with the flip fatty acid transport out of the adipose something to do with where I was like going with some what some of that had to do with lipid metabolism which suggested possibly there could be in innovation now you know it's funny I'm gonna see I'm in New

[00:14:51] York next week and Dom is gonna be in New York Dom D'Agostino who obviously you know well and we're grabbing dinner one night and I we're gonna talk about this paper because I remember when it came out Dom sent me an email we'll know for sure if you want or ever you said it yes and that's for sure because there was something about that study that was a little bit off I need to kind of go back and and and look at it but it does beg another question so I want to go back because we're there's gonna be this I know there's gonna be a theme today which is multiple threads that are easy for us to go off and I are great at going on - yeah yeah let's go back to the mice let's go back to the two studies do you recall if in the

[00:15:30] Verdun study when they before they started cycling the ketogenic diet when they were just giving it to them all the time did they have a window in which they could eat ad libitum that they over a tin or were they given 24-hour access to food 24-hour so what they never tried then was let's give you food for 10 hours and let you eat ad libitum because that would be interesting if they would overeat in that setting maybe not that interesting the other experiment that I don't think has been done is remember when they did the they took a variant which was high fat but high ish carb and so it wasn't there was enough carbon the diet that it wasn't producing ketosis but it was still a high fat diet I'd like to see that experiment repeated but with an X on Janice ketone because then you could start to identify the effect of the carbohydrate specifically and tease out the effect of the fat and the BHB right I think I remember one of the big differences between the the high fat low carb and the actual ketogenic diet was the the induction of PBR alpha yes which makes sense because that's involved in you know ketogenesis itself but to what degree that regulates you know any of the other important properties that were found including the the really the profound effects on the brain and you know so I I like to personally get my ketogenesis from from my periods of fasting more so than carbohydrate restriction well i do i do refined carbohydrate restriction but i also I think there's a lot of benefits and this is part of the reason why for so long I was skeptical of the ketogenic diet is because I think there's a lot of benefits in eating a variety of plants I think that there's a lot of various micronutrients that are much higher density in plants fully magnesium vitamin k1 but also there's a lot of fermentable fibers and and things that are really also really good for the gut microbiome which i think is very important for regulating immune function so that's kind of been my my hang-up but

[00:17:30] I think you know like people like Dom seem to be doing a modified ketogenic diet where they're you know definitely getting the greens trying to get the leafy greens so I mean I think that you know one way to kind of get around that plus I think there's also a way to do a ketogenic diet where you're eating a lot of salmon avocado nuts you know olive oil and it's not just like butter and keto bombs and all this like pork rinds and stuff where I'm just like where's the nutrient density and some of that you know so yeah it's funny I mean I guess it depends on how many calories you need but at the time that during that window when I was on a ketogenic diet I was also still very active certainly much more so than now and I really required a lot of calories I mean I couldn't maintain my weight below 4,500 calories a day and I still stucked a pretty strict absolutes on the protein and carbohydrates I really kept my carbs and

[00:18:23] I didn't look at net carbs I hope by the way for those listening and wondering what that noise is this is something Rhonda and I are very used to those are f-18s which how many overhead drive-bys are we gonna get today you've had to predict anymore yeah I would say probably between three or four okay yeah that's the sound of freedom people so just get used to me so I was getting probably 50 grams of carbohydrates total carb everything I should say probably about 80 grams of total carb but you'll see that what type of carbs it was really had to limit protein to about a hundred to 110 grams if I went over that

[00:18:59] I would get kicked out and so fat made up about 90% of my total calories and so there's only so many ways you can get that much fat and the most efficient way is actually salad with olive oil I mean I couldn't believe the amount of vegetables I had to consume to stay in ketosis you know obviously had to have two huge salads a day where I would make my own dressing which was a heavy olive oil-based dressing and I could probably only have one avocado a day which I would always have because I than anything overnight I was getting too much carbohydrate so it's like a lot of macadamia nuts a lot of olive oil olive oil-based everything and then the hardest part for me was clearly being stingy with the protein what was in there what was in the salads like okay so I go you know I'm a pretty boring guy so it's romaine tomatoes cucumbers celery had to kind of like limit the carrots a little bit I normally love carrots great tomatoes and everything on the kitchen yeah yeah again part of it is I can get away with more cuz I probably exercise more and I was doing this four people were sort of putting butter in their coffee and stuff like that so that was not I can send a lot of dairy though so it's the other thing tons of cheese tons of sour cream because he just needed those calories and I actually developed like a spreadsheet that was customized for my caloric needs but I had this formula of looking at every ingredient like could you find the food that you could eat without restriction that wouldn't destroy your ratios and so for me at my caloric levels like cream cheese and sour cream were sort of the perfect thing whereas even high-fat Greek yogurt had too much protein so I had to consume that in moderation that's the other interesting thing and I think I talked to Eric about this was you know how much of the effects you know on on health span or due to low protein intake and how much were due to you know the actual being in ketosis yeah I've talked about this with vaulter a few times we don't see eye to eye on this because for several reasons one I'm not entirely convinced of the igf paradigm anymore so that's one thing where you know the question I asked you that would be my answer so five years ago I would have said IGF is the devil growth hormone is the devil you want them to be as low as possible I'm not convinced of that today and I can't wait to explore that with you but the other thing is if you really want to produce the lowest level of insulin and igf-1 a ketogenic diet that is incredibly low in protein incredibly low in carbohydrate when I go back and look at my blood levels because I I check my blood about every six to eight weeks and I've been doing this for you know 10 years I mean my lowest IGF levels were during the three years I was in ketosis I mean they were very low they were I mean not ridiculously low but 25th percentile for age verses say 75th percentile today so that makes sense to me because if you think about you know some of the major dietary regulators of the igf-1 pathway are protein essential amino amino acids specifically and also insulin insulin through IGF bp3 or IP b12 so I mean I think that so for example you know if if someone's eating a low protein and low you're getting you may not be a vegan but even if you had you're limiting your protein you know even to some degree or you're certainly getting more than someone may be me that's not doing that really although I do kind of limit my protein but it's a misconception you see I think a lot of people assume ketogenic diets or high-protein diets I think some people do consider that yeah but if you're there may be certain people out there who can produce ketones with high protein but in my experience personally and more important clinically meaning I don't know over the course of my practice and my career in medicine I mean I've probably at least encountered 50 or 60 patients at a very detailed level on ketogenic diets almost without exception protein is the bigger thing that fouls people up and and so that's the thing I've always found a bit confusing in some of those discussions is and even Eric mentioned this on your podcast which is well you got to be careful if you're on a ketogenic I you don't have too much protein and I was like those don't go hand-in-hand you're not on a ketogenic diet if you're eating a lot of protein because you won't make the ketones that said I wouldn't be surprised if there are polymorphisms that allow people more or less and you've obviously talked a lot about the P part or alpha is it people are alpha our people are gamma where you see the differences in a person's ability to generate ketones the people are alpha is is predominantly found in the liver and it's involved in in fatty acid catabolism the production of ketone bodies so so that would be the major one now there's nothing empirically I've seen in literature that to look specifically at P P R alpha and a ketogenic diet or fasting but you know there's most of the literature out there looking at the effects of P P R alpha with people that are either head or homozygous are or have to do with the context of like high saturated fat low polyunsaturated fat guy because polyunsaturated fat activates the PPR you know family of transcription factors which are nuclear hormone receptor transcription factors but the PP r gamma is predominately found in like adipose tissue I mean they're found in other tissues but I see predominantly that's like the most they're highly expressed in that adipose tissue and it plays a role in basically taking up fatty acids into adipose tissue where is the alpha which is liver take plays a role in the transport catabolism so one would just sort of imagine I mean it would be nice to see that you know someone look at that you know people with these specific snips and how this Prometheus identify various snips of P power alpha yes but they don't really tell you anything they sort of pull abstracts from PubMed and just kind of like dump it there so you kind of can start with the research there I've been developing a genetic tool and I just were actually developing it a lot more of a former NIH geneticist who's a really phenomenal who's been working with me on to help me sort of develop those basically look at look at you know the literature and see what some of these snips are are doing and then in canino in conjunction with looking at biomarkers various blood biomarkers to kind of help people guide you know what sort of they should do what's a bypass around at a potential bypass for example so with the PPR alpha or gamma I think that the take home at least from the literature is essentially you want to have a higher ratio of poly and monounsaturated effective to saturated fat ratio in order to lower your type-2 diabetes risk you're saying for any for people with the wild-type or with people with certain snips with in

[00:25:19] PBR alpha yeah because and gamma as well because to some degree some some of the ones in people are gamma affect the uptake of fatty acids and adipose tissue and so in also muscle and so it kind of can affect you know you have a lot more free fatty acids around and that can you know have have an effect on insulin sensitivity and other things as well so we should talk about this offline because I have a subset of patients for which we have such rich data and if I'm positive all of them would be interested in knowing this and you know we've certainly get their permission but it would be interesting and taking their you know just their straight-up 23andme data okay so here's the pattern I've seen and I'm very curious as to what the overlap is so there's a clearly a subset of people I think my n is too small to quantify it but directionally it seems like I don't know ten or twenty percent of people when you put them on ketogenic diets in the standard way which usually ends up meaning you're getting at least forty percent of your calories from saturated fat typically 40 to 45 percent from mono and the remainder from Holley everything goes to hell in a handbasket and the obvious things that go to hell in a handbasket have been certainly written about on the blogosphere and

[00:26:32] Twittersphere which is usually their LDL particle numbers skyrockets despite the fact that their triglycerides go down so they seem to be getting more insulin sensitive but yet inflammation is going up and you see that both specifically cardiac specifically so things like oxidized LDL and LP PLA - but even non specifically C reactive protein fiber engine but the deeper level is the Y and what you see is they're making much more cholesterol markers of cholesterol biosynthesis like des Marshall all go way up and some of their phytosterols go up which is very counterintuitive phytosterols would generally go down on a ketogenic diet but they're going way up suggesting that they're absorbing much more cholesterol like biliary cholesterol so the first time I noticed this was 2012 and I think they wrote about this once on a blog but

[00:27:24] I don't remember maybe I'm thinking of another example and it was this relatively young patient who really loved being on a ketogenic diet but when we get his blood tests back I mean his LDL particle number was above 3500 animal per liter and I know there are a lot of guys out there who seemed to think that as long as you're on a ketogenic diet it doesn't men of this stuff matters I completely don't subscribe to that and my view is that's irresponsible so I said to them I said look I don't think the ketogenic diet is right for you and he said no no it's the best thing I've ever done like I feel better I look better I'm performing better we got to figure out a way to do this and I the only thing I could think of when I talked with Tom Dayspring about this and he said let's try an experiment and rip all the saturated fat out of his diet he was sort of like me he was eating a lot he meaning his a high caloric consumer so that gets really hard so we created a diet form that was only about 20 to 25 grams a day of saturated fat and he ended up getting about 65% of his fat calories from mono and saturated fat which was pretty gross

[00:28:24] I mean you're drinking olive oil at that point but he was interested in doing the experiment and sure enough after I don't know maybe 8 to 12 weeks same macronutrient distribution in terms of fat protein carbohydrate the only shift was the type of fat so we just substituted mono for saturated his LDL P was thirteen hundred animal per liter all of the inflammation was gone and all of the sterile biomarkers went back to normal

[00:28:52] I've since seen about six times and now I'm wondering if we took those patients and ran them through what you're doing yeah yeah the ones that have those snip and there's a variety of them that do that so there's the P P R alpha P by gamma there's a couple of FTO related snips also that the road should have saturated and basically in the literature these studies have all looked at the ratio of saturated to mono and polyunsaturated fat and for whatever reason people with those snips when they have a higher saturated fat poly your mono and or mono they have higher inflammation higher oxidized LDL higher a small dense LDL higher you just you know all these just tell you have a sense of the frequency based on the research you've done on this how prevalent that is kind of I would say you know I'd have to look back at the data probably less than 20% so it might be in the ballpark of what I'm seeing for this different phenotype might be yeah it might be so that would be really interesting to run him through through my tool and and like I said we're even expanding that a little bit I found I found a few more our patients sending you any of their data or are they doing it on their own and just they're doing it on their own some people have shared their data with me because they've emailed me and something interesting and I'm like oh wow that's super interesting do you mind sharing that with me and they have so if anybody is listening to this and they're saying hey you know I had an advanced lipid test before and after I went on a ketogenic diet and I looked like this situation you described can they reach out to you through your blog and send this data to you if they can actually just use the genetic tool and then sort of you know share with the other day they want to share with me the data you know I can't promise anything but but they can certainly get the Y themselves by just using genetic tool right now which which I have I have free reports for for for example the PPR genes but then I have a whole comprehensive report that's a $10 recommended so if someone doesn't want to pay $10 to do comprehensive they can just get the free report and get the Y potential Y them alright so I hope that anyone listening to this because I again if I'm seeing this at 10 to 20 percent of the time and you're seeing it and it'd be great to get a few hundred people who are that phenotype and find out if the phenotype match is the genotype right yeah it would absolutely be and like I said I have I have had people have that problem where they've tried occasion a guy and couldn't figure out and they did of one or even more than than one of the snips that regulate fatty acid metabolism so and then there's another phenotype that fortunately is more rare and I also wonder what's going on with P power alpha specifically which is people who do everything by the book and maybe I'm a sucker and maybe I'm gullible and maybe I believe patients too much but I don't think I've ever had a patient lie to me I really think like when they're not doing what they're supposed to be doing they tell you I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing so it's not uncommon in this rare subset of patients that is where they're doing everything by the book I mean they're working their tail off to keep their carbs here to keep their protein here to keep their fat here to keep it within this distribution and they cannot get even close to half a mil Imola of bhp in their blood and to me that's a really frustrating situation if it's frustrating for the patient because they're sort of like what the hell I'm doing everything right like I'm not making ketones and you know I think

[00:32:06] Steve Finney sort of put out this notion that the threshold was about 0.5 millimolar I don't have anything to argue that one way or the other so I generally can you know based on my own empirical experience personally I sort of felt like 1 millimolar was about the threshold but but again I think that's neither here nor there but when these people are doing what I'm describing and they're at best point to maybe 0.3 millimolar it just made me wonder there's something in their machinery that's not doing this now the question is is it a lipolysis problem is it an oxidation problem is it a conversion problem I mean that I don't know but it would also be interesting to understand where could the weak links be in their ketosis machinery right and there's probably you know there's a variety of snips and the in these genes and you know there there may be certain snips that haven't even really been tested or who knows it sounds it sounds like you know to me that there there's there's certainly something going on with with the process of ketogenesis ins and some of the patients and they're active they're activity levels or they're active yeah we're pretty I mean we've evolved a lot in our thinking on how those patients can be helped but it seems that the best way to get them over that hump is fasting coupled with exercise if they're capable but it's got to be relatively it has to be it's not gardening like it's got to be exercise exercise you know it's they they have to really deplete glycogen so that's the other thing I sort of wonder and some of these folks is what's happening with with gluconeogenesis because I I think until you start to dip down and glycogen a little bit it's really hard to do this and of course we can't do liver biopsies wait so fasting does get them into ketosis so again we're dealing with such a small end that I don't I want to be thoughtful about not generalizing too much so there's one patient in particular who is the poster child for couldn't do the ketosis thing straightaway but when we put him on every month a five-day FMD so he would do the five-day FMD but ketogenic not long goes FMD and then the 25 days of adlib was time restricted eating ketogenic then we've seen great results doing that in two people so that would suggest that something again it's not we're not doing this as an experiment at this point it's like clinical it's like just try to get the job done sort of thing but that would suggest it's something about the fasting end or the exercise end or the time restriction could get them over the hump but it's interesting because from an evolutionary perspective you should have been selected out really quickly if you couldn't make ketones efficiently well it sounds to me that maybe maybe there's a glycation you know you're not you're not getting depleting the glycogen - if that's you know so maybe it's not to do with the production of ketone bodies but it's actually just takes a long time to deplete that glycogen I do think there's a huge variation obviously physical activity plays a role in that as well I can fast I can do you know like when I do my time restricted eating ideally I like to do it within you know nine or ten hours eat all my food within nine or ten hours and then I you know I like to fast for like 15 hours I can do that and with my physical activity levels you know I will be closer to 1 millimolar it fast like we will get to 1 millimolar after 15 hours of fasting I will be closer to that when I'm really physically active like during the periods a couple of years ago and I was doing lots of like long like long-distance running and stuff I can get closer I mean I mean I'm going off of like a precision extra which probably no no precision extras it's I mean that's really good so I can get between like 0.7 millimolar to like 0.9 but are you consuming a ketogenic diet during your feeding with my diet typically I like I said I've never really intentionally tried to do a ketogenic diet but my diet is I pretty much eat a lot of the same things and typically it's salmon a salad or a sauteed vegetables with olive oil some pasture-raised butter from pasture raised animals and my fruits will be like blueberries I'll have avocado so

[00:36:00] I'll have it sometimes obvious movie with some blueberries avocado and kale and will you have two meals in that window or it depends if I have the or not typically I'll have breakfast and then an early dinner and then I'll have like a snack either nuts or the smoothie the kale with some blueberries and avocado so I think it you know I need a lot of nuts too you know I probably do what kind of nuts walnuts macadamia nuts pistachios cashews almonds I think probably I put cashews in the candy category oh really no no I just mean like can't stop eating this thing so yeah when I when I talk about nuts I'm like I eat nuts and sometimes cashews just might as well be eating M&Ms well yeah no look all kidding aside when

[00:36:46] I was on the ketogenic diet and I had to be very mindful of this stuff basically I could only consume almonds in macadamia everything else was just a little too high in carbohydrate the cashews just like my own personal demons okay I don't know what it is about cashews like I love watermelon like the summer like right now oh like my son loves we could eat a whole one oh yeah put a little salt on it like my father-in-law's from the south and taught me that so in the summer time I like to I like to eat some watermelon I like to eat peaches you know so well

[00:37:15] I'll definitely indulge in in more fruits because that's when they're around but you know so I do I think my diet tends to be I wouldn't be surprised if before you entered you're like so let's say you finish your feeding window just before you went to bed it wouldn't surprise me if you're already at 0.2 or 0.3 millimolar right probably yeah I never actually didn't measure there so check that yeah and that'll give me a sense because if you are believing is strict because I'm still nursing so I'm because it's just so hard to like timewise get everything I'm eating probably more like with the 11 or 12 hours okay okay well when you get back to the 15 I'd be curious because if you're actually able to go from zero or point 1 millimolar to 0.72 1 millimolar in a 15 hour fast that's impressed so so when I took the exogenous ketones and I've done this did you do the ester I did yesterday mmm I did their instructions which was heated with a heart high carbohydrate diet so I had a below bowl of some whole oats with some blueberries in it and then I took the VHB ester I literally went from like 0.1 millimolar ketone in one hour to 6 millimolar Wow 6 1 hour that's really high so that's impressive okay I'm trying to think I definitely don't get that high and that's just with one bottle with one bottle and then how long did it last do you recall let's it depends on whether or not I did exercise like intense exercise and so if I did the intense exercise like an hour later I was down to like 2 or 3 or something and have you ever taken it and just done work for example where basically the brain is doing more of the exercise than yeah that's what most way I do it now but I don't I'm not measuring because I'm usually like doing a podcast or going traveling and doing you know something but that's that's typical what I use it for is that so I'm not really doing that using it for exercise yeah they've really come a long way and taste really they still taste awful yeah you know it's funny I remember Kevin Rose who's a good mutual friend of ours when he tried them first he texted me and he's like dude these things aren't that bad like you made it sound like these things were horrible and I was like when I had it it

[00:39:24] I thought I was drinking kerosene or jet fuel I thought I was gonna die go blind first then die he goes not another stuffs good he goes actually I wouldn't call it a sippin ketone but it's actually pretty I was thought the guys at human and the T Delta s folks I think they've done a good job kind of making them less ridiculous they must really have tasted bad when you tried it cuz I personally think it's closer to the kerosene side than though it was so bad rather than there was like a good three month period where my favorite thing to do like more than anything in the world was if anyone came over to my house for dinner they had to try one finger dip worth Wow of stuff and of course the first time I drank it I just took 50 ml and chugged it neat without mixing it or anything like that and yeah

[00:40:08] I feel day just getting people to try this stuff the salts are obviously much more palatable yeah I've studied but I didn't really I wasn't I certainly didn't feel like I had the same effects as the the ester and also if I took a really high dose of it I felt like I had some GI distress absolutely I and I have also noticed that for some people that is for me that's the case so I cannot take the

[00:40:33] BHB ester on an empty stomach the only way I can tolerate that at high doses is either to put it with powdered MCT or actually just take it with a meal which in many ways defeats the purpose because I kind of like it as a way to avoid meals did it lower your blood glucose because yes like it like so significantly it was like like astounding yeah yeah no it's pretty impressive yeah yeah well and I and I know that Jeff woo the CEO at human is very interested in that and I republish to post I wrote five years ago in exhaustion his ketones like a couple weeks ago and a lot of scientists have reached out and said hey we're really interested in studying this like what can you tell us about this in anything so I think people are starting to realize that's an interesting way to lower glucose really significantly i person i dropped 30 points hydrate after a high carbohydrate like I said I had oatmeal with some blueberries there's nuts of course my my blood sugar because at the time too I mean I've just been nursing at night and so I'm waking up multiple times it has tear is terrible in your for your blood glucose levels and such but so they were a little higher than usual but yeah I drop me 30 points well yeah that's more than we typically see is it yeah on the topic of blood glucose have you ever experimented with akribos no I've experimented with it in with cells and culture but not like personally the stuffs pretty interesting it works quite well yeah

[00:41:59] I'll certainly if I'm going to indulge in some high carb action I'm gonna take a hundred milligrams of akribos beforehand and just flatline my glucose you know in many ways I find it actually more potent than metformin at glueck reduction I mean I think metformin has many other effects that we'll probably get into as well so let's go back to the

[00:42:17] IGF thing because this is sort of the thing that here's the thing I'll just jump right to my punchline in my question with this there are two issues I now have with things I used to take to be the God's honest truth actually three things the first is I found Cynthia Kenyans work on the daf-16 mutants in C elegans to be the most convincing evidence of the role of IGF or attenuating IGF in longevity and I now question that not question the work but question the inference that that can be applied to humans given the fact that only their germ cells divide and therefore cancer in that organism looks nothing like cancer in us cancer in that organism is only a cell getting larger there is no proliferation we have to sort of I mean it's obvious it's the risk of stating the obvious which is we're not worms but that's a huge difference in biology so that's that's the first thing let me let me let you comment on that yes because I've done those experiments so that probably what straight out of college and I went to work at the Salk Institute with Andrew

[00:43:25] Dylan who trained with Cynthia Cynthia Kenyon I was a chemistry major in college and I decided I kind of wanted to try some real biology because I only had a little bit of biology in college and so I went to work at the Salkin and really was like those first experiments I did with worms where you know we would knock down the the insulin igf-1 signaling pathway also known as the daf-2 and their worms would live like literally a hundred percent longer or like they don't go from two weeks to four weeks right yeah I mean it was like and not only that like the worms were so youthful like you would look at these worms you know cuz it's all I would do day after day under the microscope is just picking and poking and looking at the worms and how they move and you know as they get older they start to become less mobile and I mean it's just fair it's the most convincing day it is very convincing and now it's me in my mind was kind of like when I was like oh like we have a gene that sort of homologous to this and this is happening in those worms like I want to understand that like and here's the thing about that data and this is what I think if you get rid of another gene that's homologous to fall so - Oh deaf sixteen is right that's too far completely obliterates the lifespan extension meaning it's the Fox o3 that seems to be really important for we have how many we have for foxes yeah you mean different fox genes okay yeah I don't know exactly how many but the Fox oh we have three we have one two and four was it one two and there was our one two four or five but but their analog is sixteen I remember that right there daf-16 is basically our Fox Oh Fox oh yeah so okay well anyways yeah I'm not sure I'm getting confused with you know this but what is interesting is that the lifespan extension was completely like ameliorated did their health spend curbs cuz the experiment you're describing and no one can see what I'm doing but you know what I'm talking about like the the natural was a two-week lifespan where for the first week their youthful and then they have a declining health span curve so at the time of their death they're totally decrepit in the experiment you were describing if I'm thinking of the same one you doubled the lifespan and their longevity curve became a square function it just went out kind of yeah exactly yeah that's exactly what happened but you get rid of the daf-16 and they're like wild type oh they're like wild type yes I think so but and that largely has to do with you know so that the igf-1 insulin-like linked pathway both inhibit

[00:45:44] Fox o3 so if you get rid of that inhibition constitutively if Fox or 3 is constantly active in those worms I mean it's just like super in there making superoxide dismutase they're making more stem cells they're making just everything's active you know more etaf EG more stret like all these stress resistance pathways I mean Fox o3 is a transcription factor it regulates whole host of genes many of which have to do with DNA repair at ah Fuji stem cell function production of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory pathway so it's a lot of really good stuff you want active all the time so there's that component to the longevity pathway and actually if you look at the animal data from rodents where they're calorie restricted if you get rid of the Fox o3 the median lifespan extension is gone so the lifespan extension depends on Fox or 3d the cancer stuff was still like it didn't matter so the cancer reduction didn't depend on Fox or 3 only the lifespan extension so I think there may be a nun coupling between humans in igf-1 one of the major problems with igf-1 is actually cancer and if you if you look at you know animal studies if you look at humans to human studies like humans that have polymorphisms that make them have more igf-1 they have much higher cancer incidence vice versa so if you look at people that have polymorphisms is that is that the case I mean we look at the opposites right we look at the ones that have low GH and by proxy low IGF and have less cancer so you're talking about learn syndrome yes oléron syndrome yes yes they do but I think there's also another one in IGF there's Hetson igf-1 receptor so this is you're not talking about acromegaly or people that are making too much th they also are more susceptible to to cancel cancer as well yes I am talking about them as well actually the people with acromegaly are more susceptible to cancer maybe I am that's what I was referring to with they have higher circulating levels of igf-1 so you're saying you can't uncouple the growth hormone from yeah that's that's been one of the things I've struggled with is it's hard to uncouple the gh the effect of GH on the liver yes exactly that has been uncouple like if you if you do any sort of tumor transplant animals and then make them have high gf1 through a variety of modalities the cancer will grow rapidly so how do we explain the human epidemiology which and

[00:47:57] I'm like there are a few people that are more critical of Epidemiology than me I'm not a particular fan of it but I find it to be quite interesting in the negative meaning the contrapositive x' with an epidemiology can be quite interesting so this is the next thing that kept me going wait a minute and that was there's a u-shaped mortality curve that is skewed to the right for

[00:48:19] IGF and all cause mortality cancer mortality cardiovascular mortality and neurodegenerative mortality but when you uncouple them by disease you see a very interesting pattern so all cause mortality as IGF goes up it actually starts to go down it Nader's at the 70th percentile and then it starts to rise but it doesn't get as high as it started

[00:48:44] I know for people listening this is confusing so we'll include the figures of all these from the papers but the point is it's not that as IGF goes up eyetality goes up it's the opposite for 70% of the ledger only at the very end in other words only high levels of IGF if' seem problematic and as I know you've talked about I've heard you talk about this on your podcast you have to then disaggregate that by age the older you get the better IGF seems to be presumably because of the preservation of lean tissue it turns out that most of the uptick in the mortality above the 70th percentile is driven by cancer but actually cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disease seem to get they flatlined by the end so meaning there was no benefit to being at the hundredth percentile or the 99th percentile versus the 80th versus the 70th but you weren't getting penalized for it which suggested to me that low

[00:49:39] IGF might not be the ticket maybe it's some combination of cycling high and low IGF but living at around the median to slightly above that the 60th 70th percentile and again that's probably more a function of my misunderstanding of the literature five years ago but I really came away thinking IGF we've got to keep that as low as possible it's funny you and I kind of have had we've evolved in the very similar because I now also think that you know so igf-1 does play a very important role obviously in development but also in the repair of muscle in the growth of muscle preserving muscle mass also it gets transport across the blood-brain barrier plays an important role in neurogenesis and allowing existing neurons to survive which kind of brings me back to that gray matter thing with the lemurs but you know so and the thing that was interesting to me was the effect of exercise on igf-1 and the fact that for one it's been shown that the the boost in neurogenesis after exercise in the brain via brain revenue is requires igf-1 animal studies have shown that mostly in rodents have shown that that exercise causes igf-1 across the blood-brain barrier getting to the brain but in human studies I've also seen some showing that it does lower serum levels

[00:50:52] I think presumably it's also going into the muscle and the brain so I think that you know people that are exercising they're putting that igf-1 to the places where it's supposed to go muscle tissue brain tissue as well but in addition to that and this is kind of what's recent work from dr. falter Longo is that we know that this he does he's prolonged fast and I think the prolonged fasting is extremely interesting for a couple of main reasons and one is I think that it has tremendous potential for the treatment of autoimmune disease and also cancer based on on you know his work and what he has shown now in animal studies and some pilot clinical studies is that doing a prolonged fast and or in some cases the fasting mimicking diet causes this massive shrinking of organs where now he doesn't know how much of it's due to cell size decreasing versus apoptosis he does know a puppet apoptosis is occurring and he has showed that in multiple publications like there's a massive induction of apoptosis after a prolonged fest and you know which makes sense because it's a very strong stress and then after during the refeeding phase their organs basically come back they come back they grow regrow and presumably selectively repopulate yes so he's shown that these stem cells get activated so that the basically they have to be activated by the low igf-1 but then to proliferate and differentiate into whatever tissue type we're talking about let's say we're talking about the immune system then igf-1 is required for that proliferation and differentiation and repopulation of the tissue which means you can't just keep the igf-1

[00:52:31] Wow the refeeding is just as important as the deprivation and the igf-1 is key in that and so you know what he's shown now is that you can take for example in the multiple sclerosis animal model you can actually cause stem cells to be activated through the prolonged fast and then during the refeeding phase the stem cells make non dysfunctional so they're making normal non auto immune cells he's done like a pilot clinical study with multiple sclerosis people with multiple sclerosis and it's helped with symptoms but he's also done these cancer studies and this is kind of where there's been some some clinical studies that he's been involved with like a 48-hour water fast that that's been done in patients undergoing standard of care treatment and he's shown that it was tolerable not only that there seemed to be less my low toxicity less neutropenia so basically there and it sensitized cancer cells to death so not only where the cancer cells more but less of the normal cells were dying and then he's gone ahead and shown this in animal models also with the fasting mimicking diet and it's like if you look at the data particularly in the animal model because they can you know do all the tissue harvesting and stuff I mean it's like it's so phenomenal that I would not be surprised that in the next ten years it will be required part of standard of care because it seems to be so incredibly robust at selectively killing cancer cells which you know makes sense I mean oncogenes they screw up all sorts of things one of them is the the stress response and you know cancer cells can't respond just read their prime to die I mean it's I spent a long time meena studying cancer cell metabolism apoptosis with Doug green and

[00:54:00] Joseph opperman at st. Jude Children's Research Hospital and and that's kind of one of the primary ways that a lot of these chemo therapeutic drugs if they can get to the tumor site work is that because it's a stress cancer cells can't handle it you know they die so I kind of went off on a tangent here so to get back to the igf-1 let me say one thing going back to what you just said that is also interesting but in the same thing so I agree that I think that it would really be great if patients had a better insight into nutrition going into chemotherapy and the few times I go and give talks at hospitals or go and talk it like a cancer meeting I'm amazed at how resistant the oncologists are on average obviously there were exceptions but on average to interfering with nutrition because in many ways their primary concern tragically is preserving weight and so I always get a little verklempt when I walk through an oncology ward and I see patients drinking in Shore I couldn't think of a worse thing you'd want to consume when you have cancer and yet the goal is hey we got to fatten these people up so I agree with you and I really hope that this research is accelerated because I do think patients would benefit greatly from this and the other application that

[00:55:09] I saw this several years ago this is quite old now but it blew my mind I'm not sure familiar with Jay Mitchell's work up at Harvard he did an experiment where he took three yeah three groups of mice so the first group were constitutively calorically restricted for their entire life these were probably like one and a half year old mice so they're about halfway through their life starting starting yeah so these these animals were constantly at 70% caloric intake the next group was your control group and then your third group was ad libitum diet until two days before an operation and at which point they were calorie restricted to a near fast and I'd have to go back and look I can't member if it was 24 or 48 hours of fasting it might've been a 24-hour fast 48 would be pretty extreme for mice so in summary you've got control there's straight-up eating you've got 70% or 30%

[00:56:00] CR forever and then you've got control and then fasted for a day all the mice were then operated on where their femoral arteries were like ated held for a period of time and then they were Reaper fused for people not familiar with what that means so that means you you open the animal up you put clamps on the femoral arteries which would basically stop all perfusion of blood to the lower part of the body and then after some period of time just before you kill the animal you release that and then you Reaper use the blood basically the oxygen Reaper fuses the organism that's considered a reperfusion injury which is about one of the most stressful things you can do to an organism so that you can really rapidly kill someone by doing that and that's something that in surgery happens quite a bit for example you end up having to clamp something off to repair something downstream of that okay so what happened was all of the control animals died without exception of the other two groups the groups that were either calorie-restricted for life or transiently starved before the surgery a significant subset did not die and I can't remember the number and again I know we're gonna probably link to this study so people are gonna listen to this and go that idiot got all those details wrong but this is the gist of it a non-trivial subset of them lived and what's interesting is you could get the same benefit by an acute period of caloric restriction in proximity to an insult that you could get by a lifelong of caloric restriction and the third piece would that was interesting was the group that were just starved transiently actually had a faster recovery which again they were fitter organisms I remember the first time I came across that thinking there's got to be something to cycling and people used to always ask me like why are you on a ketogenic diet every minute of every day would there be any benefit in cycling now I still don't know the answer to that question but I'm more curious about it now based on what you just described from vaulters work plus this type of stuff plus just the general ethos of the way we evolved we've fasted we fed we fasted we fed we fasted a long time we gorged like it just seems we've evolved for cycling right yeah I agree it's really that with falters work I just I'm so excited about about the prolonged fasting and the the potential benefits of it I think that actually something that you and I discuss several years ago and I had you

[00:58:18] I interviewed you on my podcast that you brought up that I thought was really interesting had to do with like the failed clinical trials with binding igf-1 and cancer and vulture brought up something interesting in a conversation I had with him and that is possibly that we now know IG f1 having low and high G f1 is important so if you're constantly having low igf-1 and the igf-1 is important for the immune system or population you can imagine in the context of cancer when you're giving other treatments along with it that would be important because your immune system is key in in warding off cancer and I thought that was a really interesting point of course we don't have evidence of that but I think you know it's something that would be interesting to investigate and it makes sense yeah I definitely am on the same page with you if I don't I'm not and like I started out with saying I don't think that chronic caloric restriction and low igf-1 is the essential like way for improving health span I do think that igf-1 you want it to go to your muscle you want to go to your brain so I think people should definitely be active especially if they're eating a high-protein and or even high carbohydrate or something that's gonna produce a lot of insulin you know they shouldn't be eating refined carbs but people do they're eating them they should definitely be exercising that's another change in my belief system I think today versus I don't know five or six years ago I think five or six years ago I didn't think exercise was that important to longevity which actually sounds ridiculous for anyone who knows me because I was probably exercising four hours a day but not because I believed it would make me live longer it was just sort of soothing my addictions but I think today I feel I am much more convinced by a lot of the data you've described certainly the central stuff when we published this paper earlier this year with Richard Isaac's and that you and I were talking about it before we started recording we wanted to get a sense of like if you took a completely unbiased approached and look at the literature what was the single most compelling thing you could do to generate or preserve brain health and we came away thinking that it was actually exercise and I remember when the analysts were kind of going through this and showing me all the data I was like come on guys there's no way exercise could be the most important thing for brain health and again I'm saying this is a guy who loves exercise more than anybody but it just struck me as there's no way and again I think part of it was

[01:00:37] I was just thinking about it through the vascular lens and obviously you know I think better than I do that when you start to think about brain health you have to think about it through a vascular lens and metabolic lens growth factor lens I mean there were overlapping but distinct pathways that are going to influence brain health and so I was kind of humbled by that and now

[01:00:57] I guess in many ways I'm a little more adamant about it with my patients not that I wasn't you know adamant before but this is like boy if you're if you're not active every day like we got to change that I actually the the main reason I exercise is from my brain it's certainly just not only for you know preventing neurogenic disease and atrophy and all that but just because it affects my executive function it affects my anxiety levels it affects my ability to make decisions I absolutely if I have something that's bothering me you're giving me anxiety or have to make a really important decision going for a long run really helps me and there's been studies showing that it helps with executive function how long-term planning like aerobic exercise specifically you know and then high intensity interval training all that stuff they all they all do different things that's the thing we couldn't we couldn't tease this out of the literature which again probably is just a limitation of shitty human clinical trials but that's the second order question right which is if you're gonna take the Tim Ferriss approach which is what's the minimum effective dose because there are some people like maybe

[01:02:00] URI who I think just generally like exercise and also get these other benefits these endorphin benefits but there are some people who are like look what do I need to do like I'm gonna treat exercise like medicine and I think in that setting I'm still not clear so if you were that person would I say Rhonda as long as you are lifting weights one hour three times a week like if you can only give me three hours would that be how I'd want you to spend it or would I rather you be doing anaerobic aerobic type thing like I mean that's to me those are where these biomarkers start to become very important because we're not going to generate hard outcome studies with that level of control once you you know try to control that many variables and be that strict about it you're gonna very much lose a heart outcome prospectively but if we knew what to measure right and that's you know would we be measuring an integral of IGF for example so how much it rises how much it falls and then what that looks like over time but I guess that's the funny thing right like the more we learn the less we know yeah absolutely I think that we definitely don't know the answer to that question but I think there's a lot of data out there showing for example strength training you know there's benefits on the brain that's been shown published this benefits on preventing muscle atrophy there's benefits on preventing cancer incident like that's all been shown for strength training for aerobic and you know this high-intensity interval training is also also seems to be making its way as well like like there was a study that I that I found vo2 max this is you know the ability of your body to transport oxygen during exercise which also is an indicator of when you're not exercising and obviously transporting oxygen brain for example is extremely important vo2 max declines with age like 1 percent per year

[01:03:41] I forgot starting at what age but you know so 10 percent per decade so that's almost parallels the muscle master column does it does parallel exactly and there was a study showing that 24 sessions of high-intensity interval training where it was like a 45-minute sessions five minute warm-up 5-minute cooldown and then you know in between the max intervals which were like pretty long like a minute there was you know the 70% of max water anyway so 24 of those increased vo2 max by 12% so you're literally taking an entire decade of decline and like reversing it with the 24 yeah that's that's actually a good point when I was more active as it sort of competitive you know in cycling you we would get our vo2 max tested about twice a year Ryan Flaherty who we were talking about before the she's one of my close friends and you've got to know him as well I learned from

[01:04:28] Ryan that actually vo2 max is not the most important indicator as a runner or cyclist it's V vo2 Max or P vo2 max that matters in other words for a runner V vo2 Max is much more predictive of performance which is the velocity you carry at vo2 Max and for a cyclist it's P vo2 max which is the power output at vo2 max that said every time you go to test you wanted to test well so you know over time I learned how to game the system you know I want to make sure my vo2 max is in the 70s which again to put that in perspective like that's not at the level of a professional athlete or something like the guys that are winning the Tour de France are in the high 80s or low 90s in terms of milligrams per ml per kilogram but nevertheless just altering my training for three weeks before a vo2 max test and dropping my weight so if I shed two kilograms and did those types of intervals I actually had it down to a science where there was a workout I would do you know in Carmel

[01:05:24] Valley you've got the 56 that goes out and it's got a bike path next to it there's a section of that bike path that is 1.6 miles long and it goes up at about 4% and just doing repeat intervals of that which takes about four minutes all out to go one direction and then about six minutes to cruise back four of those that was it twice a week for like three weeks and your vo2 max exploded now of course the question is is that like you know cramming for the test getting the result but not necessarily like you have to keep doing that to get the decade-long benefit I don't know the answer but I agree that like if you can maintain muscle mass and you can maintain peak aerobic performance it's not it doesn't even matter at that point if you're living longer you're clearly living better right like if you if you don't budge anything on maximum lifespan you've dramatically improved median lifespan right and that's a you know I think for most people that's what matters it is yeah I'm for me it is I mean I what's the what's the maximum lifespan that like a humans live 120 124 or something 124 1.10 124 something like that yeah living beyond that I mean that's I think the goal is really to for me I think that's a lot more achievable is increasing my my median health span of my my health span you know so so basically preventing staving off cardiovascular disease cancer also much disease those sorts of things so that I'm so that I'm living healthier and also you know a little bit longer but obviously not one hundred and twenty five or six yeah I don't really subscribe to the theory that we're gonna meet some take off point where you know there's immortality I'm really not convinced that that's that that's sort of biologically possible and I don't suspect they'll be alive at a time when it would ever come to fruition I don't remember the journal it was a paper that came out of Japan and the study looked at a variety of people of different ages so elderly population centenarians which are 100 semi super centenarians richer between a hundred and hundred and five and then super centenarians which are 105 plus and looked at a variety of biomarkers for health and aging so telomere senescence kidney function glycated hemoglobin lipid the whole lipid panel triglycerides kidney function him out of Isis like all that stuff was looked at inflammatory biomarkers and what was found is that aside from age what was predictive of being able to basically stay alive was low inflammation like more than hematopoiesis more than glycated hemoglobin blood glucose levels lipid all that stuff it was basically the ability suppress inflammation like that was predictive of cognitive function and also basically staying alive do you remember what they looked at were they looking at c-reactive protein and things like that general markers no look at her Lukens and stuff TNF they looked at a whole panel of and also some immune cells that are indicative of inflammation so there was a whole panel of biomarkers that were looked at for inflammation HPV tighter or something was also looked at so the the interesting thing about that study was that the inflammation was so key for each age group right like even more than all this other stuff like that

[01:08:43] I've thought about like senescence and telomeres and low blood glucose levels and all that stuff and so I really and and if you look at some of the rodent literature for example I remember the study where NF kappa-b which is classically thought about as an inflammatory mediators which it is it also has an anti inflammatory component to it and if you get rid of the anti inflammatory component rodents will have this sort of low level of chronic inflammation because every time it's activated there's not that infantile inflammatory part that's kind of keep it in a check and so there's kind of like this like lower chronic inflammation that's happening and those animals live like 30 percent less so that so their lifespan is cut short by about 30 percent so that's kind of interesting right that just just getting rid of that little anti inflammatory component of this one major regulator of immune system hasn't a profound effect on lifespan and then of course if you look at snips and stuff of course so you can always find you know well scenarios have a higher percentage of 10 and anti-inflammatory anyways you know so the inflammation it's an interesting finding that keep suppressing inflammation seems to be important for at least you know according to that study for making it to every part of you know I don't know what you would call it every basically progressing to the maximum level that maximum lifespan level that humans can possibly live well there was a clinical trial published either earlier this year or last year that looked at an il-1 antagonist and so this was a study that took people and made no change in their lipid metabolism lipid biomarker you know this was they they didn't do anything to the patients as far as differentiating the groups by traditional biomarkers of cardiovascular disease but one group was given a placebo one group was given an il-1 antagonist and the question was could that impact cardiovascular mortality and we've long talked about how cardiovascular disease is sort of this trifecta of lipoproteins inflammation and endothelial dysfunction but this was in many ways the most elegant first test of that in humans using heart outcome so major adverse cardiac event stroke MI death the hypothesis was found to be correct so the patients getting the il-1 antagonist despite having no difference in lipids or any other biomarker had an improved outcome with respect to cardiovascular health about a month ago another trial that using low dose of methotrexate which is an immune suppressant was halted early and the results will not be announced until this fall but if you read kind of the fine print it does not appear it was halted for a bad reason meaning it might have been halted actually for basically early efficacy which presumably would have been in the group getting the methotrexate so again we won't know that until the meeting in October I think when this will be presented but if that turns out to be the case that's pretty interesting because now you've taken something that we practically have great examples of like the one you've given and now potentially there's ways to think about using it so taking a step back from all of this stuff like you know of course I think about it at the level of like I'm just a mechanic right it's like how can you manipulate these things in people like cycling you know using nutrition and fasting to cycle IGF maybe even using an exaggerated growth hormone for all we know maybe you know

[01:11:59] I've always been quite skeptical of growth hormones use in in the field of longevity but maybe periods of oscillating rapamycin and growth hormone and fasting where you're cycling high periods of anabolic high periods of catabolic phase maybe there's something to it and then cycling agents like methotrexate and all these things so I don't know that's my hope is like in ten years we've got a complete personalised toolkit for how everybody could you know figure out exactly what drugs or hormones or nutrients to take and cycle and how to do it and then of course the key is you have to be able to measure stuff you know the the with the cardiovascular rated mortality the desana is something that is interesting to me for that for that reason because of the profound effects that it has specifically on lowering cardiovascular related mortality and of course just some clinical trials showing that you know there's a variety of other biomarkers and magnet potential mechanisms by that which that's happening but if you look at some of the data and by dr. yar allow cannon out of

[01:12:59] Finland if you look at some of the the observational studies you know where there's like a couple thousand men that we're doing it saunas so ubiquitous in Finland but if you look at for example men that are using it two to three times a week versus four to seven times a week versus once a week and you look at for example cardiovascular mortality two to three times a week it's lowered by like 20 % but when you jump to 47 times a week it all cause mortality goes to 40 all clothes mentality is also lowered dementia and Alzheimer's disease again like like 20% lowered if you're doing 2 to 3 I'm so glad you brought this up because I almost forgot and I wanted to talk about this this is one of those things where I think three years ago I was completely dismissive of this stuff which is to say I still love going into asana because the one thing that I felt sana really mattered for was sleep and not for the growth hormone level but because I think there's pretty good data that a great way to sleep is to create a high gradient of temperature so the faster the more negative the derivative of temperature DT by DT when you sleep the faster you'll go to sleep in the longer you'll stay asleep so a sauna before bed if you could jump in the sauna then take a cold shower then jump into a cold bed you're gonna sleep like a baby I've done it it's absolutely just remarkable yeah so I always accepted that but I looked at all of that epidemiologic stuff and I was like the healthy user bias here is through the roof like I came up with a hundred reasons why I just couldn't believe it including saunas are painful so if you are fit enough to sit in a sauna seven days a week versus the guy who could only sit in it one day a week like how do I know that that's not driving it now since that time I've become a lot more interested because now the mechanisms are starting to become more well understood and so I'd love to have you talk a little bit more about this because I know you've talked about this a lot on you on your podcast but in many ways your pursuit of this has become one of the more convincing arguments in in my thinking on the actual health benefits of this independent of the healthy healthy user benefits of this you know the healthy user benefits it's of course and with with the uri's work he's tried to correct for all that physical activity then he's done everything like looking at lipid blood cholesterol numbers LDL number like just like really you know try to try his best to kind of correct for that healthy user bias and of course there's a dose dependence which always makes it more convincing but he's then since published some some clinical trials where he's looked at for example the arterial comply and of course blood pressures that's one of the main things that's effective is blood pressure but also just like the ability of the arteries to like expand and contract in response to pressure like that's improved which is really important so I think that you know obviously the sauna the heat itself does does affect you know blood flow plasma volume all that stuff is changed so so I think that the cardiovascular aspects and Yardies trying to really kind of tease apart more mechanisms because he's a he's an MD ph.d he's a cardiologist by training but he's also got a PhD so he's he's trying you know really hard to kind of understand exactly what's going on but I do think that it really seems convincing it's really convincing with the cardiovascular related mortality specifically it's very robust personally it's kind of interesting to think about how much of you know exercise also elevates your core body temperature I mean there's this overlap there you know and when I sit in a sauna my heart rate starts to elevate like I'm doing cardiovascular and that's that's what happens like I'm doing cardiovascular exercises start to sweat

[01:16:31] I mean a lot of the same adaptations that happen with exercise are happening when you're you're sitting in a hot sauna and in even a hot bath like more recently another study came out trying hot bath effect it had a positive effect on a variety of cardiovascular related markers as well which again if but you have to sit in it long enough you know to experience some of those effects or the elevation of the heart rate and all that stuff but there's also really profound effect on the immune system like part of the benefit of exercise is that it is an acute oxidative stress burst an acute inflammatory burst you know there's then a response to that and the net response is a positive anti-inflammatory and antioxidant response but the inflammatory and oxidant response is required to get that and something similar is happening with with the sauna as well recently there was a study looking by dr. Charles Rosen he had made this like fancy contraption where he elevated core body temperature and he had a sham control so actually people the Sham control also made people a little bit hot and they thought they were actually getting the treatment but it had a very strong antidepressant how do they do that he explains it on my podcast so you can go to the transcript you can just that strikes me as one of the few things you can't placebo he they did some crafty thing which I not going to try to explain but I will absolutely botch it they did it and and they had a sham control and in fact about he said about seventy percent of the people that had the sham control thought they had the actual treatment so it were like there was definitely a they were trying to control for the placebo effect what's interesting is I even the reason I got into the sauna was the effects that I felt on my mood when I was in graduate school like I lived across the street from YMCA and so I started using this on and it was like very black-and-white like I was like wow this is amazing like

[01:18:19] I can handle all this was a wet sauna dry sauce this was this is a dry sauna do we have a sense of dry sauna versus IR versus all the different yeah so I mean the infrared saunas are like they only get to like about 140 degrees Fahrenheit I mean it's not very hot if you look at Yowies work like their saunas that they're using in Finland they do they have a lot of what they call low Lu or something which is like they throw the water on makes the humid which makes it really hot I've been to

[01:18:46] Finland and try them try the their saunas before but basically the temperature gets to around 170 between 175 and 79 degrees Fahrenheit and most of the men in these studies are doing about 20 minutes to get the maximum benefits eleven minutes had some benefits sitting in 11 minutes but there was a stronger effect they say it took 20 minutes so if you're in a infrared sauna that only gets to 140 degrees

[01:19:07] Fahrenheit you probably would have to stay on a much longer to get the same benefit I see so the IR doesn't doesn't get deeper penetration thereby alleviating the need to stay in at a higher temperature it doesn't I mean sometimes people talk about there's a lot of marketing involved strip that out though if you strip that out the the infrared saunas do affect the sweating mechanisms like something to do with the penetration there you do sweat which is great because you actually do excrete things like BPA and phthalates and mercury and heavy metals and things like that from sweat so that is that's what a lot of those mark the straight-up dry sauna to 170 degrees spend three or four nights a week in that my favorite yeah that's personally I I would much prefer sitting in a regular dry sauna or even a sauna that you can throw one control just not infrared sauna yeah so that so that would be you know the obviously they're the the fire hazard risk is more when you're having a sauna like that versus just an infrared and the infra red ones are I think cheaper as well so it's certainly more convenient to have an infrared sauna but personally I prefer for the other like the barrel saunas are really nice there's a also an effect on the immune system I was mentioning Charles race on he met he measured il-6 which is also it's part of the Janus cytokine because it does like it's it's got like multiple pleiotropic effects and it's it's acutely released upon exercise as well and it has it's very important for a you know an anti inflammatory response releasing Myo kinds and all these things and muscles so it has it's important for insulin sensitivity a lot of the insulin sensitivity effects exercise has so so the sauna does the same thing that the exercise does where there's just a rapid io6 release at least according to Charles

[01:20:50] Mason's data and he said that actually correlates with things you know I've never looked at I wear a continuous glucose monitor a lot but I've never really paid much attention to it in the sauna and I don't have a sauna but I'm gonna be this weekend at a friend's place who has a barrel sauna and so I'll make sure that I document what my glucose levels doing because you would think transiently would go up right right but I know that at least there isn't one animal study where the heat stress quote-unquote animal sauna it actually increases glucose transporters and a type-2 diabetic model that actually improved insulin sensitivity and lowered blood glucose because the glucose was now being taken up into muscle butter so I wonder you know how much of the again it's like you're you're affecting the aisle six is really important for that and I all six is released upon heat stress without without the exercise so uncoupling you know how much of the benefits from exercise there's certainly some overlap and I think that there's also there are separate benefits that exercise has as well independent of the heat stress component of it but I certainly think there is a lot of overlap between those two things and so the sauna becomes very interesting and there's the whole heat shock protein part where you know the heat stress is one of the major ways to increase heat shock proteins which do you play an important role in near general preventing neurodegenerative diseases and I do think it's also really hard to the effects on the the vascular system which is important right as well because it's having such a profound effect on the back of their system the heat stress it's hard to uncouple well how much of the staving off of dementia and alzheimerís has to do with that versus heat shock proteins you know this is to me the biggest challenge with

[01:22:25] Alzheimer's disease just is you know we're talking about it in a pretty nuanced way but I think unfortunately clinically it's still considered one disease but you know to the best of my understanding it's really several diseases that all have a very similar common final pathway you know for example like going back some of the ketone data you know why why does ketone enhance memory and some in some models certainly even going back Oh God ten years you see a lot of anecdote of people in early stage dementia who when given even MCT oil would see transient improvements in cognition now Richard

[01:22:59] Veatch did some of the most elegant work on this Richard Veatch by the way is the guy who along with Kieran Clark created the ketone ester that T Delta s licenses to human and you know they showed I think quite convincingly in this animal model that the bhp was basically bypassing pyruvate dehydrogenase and so all of a sudden you know you think about the energy deficit that a neuron would experience if you have insulin resistance at PD H so if you know glucose is going to pyruvate and pyruvate can't get in because PD H is resistant giving BHB would just bypass it you go straight into the krebs cycle you make all the ATP you want but that might only be a subset of people that are you know suffering right there's also going to be the microvascular variant and then there's going to be the sort of more toxin variants so the nice thing about sauna - just thinking about it is if I can't becoming more convinced of this it's actually like a really pleasant thing that you can do to potentially live longer and certainly live better because many of the things we talked about I mean let's call a spade a spade fastings not fun I wish I could tell you that you know not eating is fun but like I just love eating so anytime I'm not eating I'm sort of like there's a discipline that's required to do it but I don't know sitting in the sauna for 20 minutes before you go to bed is pretty enjoyable of course the problem is it's not it's nothing it's not accessible you don't like

[01:24:21] Luzerne point you it's enjoyable until you like holy [ __ ] it's hot I want to get out it's knowing that like you get to get out and then that that jump into the pool or the whatever it is is yeah yeah the discomfort you experience from from like the heat stress where you're like really hot is actually I think key for the positive benefits at least for me it was on my mood where I was just like felt so good so what about the reciprocal of that cold so I used to do a lot of cold therapy but all for Dom still delayed onset muscle soreness so that was my main interest was you know back in the olden days I would go out and buy hundred pounds of ice or 50 pounds of ice I guess throw it in the bathtub cold water and I would immerse myself and that was unbearable but that really sped up my recovery from difficult workouts it's a pain in the ass so I started doing cryo and the data

[01:25:12] I was pretty convinced that whole body cryotherapy comparable effect in Dom's but a fraction of the time and 10x the cost but I've also had people talk to me about and I've never really looked into this but I'm guessing you have ice cold showers for you know increasing norepinephrine levels things like that mood altering have you had you looked into this I've looked into the literature yeah it's something that I did that I did notice from from doing cold showers and sometimes I'll do one before like a big talk or something because it does help me focus and it helps with my anxiety kind of so yeah I was gonna say so how did we square the two completely different things right you would you'd sit in the sauna to help with anxiety and then you could have the cold shower well I didn't start getting into the cold shower until probably a couple of years ago the sauna I started doing in grad school yeah long time probably about 2008 so a long time ago so they're they're completely uncoupled in my experience so do you think the sauna is working more through gh and others I think this sauna has a very profound first it affects the immune system and that inflammation has a major effect on brain and I think that that's work from Charles rays on it's pretty clear it's definitely there's definitely an antidepressant effect that seems to correlate with biomarkers of the immune system so so the more potent the il-6 response the more potent the antidepressant response in addition to that there's a very strong effect on bated orphans baited orphans are dumped and also this other system called dine orphan which is you know yeah and and what's interesting is that when you activate dine orphan through the the cap opioid pathway instead of MU opioid you feel uncomfortable and it's the part where I was talking about your relation and ha I want to get out it's the part when you're exercising where you're like oh this you know it's that uncomfortable feeling well that's you're making dine orphan partly because it cools your body down so it's kind of a response to you elevate I'm convinced by the way there are a subset of athletes that don't produce that at the same level I mean seriously like there are people I think who there are yeah because we talk about like a why can that guy tolerate so much more pain than that guy and at some point it's possible that they're actually experiencing less pain there there there definitely are variants in in the capital good receptor your pathway and and all that so I'm surprised that hasn't become a performance-enhancing drug which is you know blocking that receptor the pain receptor in the brain which is a you know a very interesting thought but now so then on the cold front what do you think's mediating that neurotransmitters so basically on the cold front the norepinephrine your it's that's been shown so animal studies have shown or norepinephrine released in the locus coleus treason or the brain after cold exposure and a variety of cold water exposure cryotherapy if you're doing a cold water 50 degree you know if it's like 50 degrees Fahrenheit you gotta stay in a little longer than like a couple of minutes in a really cold cryotherapy chamber but in humans plasma norepinephrine has been looked at which does seem to sort of correlate with the release and it's so hard though to look at the plasma to understand I know I know it is it is so I do I do think that that some of the mood is affected by the norepinephrine as well have you experimented with the stacking which is go do the sauna for 20 minutes then go do the ice shower for whatever 10 minutes and you get an additive effect in time feel really good yeah I feel really good and and that's when I did notice that my sleep was really profoundly affected what's interesting is there some studies showing that that heat stress at least in piglets does affect actually it seems to elongate the

[01:28:48] REM sleep stage which I don't know how you know what what all that means but so there's there certainly an effect of heat on sleep and then of course cold isn't you know lowering your body body temperature is important for sleep onset but I don't know there's something about the combination of the two absolutely like I sleep amazing after doing that the combination of both

[01:29:09] I think cold is really interesting for the effects on mitochondrial biogenesis I mean exercise is probably one of the best ways to increase mitochondrial biogenesis but cold exposure has been shown human studies both an adipose tissue and in muscle tissue to to boost biomarkers of mitochondrial biogenesis well it depends on what tissue we're looking at still a you know P G c1 alpha would be would probably be one of the best I would say for muscle tissue in in adipose tissue perhaps the same I would say P G c1 alpha is probably one of the best it's another downstream one I can't for some reason I'm drawing a blank yeah so that that that's interesting to me that the the effect on mitochondrial biogenesis but personally I like the exercise you know for my mitochondrial biogenesis I'm not like doing cold exposure all the time it's not like something that I do often like I said

[01:30:01] I'll do it once in a while before a big event I have to talk at or something just because it does seem to help me with have you ever swum in water that's so cold that you actually feel like you're on fire yeah I have been yeah uh-huh that's bad to me as an amazing I assume it's through to the vasoconstriction but it's the coldest water I ever swam and was in the Colorado River it was 42 degrees which is I mean that's that's unusually cold and the only reason I think I was able to swim in it was it was May and so the Sun was it was about 90 degrees Fahrenheit was the air temperature so you could like I wouldn't be able to swim in 42 degree water on a cloudy day for example or a cold day but

[01:30:41] I couldn't believe the sensation of feeling like I had jumped into boiling oil it was incredible which is very different from my normal exposure to cold I used to swim a lot in the ocean and you know if you do a 3-hour swim at 50 degrees Fahrenheit or 50 to 53 you get a little bit of that effect but you know more you can still you still know you're in

[01:31:04] Coldwater but this particular time I remember and I probably spent 15 to 20 minutes in this 42 degree temp the entire time I felt like I was burning Wow and again III know no idea why I guess it's my assumption was that's such profound vasoconstriction in the periphery that you know the one thing that I wanted to mention that when you brought this up for recovery is because um there is some evidence that for whatever reason strength training when you do cold exposure like immediately after strength training if you do it within its let's say before like sometimes with it sometime within an hour before or for sorry absolutely after strength training it seems to blunt some of the hypertrophy effects yes yes and and and actually it's in you say that that's the exact reason I would never take like ibuprofen or any anti-inflammatory agent III would limit it even that day I wouldn't take any of those agents because you're impairing that that rebuild yeah yeah so that so that's also interesting that the timing of it seems to be you know again there's it's been shown that about an hour after exercise is when the the anti inflammatory response starts to peak and so it's like if you can basically if you're within that hour window when the inflammation is happening to create that anti inflammatory response you don't want to dampen that at least that's it seems to be what I I think and and literature seems to suggest and there's of course mechanisms where it's like specific macrophages and muscle tissue are really important for activating all these things that you know eventually result in satellite cell proliferation you know and of course igf-1 is in there somewhere so again you know the immune system activation is important for a lot of the benefits of exercise including muscle hypertrophy so there's one more topic I just want to get to if we can spare a bit more time which is which is nad the precursor is the whole shtick you spend a lot of time thinking about this what is your current thinking on is having more nad to NADH matter the the thing about the nad I guess I should provide context for people why am I asking this question right so there's lots of supplements out there now that are you know either giving NR or nad and the claim is that these things can enhance longevity you could live longer and that also you live better you have more energy all of these other things and so in the mitochondria you have complex one which converts NADH to nad and the idea is we do know that as you age that ratio of nad to NADH goes down and so part of the thinking is well and this is outside of this or too and pathway but this is upstream of that but if that you give more of either the precursor or nad you're basically fixing something that is getting worse as you age yeah so that I mean the question is why does it go down and that's I think there's multiple reasons for that at least that's been shown in literature nad is a very important cofactor for mitochondria I mean obviously mitochondria or making NADH and that hydrogen the proton is used and electrons are used to basically generate energy through the electron transport chain and it's also generating the mitochondrial membrane potential by kicking out the the proton so that that's really important for mitochondrial function and respiratory function energy production which is like the key of everything right but in addition to that you have as you mentioned sirtuins which are histone deacetylases which have a whole host of functions that they're doing regulating tons and tons of different pathways there also seem to be very important for healthspan and then in addition to that there's a very important DNA repair enzyme part that literally syncs up nad

[01:34:38] I mean it's like an nad sync I mean it you know so you know we're constantly having damage where does it reside that enzyme we're in the cell yeah is it nuclear it must be right yeah and the reason I ask is how do we know that these supplements that we take orally are going to actually reach their bioavailability in the place we want them okay but that said we'll come back to that after um I think it's in the nucleus I mean it would otherwise the shuttles there but I think it is so it's very important for repairing you know

[01:35:11] DNA damage and so that's one of the major sinks and actually inflammation all these things are kind of upstream apart activation so the more that's happening the more parts being activated so you kind of have you have nad going there so one argument just to make sure I understand what you're saying is look if you're getting older you're gonna have more DNA damage that's just stochastic and if your little guy that repairs it requires nad as fuel that would explain one reason potentially why nad would decline as we age yeah it's and it's certainly a sink for it yeah and the other so the other thing is well if your immune systems can't constantly you know activate too if a more inflammation you have all that energy is required so nad is being consumed more for that as well so that's sort of another thing basically nad levels decline with age and it's probably because it's just getting used up more or the other the alternative is you know is there something else going on in terms of like this whole salvage pathway there's another pathway that you can do to regenerate aid nad and if that's kind of going wrong and I think there's some increasing evidence for that as well would that make metformin a bad idea from this standpoint because metformin inhibits complex one so Matt

[01:36:20] Forman lowers the ratio of nad to NADH does it has that been shown so you're saying it should lower it it should lower it now of course that's counterintuitive because we know it activates AMPK so I probably have to sit down and think about this but we do know metformin inhibits complex one and we know that complex one turns NADH to nad which makes me wonder does is it possible that metformin would impair DNA repair through that mechanism by reducing substrate I have no idea well

[01:36:52] I'm gonna write that down because I wasn't aware of the I didn't understand that at length yeah yeah I think that's a major one I literally think that's a major thing for it I think that the PARP is I think it's just like going there yeah so the animal evidence you mentioned some of the supplements you know precursors that can form nad I think that the animal evidence suggests that it can at least in rodents improve health span particularly in models with light that are heavily dependent on mitochondria like muscle myopathy models or something like that I think I think that was one and also the brain so I think those are the two the two organs

[01:37:29] I've seen like major positive effects with with nad supplementation and then there's some of course pilot clinical studies showing that yes you can take for example in the coton right right beside and it does seem to increase nad levels in plasma in a dose-dependent manner now again you race no idea if it's getting in the was getting in the cell is it getting in the way now we do know in animal studies that I think that has been shown because it's affecting the might of contacted those animal models of myopathy and stuff and mitochondrial function was improved and all that stuff so so when animal models it obviously is affecting mitochondrial function so it must be getting to the right place I don't know why I have found myself kind of skeptical of this I think it's good to start with skepticism I mean I think that nad levels or you can you can increase them with fasting so when you fast you know as you mentioned you convert nad into NADH in the presence of of energy because that's basically when you have a substrate like glucose or a fatty acid that's when you produce nadh or fadh2 so in the absence of those substrates then you start to meet your nad starts to build up so back to your metformin question you said I know who to ask I definitely know I'm gonna ask

[01:38:39] Navin Dell he will know the answer to this I follow a lot of his work when I was in grime Ralph Jabbar Dinis I did because I was doing a lot of cancer metabolism metabolism mitochondrial function and stuff so I followed a lot of do you have NAB's book navigating metabolism oh I don't know I just used to read his papers back when I was a graduate school just yeah so nav and

[01:39:00] David Sabatini were in town a couple of weeks ago and I was leaving town the day they were coming into town so we hung out for three hours near the airport and I was just reminded of how much fun it is to talk about mitochondria yeah for sure what is the most interesting question you feel you don't yet know the answer to but you feel is knowable that you're sort of actively putting in lots of your clock cycles on thinking about I would really like to know if for example someone who is like myself who I don't have a lot of body fat I'm active I eat a pretty healthy diet you know I don't smoke I don't have any of those bad habits if I were to do a prolonged fast a couple days a year would that truly have an effect on increasing my stem cell production potentially you know getting rid of any dysfunctional immune cells just funk liver cells dysfunctional whatever you know muscle cells and repopulating them with like healthy new cells like basically this rejuvenation like could I get this like bursts of rejuvenation a couple times a year and would that have in turn have an effect on delaying the onset of age-related diseases improving my health span you know keeping my stem cells less damaged that would be very interesting to me because to me that's something that's very doable for myself

[01:40:18] I mean the experiment to figure that out was different because it's you know in humans and so that's gonna be really hard you have to figure out like if you can even look at certain biomarkers to know that but I feel like that would be something that's so easy for someone to do it's interested in in longevity and you think it would be sort of once or twice a year doing like a five-day water only mineral well the question is how often how long like so you know we have a lot of the studies coming out of animal data which these rodents they lose 20% of their body weight after a 48 hour water fast yeah I find it hard to infer anything from rodents when it comes to fasting because MICEX act reason it's like Ida even the Jay

[01:40:58] Mitchell stuff I talked about earlier I mean I think it's an interesting proof of concept but I don't actually know how you would apply that to humans right so the question is it's like okay so if you have a 48-hour fasts and in a row yeah so I guess I'll expand my sort of answer that question like maybe do a prolonged water fasts like time right what's the frequency what's the duration to get the maximum benefit yeah and I am specifically interested in this shrinking of the organs and then regrowing like this potential robust activation of stem cells clearing away you know we're not just talking about a toffee we're not just talking about clearing away damaged mitochondria a pieces of DNA protein a great you are getting that but well in theory in humans in addition to that I mean I'm talking about clearing away the damage to the whole cell like just getting rid of it and replacing it with a brand-new young healthy cell like that's what I'm interested in you know I would I would love to you know even just the hope that that's possible you know based off of some of the pilot studies that voltar has done in humans and certainly the the animal evidence like I'm convinced I'm gonna at least try because it seems it seems very possible I know I know that he is trying to find the best biomarkers to look at for you know stem cell activation it's not quite as straightforward can't just you know harvest a bunch of tissues and look at things but I certainly have gotten some anecdotes from people that have had autoimmune like diseases and things said that fastings like completely reversed some of it like eczema or something no it's right where it's anecdotal but certainly when you start to have enough people saying the same thing it's like wow that's interesting that you've heard that five five or six times now yeah I think that would that's a good one I guess I think of a very similar question with rapamycin rapamycin yeah what what dose and what frequency to produce the best longevity phenotype do you know the interesting thing with the rapa myosin is the effect on the senescence cells like that's so interesting to me I didn't know really about that until I listened to your podcast with Judith yeah she's amazing she's really she's really she was really great and very knowledgeable in the whole senescent field yeah I had no I had no idea either the life's expanding effect is is that males only or was it both male male and female and it's across I mean it's it's everything from yeast to worms to flies to mammals I mean it's the only drug that's uniformly extended life across a billion years of evolution I mean and there's really interesting work I mean I think Matt quebra like maximum lifespan or are we talking median actually in the mice it was I think I can look it's not the time it's median but yeah yeah and what was interesting in the mice as they started late in life they started at 600 days which is that's about 60 years old yeah that's that's like starting is with this room that was really late in life for the my yeah yeah I was Wow made it that much more impressed that is that is very interesting so Kay Berlin's work do you know Matt up at the University of

[01:43:58] Washington he is giving rapamycin to dogs but these are pets right so these are not laboratory animals which is what makes it really interesting is you've got animals that live in our environment that are and dogs sort of have a very predictable demise right they're either gonna be you know died in an accident be euthanized cardiomyopathy or die of cancer that's basically how dogs died and the cardiomyopathy that they get is not an asterisk erotic cardiomyopathy they get a cardiomyopathy where the muscles are actually just getting weaker and weaker and their ejection fraction is going down and in studies as short as 12 weeks they're seeing a 10% increase in ejection fraction of these dogs and so the question is how much of that is working through senescence just selectively knocking out senescence cells and letting myocytes regenerate yeah that study out of the Mayo Clinic where they did some drugs like selectively targeted senescence cells and it it's a 20 percent increase in median lifespan sort of an interesting proof of principle how just well that was an I think an accelerated aging model so they had accumulated

[01:45:06] Marchioness themselves obviously they had to do something like that but but it all comes back to this idea of specificity and selection you know everything we've talked about if you really stop to think about it comes down to how could you target this tissue and leave that tissue alone or how could you target this cell and leave that cell alone and in many ways I think that's kind of got to be the next frontier here is you know even if you think about something as crude as chemotherapy it is not hard to kill a cancer cell with a chemical that's trivial it's hard to kill a cancer cell and not a normal cell and that's why chemotherapy obviously targets rapidly dividing cells and it's still very crude but the stuff we're talking about is like taking that to the next level which is how could you get this enzyme to work more efficiently but in this subset of cell you know just in the muscle but not in the fat or not in the liver in there yeah and that's again where the fasting is just so impressive to me the fact that you know all the normal cells is you're enhancing all these stress response pathways so the chemo drug becomes that much more or less almost less you know efficacious like it's like almost like a lower dose because it's like got these robust anti-apoptotic in anti stress response genes that are dealing with that sort of stress and so it's like it can take the toxic and sole because of that upregulation that fasting is doing and the cancer cells just can so I'm I'm so glad that that works being done I hope that there is more funding that goes in that area I think that it is a really important area of research again like I said with it you know this is and this is all from from vaulters working some of some of his colleagues so I'm just kind of like the fangirl you know but I'm certainly

[01:46:39] I'm happy someone's doing that research and I would love to see that be used as a standard of care someday for sure so Rhonda many of the people listening to this will know everything about where to find you but for the let's assume there's someone here who this is their first time meeting you where can they learn more about you and how can they interact with you I have a podcast it's called found my fitness you can find it on iTunes and on my website found my fitness comm all the episode pages there with links to the video which and your videos are remarkable because you put so much work into actually like a podcast like this unfortunately we're too lazy like I'm not gonna actually do much except create show notes but on yours it's like it's like a Khan Academy right it's like everything is being explained in the video as well like yeah any text explaining the figures definitions and all that are there in the video and also on I think we're having now definitions and stuff on the website so people can the the goal is to definitely showcase you know a lot of the the researchers and scientists that I interview and also to educate people as well so found my fitness someone iTunes and my website and social media you can find me on and what do you like most is Twitter the easiest place for people to get better
