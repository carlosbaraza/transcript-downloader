## AI Summary

I'll help analyze this podcast excerpt about early sports specialization in children. Here's the structured breakdown:

**1. Executive Summary**:
This segment features a discussion between Dr. Peter Attia and experts (including Mike Boyle) about the dangers of early sports specialization in children. The conversation focuses on why forcing children to diversify their athletic activities is crucial for long-term development, despite potential resistance from the children themselves. The experts strongly advocate against year-round single-sport participation and emphasize the importance of sampling multiple sports during childhood.

**2. Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Early specialization is often driven by financial interests rather than scientific evidence [00:00:00]
- Early succeeder phenomenon relates to early physical maturation, not necessarily long-term athletic potential [00:02:27]
- Increased injury rates in US sports correlate with year-round participation [00:06:57]
- Modern basketball players cover approximately 200 more miles per year due to game style changes [00:07:41]

**3. Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Encourage broad sport sampling up to age 12 [00:04:07]
- Include combative sports in children's athletic development [00:05:11]
- Incorporate both fine motor skills and musculature development activities [00:06:17]

Context-specific recommendations:
- For baseball-focused kids: Add swimming and soccer [00:05:11]
- For hockey players: Consider soccer for foot coordination [00:04:07]

**5. Exercise & Movement**:
Training Methodologies:
- Multi-sport approach before age 12 [00:03:25]
- Combination of:
  - Gymnastics
  - Jiu-jitsu
  - Swimming
  - Soccer
  - Judo
  [00:01:44 - 00:02:27]

**9. Notable Quotes**:
"Follow the money - if you look at most of these people that are telling you that kids need year-round sports are people who are making their living from year-round sports." [00:00:00]

"I don't care if you're the best player when you're 12. I care if you're the best player when you're 18." [00:03:25]

**10. Follow-up Questions**:
1. What is the optimal age to begin sport specialization?
2. How does early sports specialization affect mental health and burnout rates?
3. What are the specific injury patterns associated with early specialization in different sports?
4. How does early sports specialization impact long-term athletic development and performance?

Would you like me to expand on any of these sections or provide additional analysis of specific aspects of the discussion?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] We live in a world now it seems where uh coaches want kids to specialize earlier and earlier. Most of the kids have a coach an a coach outside of like a position coach outside of the team. Now my intuition is that just doesn't make sense. So So what tell me what you guys think of that. Do you have a soap box available um for me to jump up on? Absolutely. One, I always say follow the money, right? If you look at most of these people that are telling you that kids need year- round sports are people who are making their living from year- round sports. If you look at what most professional athletes are doing, they're not doing that with their kids. If you look at what most coaches are doing, they're not doing that with their kids. What you usually find is some entrepreneur who has developed Joe's baseball and he needs income year round because he doesn't have Joe's baseball and lacrosse. He just has Joe's baseball. So as a result they're they start telling you they start giving you that early specialization myth like hey you got to get started early and if you get started early you do better and if you you get seen early I just saw somebody Twitter the other day somebody said that you know scouting starts now at 10U this was a woman who runs uh a softball development program and I just I literally I typed it I said no that's that's absolutely bad information it's they start using words like development and exposure. The reality is if you said, "I have an 8-year-old who really likes baseball." The number one thing I would tell you is make him do something else besides baseball. My daughter was a full scholarship ice hockey player, very, very good. Played a year in the women's professional league, had a scholarship when she was 15 years old. I didn't let her play in a summer tournament until she was 13. And people would say all the time, "Can can

[00:01:44] Michaela play in this tournament? Can she play in that tournament?" I'm like, "Nope." And they were like, "What is what's she doing?" Said, "She's going to go to the lake. She's going to water ski. She's going to be on the swim team. She took up diving one summer because they needed a diver and she became the

[00:01:56] U12 diver because she the guy started throwing herself off the diving board and said, "Oh, she's fearless. I'll teach her to dive." And I was like, "How many hours will you take her for?" And he's like, "Oh, a couple hours a week." I was like, "Awesome." But so I we made her do that. We made her play soccer. She did judo. She was state judo champion when she was 12. The kids that are better athletes do better in the long run. you end up with there's a whole early succeeder phenomenon that we deal with and early succeeders generally they won the uh the genetic

[00:02:27] Olympics they generally tend to be from uh from groups that that develop earlier and they will tend to be ahead when they for us from in my years it was the Greeks and the Italian kids they always mature they they were the ones that were shaving in junior high school and they were much better in junior high at football than the rest of us were because they weighed 190 lbs and we weighed 130 lbs and You just look at that and think that's not going to have any bearing on the end. You have to look this is the literal marathon versus sprint argument in terms of you've got to look at this and think no this is a this is a developmental marathon and the kids who sample tend to do better like your kid loves baseball now but you don't necessarily know that that will be my son loved hockey he's playing college lacrosse he was playing baseball and lacrosse at the same time and eventually we realized do you feel this way even if the kid is themselves wanting to play all the time would you sort of force the kid yeah I forced my daughter my daughter was hockey only she that's all I want to do. And I said, I don't care.

[00:03:25] So, she was not thrilled about the idea that you weren't letting her play in a summer tournament. Yep. Angry at times with me, fights about why can't I do this? Because she knew she could go and be the best player. And I said, I don't care if you're the best player when you're 12. I care if you're the best player when you're 18. Uh, and so being the best player at 12, I'm not getting any ego gratification by going to this tournament and realizing that you made the 12-year-old allstars or something like that. So, yeah, we had fights. We had fights about soccer. I made her play her 14 year soccer and I did. But the specialization thing I always think up to 12 broadest sampling possible. The more things they can possibly do, the better the more because we're trying to develop general athletic attributes.

[00:04:07] You'll see the kids in hockey that played soccer because they're kids that can pick up pucks in their feet. My son picked up lacrosse really fast because he played baseball and he played hockey and he understood the whole idea. Oh, we score. There's a net. I can catch things extended. All that stuff made perfect sense to him when he went to lacrosse and lacrosse ended up coming together.

[00:04:26] But if you weren't sampling, you don't know. You just think, I always say, and this is a terrible analogy, but I'm going to use it anyway. I said, if your son came to you and said, "I really like cocaine at this point. It's the only thing that I want to do." You would be like, "No, we're not going to do that."

[00:04:39] Right? But suddenly, because you you have to do a little heroin. You have to do a little meth. I would like you to drink a few years. I just don't want you to be But you know what I If you substitute just because they want to do it. You substitute that for baseball. You think you you like I'm I like absurd analogies, but I think there you see the absurdity of that and you think, yeah, you love baseball, that's great, but hey, you really should, you know, you should learn to swim and you really should learn to do some sort of, you know, sport that involves your feet. You know, you should play soccer. You should

[00:05:11] I think, you know, kids should do I think some sort of combative sport is really good for kids because you should learn what it's like. Like it's really funny. My took my daughter to the instructors when my daughter was doing judo were Ronda Rousey and Kayla Harrison which like what are the odds that you go to the best judo school in

[00:05:26] America that is 15 minutes from your house and that's who's teaching the classes in judo. So my daughter can still say that you know she was taught by Ronda Rousey and Kayla Harrison but having to go out on a mat and fight another kid I he fights the word I guess right is really good for a 12-year-old girl. And that feeling I remember her looking at me the first time like you know and I'm like sorry I can't come out like you're on you're on your own you better figure it out and she did. So I just you sampling is the key and specialist specialization if we can think of the worst possible thing you can do for your kid it is to let them specialize even if it gets to the point where they think dad I don't like you you're mean you're you're not a good person because you're not letting me do what I want to do. You've got to look at them and think that's why I'm the parent that's why I'm in charge. Sorry, soap box. Uh, soap box down. I'll let somebody else talk.

[00:06:17] I will say that our kids are both in gymnastics and jiu-jitsu. My daughter hates jiu-jitsu and she excels in gymnastics. And we chose gymnastics because it allows for her fine motor skills, all of this development very young, and also the development of her musculature. She's And again, she loves it. And we know that the healthier, fitter, and more active these kids are, the greater their metabolic health as adults is. But um to your point, what we see is I think in the US we see a lot more injuries than in other places because of this always having a season.

[00:06:57] And um from a standpoint of longevity, definitely again make our kids do the same thing. I don't know why we haven't stopped and questioned it a little bit sooner because it's not like injury rates are going down. So, we're playing more and getting injured more. Like that's what we've seen um across all levels of sport. Mike and I were discussing the Achilles tendons and the rash of Achilles tendon injuries or at least it seems to be in prominent players. Um but a lot of it has to go back to just the the the repetitions and the mileage. One thing that Mike brought up that I thought was really interesting was the way the style of the game is played now. Let's say basketball, there's so much more because it's really come down, chuck up a three, go down, chuck up a three, come down, check.

[00:07:41] There's a lot a lot less of that inside game going on. The game is faster and they run more and there's a lot more mileage. How many miles extra was it? 200 more miles a year per team, right? Just because of just the way the style of the game is played. And they're not all linear miles. They're start, stop, start, stop, start, stop. So there's a lot of cumulative stress on the Achilles tendon doing that that can you know again on top of the fact that that as as as teenagers they were playing all year long too not like it used to be when Larry Bird was playing when he played his season and he probably went home and and did something completely different. Um I or just just shot around a little bit. So the we need to start looking at these extensive seasons and these multiple seasons per year because it's not changing. is not helping. If it if it was helping, we wouldn't have all these athletes being injured. Things are worse now than they've ever been.

[00:08:32] Same more about the Achilles. That that is the injury I personally fear the most at this point. I don't know what it is. I think I've just seen so many of them. It's the injury that keeps me up at night is like I'm just literally diving for a soccer ball and ping. I'm Peter Aia.
