This clip is from episode 351 ‒ Male fertility: optimizing reproductive health, diagnosing and treating infertility, and navigating testosterone replacement therapy | Paul Turek, M.D.

In this clip, they discuss:

- Exogenous Testosterone Suppresses Sperm Production – Even after a few months, testosterone therapy (injection, gel, oral, or nasal) typically shuts down sperm production
- Some Testosterone Forms May Be Less Inhibitory – Intranasal or oral testosterone taken in multiple daily doses may allow some sperm production
- Long-Term Use Can Lead to Complete Suppression – Men taking testosterone for years, especially via weekly injections, often present with zero sperm
- Recovery Is Possible but Depends on Duration and Dosage – Shorter-term, cyclical use can often be reversed; long-term, constant use increases the risk of permanent shutdown

## AI Summary

Here's my analysis of the video clip:

**1. Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Paul Turek discussing fertility issues related to exogenous testosterone use. The conversation focuses primarily on how testosterone supplementation affects sperm production and fertility, and the protocols for recovering fertility after testosterone use. Dr. Turek shares his extensive clinical experience with helping men restore fertility after using testosterone, including specific protocols and recovery strategies.

**2. Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- 95% chance of no sperm production while on exogenous testosterone [00:00:00]
- Different testosterone delivery methods have varying impacts on fertility:
  * Intranasal and oral variants (delivered multiple times daily) have less negative impact [00:00:40]
  * Injectable testosterone is most suppressive to fertility [00:04:18]
- Recovery potential depends on:
  * Duration of use
  * Dosage
  * Method of administration [00:05:29]
- Risk of permanent suppression after 5-10 years of continuous use [00:06:22]

**3. Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Never stop testosterone suddenly; always taper off [00:07:47]
- Taper protocol: reduce dose over 6 weeks (2 weeks at half dose, then 2 weeks at quarter dose, then off) [00:07:47]

Context-specific Recommendations:
- For fertility recovery, three main approaches:
  1. Taper alone
  2. Taper with Clomid
  3. Taper with hCG and Clomid [00:08:48]

## Transcript

[00:00:00] Question one, if a guy is taking exogenous testosterone, and let's just say he's been on it now for a few months, is he able to create sperm? Not 95% chance he's not. Wow. While he's on it? Yep. Understood. But can he create it once he stops? And we'll and we'll definitely address that. But just to be clear, even a couple of months on exogenous testosterone in any form, injection, topical, oral, whatever, you basically have shut off the ability to make sperm because your testes themselves have shut down, right? No signals, right? No gas to the engine.

[00:00:40] Now, there are some it's nuanced, okay? So there's there are formulations that are topical that are less potent that way, less inhibitory than injectables. So there are variations in the spectrum of exogenous testosterone that will maintain some of your fertility. there are formulations at least the um I don't want to go so far as to call it the marketing material but for lack of a better term the marketing material is suggestive that the more frequently delivered varants so for example the intraasal variant which is delivered three times a day the oral variant delivered twice a day have less of a negative impact because they're producing far lower surges than if you did a weekly injection is that what you're referring to Yeah. So they do more physiologic they're in the normal range more. What gives you side effects from testosterone including sterility is too much. Yeah. So in your experience has that borne out? Yeah. So men you've seen men taking Nesto three times a day doing a nasal keeping their sperm counts. Keeping their sperm counts.

[00:01:46] Okay. That's interesting to note. What about the oral testosterone the twice a day? Love it. So and dec testosterone nec and decan08 and it was not available in America for 50 years. It was available in Europe and a couple of researchers at UCLA a husband wife team beautiful um decided what happened was we were worried when we took oral testoster right to the bilary system and go to the liver cause liver cancer so it was always verboten. All right. So, now let's talk about the guy who comes to see you. He's been on exogenous testosterone for three years. So, he was given poor advice three years ago. He went to some shady, you know, back alley website and they just, you know, he was 27 years old at the time. He just wanted to I mean, this is tragically a very common story, by the way. Right. So, this guy's been on 200 milligrams of testosterone a week for the past 3 years. He's now 30 years old. He's met the love of his life and lo and behold, they can't seem to get pregnant. So, he's in your office. During the history, you find out pretty quickly he's been on 200 milligrams of testosterone for 3 years. Tell me what his uh sperm analysis looks like. Do you see there are no presumably there are no sperm? I would bet 95% confidence that he would be have no sperm in a semen. Okay. At 200 milligrams a week. So, what are you telling him now? How are you going to solve this problem? So, it's funny because a lot of guys come in um they're they look good and and I when I examine

[00:03:17] I'll say, "Are you taking anything? Are you taking because they never put it on their medications, right? You never write it out on the history. You always have to get it out of the if they look if they're super jacked but then they have shriveled testes." Yeah. And they're zero and they're wondering what you know. Right. So, I will look them in the eye. So, you taking testosterone?

[00:03:37] And I'll look them in the eye until they answer. And if they look down and and they don't say anything, I know they're on it. If they look me in the eye and say no, then I know they're not. But they'll always look away cuz it's it's this verboten thing. So this is the same, by the way, as I'm sure you experienced as a resident in the ER, the people that come in with foreign rectal bodies and abdominal pain, that's the one thing they emit from their history, right? It's like they tell you, you know, this is the last time I ate. this is this. This is this. But then you get the X-ray back and there's like a candlestick in their colon and then you say, "What about this Hopkins? What about this?" Yeah. Yeah. What about this candlestick? And they're like, "Oh, I totally forgot to mention that." Yes.

[00:04:18] Yes. That was lit when I went in. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, typically I'll say, "So, my theories about this is if he's why is he taking it?" So, if he's taking it for anabolics and you know, he probably has a pretty good idea. And I I want to send you give you a little research we're doing on the lifespan of anabolic steroid users. So remind me at the end of the story to give you a little brief about what I know about that. But um so I so when you take So how he takes it matters. So if he's been in constant use injectables, that's the most suppressive of fertility. And if you turn a gland like a testicle off long enough, it's off. So I gave a lecture to the anagramrin society on recovering men from hypoganism in young men and I asked them a question at the end because I this is I my whole procedure comes from steroid users. I I I take notes when the anabolic guys come see me because they're really smart and they know a lot about reactions biology not everything but it's a science. Some of them are PhDs. I took notes for years and it came up my approach uh along with what I know.

[00:05:29] Right. So it's very much in concert with concert with them. So everything I say is sort of built on a large experience. Uh and it's called getting off the juice the blog and I have people read that blog do it and say get about 80% of the way and then call me and say I need help here now. I'm here. Yeah. We'll link to this in the show notes. Getting off the juice and there's a PowerPoint in it. So the recovery is usually possible in young men, but it depends on how much they took, how long they took it, and how they took it. If they do it like a cycling effort, that's the best, right?

[00:06:04] So if you cycle steroids, you recover the pituitary, you get back to normal, and then you hit it again. That's actually quite smart. Constant use is not constant use for longevity or whatever is not a good idea for fertility. So that's going to be much more suppressive. Injections are worse than orals or any gels. Mhm.

[00:06:22] So, the next thing is how long? So, I asked the Endocrine Society since I answered all their questions. I said, "I have a question for you. Can you turn a testicle off like in a thyroid or an adrenal gland? If you suppress it enough, can you turn it off for good?" And they said, "Yeah, that's a board question of ours. We can do that." And I said, cuz we believe it's always reversible in the field of infertility in men. And they and so that got me a little worried. And so now I kind of worry about 5 to 10 years of use. After 5 or 10 years of use, you may not get it back. either the ability to make sperm or the ability to make testosterone natively. So, we typically tell men in our practice, um, don't, you know, two years would be the absolute ceiling. Maybe are we too conservative? Maybe. Okay. Depends on dosing and everything, right? If they're taking 250 a week, then No, I mean, in our practice, it would be 50 twice a week. Yeah. Okay, I did a study, published a study when I was a fellow in

[00:07:12] Houston um of a guy who took it for 25 years and we drove at him with gonadotropins, hCG and FSH and we didn't get anything but he had testicular. No, we got a a low number of sperm back and I just had a guy from Louisiana come in 25 years of chronic use. I did a mapping procedure to find sperm in his testicle and he's going to be having a kid but he made a couple of sperm after and that was a record for me. But you pump him full of hcg and synthetic FSH and get nothing and then you have to look in the testicle because production can be low enough to be there but not coming out.

[00:07:47] But this is the rescue protocol. It's LHFSH. Basically, there's three ways to do it. One is never stop the testosterone suddenly. Interesting. Because men will hit the doldrums and go and they'll flop over like they have the flu. They'll feel like and they'll get right back on it. They'll feel terrible because they have nothing going on. If you take the testosterone away, their system's turned off. they're not making their own. It takes time to get the system to reactivate. So that's the hardest. So I always taper testosterone over what period of time six weeks typically you have the dose for two, have the dose for two and then off for two and then you measure and that's like getting out of the white water into the green the green wall a little bit. So that's a little smoother. So taper and then I offer them two options. One option is taper alone taper with clomid and clomophene which is a little quicker getting the pituitary to turn back on. So that will that will soften the blow of the feeling of feeling completely fatigued or more aggressively hCG and and and Clomid.

[00:08:48] Okay. Um I guess at about 6 weeks or and there's no So it's it's interesting if you give Clomid the pituitary will make FSH and LH. Yeah. It doesn't shut off. It takes a while. Well, that's a way more cost-effective approach than giving syn because synthetic FSH is pricey. Yes. Couple thousand a month. Yeah. In

[00:09:10] America. Yeah. So, is there any reason to do that over the Clomid approach or is it just that it's faster? I think you might gain a couple of weeks of time. Okay. So, for most people, that's not a price. With that taper over a month or two, I usually check their tea levels at around two weeks off of the last testosterone, and that's the lowest they'll be. And if they're in a good range there, that didn't you can use that as a predictor of their response.

[00:09:33] If they're good if they're in a normal range. Oh, really? Okay. So, you we we want within a couple months to see them back to 600. 300 would be okay to make sperm. Okay. All right. But then to get them to where they want to be depends on their symptoms and what they're happy with. I'm, you know, I'm not sure. I'm not you you won't know till you wait longer to see how how high you can get them. That's the lowest they'll be, but they'll be off of testosterone. And if they go along that taper and they're not tolerating, I try to tell them, don't go back. Just stay there because time will help you. Yeah. And you're not going to feel maybe that great, but try to do this because if you don't, if you go back, then we have to start over. But if you can just maintain it for a while, you'll feel better. And some of them dip a little bit, but remarkably, most men do really well with that taper. I'm Peter Atia.
