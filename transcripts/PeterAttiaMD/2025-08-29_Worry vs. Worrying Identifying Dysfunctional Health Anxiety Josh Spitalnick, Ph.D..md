## Transcript

[00:00:00] Let's help people understand that. I'd like to use thoughts versus thinking and I'd like to use worry versus worrying to help people understand when they've crossed that threshold. Um, so start with whichever one you want and let's pick a real world example that you might experience in the practice. Well, I want to talk about health and medical stuff.

[00:00:22] So, someone's having a bunch of physical symptoms and they're afraid that they might have cancer. They're afraid that they might have cancer. That's a worry. They're afraid that these might be symptoms of a heart attack, of an MI event. That's a worry. What if I'm having a heart attack? All of a sudden, you're trying to figure it out. Which, by the way, asking that doesn't figure it out. >> And Googling it doesn't figure it out.

[00:00:46] And calling your cardiologist who hasn't seen you doesn't figure it out. But when you go, go, "What? What if this is a heart attack symptom?" You're beyond worrying about it. The worry is I might be sick. in this case having a medical event and you're trying to figure like what if this is the thing and when you're trying to figure it out that's no different than googling it that's no different than looking it up online calling your nurse or doctor friend or or in-law and saying do you think this is what it is so when I go to someone and go hey do you think that's what this is most people would call that reassurance seeking which is a classic ritual it's a behavioral thing me asking you hey you have not evaluated me you're my brother-in-law do you think this is a medical event but when you Ask yourself that. How is that any different? We haven't evaluated you. There's no lab work. We're not really going to get the answer. And you're really just looking for one answer. You're fine. So, the dilemma is is when you go from that worry state to oh my gosh, I'm terrified

[00:01:40] I might be sick to what if I'm sick? What if this is the event? People can spend not in that that little moment, but all day wondering, is is that is that another thing? Is that a heart issue? Is is that a symptom of stroke? My eyes twitching. Does that mean I'm having a seizure? When they start asking themselves a litany of questions, that's not the worry. The worry is just, I'm scared something's wrong. I'm scared something bad's going to happen. When you sit there and start questioning it all to me, it's no different than just sitting there and googling all day long, what are these symptoms? And everyone would look, anyone would look at that and go, of course, that person's ritualizing. But when you do it inside, it's the same mechanism. It's you trying to get to the end of the story. you're using your crystal ball or time machine to get to the end of that story sooner than you actually need to. And in that case, if you're having a real medical event, I'd go to the doctor. I'd actually go see a physician. But sitting there questioning it doesn't solve anything. So, you went from a state of having worries, I'm afraid I'm sick, I'm afraid something's wrong, to sitting there, I won't use the word per severity because that usually means something else, but ruminating on it. And that's looks functional, but it's actually quite dysfunctional. >> Is it dysfunctional because of the duration? Is it dysfunctional because it comes at the expense of doing something else? Or is it dysfunctional because if an objective person were to evaluate it on its face, it doesn't make any sense? Now, I know I've said a lot there, but to me, this is the crux of it, right? >> I'm going to be able to answer that with one word. Yes. It's dysfunctional because it's taking away from your life.

[00:03:12] It's dysfunctional because the duration or intensity of it doesn't match the thing. meaning that if you're spending all your time doing that and not going to the doctor, this is not going to solve anything. Um, so in a single moment, anyone freaking out, I don't think that's dysfunctional, Peter. That's that's what any one of us would do. You know, you you sent an email and go, "Oh, shoot. Did I just do that?" We all do that. Oh, man. This this this feels tight in my chest. What what is that? We all do that. So even the criteria for something like health anxiety um the DSM criteria requires 6 months of being concerned about whether it's about symptoms or diseases. We'll talk about different kinds of health anxiety in a few minutes. 6 months. So in a single singular moment it's nothing more than you being inquisitive and curious. But the point is is that's not going to solve whether it's a medical event or not. Going to your doctor is getting an EK EKG is asking your nurse sister if you're having like a stroke.

[00:04:06] What does she know? So it doesn't solve the problem. and it's trying to get to the end of a story or or resolve some uncertainty um or some ambiguity in a way that's not actually going to solve it. So, it's just not a functional way to process in a singular moment, in a single moment, uh the first time, I don't care. You don't care. It's what someone does. But when you're doing that multiple times a day, multiple times a week, or for months on end, that's the disease. Now what about the individual who uh goes out to seek medical attention for something but the pattern is so illogical. So they they just keep having sort of unexplained um symptoms >> and they they create a story that says this is cancer or this is heart disease or this is whatever >> and they follow through with the medical checkup as they should. >> Yeah. And the medical checkup keeps coming back crystal clear. You're you're fine. You're fine. You're fine. You're fine. You're fine. And the goalpost keeps moving. So it's I think I've got this. I think I've got that. I think

[00:05:11] I've got this. I think I've got that. Everything they get checked up for is fine. Is that health anxiety? I'm Peter.
