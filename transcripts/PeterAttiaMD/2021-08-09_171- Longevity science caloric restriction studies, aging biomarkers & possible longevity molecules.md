## Description

Steve Austad is a distinguished professor of biology at the University of Alabama and director of one of the Nathan Shock Centers of Excellence in aging biology. Steve's current research seeks to understand the underlying causes of aging, specifically with a long-term goal of developing medical interventions that slow the age-related decay of human health. In this episode, Steve tells Peter about his unusual childhood and stints as a cab driver and lion tamer. He goes on to describe what led to his focus on studying aging and some of the major challenges and limitations of working with laboratory animals. Steve and Peter talk about the relationship between caloric restriction and lifespan, including some of the most important studies exploring this question. Additionally, they hypothesize what might explain the sex-related differences in longevity between men and women, explain the importance of finding longevity biomarkers, and discuss the most promising molecules as potential longevity agents.

## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia

[00:00:09] hey steve as we were just talking about a minute ago this has been a long time coming i am so excited about this discussion today good i'm looking forward to it myself you're one of those people and there are a handful of people like you where any time we sit down if it's over a coffee a meal or a short phone call it i feel like my learning increases at a geometric rate so to now be able to do a very long discussion and then share it with so many people is is going to be awesome but you know frankly any discussion about longevity i think needs to begin with your background i think people need to understand the curious character that you are and your your journey to where you are today is um you know it's not it's not common right and i but yet i think it sort of speaks to uh the unique lens that you've you've brought to this space so um give folks a sense of you know what you did growing up like when you were in high school what were you interested in you know it was interesting in high school i was a math nerd and everybody assumed that i was going to be a mathematician including myself in fact i i was a math major when i first went to college but what i really did in my spare time in high school when i wasn't playing sports is i like to kick around in the woods and this was in southern california and i would actually go out into the desert i actually had a high school biology teacher who would take students out in the desert to catch rattlesnakes and i still i'm not sure why he was doing that i think he was milking them and getting money for the venom or something but anyway i had a great time doing that and at that time i think i was in 10th grade he said you're going to be a biologist and i thought that's the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard of i know i'm going to be a mathematician and then after i got to college i suddenly discovered after the first year i didn't really like math all that much and i wasn't about to spend four years doing something i didn't like so what i really liked to do was read and so i switched to an english major and i actually ended up with an english degree and my goal at that point was to write the great american novel and become you know the the ernest hemingway of the latter 20th century and you went you went to ucla for undergrad you were in soccer yes i did yeah um so that was really my job but i the one thing i did is i thought well to write novels i've had a pretty traditional upbringing middle class upbringing except for the fact that my family traveled all over i went to 20 different grade schools at least i'm not sure how many really we would live two months you know my dad sold our house and bought a house trailer that we put behind the car and so for about six years we would spend three months in this town four months in that town oh so this wasn't because one of your parents was in the military no no my dad was a was a newspaper pressman and his union had something called a traveling card which meant that if you're a union member you could go to any big city newspaper and be hired for some short amount of time and so he must have just had a travel bug i i really regret that i never asked him what what were you thinking dad when you did this um so that's where we went we went you know el paso dallas atlanta miami virginia new york detroit that's that was my schooling except in doing all this traveling every year i missed probably two months of school um but when we were traveling my parents just threw these books at me in the back seat of the car and said there it's your study time and so um you know i i learned a lot on my own and that probably influenced somewhat who i am because that's a pretty unusual upbringing probably well i mean i can't imagine most kids could thrive in that setting because it's so disruptive like i uh i hear i i actually had a patient once who went to 11 different schools between 1st and 12th grade so averaged about a year per school so at least they didn't have to move during the school year but i always thought that that was you know just the social aspect of that not to mention just the continuity i mean when you move from one state to a next they may have different standards for what you're going to learn in english math or science but what you described takes that to a whole new level um were you ever behind in school did you ever show up at the at the school that you were in and feel like you're out to lunch or was it the opposite did you generally feel like you were more than making up for it in the back seat i felt like i was more than making up for it but i also think the school systems in southern california were particularly good at that time so i usually had had in school a lot of the stuff that i would come across particularly in the south which is the first part of this journey where we where we traveled through in fact you know it was probably made easier for me because i was an only child and i was used to being thrown on my own resources but one of the things that i quickly figured out because i was always the smallest kid in class even when i graduated from high school i was i was still 105 pounds and about five feet four and i quickly learned though that i could avoid being beaten up by the bigger kids if i helped them with their homework so i quickly fell into that in every school i went to i was the guy that would help you figure out what was going on in math or history or whatever and you're a normal sized person it's not like you're five foot seven today so what what do you attribute such a late growth spurt to well it's kind of interesting given the topic we're going to be talking about but but i when i was in a sophomore in high school i was still way behind i was i was wrestler i was wrestling in the 98 pound division which is the lowest weight class but i only weighed 79 pounds and at some point my parents took me to the doctor because they were concerned about delayed puberty and me being so small and i got some sort of injections then and i don't know if it was growth hormone i don't know if it was testosterone but almost immediately after that i started going through puberty and then my real growth spurt was after i got into college you know so um it was very unusual and i still think of myself as being little you know even though i know i'm normal size i still think of myself as being small well that's interesting that probably speaks to the psychology of our sort of formative years right right exactly but i really would be curious to know if i got growth hormone when i got those injections or not so like all good aspiring authors you somehow wind up in new york right yeah i figured that was the place to be if you were going to be a great novelist because that's where all the publishing was but the other thing that i figured was that if i'm going to write a great novel like i don't have anything but a sort of typical middle class experience because at the time i didn't realize how unusual my background was um so i went there but i decided i needed to start accumulating experiences so i started having adventures you know i would you know i would hop a train from southern california to san francisco and back i got to new york by hitchhiking to new york and later on i hitchhiked back to california again and when i was in new york i thought well where am i going to get experiences here so i ended up driving a taxi there because i thought wow this looks like you could really accumulate a lot of experiences in a hurry here which was true how long did it take you to learn the city i mean new york is in some ways a pretty straightforward city to learn because it's on a beautiful grid but you know there's some nuance to it given the one-way streets and you've got you know broadway is diagonal and so it's you know it's not a trivial city to learn especially given its size how long did it take you to be a competent cabbie um well i was pretty competent right off because of the logical structure of it but there are these parts of the city below 14th street for instance that were that were amazed and usually what i would do to hide my ignorance is i would just ask the passenger um which way would you like me to take and so then they would direct me so i never really felt like i was lost there and then of course if you got to the outer boroughs it was a whole different uh ball game but i didn't go to the outer boroughs very much and when i did i had to have help getting back because it was challenging but it was a it was a really unique experience i drove at night so i go to work about four in the afternoon and come home about you know somewhere between midnight and two a.m depending on what the fares were like and i mean i you know the experiences i had i had people who one person i remember well wanted me to stop in every bar along the street and and we did this for a while and i he said you go in the bar and he said wait for me and he come out and we go to the next one and i finally said um if you don't mind my asking because i was afraid he was gonna go into the bar and never come back and i would be you know in debt for the taxi fare oh he said oh i'm looking for my wife and when i find her i'm gonna shoot her and so that's the point at which i said okay well you can pay your fare now um so that's a type of thing that happened to me more than a few times this was what years were this these were in the mid-1970s in new york a totally different city from what it is today yes yes no in those days you could get robbed in daylight in central park and now central park is just a wonderful place to go i i it was it was in retrospect um really quite the interesting time what was that what was the dodgiest part of the city south of 96th about it was probably the extreme west side 9th and 10th because there was a lot of abandoned buildings over there the lighting wasn't good um and then uh and then of course harlem was was not a great place then and i was that's why i saw it south in 96. that was like i took that as a given yeah i figured it was but the interesting thing is a lot of cab drivers would not take fares to harlem and i would i would take somebody any place they wanted to go but i did have some dicey experiences there i have to say i never was robbed but i was the only taxi driver in this garage that i knew that was never robbed during that time so do you attribute that to pure luck or something else yeah i do the one time i was certain i was going to be robbed a police car turned a corner and pulled up behind me and couldn't get by because it was a narrow street and so the guys that i i could just tell from the vibe this is not going to be good they just paid and got out and left so that was the closest that i had although i did pick up two taxi drivers who had been robbed and their cab had been hijacked and they were on the street and they waved me down and so yeah it was a pretty adventurous time so where was it in here steve that you also began a little side hustle training animals well that was after my taxi driving years i what happened is that i moved back to portland oregon i'd uh after all of the travel that my family did we ended up in portland oregon where we kind of settled down so i'd spent my first year sort of sixth through tenth grades there i really liked it and after i got out of uh college i went to portland for a short time before i went to new york so i went back to portland and there i was taking karate and my karate teacher had some african lions at his ranch out in the country and i used to go out and and and visit him and when if he was cleaning the cages i would uh you know he'd say come on in let's talk while i'm working and so i do that and i i guess i wasn't too obviously terrified because he got an offer to use the lions in a movie in hollywood and he needed someone to help him uh drive the lions to hollywood so he asked me if i'd do that and i was i had a job as a newspaper reporter at the time so i thought well this is going to be a long weekend so i said yeah i'll help you do it and i went out to his house and i assumed there was going to be like something like a horse trailer that was modified for lions and what he said was um help me get the back seat out of the car here steve and we're going to put churza which is one of his lions in the back so we did we took out the car seat we put the lion in the back seat and we took off for la and there was nothing between no no screen no window nothing between the front and the back seat but wishing for in my york taxi with the plexiglass yeah no kidding uh well actually i wasn't worried at first because i thought it's his pet he must know what he's doing later on worried about the fact that the pet's more familiar with him than you and if no i should have been i should have been but here's the weird thing is that he was driving initially and the way he controlled this lion was with a cattle electric prod and so he handed me this prod and it was if you push the button it buzzes and he said the lion's afraid of that so if he gets restless just stick that in his face don't touch him with it just stick it in his face and buzz it and so that worked once and then uh the battery ran out and uh so uh then he's i said what am i gonna do now he goes well just hold it in his face and go with your mouth like that and i thought again i thought it's his lion he must know that his lions that stupid and it turned out his line wasn't that stupid that that worked once and then the lions started to get really quite active and then i realized my friend was scared and that's when i got scared because i thought he knows what so we ended up pulling off on a side road in the middle of the night now getting his lion out on a long leash lesion walking it down this uh this rural country road for several miles to try to get it tired out and i was driving the car so that he could be in the headlights and see where he was leading the lion and every time we would go around a corner and the lion would lose sight of the car we'd come around the corner the lion would attack the car it would jump up on the hood so i was expecting a catastrophe i thought there's going to be a farm and there's going to be a dog and the dog's going to run out and but none of that happened so we put lion in the back of the car it was tired it slept all the way until we got to the bay area when uh we had switched drivers and and suddenly the police lights came on behind me and so uh the policeman pulled pull us over and i jumped out quickly to try to pretend this was just normal but you know you know how in the middle of the night they'll shine their lights into the car ahead of them so they can see what's going on the lion is now getting up and it's pacing back and forth and i'm saying oh just bringing the lion down from disney studios in washington very routine was i speeding sorry about that and in the meantime my friend who owns the lion is in the front seat and he's trying to keep it from coming in the front seat so you can see him you know trying to hit it with his elbow and then the lion goes over and steps on the car horn and so the car horn just starts shrieking so at this point the policeman said um just get out of my jurisdiction he didn't know how to deal with it uh so we had a rather uneventful trip down to la at some point did you at least get a new battery for the taser we didn't we didn't um once we got to la we did but uh by the time it was light we were close enough that um the lion was asleep still so we ne we never did it was really pretty interesting and my intention was as soon as we delivered the lion to fly back to portland and continue on with my life but it turned out the movie producer offered me a job on the spot and uh he said we're doing this movie we're going to have 25 lions in it we need lots of lion trainers i said you don't understand i have a job as a reporter this is the first time i've ever been in close contact with the lion and frankly it scared me to death so um they said dad don't worry about that um uh he says i've got lots of professionalization you're the only one dumb enough to do this job i can't find anybody in my union willing to do this but yes carry on exactly exactly so i was still pretty dubious i have to sell you but here was the key um he said well the way you're going to start is i'm raising some lions at my house and so i'd like you to live at my house for the next few months and take care of the lions and the only people that you'll have to deal with is my wife and my daughter my wife tippy and i had this crush on this actress named tippy hedren since i'd seen her in the birds when i was a kid and as soon as he said tippy i thought gee that's a unusual name and it turns out he was married to tippy hedren so suddenly i'm thinking of going and living in a house with an actress that i had a crush on since i was 11 years old so that changed my attitude entirely so i said okay you know when do i start i mean at this point steve you have more than enough substrate to write a fantastic novel right yeah i but by that time i realized that that's not where my talent lay so i really wasn't thinking anymore of writing a novel i was trying to think i loved animals so much i thought gosh this is great i get to spend my entire day around these animals and actually for the first year i i worked there i never took a day off on saturday and sunday because i just enjoyed it so much um so i'd almost feel like i've been given this gift of of something that i was always meant to do but this by luck it just stumbled into it so what finally got you to go back to graduate school uh probably a bad encounter with the lion i was fairly significantly injured by a lion and i had to i spent a couple of weeks in the hospital and a couple of more months laid up what happened i i jumped me i lion attacked me under a very bizarre set of circumstances and there was no one around when this happened so i was completely helpless you know pinned to the ground by this line expecting that it would start eating me at any point and again it's one of these lucky things the only thing that saved me is it grabbed me and it sunk its teeth into my leg but it was getting possessive over my leg because um they get that way over food they get uh if you've ever seen a group of lions eating they'll just get their food in front of them and grab onto it very tightly and that's what it was doing and so i was just trying to stay conscious and not pass out because i thought then he's going to let go of my leg and start to eat me and the only reason i'm here today is there were some people that were driving by on the road above the compound and this was kind of a a well-known place that people could pull off the road and they could look down and they might see lions running around or or tigers where was this steve this is in acton california which is just north of los angeles out in the desert between near palmdale and so they saw me with this lion on top of me so they drove up to the front office and said there's a guy in the back with a lion on top of him we don't know if that's supposed to be that way or not uh and so they came and rescued me the the you know the other trainers that were in the office so um so i that gave me a lot of time to think about my future and i really by that time was kind of um disinterested in the hollywood part of it i still love the animals but i i really got bored with the movie aspect of it because there's a stereotype that movie people only talk about movies and making movies and movie deals and movie sequels and movie reruns and i didn't find that very interesting and so i really got bored with that part of it so i thought i've accumulated all this knowledge about animals that's applied maybe i should go to graduate school and study it in a formal sort of sense so i actually went to graduate school with the intention of studying lions in east africa and i went to east africa at that point the there was a long-running serengeti lion project that had just ended uh the people that were doing it just quit i went to graduate school my advisor did research in east africa on monkeys and he told me if you get over there you might be able to take over this project but i didn't by the time i got there someone else had come and taken it over so it didn't work out so i ended up doing a phd that was a very combining my math and my interest in animal behavior and i did a phd on sort of theoretical models of animal combat and why animals very seldom fight to the death um and under what circumstances they might do that so have nothing really to do with with lions so uh at that point i didn't really know i thought well i've got a phd i guess i should be a professor somewhere but i had no interest in aging it never even occurred to me but i did a post-doc in south america at a biological station again unrelated to aging i was studying these social birds but a friend of mine there was uh studying another group of animals but he kept catching opossums in his traps and at one point i said you know you're not able to catch the foxes that you want to you're catching the opossums you're studying the wrong thing you should be studying the opossums so he said well what what of interest could we do to the opossums and we put our ads together and came up with something it still had nothing to do with aging but in the course of that project i would capture opossums once a month and i would weigh them and measure them and look in the pouch these were all females that were radio collared and one of the things i discovered was they aged incredibly quickly you know so this is an animal the south american ones that we're studying look very much like the north american opossums most people would not be able to tell the difference um so they're about the size of a small cat and i expected they would live 10 or 20 years like cats do and here at 18 months they would get cataracts they would lose muscle they would be able to parasitize they would just look terrible even the same animal that i'd caught three months earlier and i just became incredibly intrigued with why they would age so much more quickly than it than a cat and that really started my interest in aging in fact the project that he and i were working on eventually was published in one of the most prestigious scientific journalism by the time it came out i completely lost interest i was interested in aging and i've been interested in it ever since you know so that's kind of the long story about how i got into this so where where did you when you after you finished your postdoc where did you come back to when i finished my my first faculty position was at harvard um and and it was great because that was the point where i was switching over from what i had done before which was behavioral evolution to aging and at harvard junior professors they don't care what you do really so i had some time to really gear up and switch fields it wasn't like i had to get six grants the first year or something uh and so it was great so i um i basically spent some time developing my first aging study which was a field study of opossums and these were north american opossums but i was comparing the way they aged on an island compared to the mainland and i was interested in that because there were some theories of aging that suggested that animals that had evolved in environments that were low risk and this island had no predators on it will evolve slow aging at the same time so i ended up doing this project where i had a population of opossums on the mainland another population on the island and i would track them from birth to death because one of the nice things about opossums is that because the babies are born in a pouch if you catch a mother that's got babies in the pouch pouch young you can mark them at that point and then if you later catch them you can put a radio collar on them so you know the exact birth date basically of every animal in a population fairly quickly which is pretty unusual for wild animals so that that was really how my aging career got started at harvard and uh it was a great experience i it was a wonderful place to be unfortunately my wife hated boston and so she was really wanting us to go somewhere else what did you find out about the opossums and and what explained the difference how much of a difference was there between the the groups that grew up in a low stress environment versus the high stress predatory environment there was about a 20 difference okay so pretty substantial difference and the next phase to figure this out was to try to work on the mechanism what what is it and cortisol related right exactly this was in you know this by now was in about 1990 and we didn't have genomics really that at that point if we did the first thing i would have done is sequence the genome of the opossums on the island in the mainland but the only thing i could think of to do next was to two things one i was interested in is this some genetic thing did you do a sword in other words did you take the island version and just let them breed uh or you know because one generation you'd pretty much get your answer right that's exactly right and i and i submitted a proposal to do that and it didn't get funded there was a problem i could only really do it in one direction i could take the island opossums and release them on the mainland and see how they did i didn't want to do the reverse because i thought if this is really a unique genetic population you don't want to contaminate it yeah yeah so um so i never did that it was the obvious thing to do and i thought about it but i never ended up doing it and i'm sort of disappointed what i did though is i i got um a population of opossums that i brought into the laboratory and i my plan was to start off with just some regular opossums and then once i knew how to manipulate opossums in the laboratory to go get some from the island um but opossums are really not easy to keep in the laboratory environment and my colony ended up getting some flesh eating infection and so i basically had to abandon that project i i thought um you know i thought about going back to it subsequently you know and in fact i went back to the island which is called sapolo island which is off the coast of georgia about 10 years later with the with the film crew to do a film about them and in the interim a new species had been introduced to the island um armadillos had never been there before and now they were there before so i suddenly got worried that my population of opossums had also been contaminated so that discouraged me from going back and working on the genomics of those possums so at what point did you begin to come did you start to begin to get interested in the difference between animals in the wild and animals in the lab as far as longevity differences and of course where i'm going to go with this steve is two directions just to give you a heads up obviously i want to have a really deep discussion on the largest longevity experiment ever done in animals which is the wisconsin nia experiment obviously animals in captivity and i also want to talk about the distinction between mice in the wild and mice in the lab when it comes to all of the literature on cr and dr uh right so so it's really i mean and this these are discussions you and i have had um and every time we have it it gets richer and richer so you know i guess what i'm really asking at the outset is when did this subject matter uh become of great interest to you so okay so my my background is entirely in field biology at the point when i start doing laboratory biology so i'm coming from it from a way different perspective than most people and when i started to learn about the not just the mice but the other laboratory animals and how much different they were than the same species in in the in the wild i started to get very interested in what i call laboratory evolution how have these things changed in the hundred years or so since they were brought into the laboratory because you know when i was in the field i'm always thinking about well how is evolution shaping these animals to do whatever and in the laboratory i'm thinking well the way that we breed them and the way that we inadvertently select them there's very strong evolutionary pressure on laboratory animals it's just that most people aren't aware of that so um so i started thinking well what can we learn is there anything to learn um and one of the things that right off the bat was this this dietary restriction experiment now before we even get to it steve maybe we should explain to people what a laboratory mouse looks like you know when you think about the b6 mouse which is sort of the the workhorse of so much of the research that goes into cancer biology i've had guests on this show before who have made a very compelling case that we simply should never use that mouse model for anything that comes down to cancer therapeutics because whatever you learn in it almost assuredly is not going to apply later on but notwithstanding that help help folks understand what a mouse in captivity has been through what does it mean for example to be homozygous at each loci what what is it that we're trying to accomplish and an ex what's the price we potentially pay for that yeah so so let me describe the history of the laboratory mouse so the laboratory mice came from um what were called fancy mice and these were mice that were bred for bizarre coat colors and coat textures kinky coats straight coats silver coats and people used to have mouse beauty contests just like the westminster dog show there used to be mouse equivalents and for all that there probably still are mouse equivalents so at some point research this is early in the 20th century when they just discovered the rediscovered the laws of genetics from mendel some geneticists got looking at all these bizarre coat colors and said this could be a nice model for to see if mammal rules of inheritance are the same as plant rules of inheritance so they started working with the mice for genetics and then for the for reasons of trying to understand the genetics he started inbreeding them and when i say inbreeding i'm not talking about cousin breeding i'm talking about brother sister mating and they did that for now hundreds and hundreds of generations so the mouse that we currently have in the lab the typical mice come from mice that were selected for bizarre coat colors and sizes mice that were then inbred for hundreds of generations so that they're absolutely genetically identical to one another and then over the generations of course as we're raising these mice every you know once they started being commercially valuable the companies that produced them would always the ones that left the most young were the ones that formed the next generation so you're always getting this selection for bigger and bigger litters and faster growth and more rapid reproduction so by now you have what a friend of mine calls a mouse-like object uh you know something that looks like a mouse but it is uh it's not only genetically identical to all of its uh the other ones it's now called a strain okay so b6 is a strain so now call this it's not only genetically identical but again because of the inbreeding it's it's homozygous at every locus that is it has exactly the same two genetic variants at every single place in the genome so that makes it very very different from any kind from humans certainly but from any animal in the wild and i got very interested in how does that affect all of the experiments not just in aging but in cancer in alzheimer's disease i mean we use that one mouse and i used to say to people this is like if we only tested drugs in the same set of twins time after time after time after time rather than ever going out so i agree with the people you've had on your show that said we need to really avoid this kind of reliance on such a bizarre creature you know i mean is about as bizarre of a creature from a zoological perspective as you can imagine they're twice as big as a wild moss at least twice as big they they reach sexual maturity about twice as fast that much larger litters they have a bunch of bizarre mutations and some strains um become blind in a few months of age some become deaf some if they hear a loud noise start having convulsions and and this is the fundamental basis of our biomedical research enterprise as it applies to mammals so um there's 4 500 species of mammals the fact that we've had one species and a very bizarre species at that be the substitute for all of the others including ourselves it's just a very weird approach and and to me it just shows that the culture of evolutionary biology has never really soaked in to the laboratory biology and i've kind of made it my goal to try to help with that over my career now some people of course have gone to great lengths to avoid this so i recently had rich miller on the podcast and we talked about the investigation the the intervention testing program the itp what is it that they do that raises the bar on on rigor right so so rich miller is a good friend of mine and we've done a bunch of projects together on on mice on different kinds of mice and what the what that itp does is that they create what are called genetically heterogeneous mice that is every single mouse is genetically unique um but they're all brothers and sisters they um so that you can recreate that population at any time not the specific individual but the population now the interesting thing about those mice is that their ancestors are all these inbred mice so they've been selected for strange genetic alleles that only work seemingly in when they're together with themselves so i i'm a very big fan of that mouse model i have to say because i think it's a huge step in the right direction it's sort of it's the least bad option basically yeah exactly and there's there's one kind of weakness that i'd i'd like to see them work on and maybe they will and that's this because of the breeding scheme that they use all of the mice have the same mitochondria no matter how genetically diverse they are they all have the same mitochondria and we now know that the mitochondrial genotype because it interacts so closely with the nuclear genotype can have a huge impact and in fact someone here at my university scott ballinger's created these mice that have different mitochondria in the same nuclear background and they have very different characteristics so the other thing is that because all of the current laboratory mouse came from a relatively small number of these fancy mouse ancestors they all have pretty much the same mitochondria the only differences are differences that have evolved slowly by drift over the last hundred years so for instance his my friend that's got the nuclear mitochondrial exchange mice his two mitochondria which are very different by mouse standards only differ at five individual nucleotides in the whole 16 and a half thousand nucleotide mitochondria how many genes is that again is that about 20 genes it's a yeah it's about 17 typical genes but we're finding new genes it's interesting we're finding new genes in the mitochondria so it's around 20 or 25 genes so we may be missing out on a huge amount of variability that's due to mitochondria and humans of course have incredibly variable mitochondrial genomes now is is it too late steve to to sort of say look we're going to go into the wild get a whole bunch of completely wild mice that are so genetic genetically heterogeneous and we're going to start letting them breed and we're not going to force them to be in bread we're just going to let them breed naturally is that just too expensive or like why has no one gone about you know trying to address this because it's it's such an obvious limitation right well i think one of the reasons is is the lack of genetic control that you would have in that situation there has been some attempt to do that that is the people have been working on a a diverse genetically diverse population of mice where they took a whole number of the laboratory mouse strains and mixed in a couple of recent introductions from the wild and mixed them all together to create something the problem is in talking to those people the the wild backgrounds don't seem to breed as well in captivity so gradually those genes are lost but i think there are some reasonable alternatives that are out there that are being developed and have been recently developed it's just that it's going to take a big change in the culture of the way we do laboratory medicine i think before people will accept that it probably comes back to a point you made earlier which is for many people who work in the lab using laboratory mice that's all they've known and it might not be as apparent to them um how genetically far removed they are from their predecessors whereas because you came at this from you know being a field biologist and also with a much greater lens for comparative gerontology right you're looking at this opossum and that opossum and you know these are both wild and yet they have some differences but they're not you know they're not totally different um there it may simply be a blind spot right yeah i i think it is and i think that even the best mouse is still a mouse it's still one species and it's a very different species than we are and so uh even the best mouse model is not going to be enough we need to know more about general mammalian biology if we're going to understand our own biology better well before we leave the mouse let's let's talk a little bit about clive mckay and kind of the the history of caloric restriction um i think most people today are generally well aware of the uh reported efficacy of caloric restriction in life extension there are no shortage of people that are now looking at ways to mimic caloric restriction be it pharmacologically with molecules or be it using dietary interventions that sort of act like transient periods of caloric restriction all in search of what we believe cr does but let's maybe have you explain to people what this history looks like sure well the first person to really do this in a in in a formal way was as you mentioned clive mckay who was a nutritionist at cornell at the time and he wasn't interested in aging either he was interested in growth and how to make animals grow faster because that has all kinds of agricultural implications and so in studying growth he was looking at the effect of restricting the diet on growth rate and when he did that he noticed that his animals seemed to be staying healthy longer and living longer when he fed them less and he did this in fish he did some stuff in in dogs although he didn't look all the way through their lifespan and then he finally did this ex this this experiment in rats and that in that one he'd let them live their entire lives and documented very convincingly how dietary restriction made in this case only females not males live longer and the interesting thing about mckay is that about a decade ago i was i was a visiting scholar in ithaca new york for a week and i went to the cornell libraries and i looked through all of his old papers and i don't think he ever really appreciated the significance of of what he'd done because he didn't really this was in the 1930s if i recall yeah this was in the 1930s and he was active until the 1960s but he got into producing you know high-protein bread and i'm making nutritional food for the military during world war ii and he really kind of dropped this whole thing so even though he made what in retrospect was really i think a landmark discovery i don't think he really appreciated that because he was never focused really on longevity so what are the ways in which this got um validated and repeated throughout time who was the next person to pick up that baton you know i'm i'm i'm not exactly sure who the next person was there were a whole bunch of peoples starting really after world war ii that started looking at it more closely in rats and more closely in mice and there were actually a whole bunch of people working on invertebrates that did this experiment by accident and i'm one of them actually the first paper i published on this topic was some stuff that i did during my phd so my phd was testing all these mathematical models about combat but i was testing it in a small spider and as part of that experiment i had groups of spiders that are i was feeding various amounts and i would keep them until they died but i wasn't paying any attention to that once once i discovered all of this work i went back to my data and i said well i wonder what happened when i fed him less and it turned out the less i fed him the longer they lived and so after world war ii people really started getting interested in this and there were a number of people there was mouse studies now um rat studies there was really i think the next big advance was when roy walford got into it who was very interested not just about mice age but how that might tell him something about human aging and ed masro another researcher who followed up on rats and those two i think really took it to the next jumped it to the next level which is can we understand why this is happening there was really very little investigation of that previously but walford who was an immunologist was very convinced that was doing something to the immune system and that was at the base of it and masero was didn't really have his own hypotheses but he thought that it was a great way to test hypotheses about how aging worked the other big difference between these really fascinating characters i mean walford what probably one most interesting colorful person you must have known him because he only died what maybe 20 years ago 25 years ago oh yeah in fact my first paper he published the figure out of my spider paper before it was published in a real journal because he had heard about my work and he asked that i'm writing a book can i put this figure in my book so yeah i knew roy quite well of course he's famous for the biodome right that's that was the yeah yeah um the biosphere biosphere right yeah yeah yeah yeah um and it's pretty interesting when i was writing my book on you know so the biosphere 2 was this inadvertent experiment on dietary restriction because these people were sealed in this dome and they couldn't grow as much food as they thought and roy was the was the doctor in there and so this was a great opportunity you know he wanted to know how dietary restriction worked in people and here he had uh all these people that couldn't make enough anyway um how long were they in the biosphere two years two years and when you look at pictures of him when he came out i mean he looked pretty emaciated oh he looked horrible he looked absolutely horrible in fact they have this famous picture of them all standing on the rafters in the biosphere when they went in naked and they had the same picture that roy showed at a meeting when they came out and you've seen pictures of him he looks like he just emerged from a concentration camp right yeah well i wanted to use they all look like that i wanted to use that picture before and after in my book on aging and so i asked roy about that and he said i'd love to give you that picture but everything's tied up in litigation it turned out that the people in that experiment had become enemies and everybody was suing everybody else over everything having to do with the biosphere so psychologically that wasn't such a great success people would disagree about whether it was a success scientifically or not roy thought it you know he looked at it in one way thought it proved everything that he had seen in mice was true in people other people were looking at it and say oh my gosh i don't know how you felt but you just looked terrible and then he died yeah he died young right not yeah well he wasn't that yeah i think he was 79 or something he was always he was always one of these people that if you knew his age you'd say man that guy looks 20 years younger than he is but after he came out of the biosphere he didn't look like that anymore now the other thing to be fair that happened in the biosphere is that the atmosphere got really out of whack and they ended up without realizing it they had so little oxygen they were living at the equivalent of about 17 000 feet and so yeah and they've been doing that for they didn't know how long uh eventually so they had to refresh the air in the environment and he attributed his later health problems to that not which is certainly plausible i mean we'll never know but yeah to spend some portion of two years at everest base camp if you haven't grown up there it's one thing if you're a sherpa right but it's another thing if you've spent your whole life at sea level um so going back to the sort of cr um insights which was the oh by the way sorry before i do that um what can you tell us about rats versus mice uh in terms of the uh genetic diversity and the ability to glean insights that are perhaps more or less interesting um rats are a lot different to the extent that as i say almost all the the well all of the traditional laboratory mice strains came from this small handful of weird ancestors rats have a different history they were used earlier in biomedical research actually but they've been domesticated multiple times in multiple parts of the world so if you look at all the genetic diversity and the mitochondrial diversity that you have in rats is far greater than you have in mice and so i'm actually working with some other people now trying to bring the rat back more into aging research because we discovered how to manipulate the genes of mice a lot earlier than we discovered anything else and so they kind of took over that's really why almost all the focus is now on that one species we now can do these genetic manipulations in other species just as easily and i'd like to see something like the rats for instance we're working on a rat which it um the two mitochondria we're interested in instead of different only at five of these nucleotides or dna letters differ at 100 of them so that's much more similar to the kind of genetic diversity that you find in people's mitochondrial genomes rather than rats so i'm hoping in the next few years we can really um i would like to see something like like bridge miller's uh interventions testing program in rats as well because i think i'd have a lot more confidence that something we found in mice might have relevance to people if we found the same thing in rats you know it's not the ideal comparison but considering because rats and mice are reasonably closely related they're kind of like we are to a rhesus macaque about that degree of divergence but still they're they're very they're very different we also can do a lot more sophisticated cognitive studies with rats than we can with mice they're trainable you know and so i'm hoping that over the next few years we can make an impact and bring the rats back because we might learn something differently you know right now one of the most robust findings in mice is that if you somehow disable growth hormone activity the mice stay healthy and live a lot longer there's only been one experiment doing that in rats and it came to a very different conclusion it's kind of like the two primate you know calorie restriction studies but again it's one study against the gazillion studies over here but i'd like to i'd like to really look at are we getting a biased picture of something like growth hormone because we only really know a lot about its mechanism in mice what what is your best explanation for why the rats given growth hormone uh fared better they fared worse they didn't live any longer um that was that was that was i don't know but they feared better than the mice didn't they oh so we're talking about two different things here so if you compare dozens and dozens of mouse studies and you look at how much life extension there was with dietary restriction you look at a whole bunch of rat studies you're right the effect is bigger in rats and growth hormone is suppressed by dietary restriction the experiment i was talking about was one where they had taken a natural genetic mutation that disabled growth hormone in their rats and that didn't live longer like the same natural mutations occurred in mice now why does is the effect bigger in rats than mice that's a good question i don't i don't think we know why and i also don't know how far to push that comparison because there's been a lot fewer rat studies done we've done mouse studies with a much greater diversity of mice and so if you look at the biggest effect that we've ever seen in a mouse and the biggest effect we've ever seen in a rat those are not that different so i think it's a little bit premature to conclude that dietary restriction works better in rats generally than it does in mice that may be true but um but i just don't think we know enough yet so speaking of course about big experiments with dr and cr we we have to look no further than i mean they have to be the largest experiments done the wisconsin nia experiment correct yes i mean certainly the most expensive aging experiments that have been done that haven't been done in people yeah so um gosh this experiment was probably kicked off in the late 80s yeah exactly yeah tell folks about the experimental design yeah so it was it was almost serendipitous that they they'd started at the so two groups one at the national institute of aging one at the university of wisconsin and one person rick weinrich actually was involved in both he was at the nia when that project got started then he moved to the university of wisconsin and the idea was to see whether the results that we saw in these laboratory rodents could be replicated in something that was a lot closer related to humans and also something that hadn't gone through these bizarre laboratory inbreeding selection and all that stuff closer to a real animal in other words and of course these things live up to 40 years actually many people don't know but there was another study started at the same time on squirrel monkeys because they were only supposed to live 25 years and they thought they could do that quicker but it turned out squirrel monkeys were unusual you could restrict their diet but they didn't lose weight so they ended up abandoning that study so anyway because monkeys live so long and it takes so long to see results these things went on for years and years and they would publish you know occasional studies about their blood glucose how it would affect their blood glucose their body fat and all these eventually when enough died over the next few years they came to very different conclusions now i've got a lot of friends and been involved in both of these studies and so at the risk of of irritating my friends i'll have to say that i think we learned something but we learned something very different from each of the studies so let's explain some of these differences because i do think there were some there were some interesting differences and by the way it's an interesting footnote too just by total coincidence that when the first of these papers was published in 2011 i believe it was the same day so i should say not published as in the scientific publication but on the day that the new york times ran the story of the results of the first of them which i think was wisconsin uh yeah on that same day they ran the rapamycin itp result the first rappa itp result 2009 yeah 2009 2011 you're right yeah yeah uh what's interesting is of course the the monkey study was front page news the rapper study was buried in the back uh barely barely really yeah yeah see i didn't remember that at all that's interesting yeah so so what was different yeah let's talk about what was different between these experiments yeah well first of all let's talk about wild monkeys versus laboratory monkeys so they haven't been in the laboratory long enough to really have had the kind of genetic alterations that mice have um but anna again this is this comes from i you know i had a long history with studying you know lions and tigers and other big cats and bears and elephants in captivity and then seeing them also in the wild and one of the things that we know is that virtually all captive animals are obese relative to their wild cousins kind of like us captive humans exactly exactly and one you know one of the things that i did in the in the late 80s early 90s that i did some research in papua new guinea where we're basically studying people who are still hunting you know with spears and arrows and it's very similar to wild you know primates versus captive primates so so all of why all captive animals are obese to in a degree now there are some that are just frankly obese and there are some that look okay to us because we've only seen animals like that but they still have a lot more body fat so what the wisconsin study did is they took animals the control animals that were eating at libitum so they they had food available pretty much all the time and they restricted each individual animal by 30 percent so they tracked individual animals how much does it eat over a certain amount of time and they said okay its diet for the rest of its life is going to be 30 less than that and they did that for the next 35 years and this was one-to-one randomization steve yes so just to be clear they follow all the animals get a baseline intake for them then they divide them in half randomly one group gets to continue consuming that amount or gets to continue consuming ad libitum it gets what it wants to eat add limit okay so that's an important distinction the cr group gets pegged to 70 percent of what they were eating during the run-in right okay right and so you know 35 years later they report that the animals that are eating less are living longer substantially longer and by all kinds of disease metrics are healthier so pretty much replicating the laboratory experiments now i have to say that up to this time i really hadn't thought too much about how you would translate the laboratory rodent experiments into human experiments but suddenly because i was asked to write something up on these two experiments i started thinking uh about yeah what are we i mean if you think about it a rat or a mouse spends its life in a cage that's no bigger than a jail cell usually as very little except other animals in the cage so has zero opportunity to get into for much physical activity and needless to say that because they have food available all the time because they've been selected to reproduce as much as possible they're going to get really quite big um and i think that that was a perfect replication the wisconsin study of what goes on in most laboratory rodent experiments which i think is what they'd intended i think the philosophy of the national institute of aging study was different i think they were trying to say what is the relevance for people and not for people who are sedentary and obese but for people generally so what they did differently well i'll get to the diets yeah i was going to save the diets for the end because that to me is i think let's just talk about the way they did the experiment what they did is they said we want our control animals to be at what we consider to be a healthy body weight so we're not going to feed them ad libitum we're going to feed them a couple of times a day and we're only going to feed them enough to keep them at what we think is a healthy body weight and we're going to restrict our other animals our restricted animals 30 from that so now we're talking the restricted ones are going to be much leaner than the wisconsin restricted ones and the controls are also going to be much leaner so it's a form of pear feeding but it's a it's a cr pear feed basically yeah exactly and what they really were saying is look if you take a healthy human and you restrict a healthy human what kind of effect are you likely to see so almost inadvertently because i don't really think they had this philosophical difference worked out at the time but that's really the way i think it ended up happening and in this case the animals didn't live any longer so and it was it was very clear it wasn't like well it's a little bit longer but not quite enough to be statistically significant so there's no difference whatsoever but their controls were also living longer than the wisconsin controls which again not surprising because they're kept at a healthy body weight and these others are you know gotten to be frankly obese and then we get to the difference in the diets right which is and really stop i mean that's that's not a subtle distinction no no so so the difference in the diets is is critical so if you look at the gross macronutrients the carbohydrates the the fats the protein they're not that different but here's the critical difference is that they use natural ingredients in the nia study in the wisconsin study they wanted to use what they call purified ingredients because your complete control of of the of this you know you might get a a different source of of cornmeal and it might differ slightly in nutrients but if you're just doing specific if you're just doing albumin you know you're always getting the same protein the trouble is that that wasn't a very palatable diet and to make it more palatable to do the carbohydrates they were adding sucrose and by the end of it well i think by the time they figured out the diet it was a they were 28 20 and a half percent sucrose diet in wisconsin and you know very low sucrose you know all these natural ingredients i think it was about three percent sucrose in the bethesda mice right versus as you said 28 29 sucrose there um bob kaplan did an analysis for me we write about you know we've written about this i think in a in a weekly newsletter or something but the the wisconsin monkeys were effectively eating the equivalent if they were humans they were effectively eating three big macs two large fries and two jumbo cokes a day that was the equivalent of their diet um and then you were so you were basically getting a control animal that's eating like three big macs two monster fries and two jumbo cokes a day and then the controls were getting or sorry the cr group was getting 70 percent of that in bethesda it was basically like a whole foods pescetarian diet right with three percent sugar in it um right and you know it's a bit of a shame because it doesn't allow us in my opinion to appreciate the effect of the weight difference because as you said the controls in each group there's no comparison right the the control group in bethesda was the longest lived animal but pardon me the cr group in bethesda and the control group were the longest lived animals and they actually lived longer than the cr groups in wisconsin yeah yeah i mean this isn't this isn't a surprise when i said they started off with these squirrel monkeys as well one of the reasons they abandoned that was they soon realized the squirrel monkeys were living longer than any squirrel monkeys that ever been reported to live before as well and now their rhesus macaques have been reported to live longer than any macaques had been before it's interesting because as as often happens in science of two groups do what seems to be the same experiment although with i agree with you this wasn't really the same experiment but if they seem to do what's superficially the same experiment they come to different conclusions they're not happy about it and so in one of the attempts to reconcile the data they looked at the weights of the control animals in wisconsin versus bethesda but compared to all of the rhesus monkeys in the country and all of the research facilities in the country and the wisconsin ones were about 10 percent heavier and the controls now and the bethesda ones were about 10 lighter so um you know like i say i think they're telling us something differently someone might want to know if instead of eating two big macs and two helpings of fries and two giant cokes a day what if i only ate 70 percent of that would i be healthier then you as a physician will probably say yeah yeah eating really toxic food is good for you that's exactly my conclusion from that study is in a still somewhat contrived way i think what we learned is the worse the diet the more beneficial the caloric restriction the better the diet the less of an impact caloric restriction has and what that says to me is dietary restriction might be as important if not more important than caloric restriction by dietary restriction i mean manipulating or reducing components of the macro or micronutrient and in this case the sucrose was head and shoulders i mean to me this was basically an experiment demonstrating the harm of sucrose yeah yeah because if you looked at uh what they call uh glucoregulatory problems in the controls they were massive and there were zero of those in the restricted animals and i'm glad you brought that up because it reminds me the control animals in bethesda i.e the fully fed animals in bethesda had less diabetes than the calorie-restricted animals in wisconsin i don't know that that's correct i don't i don't remember wisconsin reporting any no i think it was i think i think it was i i think this was an after publication oh i'm pretty sure yeah okay we'll confirm that for the show notes but i think this is something that came out much later but i actually think that the that the group eating 70 percent of the high sugar diet had had a higher incidence of diabetes than the control in bethesda which again just speaks to dramatic differences in um what you're feeding yeah and and i have to say i don't think we've ever really gone back and worked out the best diets for mice or rats i think there's a lot still to be done in those you know we most of those standards were really just developed for keeping them healthy so they could breed and i think that if we really wanted to understand more about nutrition in those animals we'd have to go back and do that with modern techniques if we really wanted to understand nutrition of rats and mice i don't think we understand it very well and there's no way to really study monkeys in captivity without limiting their exercise right i mean there's there's is it is it possible it well i i think it is i mean it's it's possible i think there are two problems one is that because you need to control the diet the animals were kept individually housed and this is a very social species just like we are right and so cognitively psychologically these had to be extremely unusual animals on top of that because of the size of the cages that they had yeah there was virtually no opportunity for physical activity that's very similar to the rat and mouse studies right but i think for primates it's probably worse i think it's yeah i think it's much worse cognitively i'd have to think it's terrible um i mean they were in a room where they could see each other they could hear each other they could smell each other but they couldn't touch each other and i i think if so they didn't even get to mingle outside of feeding times no no why probably had to do with the with the with captive setup that they had in those two places it's not easy to get strange monkeys to interact with one another you might end up with a lot of fighting and at least one of the other differences between the two studies was the wisconsin animals were all monkeys from india that were born in captivity and so they knew the precise age in the bethesda study they they sort of added animals of different ages as they got them some of them came from the wild and some of them they kind of guessed the age at the start and some of them came from china so there's some genetic differences as well so um so yeah your your basic conclusion that nutrients seem to count i think is is very valid and i think that i think it's also something you know i always say that humans are the worst animal to study that you could imagine because they don't do what you tell them to do you know and they'll lie about what they do but on the other hand there's certain kinds of studies that i think you have to do in humans and i think that the idea that the nutrition that works best for a mouse even if we knew what it was might not tell us anything i mean mouse my seat seeds in insect larvae in the in the wild and we're very different so i think for these kinds of nutritional studies i think you really do have to study humans because humans have their own unique characteristics which is a point i'm going to absolutely want to bring us back to as we look to one of the great challenges of studying humans is not only the time scale and the difficulty with interventions but frankly the lack of biomarkers that could really help us assess gero protection right but i want to go back to kind of what you think would happen to animals calorically calorically restricted in the wild do you think that if we could and imagine this is a thought experiment although i believe this experiment has also been done in some form or another where you calorie restrict wild mice what do we know about that yeah so i actually did an experiment like this so i didn't calorie restrict wild mice in the wild like calorie restricted wild mice in the lab yeah so i brought them into the lab because one of the ideas that i had which turned out not to be correct was that we have select well partially correct we have selected these animals to grow as fast and reproduce as fast as possible so we may have created gluttonous mice just by laboratory selection over dozens and dozens of generations mice after my own heart basically [Laughter] so wild mice of course don't have that so i went out and i caught a bunch of wild mice and i brought them into the lab and i let them have babies for a couple of generations to get rid of all the contaminants of being in the wild and then i restricted their diet and what i found was that um there was no difference whatsoever in how long they lived now i have to say i'm watching the animals die and they're right on top of one another almost and i'm just ready to say there's no way that dietary restriction works in in wild mice but then the last few the last 20 percent lived longer the restricted ones were living longer and longer and longer so all of the longest lived ones were in the restricted group so what i concluded from that is that these are wild animals they're genetically diverse so i thought well maybe because the other part of this i didn't imagine is very early on when i restricted them a number of the restricted ones died early in the experiment so i thought maybe depending on your genes dietary restriction be good for you can have very little impact on your health it can be bad for you um the ones that died early steve what did you when you examined them after death what were you seeing you know i don't think that we did enough necropsies on the early ones that died to know that it's not very easy to to get good necropsy material on mice because their bodies cool off so quickly and their tissues start to degenerate so quickly so almost all of what we know about mice pathology is from mice that were euthanized and i don't think we euthanized any because we didn't expect them to die when they were young like that right so um maybe they had some nutritional requirement that we weren't meeting like i say we were using standard laboratory chao and that's you know we don't really know how good that was i mean standard mouse child is total garbage that's probably a good a good a good reason to be concerned um at the at the upper end steve did you see a red i mean i guess if you didn't euthanize them you wouldn't know but you you'd expect to see cancer being the biggest difference although do wildlife suffer cancer to a fraction of the extent that uh inbred mice do they do to a fraction but they don't yeah we did for the ones that lived longer most of those we were watching much more carefully because they were getting to the point where we were expecting them to die so we have quite a bit we probably have necropsies on about at least 20 mice in each group and yeah they still get mice they still got a lot of cancer because let's face it mice in the laboratory live on average about two and a half years and the longest live ones live about three years in the wild they live on average about three or four months and longest live ones live maybe a year or a little longer so we're talking about incredibly long live mice so yes about half of them had cancer when they died i don't know if that's what killed them but they had cancer when they didn't but if you bring up if you bring lower it's a lot lower than lab mass yeah if you bring wild mice into the lab how long do they live when you take away their predators and you insure them food they live they live a little bit longer than uh than your laboratory mice maybe 20 percent longer okay so they are a healthier mouse they're pretty healthy despite despite not being bred for being well i mean there if i gave a handful of these mice to people that were only familiar with laboratory mice they wouldn't have any idea they're looking at the same species first of all they bite secondly they can jump you know when we change mice from cage to cage we set the cage down we take the top off we pick the mice up we put them in the new cage you take my wild mice you take the top off and you got popcorn you know they're they're all over the place and there's a common test that we do in laboratory mice for sort of coordination and balance which is called a rotor rod which is kind of like log rolling for mice right and the idea is that this is probably 18 inches off the ground so they're afraid to fall so they'll sit there and try to stay on the circulating rod try that on on a wild moss and just immediately leap off the thing and leap off your desk and leap onto the floor and they're gone there's another one that we call called the raw the the wire hang which is just what it sounds take mice and you hang them from a wire like they're dangling a push-up and you see how long can they stay before they fall out it's like kind of a grip strength test yeah yeah and uh you do this to a wild mouse and it doesn't pull up it pulls itself up onto the wire and it runs off the wire and that's the end of your test so when i say there's no comparison between them i'm really meaning that you could take the most sedentary overweight person you could imagine and say okay i'm going to compare you to this trained athlete that you know and that's the kind of comparison you get cognitively it would be really interesting to see as well the trouble is wild mice are not used to being around people so you know they're freaked out when you touch them and so you can't do the same kinds of cognitive tests which is unfortunate um but but on the other hand this is what you have with the the other thing is um if a domestic mouse um wants to get away from you it jumps back in his cage and sits there you know if wild mice wants to get away from you bites you and then it jumps off the table and onto the floor and it's gone so if you if you had to do the thought experiment which is you're going to take a group of wild mice in their environment remove the predators so assume that they can live a little bit longer one group gets a hundred percent of their necessary nutrition the other group gets 70 percent of that do you believe that the cr group would live longer no no i don't do you think they would live shorter quite possibly i think probably yes and and i'll tell you why so this experiment has not been done because it's it it's hard to do but the reverse has been done so there's been a lot of studies where people have supplemented the food of animals in the wild so they don't have to go out and forage as much because i'm going to give them as much as they need to eat every day so you would expect okay now i'm going to get obese mice that are going to be short-lived but that's not what you get you get mice that live longer and they live longer because they're foraging less they're exposing themselves to less predation the reason i think that if you restricted animals in the wild they would live shorter is that the first thing is they would have to forage longer they would have to take chances to go after food they don't normally go after they would possibly eat things that they normally don't eat that might be toxic so my thought experiment is that the animals if you did this in the wild if you could somehow control the available food for them that they would be shorter lived the other thing is that there's a couple of things that calorie restriction does that don't seem compatible with the long life in the wild one of these is that it slows wound healing the other thing is that it makes animals more susceptible to certain kinds of pathogens and those two things in the laboratory are not a big deal because they don't get wounded and we spend a great deal of time and effort to keep pathogens out of the colonies but in the wild those are very important causes of pathology and things that you need to work well so that would be my guess is that they would probably be shorter lived are there any other studies in the animal literature that you think can shed light on this very important question as it pertains to an extrapolation into humans um well i mean there's there's there's there's a human studies yeah of course before we get the calorie and cronies and stuff like that um no i don't think so i mean you know when i first came into this and people told me about this phenomenon the first question i asked well if this is so healthy why do animals in the wild not eat less and of course the answer is that the animals that have the genes that have survived for millions of generations out there are the animals are the best at reproducing right they're not optimizing they're not optimizing for the longest life they're optimizing for the most reproduction that's right and so i said well of course so they probably eat more than is perfectly healthy because that helps them reproduce faster it it made perfect sense and so i don't find it particularly surprising that uh you get this kind of health because that's you know that's that's not what nature has designed any of us to live as long as possible you know it's kind of up to us to figure out how to stay healthy long nature was nature was fine with us when we were living you know 35 years yeah so i know i can't think of any other experiments that i would there yeah there's one experiment that was done that where they took mice that had been genetically altered so that they lived longer in the laboratory and they put those in a field exclosure with some normal mice and just came back 18 months later and the ones that lived longer in the lab were shorter live they were almost all gone in in the real world so um there's a slight complication to that experiment which is a follow-up experiment showed that well that same mutation they don't necessarily live longer in the lab it was one of these you know unfortunate false results that couldn't be replicated but you know that's the way science works sometimes you know so um let's turn to the human studies then which obviously don't have the luxury of the same duration uh relative to the lifespan of the animal but uh what what have we what have we learned there right so there's uh i think you have four human studies that uh five if maybe so the first one i think was was the biosphere 2 study but we don't know much about what happened most of the people in that study were pretty young roy was a real outlier roy walford was i think 66 at the start of that experiment 68 when he when he came out but certainly from their blood analysis they had very good cardiovascular risk factors their blood pressure was extremely low their blood glucose was extremely of course those were all exceptionally healthy people when they went in so this was not a random group the calorie studies are the two best controlled studies in humans and there was two of them um there was one that was very short term six months and then there was another was slightly longer term which was two years how many institutions were a part of these two studies three institutions pennington pennington uh washington university and then tufts and tufts didn't publish anything out of the first phase of the study i don't believe but in the second one they did so to me i'll just give you my bottom line on those studies is that people can't do calorie restriction in that traditional sense i mean in in all cases the goal was to reduce calorie intake or energy imbalance by about 25 and they never came anywhere close to actually getting that um in the longer study i think ultimately the amount of restriction was about 11 to 12 percent that people were able to achieve over two years um because these people were in charge of their own nutrition it's not like right the study could afford to actually give everybody all of their food every single day which would at least give you some hope of doing that if participants could limit themselves to eating the provided food yeah as i recall i think they the they provided meals initially for a short term but they didn't monitor whether the people wouldn't ate anything else as well and then they were on their own right and so it's quite clear that people can't normal people you know there are people that can but certainly your average person cannot so and none of those did they achieve anywhere close to the dietary restriction they had hoped to do so what did they find with what they did achieve cardiovascular risk factors all improved certainly you know blood pressure was better lower insulin lower glucose but there were some things lower bone mineral density as well so it's it's a mixed bag and the main thing is if you look at a dietary restricted mouse it's got almost no body fat these both both of these experiments the thing we struggle with is that most people are overweight or obese in the u.s where these were both done right so your control group is not going to be like the bethesda uh monkeys that so what that means is if they can only achieve 10 dietary restriction you're going to get people that are on the verge of being overweight or obese and getting them down to a healthy body weight and i don't think it's surprised anybody that that's good for your health and and that's pretty much what they found they never got people to that extreme leanness that roy walford and the people in the biosphere had or that the subsequent the cronies have so i think you could generally say from the calorie studies that yes reducing your food intake had lots of benefits had some possible negative effects in terms of bone mineral density had some negative effects in strength loss although not if corrected for body weight but yeah generally beneficial but again take somebody that's on borderline overweight reduce them to a healthy body weight i don't think any physician wouldn't have to be a specialist like yourself any physician i think would say yeah okay where's the news so that's what i take away from from that now the other study is the study of the cronies and these are people that belong to a society called the calorie restriction society that have taken the rodent work and assumed that is going to make us healthy longer and they really have restricted themselves like the we really do to mice and they also have good very good cardiovascular risk factors less inflammation they're probably going to dislike get less cancer but they have low bone mineral density negligible sex hormones you know a whole suite of things no muscle mass to speak of i've i've spoken at a couple of their conferences and they're always exhorting one another to exercise more because they have trouble with this degree of restriction keeping any muscle mass at all but it's a struggle because they don't really have the they don't have the energy yeah yeah yeah so um so then these people typically have what how much of a bmi steve these are people that are 17 18 bmi at this point yes i'd say 17 to 20. yeah the interesting thing is in that society if you look around the room i would say probably 30 percent of the people are actually doing it like that the others are maybe aspiring to do it but not quite making it they look more like an average person would look but yeah that that's that's the problem and i'm not sure now that all these other diets are starting to come out how many people are still sticking with that because i haven't i've kind of lost track over the last few years of what's going on with those people the other thing is they're all they have very low thyroid hormone so they're they're cold all the time so one of the things i noticed at a comfortable room everybody would be wearing a jacket that was really bmi of 18 or so and we don't actually know the impact of this on long-term cognition do we i think the on cardiovascular and cancer it's pretty clear that they will have a benefit not clear with respect to dementia not clear with respect to immune function and certainly not clear with respect to the diseases of frailty in fact i should say it is clear with respect to the diseases of frailty they're much much more susceptible yeah i i think that's true the the cognitive part i mean in the calorie study they did a little bit of cognitive research but again i you know these were people that weren't being restricted to to the same extent and you know the people in that society are very eager to be studied the problem is this is an uncontrolled experiment yeah my guess is before they started the calorie restriction they were not your average person this is the self-habits yeah this is the poster child example for healthy user bias and epidemiology we can learn virtually nothing from that without randomization and in terms of the immune system though i will have to say that i i did ask a lot of people at the at the conference do you get often do you get colds or the flu and they say they don't and i tend to believe them because i've never met a group of people that are fanatically attentive to their own health like if i said what's your bmi they could tell me to three decimal points and and then and then say well do you mean in the morning or in the afternoon you know so when they tell me they haven't gotten a cold in five years i believe them sure fair enough um i mean this highlights an important point right which is one it's a very very very rare subset of the population that is going to be able to adhere to 30 caloric restriction every minute of every day and i would argue that even if you could the quality of life might be not justified the trade-off isn't there a joke that says caloric restriction will lengthen your life and it will feel like it or something to that like the the yeah yeah what is it but but i think you know for these people i don't think they perceive it as i don't i don't think they they miss it no no no my point is you couldn't extend they are the subset who can do that yeah to try to make that the solution for the rest of us who are interested in some form of jiro protection uh yeah it's a non-starter right yeah sort of con you know constant caloric restriction isn't the answer right so we now look to other things and you've maybe heard me talk about this but i kind of have this framework right that says on the one hand we have this thing called the standard american diet which is sort of the cesspool of nutrition we all live in um so that's that's the environment where food is infinitely abundant infinitely cheap infinitely palatable uh and and infinitely transportable so meaning it's so processed that you can actually take it with you anywhere right um and it's hard to escape the gravitational pull of that so we're all sort of in this orbit around the standard american diet and there's basically a handful of ways out so i think one one avenue out of that is time restricted feeding where you start to say well look i'm not going to restrict what i'm eating i'm not going to engage in any form of dietary restriction i'm just going to limit the window in which i expose myself to this toxicity so i'll not eat for 16 hours but i will eat for eight hours and you can obviously make that window narrow and narrow and then there's the uh then there's what i call dietary restriction you and i use these terms a little differently although i know what you're meaning when you say it when i refer to dietary restriction i mean no attempt at reducing the content but rather changing the mixture or quality so dietary restriction which is probably what most people think of when they think of a diet like a paleo diet a vegan diet a keto diet a low carb diet they're not explicitly telling you to eat less they're just telling you to not eat in certain things and so those two become i think the mainstay of how most people are trying to escape the gravitational pull of the standard american diet and then you can actually talk about intermittent forms of fasting and that can be complete such as hey i'm not going to eat anything i'm just going to have water for three days every month or every quarter and they can be partial sort of like the fast mimicking diet where for five days you consume you know 750 calories when you think about that entire landscape where do you think we have the best insight about the health benefits well first of all these are all pretty new ideas and i don't think they've had a lot of empirical testing at this point and the empirical and testing that they have had has mostly been in people that already had some health issues that were diabetic or pre-diabetic or something like that however the logic of it is pretty compelling and this is something this is something we have learned from the mice you know from the mice we've in the rapamycin studies we look we've learned how suppressing this gene called mtor can have multiple health benefits and now we know that it doesn't take that much fasting to also suppress mtor so we now kind of have an idea so you know one of the things we should probably mention is that the people that were studying mice and rats you know years later started noticing well wait a second and i noticed this when we go to feed these animals they're right there they're doing pull-ups on the cage waiting for you to get the food and you know literally within half an hour all their food is gone and what we never really thought about until recently is wait a second maybe it's the timing that's the important thing the fact that they're fasting for 23 hours a day or 23 and a half hours a day maybe that more than the total consumption or as much as the total consumption is doing it and now we kind of have a molecular mechanism for understanding how a period of fasting might have benefits it might have short-term benefits i mean i think that's one of the really interesting things is that these short term fasts whether they're in mice or or or humans seem to have multiple benefits i mean one of the i think one of the most groundbreaking studies was by jay mitchell um unfortunately he just passed away a year i mean yeah yeah terrible terrible um bicycle but he showed that if you fasted a mouse for two or three days they recovered from surgery so much faster well well actually steve i mean we should double click on that a little bit because it's not just that they recovered from surgery they recovered from a lethal injury right there's one experiment where i think if i if i'm thinking of the right experiment they took a group of mice that were constitutively calorically restricted their entire lives they took another group that were fed ad-lib their whole lives and then they took another group they were ad-lib fed but i think three days prior to the surgery were severely calorically so so each of them then had the same procedure which was a laparotomy with a ligation of the femoral arteries for a period of time and then a reperfusion so what you know for the folks listening what that means is you clamp off all the blood supply to the lower part of the leg and then you know basically just before the animal's about to die you let it you let the blood flow again but because of all of the ischemic damage to the tissue all the tissue damage due to no oxygen you create such an injury to the animal that i believe all of the ad-lib animals died from that but yet the two groups that were calorically restricted won its entire life and one just for three days survived suggesting that just that period of caloric restriction could produce a similar benefit now i could be a little wrong on the numbers but that was sort of the gist of my memory is that correct yeah well what he did the it actually cut off blood supply of the kidneys and he also had another yeah another one that they did the liver same result though and you're exactly right they did these ones that have been calorically restricted their whole lives the ones that have been that were ad-libbed and then the ones that have been fasted for they did some that have been fast uh restricted for a few weeks and then some that have been just fasted water only fast for a day two or three days for two or three days that's a big fast it is a big fast that's absolutely right and they did much better you're right i don't remember if all of the controls died but if not almost all of them did and and and the ones that were restricted lifetime or for two or three days i think none of them died so you're right it's yeah when i said a surgery i guess i was thinking about it from a mouseologist's standpoint where a lot of our surgeries don't turn out so well but yeah this this wasn't a minor uh surgery that you expected everybody to agree with this wasn't a little bit really we're expecting most of the mice were gonna die and they and they did so yeah i mean i that that kind of i think it changed my thinking entirely about about dietary restriction and you're right we use these in different terms initially was called dietary restriction because they just restricted the amount of diet but then after they decided it was calories that counted then they started being called calorie restriction and now probably not exactly calories so i don't know food restriction maybe we should call what they do to them to the mice at this point well what's your take on the role of the macronutrients here and i'll pause it's two candidates to consider the first being a subset of amino acids whether it be methionine tryptophan um leucine would be candidates to consider uh and then other things such as sugar again the the the wisconsin half of the monkey experiment certainly suggested that a reduction in sucrose perhaps independent of calories could have played a role but it's difficult because we can't disentangle it from the weight loss and other things but what do we know about amino acids and their role we certainly know that mtor which you brought up a moment ago is an amino acid sensor uh so how do you think that fits in independent of calories perhaps yeah i well i think we need to work that out uh you know because there are these diets around and there are diets that say oh what you want to do is you want to eat as many carbs as you can and as little protein and fat as you can and there are others that you know say the opposite and i i don't think that i don't think the animal work is going to tell us a lot about that i think we have to we have to try to figure out how to do the experiments in people we have to do it in healthy people because i think if we want to make sick people less sick that's great we should be doing that but a lot of people that are healthy want to know how to stay healthy and i think that we can't do these things long term because what if you're in one that's turning out to be really bad for your health what we need is we need some biomarkers which you you mentioned before we need something so we can do an experiment of a few weeks or a few months and have the answer long term and we need to do it in people of different ages as well you know that the thing that we didn't talk about the calorie studies so those were done on people who are basically in their late 30s and what's good for them is not necessarily good for what people in their 60s might want to do you know one of the things i think that the interventions testing program has demonstrated that's shocking is how late in life you can start some kind of intervention and still have a dramatic improvement in health and that to me has really major implications for people right just because you're 50 years old and you've never done any exercise and you've eaten a terrible diet doesn't mean you can't improve your health a lot so because i think a lot of people feel that i've done this my whole life so what's the point in in doing it now um you know i'm curious for for you you know i get to ask you a question occasionally here what is the average age of people that come to your clinic are there people in their thirties or forties or seventies or eight i think the median age in our practice is high thirties yeah would be median and mean is probably a little bit higher but right range is 29 to 79 29 to 82 maybe is the range right so that makes sense so that's about the time in life where people start realizing they may not live forever right and uh and and start making some changes potentially and the way they live their life you know i have a dramatic memory of when i first detected aging in myself what was that and that was that was i probably was 30 to 32 maybe but it was during a basketball game and i was always the quickest person on the floor and i was used to blowing by people and suddenly this person blew by me who was much bigger than me and i was just if anybody was going to be as quick as me it was going to be somebody as small as me and i thought gosh that had to be an accident you know and then he did it again you know and then he did it again and i realized i lost the step this is what they mean by aging i have lost the step there's you know and if you're a professional athlete of course you're tested much more often and you probably notice this much earlier than i did in a casual neighborhood basketball game but it was it was a shocking moment to me because before then never entered my mind that my body was going to change in a way that would make it less good at things it used to do well speaking of human longevity steve what do you think is the best explanation for the sex difference between men and women um in the united states today and much of the developed world it probably accounts for about two years of difference doesn't it more like five is it that much wow yeah okay what's our best attribution well it's a really interesting problem and and and and let's sort of uh talk about i think some myths about that difference it's not that women survive better in old an old age they do but they also survive better when they're infants and they also survive better when they're in their 20s and in their 30s and their 40s so they survive better at every age and they survive better when times are good and during epidemics and during famines and so there's something about their biology that allows them to survive better and it doesn't seem to depend on conditions that's very different from a lot of animals where it depends on the diet it depends on the circumstances we don't know any circumstances in which men survive uh better than than than women even prematurely born infants being a male infant is a risk factor for dying if you're a preemie so there's some robust feature of human biology at play here and unfortunately we don't really know what it is we don't know is it sex hormones is it something that happens before birth that we can't do anything about later there's there's a little bit of weak but um i think maybe uh provocative evidence there's at least two studies showing a major increase in longevity for men who were castrated for one reason or another is that relevant these were unique populations and maybe that has no relevance whatsoever but that would kind of put the onus on sex hormone right on the other hand there's the hormone replacement you know work in human females which suggests that well maybe replacing those hormones isn't such a great idea so i don't think we know so i'll tell you the three i think we now don't find that to be the case right i mean i think the i think basically every conclusion of the original women's health initiative has been turned over right no i don't i would say that's that's that's not the case but the but the the the key factor for the women's health initiatives is the women didn't start doing it until 10 years after menopause on average and so there have been shorter term for women that start replacement therapy earlier and then stop it that there may be this window in which it's benefit but of course it depends on your family history yeah but my point is there was no there was no increase in mortality i think if you really scrutinize the whi data correctly even the the the most headline grabbing um finding which was that the women in the progesterone and conjugated equine estrogen group had a greater 25 percent greater risk of breast cancer i mean i think we now understand that that was a very misleading finding um yeah i mean there were several things that they they were much more they're more likely to have a stroke but you're right the overall mortality rate at the time that they stopped the study because of the blood clots and the strokes and there was no difference you're absolutely right about that there was no difference in mortality and you could have made the case that they shouldn't have stopped it at that point but um and it's interesting on the on the castrated study uh um on the castrated literature you know the obvious can one you know the first or occam's razor view of that would be well there's something about testosterone right and because that's it's not so much that the men who are castrated are getting estrogen and progesterone if you castrate them they're actually going to have no estradiol versus the estradiol they would have if they could keep their testosterone um but of course that kind of flies in the face of the testosterone replacement data which say well actually it doesn't seem to impact mortality either way at least outside of two or three years but then that comes to a point you made earlier maybe it's something that happens early in life with high exposure and yeah i mean to me the telling data points are that the women survive better from ages zero to five you know that suggests to me that there's something already in place and it probably may not have anything to do i mean let me point out the two testosterone studies are are are very weak they were not done with this in mind they were done post hoc yeah there's a lot of complications so i don't put a great deal of stock in those it's just provocative and also the i mean the difference in longevity was something like 20 years and both of them so it wasn't a trivial difference but i uh i can certainly understand why men would have a lower all-cause mortality or higher all-cause mortality when you factor in a couple of things one is behaviors i mean you know if i compare my sons to my daughter it's it's literally like they wake up every day trying to figure out how to hurt each other and hurt themselves it's it's and that i mean i'm actually very fascinated by that steve because i don't understand where that is in their genes um like you would think well that has to be sex linked right but right you know when you look at men who are double wise so you know there are some men who don't get an x chromosome they get two y's they turn out to be no more aggressive than a standard x y so it's not something as just as simple as like well that y chromosome has it's going to be a little bit more nuanced than that but so like you know and i think about the dumb things i did growing up like i there were literally times i was engaging in such stupid behavior like into my late teens that it's a miracle i'm sitting here at least when you almost died well i guess we could argue that was kind of maybe not the wisest behavior but um oh you don't have any clue as to what the really dumbest stuff that i did we used to i used to be in a group of friends hunted with bows and arrows rabbits when i lived in florida and we would take our bows and arrows and go into a vacant lot in the middle of the night when it was dark and shoot them straight up in the air and then stand around to see where they would come down so they could have come down straight through the top of our heads and you look back and you go yeah what was going on it's a miracle i call this yeah i say that i call this testosterone dementia and i think probably most men go through it at some point you know in their probably in their adolescent years right yeah when i was in when i was in high school one of the things we used to do there's this huge train in toronto called the go train and it was the above ground transit train and we used to play this game as soon as you got off it you would dive underneath it and see who could lay the most coins on the track and then get out such that when it started rolling you'd get whoever had the most flattened coins would win can you believe that for a moment like it's just hard to believe that that a subset of our species could be so stupid to do something like that yeah we would also shoot arrows at one another on purpose and dodge them and that ended because i was the first one that didn't dodge well enough when i got an arrow stuck in my leg at which point our parents investigated what we've been up to and that was the end of that yeah and like do you think in the history of the how many billion people have lived like eight billion yeah well there's almost eight billion alive okay so there's probably about eight hundred million yeah yeah so so when you think of all the people that have lived half of them being women do you think there is one example of a woman doing something so stupid i don't know i can't i can't remember i can't imagine yeah yeah but that's not all of it right that doesn't explain the infant mortality in the nicu right well right and it doesn't explain uh it doesn't explain the lower influenza deaths it doesn't explain the lower i mean covid was you know if you if you look at the covet so women are dying about 45 men about 55 percent that that's pretty much what it looks like for the flu and i mean you if you look at all the major causes of death women die at a lower rate even if you adjust for age so you take age out of the equation than men for all of them with the exception of alzheimer's disease that's right which is is really interesting to me and it makes me actually my private hypothesis that i don't think i've ever said publicly before is i think alzheimer's disease is going to turn out to have an autoimmune component because that's the kind of thing that women seem to be more prone to than men is some of the autoimmune diseases so i mean there's a couple there's a few possibilities here there's one idea that it has to do with the fact that women have a redundant set of genes on their ex their second x chromosome right so if they have a defective gene or genes on one of the x chromosomes the other one can compensate for it to a certain extent if that's true i don't know if we have enough men with klein felters out there but we that would be an interesting comparative analysis right just for folks listening men with klinefelters instead of having xy have xxy so they would also have that same redundancy of genes right but some some of those redundancies might might be bad because klein felder's don't those people don't live long for certain i don't know how short live they might be but they're not long i didn't realize their lifespan i mean they certainly have a unique phenotype but i didn't realize they lived shorter yes certainly yeah um but that's interesting because women with turner's right which is x which is a aneuploidy of x only one x they definitely live shorter don't they right right so that's one idea and a little bit of support for it is if you look at so one of the x chromosomes typically gets inactivated in each cell and it tends to be random as people get older as women get older there tends to be a bias in one or the other x chromosome so one is inactivated more than the other early in life seems to be random half of the cells your paternal x is inactivated half of it it's your maternal ex but over time you get a kind of a selection for one or the other maybe that might be it the other thing is that there might be an issue of compatibility of the mitochondrial genome and the nuclear genome because mitochondrial genomes only get passed from female to female through generations right so you'd expect there would be a lot of selection for excellent compatibility now the mitochondria that end up in males are at a dead end so they don't you know it may be that the male nuclear genome is just not as compatible with the mitochondrial genome as the phenyl genome so that's the other possibility that i find kind of i find both of those really interesting and what we really need to know about is we need to know a lot more about this in x in activation because it's not total not every gene on the second x isn't activated only some of them but the other thing is the y chromosome is this got to be the first time in the history of medicine that men get less attention for anything than women but we've always assumed the y chromosome is about about sexual characteristics but we now know there are at least nine genes on the y chromosome that are expressed in every tissue we have no idea what they're doing in all those tissues but maybe they're doing something that's not so good for us in some of those tissues i find both of those ideas steve incredibly fascinating i'd never i'd never thought of either the mitochondrial incompatibility is a brilliant one i'll have to think for a moment about how what experiments one could do to test that but on the other one on the um on the dominant x it would be interesting to follow women and identify ones who partition more into a dominant maternal x and then a dominant paternal x in the women who have a dominant paternal x presumably that x is better than the other x and then i would like to see if there's a difference in the longevity of that father versus and it's not a random experiment so it sort of sucks but is that a better surviving male than another male that's otherwise comparable that's one way i would try to get at that yeah yeah i mean i think this is a really intriguing area of research and something that we could do now that we couldn't do a long time ago that the limitation of course because it's humans is that we're kind of stuck with doing that in blood and we don't know if the same thing might be going on in the brain or the liver although again i guess from autopsy studies we could probably figure that out now but we do have the tools now to do a lot of this we could do muscle biopsies is it the same in the blood and the muscle that's a possibility um so you know my feeling is that we have yet to really explore these sex differences in any depth and that we may end up having somewhat different therapeutics in women and men once we start looking into exactly how these things work out between the sexes now the itp very consistently even you know whether you talk about its home run drugs like rapamycin and other drugs like recently 17 alpha estradiol [Music] they they disproportionately favor the male mice over the female mice do you believe that that is simply the result of the fact that they're they have more they have a higher bar to clear with the females possibly because in the itp the female mice live longer so it's a longer life sex that's having no effect and shorter life sex is having the bigger effect a really interesting one is rapamycin because you know in rapamycin the sex bias is very in in longevity at least it's very dose dependent at the lowest dose they've done the females live substantially longer than the or put it this way the effect is substantially bigger in females than males and that difference gradually goes away as you get it to a higher and higher dose and in the highest dose that anybody has used which is not in the itp but um in another study males had a big effect and females had no effect so the idea is maybe you've overdosed the females at that stage now do you recall that in the itp the females had a much higher plasma level than the males despite consuming the same amount and i i don't remember if rich had an explanation for why that was the case do you no no i don't think that i don't think they have an explanation um but that could that could explain the difference right it could be that it wasn't it wasn't that at a lower dose females are living longer because it's a lower dose it's because they have a higher plasma concentration and maybe that's the gap that vanishes at a high enough dose i don't know because i don't know what the kinetics were in the other study and what they've published it wasn't related to blood levels of of rapamycin or metabolites there was some something else is going on um but you know those things get metabolized very quickly and there's lots of downstream things that could be but but again i think that mice are particularly bad place to look for these sex differences and that's because as i said in the itp the mice the females live longer but if you look at all the my studies together there's my studies in which males live longer mouse studies in which there's no difference mouse studies which females live longer and they're all over the place and it's not a genotype thing because i i once looked at 30 black six mouse studies and you found the same range from males living 25 percent longer to females living 25 percent longer and we don't know what that's a result of is it something in the diet is it something in the bedding or the who knows but the other thing is that mouse sex chromosomes are quite a bit different than human sex chromosomes just to give you an example of some genes on the x chromosome do not get inactivated on the inactive x about 15 percent you know you get expression in both sexes in mice that's about three to four percent of the genes on the x chromosome getting activated there are also genes on the y chromosome in humans that are not on the y chromosome in mice and vice versa so i'm not this again is one of these things where i think of this as as looking at the world through one eye we have one comparison with humans now it's mice and just like you don't have much perspective when you close one eye i don't think you have much perspective when you have one comparison and and that's kind of what we have now why do you think it's been i don't want to say so difficult because i don't know that we've tried frankly but why do you think there hasn't been a greater effort in identifying better biomarkers of aging um or do you think that there has been an enormous effort and it's just been too difficult but for example we don't know how long one as a human needs to fast to achieve a significant inhibition of rapamycin to extract the benefits that we think are there why is that well i i would i would say that of your two alternatives that we haven't tried hard enough or or maybe we've tried hard enough and haven't found anything i would say it's the latter because in the 1990s the nia put i think 100 million dollars into developing biomarkers of aging and it came out with nothing but that may have been that we just didn't have the right tools at that point i think i think we're really on the verge of something big here so that we could have biomarkers that will tell us exactly this kind of thing and do you think these biomarkers will be in the metabolism in the proteome in the in the epigenome um [Music] all of the above i think they're yeah i think they're likely to be all of the above um and right now the hottest one is in the epigenome because that's looking better and better and it seems to are you optimistic i mean i i i've seen how easily it is to how easy it is to manipulate those and i find it completely uninteresting and i that's going to alienate a lot of people that are listening to this because i'm the i'm the naysayer on that but steve when i look at those data i'm not remotely impressed and by the way i've done the experiments on some of my patients right you you know you measure their epigenetic age on day zero they do a three day fast you measure their epigenetic age it goes down by 10 percent or more frankly have you really learned anything and then a week later it's back to normal like i i that i don't know what that's telling me well it may be so i'm actually fairly impressed by the epigenetic data but maybe it's not going to work in the short term like that it may be this may be something that tells you something over the course of years but not over the course of weeks or months i think my only point there is that it's very sensitive to what's happening in the moment right and so when when i look at a lot of these aging clocks and i look at the inputs i i think to myself these are very easy to manipulate what was your vitamin d level on this day what was your glucose level at the moment of that blood test what i mean these things are so easy to manipulate and they have so much volatility over time that i don't find them to be clinically quite useful well they may never turn out to be clinically useful because it may be that they're integrating things over a time scale that's not clinically meaningful i think the likelihood that we're going to find something in the proteome and the metabolome is is is higher i mean something that's that's that's therapeutically useful yeah just because those things really change rapidly yeah you know and and um if if we want to know if you do x for the if you if you fast six hours you fix facts uh fast 12 hours i think what you're going to look for there is changes in gene activity and and that's going to be in the proteome yeah or or in the metabolism the thing is it's going to it's going to be computationally complex now we have all these tools for doing computationally complex things but but they're not cheap tools and so i don't know how long before they'll be in the clinic where we can afford to do this on in people on us if i were you know czar for a day and could marshal the resources for the manhattan project on longevity this would be one of the departments right like this would be if you had a billion dollars to put towards a manhattan project of longevity i feel like a quarter of it would go into this problem um yeah because it again if if we're interested in longevity presumably we're interested in human longevity and if we're interested in human longevity we don't have a hundred years to come up with the answer so we have to come up with with markers that are better well now we have the tools to do that yeah you know every year the tools the computational tools the analytic tools you know if if if you can detect you know 3000 uh different proteins in your blood uh then you're much more likely to affect to detect something that's really really meaningful and so those things are all happening uh of course they could happen more if there were more money invested in them um i think that's the big issue steve personally i think this is not commercially interesting enough and i i think that that's why it hasn't gotten the attention i mean i think the diagnostic space is a lousy space right like if you're a venture capitalist and someone comes up to you and says i've got a new diagnostic test i mean that's nowhere near as interesting as i have a new therapeutic uh model and that's why i feel like this could only really occur in kind of a manhattan project or a heavily funded government project but i just don't and i i use the term manhattan project meaning an entity that is so large commercially that they understand that this is an important tool that needs to be developed in our in in in research to foster the development of you know molecules down the line yeah it's a it's an interesting you know i mean craig venter tried to do that right with and that corporation really the company would yeah i have thoughts on that i can't share publicly but uh um but you're right i mean i think the key the key's got to be there this is not magic you know there's stuff going on in the body i think the blood because it courses through everything in the body is going to have clues to what's going on everywhere once we learn how to read those clues and um i think part of the problem is that we're not you know there's a very small group of people that are interested in making other people live longer but most of the time it's trying to prevent them from getting a specific disease there's a lot more money that goes into obesity i think than that goes into longevity and it's hard to say that it's not well spent money because obesity is the huge problem right um so you you you made a very famous bet uh with jayashonsky 20 years ago right 21 years ago yeah what was that bet the bet was about when the first when we would have the first 150 year old human which side of that bet did you fall on i was on this so my part of the bet was i think that person was born in the 24 already was born by the year 2000 the person is already alive who would ultimately become the first 150 year old person and j bet the opposite and the critical thing was the person had to be mentally competent enough to carry on a sensible conversation about something um yeah so that was 20 years ago and nobody's lived as long as the longest live person had lived at that point since then which was about 122. yeah 122 and a half roughly nobody's even reached 120 since then and so um yeah i'm asked quite often if i still think i'm right and i do because i never thought this was going to happen because we got better at treating cancer or we got better at preventing heart disease i always thought it was going to happen because we we would develop something or some things that would fundamentally ch change the rate of aging and we haven't developed that yet we've got a lot of clues and i think we're getting closer and closer and closer but the other reason i'm still confident that i'm going to win that bet is that one of the things that's come out of the interventions testing program is that things can have this big effect late started late in life so it may be that this doesn't happen until the person that was born in 2001 is 50 years old but if it happens then that doesn't mean that they still couldn't live 150 years now it's important to note because this wager gets mischaracterized something i'm not saying that i think the life expectancy that's right you're talking about 150 years yeah yeah i'm talking about a single person probably a japanese woman it would be my guess if i had to guess right now i don't think that 150-year life expectancy what do you think is the limit of human life expectancy as we currently exist maybe 100 years i think that's that's reasonable um with now if that happens some people will live 150 years yeah um right it's like the average is around 80 now and this one person lived 122 years so i think if we get to 100 that seems conceivable to me and and also something that could be reached by getting better at what we do now the key thing is getting people to do what we know is better for them now do you understand the math behind jay's models that say if we completely eradicated cancer we would increase life expectancy by x years if we completely eradicated disease y we would increase and the numbers are very small in his estimates but i don't i don't fully i've never actually taken the time to look at the models to see where those numbers come from yeah they those models rely on a number of assumptions one of the assumptions that each of these is independent of the other and i think which is completely untrue right metabolic syndrome tells us that's untrue right so um and eliminating a single cause of death is not the same as delaying 20 causes of death yeah right so i think they're kind of artificial in that respect so those give me no pause for possibly winning my bet so when you think about existing molecules i.e molecules that are either fda approved or [Music] you know like 17 alpha estradiol is not an fda approved molecule but it's been tested and it's had unbelievable success in male mice in the itp when you think about canagaflozin acarbose of course rapamycin metformin what molecule do you think of the molecules we know about today has the most potential for gero protection certainly if we go by the mouse data it would have to be rapamycin if we go by the human data it would have to be metformin both of those are weak statement in my qualifications for each of those is a pretty major qualifications i actually think that what might turn out to be the most helpful is combinations of these things so rapamycin plus metformin um what i what i like about metformin is that the most compelling data come from human studies not from mouse studies the mouse data on metformin are weak yeah it didn't succeed in the itp which is were you surprised by that no no i wasn't surprised by that at all um and i wouldn't be surprised if it didn't work out in humans it's because just because most clinical trials don't i mean the existing data which is voluminous and all pretty much points in one direction which is is that it's it's going to be beneficial again it all comes with from people that are taking metformin because they're diabetic and so this could be a lot like the wisconsin experiment again where it's not going to work if you do it on people who are healthy right now ner would argue against that right near would say i know there are many benefits that that you know we see in metformin that go far beyond its uh glucose regulatory benefits that are the obvious benefit that the diabetic patients get yeah no no near would be quite emphatic about disagreeing with me on this um i i'd love to be wrong about that but i just if i had to put my money it's just because most clinical trials fail and most clinical trials fail because they were based on mouse data to start off with at least so maybe this is maybe this is something it's certainly worth figuring out just because the effects are so manifold you know it's it's dementia and cancer and heart disease and we don't know what else we don't know for instance what it might do to muscle function the you know the best data on that it's not good for muscle function but again that comes from early work and i think we have a a long ways to go because it's so safe you know that's the that's the big thing about metformin is that we know it's extremely safe it's been taken by millions of people we don't know that about rapamycin yet but i think it ought to be a high priority to find out what low-dose rapamycin does the trouble is it you know giving drugs of any sort to completely healthy people is something that the fda is not going to go for so we're almost going to have to work these things out on people that have some sort of illnesses to start off with how would you dose rapamycin in a longevity trial just as a thought experiment given two pieces of evidence that seem um to be at dialectical odds with each other so they are as follows in the mice studies in all of the itp studies the animals were fed rapamycin in their chow meant meaning they received rapamycin every day they were always eating rapamycin but based on our mechanistic understanding of rapamycin we believe that the benefits come not from global inhibition of mtor but from the inhibition of mtor complex 1 and not the inhibition of m4 complex 2 and in fact the inhibition of impor mtor complex 2 might actually have some negative consequences and if you were to take constitutively rapamycin as patients do with organ transplants you were suppressing both how do you reconcile those two and how would you design a clinical trial to address this if your stated purpose was increasing longevity well i the first thing i would do is i would start off with a dose that's been already been tested in human for its effects and enhancing uh vaccine response to influenza because they did multiple doses now that wasn't rapamycin that was a rapid role and that was so five milligrams of everolimus and 20 milligrams of everolimus given once a week did just that right and the lower dose had was just effective at boosting immune responses the higher dose it had fewer side effects so i would start off with that episodically like they did because i think there's some evidence that that you're getting just as big a boost without the side effects without the side effects and also i think you know there if you can imagine how much the drug companies are working to find a wrap up log that doesn't inhibit complex two i mean that's going to be huge if they can come up with something that works really differentially on complex one that's really where i would start and i think those vaccine studies were a great start and if they would because they were those were healthy people right they just were older people there were people i think 65 and older i would like to see those things continued now it's interesting a number of years ago we tried to get funding for what i thought was a really good rapamycin study but we were unsuccessful which is that there was a nih clinical trial to look at rapamycin as preventative for the reoccurrence of kidney cancer so this is people that already had a kidney removed but were seemingly cured but they have a higher than average you know rate of relapse they were giving one year of rapamycin to see if it reduced that and i said wait a second why didn't we jump in and measure inflammation muscle strength you name it all these things in this experiment that was already ongoing but unfortunately that didn't get funded but on the other hand it may have been too high a dose because this is a therapeutic dose for right you know suppressive purposes right so it may not have been the right dose anyway yeah so we might have come to a conclusion that was misleading i thought that that vaccination study was a great avenue for starting a longer term study and and i know they're they're doing some of that in a private company you know spinoff from yeah are you excited about the sglt2 inhibitors i think i think it's a little early to tell i'm i i you know that in the the nad you know various nad precursors i i just i think it's a little too early i typically you know this is so scientists are often by temperament and training extremely skeptical and and and you know i think that's why we make boring interviews so often is they want we don't want to ever come down on a and make a clean statement but i really need to see the data before i start to get excited and and and i never get excited by a single mouse study um i get intrigued but i don't get excited although the human data on the sglt2 inhibitors is also remarkable and i think that's yeah you know that's the sort of that's the theme here right is you have a great itp outcome and of course the human data are not for longevity but they're right again they suffer the the limitations of all human studies namely that they're being used in a subset of the population that might not be the subset of interest but you know the impact on kidney failure all-cause mortality heart failure is pretty impressive and i think what's interesting about what the itps show us with both canigaflows and acarbose is that the benefits might not have to do anything with reducing you know caloric intake right which was the proposed reason for for a carbos but rather has to do with glucose kinetics and i find that very fascinating actually i do too and and i have to say i'm i'm disappointed in the itp that they dropped their pair fed arm of that when they started off there was going to be a pair fed arm and they dropped that and i'm a bit disappointed because you we don't know now we only have body weight we don't have food consumption so we don't know how much of these effects might be due to food consumption and how many might not be or changes in the temporal pattern of food consumption you know maybe if it makes your stomach feel a little bit queasy you don't want to eat again for 20 hours but um so the human data i mean we're going to make real progress when we have human biomarkers yeah and we can do we can do a five-year study and we can say we know this is going to decrease dementia heart disease cancer preserve muscle strength boost immune response not just immune system because we have to be careful of that i think people think oh yeah we want to boost the immune system well we don't want autoimmune diseases we don't want our immune system to go haywire because it mischaracterized something as as an invasion but we want to boost immune responsiveness certainly um yeah i mean i think the limiting factor right now is biomarkers well i yeah you know my feelings on that so i think we we end on the same page there steve this has been uh this has been a lot of fun um and uh we're long overdue to uh to share a dinner and continue these discussions so hopefully the next time it'll be in person that's a great next time in new york austin wherever perfect all right well
