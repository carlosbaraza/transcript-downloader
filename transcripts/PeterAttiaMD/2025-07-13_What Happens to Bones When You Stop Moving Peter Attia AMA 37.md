This clip is from episode Navigating bone health: early life influences and advanced strategies for improvement and injury prevention (#214 rebroadcast)

In this clip, they discuss:

- Disuse Osteopenia Explained – Bone loss occurs when bones are unloaded, as seen in spaceflight and long-term immobilization
- The Risk of Bed Rest – Prolonged bed rest (e.g., in pregnancy or injury recovery) can contribute to rapid bone density decline
- Rates of Bone Decline – Bone loss can occur at 2% per month in partial paralysis and up to 7% in complete paralysis
- Load What You Can – Even in bed, loading muscles through physical therapy or resistance can help prevent deterioration
- Mouse Study on Bone Loss – Research on mice shows bisphosphonates can counteract bone loss caused by immobility

## AI Summary

Here's my analysis of this episode of The Drive:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This AMA segment focuses on disuse osteopenia - bone loss that occurs when bones are chronically unloaded. Dr. Attia discusses how this condition manifests in various scenarios, from astronauts in space to patients on bed rest. He emphasizes the rapid rate of bone loss during immobility and explores potential interventions, including both physical therapy and pharmaceutical approaches.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Disuse osteopenia involves high bone resorption and low bone formation [00:00:00]
- Bone loss can occur at ~2% per month in microgravity or partial paralysis [00:01:46]
- Complete paralysis can lead to up to 7% bone loss per month [00:02:31]
- Trabecular bone loses mass more rapidly than cortical bone [00:01:46]
- Mouse study showed bisphosphonates could prevent immobility-related bone loss [00:04:00]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Avoid prolonged bed rest when possible [00:01:46]
- Maintain some form of muscle loading even during injury recovery [00:02:31]
- Consider isometric exercises when movement is restricted [00:03:08]

4. **Exercise & Movement**:
- Blood Flow Restriction (BFR) training can be useful during recovery [00:02:31]
- Isometric exercises can be performed even while bedridden [00:03:08]
- PT focusing on active muscle loading is beneficial [00:02:31]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"Today we know that [prolonged bed rest is] absolutely the last thing you want to do" [00:01:46]

6. **References & Resources**:
- Mouse study using bisphosphonates and botulinum toxin [00:04:00]
- Study on 65-year-olds showing significant lean mass loss after 2 weeks of immobilization [00:05:03]

7. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What specific protocols do astronauts use to prevent bone loss in space?
2. Are there particular nutritional interventions that can help minimize bone loss during forced immobility?
3. How does the rate of bone recovery compare to the rate of loss after immobilization?
4. What are the long-term implications of multiple periods of immobilization on bone density?

The episode provides valuable insights into the importance of maintaining some form of physical activity even during periods of restricted movement, and highlights the potential role of pharmaceutical interventions in preventing bone loss during immobilization.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] What happens to your bones if you truly aren't using them? This is obviously not a subject that is relevant to a lot of people directly, but I think indirectly it's it's it's relevant to a lot of people. So, this is, you know, space is just the most extreme version of what we would call disuse osteopenia. So as the name suggests, disuse osteopenia occurs when bones are chronically unloaded leading to a very unfavorable combination of high bone uh resorption and low bone formation. So it's the same thing that's happening with the osteopenia from aging. It's just much more accelerated and much more extreme. So again, the most extreme version of this is astronauts. Um, and I don't know much about what they do in space, but I suspect that they go out of their way to figure out ways to load astronauts in space. Um, so that you know they don't have to deal with this in its highest form. But I think for most people where this is relevant is bed rest. So lots of people have to undergo bed rest for all sorts of reasons, right? Pregnant women often are placed on bed rest if they are experiencing fetal retardation. uh and I mean that not cognitively but growth retardation right so um if in the third trimester the fetus isn't growing at the rate that um is expected uh not uncommon that the OB will ask the mother to gradually reduce her impact until um more and more energy can be reserved for the fetus. Uh you can also see u you know bed rest being necessary for various types of injuries. Uh, of course we know today that we don't want to rest people nearly as much as we used to. I mean there was a day 50 years ago when if somebody hurt their back they were put on two weeks of strict bed rest.

[00:01:46] Today we know that that's absolutely the last thing you want to do. So bone loss due to you know disuse osteopenia is incremental and it's progressive with time and it occurs more rapidly as you would guess in the tracular bone than in the cortical bone. So this is the this is the um the trend we've seen over and over again. Um and frankly it can be about 2% per month in microgravity partial paralysis which I should have mentioned as well right so paralysis based injuries uh or or immobilization with injury um and in the most extreme setting with complete paralysis it can be up to 7% per month. So Peter, for people who are experiencing like that type of immobility, is there anything in particular they should be thinking about or they can do to kind of help with the

[00:02:31] BMD concern? Yeah, the first would be any form of PT that can actively load muscles. Um, so I don't know if there's I actually don't know how much data exists on this, but that's one of the things that I think is interesting about cyclic BFR. And that's why the minute I was out of surgery, I got permission from my surgeon to put my, you know, katsu cuffs on my arm and just start cycling the BFR. I wanted to put little bits of stress on that bicep just to have it moving. And again, keep in mind, I was very fortunate. I did not have a bicep tendon repaired. If I did,

[00:03:08] I would not have been allowed to do that. Um but you know I had to keep my arm completely immobilized but I was still able to get sort of compression on the bicep and um you know basically if you if let's say you're bedridden with a certain injury, there are still other muscles in your body that don't pertain to that injury that can still be moved and put under load. And even if you're doing these things isomemmetrically, right? So a person is holding you and you're resisting against them without actually moving in the bed. That's important. Now, there was a super interesting mouse study that we found that um used uh a bisphosphinate to inhibit the osteoplastic bone resor resorption um in a mouse model where the mice were given uh botulotoxin to basically prevent them from moving I think one part of their leg. So, if you

[00:04:00] I think I think we have this figure here as well. Um yeah, it's figure 10. Yeah. So what you're looking at here is in the the first bar on the left is uh just sort of the baseline and then you have control mice in black and then in white you have what happens to the animal that were just given botulotoxin. So these were the animals that were basically immobilized um because you know bottoxin of course paralyzes their legs and then the bottoxin plus the bisphosphinate on the right and I I think this is a pretty profound result. Right? You're looking at this in the femoral neck and in the middle of the um the upper part of the femoral bone uh below the neck and you can see that the bisphosphinate plus the immobility really looks no different from the control and it's a you know clear contrast to how the untreated animal looks. So you know look these are 16week old female mice you know is this going to be true in humans?

[00:05:03] I have no idea. But I find this type of research very interesting and frankly I hope more people are doing this type of research because I think immobility is a huge problem with everybody. But once you start to deal with an aging population, it becomes more significant. How many times have we talked about that study where um you know a group of 65 year olds I believe were immobilized for 2 weeks and lost if I'm not mistaken something of the neighborhood of about four pounds of lean mass in two weeks.

[00:05:32] And that, you know, we talked about that through the lens of how much you lose lean mass, but think about what that's doing to to BMD. And think about how long people are immobilized beyond 2 weeks, um, especially as they're older. I'm Peter Aia.
