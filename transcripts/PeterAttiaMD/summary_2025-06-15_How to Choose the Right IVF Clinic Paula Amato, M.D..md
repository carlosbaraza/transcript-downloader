2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- IVF clinics are required by law to report every cycle and success rate (established in the 1990s) [02:27]
- Average clinic volume benchmark should be at least 100 cycles per year [03:07]
- Example of robust clinic staffing: 6 doctors, 9 embryologists, performing 600-800 retrievals annually [03:45]
