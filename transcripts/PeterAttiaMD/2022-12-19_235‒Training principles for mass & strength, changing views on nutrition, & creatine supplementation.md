**1. Executive Summary**:
This episode features a detailed discussion between Peter Attia and Lane Norton about powerlifting, nutrition, and training principles. The conversation covers various aspects of strength training, body composition, dietary approaches, and the psychological aspects of different nutritional strategies. Key topics include creatine supplementation, training methodology, and the relationship between nutrition and performance.

**2. Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Creatine acts as a high-energy phosphate donor and osmolyte in muscle tissue [01:01:13]
- LDL cholesterol's relationship with cardiovascular disease is linear with lifetime exposure [01:57:15]
- Muscle tissue is approximately 70% water [01:02:38]
- Strength and VO2 max are the two biggest predictors of longevity [00:14:37]

**3. Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Track food intake for at least one week to understand true consumption [02:54:02]
- Aim for 15g of fiber per 1000 calories consumed [02:22:29]
- Include compound movements in training routine [00:28:47]

Context-specific recommendations:
- For powerlifting: Progressive overload through various means (weight, reps, sets) [00:19:58]
- For body composition: Monitor both calories and macronutrients [02:48:32]

**4. Supplements & Medications**:
Creatine:
- Recommended dose: 5g daily [01:02:14]

## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music] AA Well Lane we're back for another round of this but this time we finally get to do it in person yeah I'm I'm looking forward to this this will be I said it be a little bit different so let's talk about your training because right now you are training for uh the worlds in powerlifting we had a great chance to kind of catch up on some of your training yesterday I probably won't get into as much detail as you and I got into last night CU that might be more detailed than the average non- nerd is interested in um but maybe just briefly kind of explain the sport of powerlifting uh you know there are three lifts how it works uh and then I want to talk about kind of how you're training for that and some of the challenges that yeah so power lifting is very basic sport like you mentioned those three lifts the squat the bench press and the deadlift and they go in that order uh you get three attempts on each and uh they're Progressive so for example once you put in an attempt like let's say you put in a squad attempt of 550 pounds for your opener if you miss it you can't go down so usually the way people do it is you know first attempt is a pretty conservative weight kind of like a last warm-up second attempt is getting close to something that's you know pretty reasonable like you know RP 9 N and a half and then your last one you're hoping to get kind of your true maximum um and it's I mean basically highest total wins um between the three different lifts correct so um at Worlds they will give medals for individual lifts so um there'll be a gold silver and bronze for squat gold silver bronze for bench press and gold silver bronze for deadlift and then there'll be those medals also for the overall and the overall is just the summation of the total of the number of lifts you hit so and when you do your three squat three bench three dead are you doing them in that order or are you going yeah y so it's you do all three squats go then all three bench press and all three deadlift typically how much time in between each attempt yeah so it just it it can really depend uh the last time I did worlds in 2015 uh that was a very very fast meet so in our flight there was only 11 people so meaning you know you have uh the person who has the lightest squat will go first at up to the heaviest

[00:02:24] Squat and then those will continue to cycle through uh same thing for bench pressing for deadlift and the whole meat took over just just over two hours but I've been in meats that have taken as long as three and a half so it really just depends on your flight how quickly the SP but if I'm doing the math I mean that means you might only have 15 minutes between lifts uh usually you'll get about at least 30 because the way they run it is there's there's no real breaks for people who are spectating so they'll have two flights going at the same time so what'll happen is uh they'll have an a flight and a b flight typically sometimes they'll have C flights as well if they're if it's a really really packed meat like Nationals um but at

[00:03:11] Worlds it's usually just an A and A B flight and they just separate those based on opening squats and usually the the the B flight will have the the top lifters in it um so you have some time so you're while the other folks are lifting you're typically warming up getting ready and then once for example um the squats are finished a flight will start for bench and then if you're in BF flight you can have time to warm up so what are you doing between so let's just say between lift one and two um lift one shouldn't have been that stressful if you did it correctly is does your does what you eat matter much does how you are you getting any tissue work like what what do you need to do let's just say you have 30 minutes between those attempts what do you need to do to maximize your off so usually between the lifts themselves like between Squat and bench press we'll have 30 to 60 Minutes depending on how quickly things are going but what about between the squat attempts like between the first second second third so between the actual attempts themselves I mean

[00:04:15] I'll take I drink a water I I might like throw some candy in or something like that really quickly if I feel like I need it but for the most part I'm just mentally trying to get myself in the right Zone and it is a little bit tricky because you can't keep yourself at that really high level of arousal the entire time because you'll just wear out really quickly um so for me the trick is bringing that arousal down for about you know five minutes or so so that I can just relax just enough and then start to focus back up and it's almost like um it's like a wave you're kind of letting yourself come down and then when the time is right and really timing is a big thing in this because once the bar is loaded they call bars loaded you'll have one minute to get the down command for squat or bench press or whatever it is so really and there can be mistakes where um like maybe you come out and you forgot your belt or you something happens um so I really try to make it to where when they say bar is loaded I I get out there very quickly so that if there is anything wrong I can address it and uh have time so really timing it and seeing okay how many people are in front of me how long do I need to amp up usually for me I like to have about two or three minutes to really get like very aroused and very amped up um and so just trying to time that correctly is kind of tough but like I said for the first five minutes afterwards I kind of let myself come down but I never like truly relax

[00:05:46] I'm still like got my music on I'm still thinking about what I've got to do but I'm not like really hyperfocusing and then as it starts to come into the last five minutes for the lift you know I'm putting whatever I need on to focus myself you know mental imagery visualization and then by the end I'm even doing like breath work like I really I want my heart rate to be about 160 170 by the time I go out to hit my

[00:06:10] LIF like I want to be W very amped yeah I was going to ask you what your heart rate got to I would imagine your blood glucose is probably about 160 as well probably your liver is just you know hepatic glucose output at the max yeah I mean you know your your stress home earns are going to be high you know you it's really interesting I was um this is a little bit off topic but I was

[00:06:32] U listening to a sports psychologist talk about how the differences between excitement and anxiety are and anxiousness are almost you can't almost pick them out it's just your perception and I remembered when I played baseball in high school I would come up to the plate with the thought process of don't strike out you don't want to look stupid just put the ball in play it wasn't the the process of I'm going to drive these runs in I'm going to you know do

[00:07:00] XYZ and I was watching an episode of The Ultimate Fighter probably 13 14 years ago is where Matt Sarah versus Matt Hughes and one of the fighters was getting like really like like vomiting before uh a match because he was so nervous and he was over the bucket going I can't do this anymore I hate the way this feels I I can't do this and Matt

[00:07:25] Sarah just looked at him and said what are you talking about man that's the feeling of being alive you care about something so much that your body is reacting this way and ever since then it completely flipped the way I looked at competition and so now before when I would get nervous playing baseball I would try to like calm myself down like why can't I feel normal why don't I feel relaxed and now when I feel those nerves start to kick in I just tell myself this is a good thing this is a good thing this is your body getting you ready this is you being ready to go and uh really like that reframing of things and just accepting and being okay with the anxiety has helped me so much yeah well I think uh you know something like that with in powerlifting where the stakes are really high and it's really short it's not like um you know in tennis you can you can have one bad match right or one bad serve and it doesn't end the entire thing uh in powerlifting it can and I guess the other thing I guess is the stakes are kind of high from an injury standpoint as well because you are pushing at your

[00:08:29] Lim it um have you ever injured yourself in a meat so not to the point where I couldn't continue or um you know had really bad pain during but at the Arnold in 2015 at the Arnold Pro meat I had um aggravated my back a week out pretty badly and then uh the day of the meat um when I hit my last squat which was 661 pounds I kind of rotated a little bit coming up and the next day I could definitely feel it like in my it was actually closer to my upper lumbar or lower thoracic uh I definitely had quite a bit of pain there so what's interesting is you don't you typically don't see people get injured at Meats it does happen but I would say that it's less frequent than during training that's I don't have any data on that I'm just guessing but I think part of it is you are so focused in you are so excited you're very tight like you're you're very you know conscious of what you're doing at the end of the day it is just one rep where I've tend to yeah whereas the volume when you're training and you're also probably more broken down and more fatigued yeah so you when you get ready for a meat if you've done your due diligence hopefully you've kind of dissipated a lot of that fatigue through you know rest and and tapering whereas when you're in the throws of training and you just have high levels of fatigue maybe you're just not able to execute the lifts as well because of that fatigue um that's where things tend to happen especially like if you're doing you know multiple repetitions as you get close to the failure just the opportunity to get out of position or make mistakes those sorts of things so it is definitely uh one of the things that you know is part of the game um like you're just going to deal with pain um but I always tell people too like you know I'm 40 now and most 40y olds 50 year olds they have pain pain anyway so I'd rather be strong and have pain than be weak and have pain how many times a year can you Peak for a meat and so maybe not necessarily even you but at the top level of powerlifting how many really good meats in a year does a does a lifter have so I this is just completely my opinion uh and it's it's based on my own experience but for me I've done it where I've only I've done one I've done it where I've done like four high level meets four was way too much um I think probably two is the sweet spot for me um you know gives you time to really I don't think I've ever gone into a meat and just been like oh I feel 100% healthy and nothing hurts or anything like that it's it's kind of it's not the same thing as getting ready for like a fight but I mean in order to be able to execute a heavy lift you have to lift heavy and so part of that is you're going to accumulate some some dinks and some dunks and so really it's about getting to competition day with enough Fitness level in terms of being able to execute heavy lifts while dissipating fatigue and being in low enough levels of pain that you can execute um and so afterwards really it's always been the most dangerous when I feel good after a meet because then I just tend to like go and like on Monday and say well let's get right back into training and really the smart thing to do is just to take some some time you know train for fun you know keep that core strength but move more towards accessory movements and things that don't beat me up so much for several months then kind of re-enter like a more of a like building accumulation phase where volume is going up but the weights still aren't super heavy and then those last three four months four a week now it's time to start putting in you know more heavy weights and starting to ramp up towards where the end I mean like by the end of my training I'm mostly on my competition lifts just hitting heavy singles so that's what I want to kind of talk about is um what can the rest of us who aren't powerlifters learn just about strength because if I wanted to frame this for a listener because people have heard me talk about this but the two metrics that are most significantly associated with longevity uh so if we were to stack up every possible known risk factor smoking type 2 diabetes high blood pressure coronary artery disease endstage kidney disease whatever and we were to talk about how much of a hazard ratio do these bring to you in terms of all cause mortality they're they're quite big you know hypertension is about a 20% uh type 2 diabetes is about a 30% increase in mortality smoking is 50% uh increase being weak relative to being strong is about 250% having a very low V2 Max in the bottom 25% of the population versus being in the top 2 and a half% of the population is about 400% wow so when you line everything up the two things that stand out the most are incredible cardiorespiratory Fitness as measured by V2 Max and strength and then a third is muscle mass but I think when you look at the data you realize muscle mass is so coupled to strength that that Association is tight the point being is if you're listening to this podcast and thus far into this podcast your eyes are sort of glazing over as we're sitting here talking about powerlifting it's probably worth pointing out that even if you never once care to do a heavy squat or a heavy bench press or a heavy deadlift you have to be strong and in these studies where these associations continue to show up over and over and over again you know they're using things like grip strength bench press leg extension things that are a little less technical MH but the point remains anybody who's going to a power meet and crushing a deadlift has pretty strong grip strength right so um

[00:14:37] I think it becomes important for people to understand how to train for power uh and so so let's now talk a little bit about that right so if if a person comes to you and says I want to get stronger uh and that's my primary objective in the weight room it's more so than the aesthetic uh because we're going to talk about that later what are some of the principles they need to keep in mind so what's interesting is the principles are pretty much the same it's just the level to which they're applied right and I think it's important to point out that you know there there are diminishing returns with strength in ter well I'm sure there are I don't think the studies are refined enough to pick this out at this point because it's not like they're getting a population of powerlifters and looking at their longevity um so but my guess is that at a certain point you pretty much get all the benefits and just getting even stronger is probably not going to give you more especially if it comes at the risk of injury that can later on in life yeah sure and then I think like you also see with like running there's kind of like a j-shaped curve part of me thinks that just the people that take it so far whether it be powerlifting running whatever that it's not that their sport makes them more prone to more to early mortality but more so that they probably have other behaviors of being being an extremist that probably contribute to that yeah interesting um but as far as strength goes I mean really what we're talking about is Progressive overload I mean that that is the most important core principle and it actually really applies to a lot of things in life to be quite honest but when it comes to lifting weights a lot of people hear Progressive overload and they just think weight on the bar and that is the most simple way to explain it right so if you come in you've never done some sort of squat movement before and you do 95 pounds uh for five reps and then the next week you come in you do 100 and the next week you come in and do you do 105 at the same number of reps at the same number of reps right you know that is a form of progressive overload and most people when they enter the gym that's kind of their experience they don't need to increase that number they don't need to really they can increase the Reps but for the most part when you first start going to the gym you're just going to be able to put more weight on the bar pretty much every week and that is a perfectly reasonable way to progress and I mean even you know I know we haven't gotten here yet but people will say well you know I'm postmental posle woman or I'm a 75-year-old male like it's too late for me no it's not it now is the best time um in fact when I was at uh University of Illinois where I was in the department of nutritional Sciences right across the street in the exercise physiology department they were conducting a study on um frail elderly so people who basically almost couldn't couldn't really walk like they could but it was very tough for them uh and they just started progressively overloading them and that looked like basically squatting to a really high chair to start right and what they saw was incredible in like 12 weeks they actually had people who could squat down to like a below parallel chair and come back up which may not sound like much for the average person but when you're talking about somebody who's you know frail elderly the difference in functionality and their lifestyle is going to be incredible in terms of what they can do so what I'll tell people is what you can learn from powerlifters is that Progressive overload one in terms of weight on the bar but nobody's able to increase weight on the bar forever that that's just it's not going to happen and the the longer you get into it the more nonlinear it's going to be it's going to be you're going to go down and come up and go down and come back up um but there's also other ways to progressively overload uh one being more repetitions um and the other being adding more hard sets so the latter adding more hard sets is really something you only need to get to as you get to be more advanced because like I said you're you're not going to be able to add strength forever and you're not going to be able to add reps forever either so by the way this is one thing that from one of our earlier discussions that really started to change my training I started um adding a little bit more set at slightly lower RP to net increase volume so I was I think doing a lot more RP 89 stuff but you can only get a few sets at that level like you're really really spent and instead I was saying well wait a minute why don't we do a little more rp6 and seven and add more sets more volume um one I feel like it's lowering my risk of injury uh and two as you said it's really just another way to progressively overload yeah and you're always weighing those two things kind of your stimulus versus fatigue ratio and that's something um so I'm coached by a guy named Zach Robinson who's doing his PhD in Mike zoro's Lab at uh FAU great lab um and he talks about stimulus versus fatigue a lot and they do a lot of training in that kind of RP 5 to6 area which some people call that easy when it comes to compound lift

[00:19:58] I really call it easy um but you know it's kind of like how can we maximize our stimulus and minimize fatigue and if you're talking about an rpe 9 for example how many sets at RP 9 can you get I don't know about you I have like one to two right right before you really have to drop the weight down or whatnot or before like someone like me who's not you know at the level that a power LIF is at like my my form starts to compromise right and um Mike isra actually had a great kind of take on this too in terms of like training to failure he's like you know if you take a squat like a free barbell squat to failure for 10 reps and then you try to do another set with that same weight how many reps will you get I mean I know from doing sets to failure of 10 reps of free barbell squat I might not even be able to get like two or three reps on my next set because it's just so fatiguing so that that is one thing that's important to point out when we talk about rpes which is kind of a measure for proximity to yeah I guess just we talked about on the previous podcast why don't you tell people how RP works because I I think it's really a fantastic system um but you do need to push yourself in the gym to really understand what they feel like yeah so RP is kind of a it's been adapted from running to lifting and it's on a scale of one to 10 or I guess even zero but RP 10 being you had no more reps left that was your absolute allout like 100% effort uh rp9 is you could have done one more rep rp8 one more rep so on and so forth um and one of the issues we know you don't have to train to failure to grow muscle in fact it may actually be a little bit counterproductive just in terms of the fatigue that it causes relative to the stimulus we know that you know for most movements you get most of the hypertrophy and strength benefits going within a few reps of failure so RP like 78 um and obviously if you can do more volume it may be even more beneficial but the downside is if you've never actually taken something to failure like true failure people are really bad at estimating it and so it with beginners and intermediates they find that they tend to underestimate their rpe by about five wow which is pretty incredible and uh we we've seen it in lab like we'll take somebody in and they'll put a weight on they'll do a rep and and you'll ask them what what's your RP right what was what was that like and they'll say they're rpe and then the researchers will actually make them take it to failure while they're like yelling at them and encouraging them and on average they'll get five more reps than they estimated they would have I I can totally believe yeah whereas when they look at rpe uh validity in advanced lifters uh it tends to be much more accurate much more accurate so there was actually a study I was in a powerlifting meet where they had a tiendo unit on the bar and they were measuring our bar velocity and they were asking us to rate our RP after every attempt and they found that RP uh as validated by velocity data was a pretty good measure in that population of power power lifters because they've taken so many sets near failure so your point is well taken like you do need some experience of going really hard and really close to failure but once you have that experience and you understand what that feels like then you can estimate better you're probably better off staying a few reps shy of failure and accumulating volume that way just because going to failure is just so incredibly fatiguing so for a person who again is not planning to go to a power meet um is there a need for them to go below four reps in training I would say that's an arbitrary number but you know what I'm getting it I would say probably not I mean you can get plenty strong uh even doing you know sets of 10 those sorts of things oh that's interesting I wouldn't so that I would have thought you needed to get at least into the fives and sixes sometimes but so you can get really strong doing sets 10 15 those sorts of things now you will not be as strong even per cross-sectional area as somebody who trains for strength because strength is a specific skill and even like myself um you know my best squat ever is a 668 and when I was you know six months out from that it's not like I uh you know I added weight to the bar that I was able to squat but it's not like I added that much more lean body mass because I didn't uh I was practicing the skill of a one rep max which allowed me to better do the one rep max and you were practicing at what percent of ultimately became 661 usually around 90 995 um but not very much at 95 mostly at 90 for like singles and what was your rpe when you did those singles so usually about eight and a half or nine yeah okay so and so you would do multiple of that just doing the math let's just say that's 20 or something like that or yeah so let's say it's call it 600 lb so you would do a 600 lb signal three times in a workout something like that okay yeah and what you're what you're kind of making gains on at that point is just your one it just teaches you how to grind through a lift uh because a lot of people have never had the experience of really sticking with a lift and interestingly the more advanced somebody gets in terms of strength the slower their one rep max velocity will be and and we see this in uh research studies all the time um somebody who's kind of new will come in they will absolutely smoke a weight you put five pounds on and then they get stapled because it's just they don't have that grind capacity they don't they don't know how to do it and part of that may be psychological but part of that's probably physiological too so interesting in terms of you just haven't trained your body to recruit all the fibers that it can get so you know lean body mass and strength are very closely tied together but when it gets to those finer levels of strength it's kind of just practicing the actual you know one rep max so when it comes to uh you know getting strong you can absolutely get strong you know doing sets 10 15 because you're increasing your lean body mass do you need to do sets of three four no but what I would say is like don't necessarily count them out because uh a lot of people actually just do really well with variety so you know period ization was kind of a a big thing for lifting back in the day and now we've kind of shown that at least in the research studies it doesn't appear to produce greater gains in lean body mass maybe a little bit better strength gains but that's probably just because people Peak better when you're periodizing things but what tends to actually be shown is that people just tend to like periodization better because they're varying their repetitions they're not as bored right so you never want to kind of poo poo the psychological effects of those things I talk about this with diet as well adherence is the most important thing just getting people to come in and do it so especially for people who are coming into the gym you know if they you know if if they're just trying to get stronger and be healthy well for me if

[00:27:46] I'm like talking to them or coaching them or whatever it is it's like well what do you enjoy what's going to get you to show up consistently right oh you don't you don't want to free squat that's fine let's leg press you know there's there's many ways to skin a cat uh you don't want a barbell deadlift okay no problem let's do some rdls you know those sorts of things uh you know slightly less technical lifts are still going to produce really great uh gains in terms of strength lean body mass those sorts of things so if you're not going to specifically compete in a strength sport there's so many paths to roam in terms of getting stronger and increasingly in body mass so do you think there are some principles for example like um let's say a person isn't um confident that they have the technical ability to execute a squat or a deadlift let's look at a hip Thruster again you can screw that up too and you could hurt yourself but it's a lot harder to hurt yourself doing that um do you think there is still an essential need for some sort of compound Movement

[00:28:47] Like a hip Thruster at least as a compliment or a leg press as you point out you know it's it's pretty funny like I went through a phase where everything I learned from the magazines the Bro Science I was like well this all has to be junk you know and now we're actually having studies come out that are validating some of this Bro Science from like 2030 years ago so there does appear to be like uh different areas of the leg muscles the quadriceps for example that are better activated by say a leg extension uh compared to a leg press compared to a squat so I do think it is good to have variety I think it is good to have compound lifts as well um and in fact there's some interesting data that suggests that you don't have to get as close to failure on compound lifts to still get the same stimulation compared to isolation exercises where you you do seem to have to get much closer to failure to get those benefits um but also just thinking about like again if we're kind of like looking at the longevity or the quality of life piece what is you know most analogous to what these people are going to be doing and where they're going to be needing it well if it's bending over and picking something up that's some kind of hinge right some kind of hinge um if it's you know sitting down and standing back up some kind of squat now you can use variations right and I would never I don't want to say never because it's a it's a superlative uh but I very rarely would take somebody who's like fresh off the street and just and just put a barbell on their back and say okay learn how to squat because I mean it's going to be like Bambi trying to stand up right yeah um ideally you're probably going to you know maybe even start them off with no weight and just teach them how to hinge you know how to use their hips how to use their knees um how to track you know their their legs with their feet and those sorts of things and just balance because if you've never like put a barbell on your back I mean it's it's not a comfortable position um and honestly to do it well you shouldn't feel comfortable you should feel very tight you know most places uh and then like once they're established with that then moving to where they're like holding a kettle bell in front of them and then you can progress with weight with that and then maybe you progress to something like a safety bar you know where they're not having to worry so much about hands and whatnot uh to a box and then eventually take the box away and then maybe then you can progress to a barbell squat um but I would say that you know the Puritan in me would be like yes everybody should barbell squat but I know that that's not true I think the biggest thing is just just getting something close and analogous to the things that are going to be important in your day-to-day life if you get as you get older especially if you know quality of life is important to you and I mean when we talk about you know people who fall as elderly I think I read something insane like half the people over age 65 who go in the hospital for a fall never come out or or I think it's something of that nature yeah I mean I've seen many studies on this the the the one that sticks out of my mind was 30 to 40% of people over the age of 65 who break their hip uh will not live will be dead within a year of that insult yeah because you got infection and then you have them that you're also like they're going to have to be immobilized so long and they get pneumonia or adasis pneumonia or something like that so yeah it's um it's it's awful I mean I I I think you know there's a study and I I think I even mentioned this on a previous podcast but we we should link to it it's it was an Australian study that took a group of older women I don't remember exactly how old they were but they certainly looked like they were in their 60s or above uh who all had Osteo at least osteopenia if not osteoporosis and it put them on a a relatively unsophisticated lifting program unsophisticated in that there wasn't a lot of instruction other than just pickup weights it was mostly just pick up weights and uh I saw the video on

[00:32:46] YouTube of the pi discussing this isn't it fantastic y it because they're in this totally old school gym and you've got these old ladies picking up weights walking around some of them getting really I remember one lady was picking up her body weight yeah I mean she was basically deadlifting her body weight y these are women who had never lifted a weight before and their symptoms just got so much better absolutely and I mean the best thing you can do for like bone density is lift weight so this isn't like a mutually exclusive thing in fact people get really focused on the bone density portion of this when we talk about Falls and whatnot so they get very focused on how do we keep them from breaking their hip what if they didn't fall in the first place y right what if they had the strength to catch themselves exactly the balance to catch themselves uh and then like again even if they did fall if you have more muscle mass you're probably going to have more bone density as well these are all things that are going to help and you know resistance training is great because you can have these other sort of interventions that can improve lean body mass and whatnot but they all work way better with resistance training because you're creating the need for the tissue um and that's something I think that has been missed a little bit is theological perspective of this which is you have to give your body a reason to lay down tissue muscle tissue is pretty energetically expensive relatively speaking so again I'm kind of speaking philosophically but the body is not just going to go oh yeah we got some extra calories let's just lay down some lean tissue it doesn't make sense because from the body's perspective the number one thing it's trying to do is keep you alive long enough to reproduce and then it once you've done that it's just trying to um prevent you from starving like the the risk of dying from starvation over the course of human history is way is magnitudes greater than like diseases from too much nutrition I mean that's basically a 20th 21st century problem so the idea that oh well like if I eat some higher protein I can lay down some more lean body mass yeah you can but it's going to be really really minimal compared to what you can build through resistance training and then when you couple resistance training with high enough protein um or you know any of these other modalities now you're creating the turnover in the tissue that the body has the requirement to lay down that tissue so what do we know about the um

[00:35:23] Peak capacity for strength as a person ages does this differ between men and women and I'm sure there's variability for people but I mean on a per pound basis are you stronger today than you were at 20 yeah I am stronger today than I was at 20 um are you stronger than you were at 35 no no that's come off my Peak a little bit but that's I don't think that's like a sarcopenia thing I just think that that's accumulation of injuries and not being able to train the way I used to be able to train so I used to be able to train much harder than I can train now like my uh my Governor is not the work ethic it's the it's the okay how hard can I train before the pain level gets too high so it's not that you're losing type uh two fibers that you're losing some of the 2A or 2B fibers and that that's why you're not quite as strong you would you do you believe that on a muscle biopsy basis you're you could be as strong now as you were at 30 I think I probably could um it's it's if you look at the research literature you do see differences between young and old but most of those get amili orated when you start adding in resistance training and more to your point you know the idea how much strength could I gain how much lean mass could I gain based on what I've seen so let's take men and women for example um women have been shown to gain just as much lean mass as a percentage of their starting lean mass it is the relative increase so for example if people add 10% lean mass something like that well if you're a male and you have you know 70 kilos of lean mass now you're 77 if you're a female and you had 50 kilos of lean mass now you're 55 right so the male added seven kilos the female added five kilos but relative to their start they added the same and that's what the research literature says is they pretty much can add the same amount as a percentage of the starting lean mass and the same thing for strength uh and actually there's some evidence that women may be able to tolerate higher training volumes than men too now I'm not sure if that's is that across all ages you think or is that within a certain age they've only really looked at it in kind of young adults okay um like 20s and 30s so it's hard to say but I wonder if that's just more of a function of they're just smaller bodies handling less weight I do my wife would tell you that no one can handle a cold less than me because and I think it's true I have an insanely High pain tolerance except for when my sinuses are congested and I have a miserable cough then I turn into a little baby so there might be something about women just being tougher too yeah uh I think so I've I've thought about this quite a bit so if you look at um like let's look at Super heavyweight powerlifters just as an extreme example right and these are guys that weigh over what what's oh like Ray Williams for example so he's one of the greatest um drug tested powerlifters history first man to Raw squad over 1,000 lbs uh he was a college football player they dexed him he had 308 lb of lean mass and he's probably over 400 lbs of of total body weight the man how much lean mass uh three over 300 lb incredible um now his like let's say we're talking about working with 80% of a one rep max his 80% is 800 lb a female is 80% if she's doing a One Max of 300 lb is 240 lbs the same percentage I'm not sure that you can say that the same thing in terms of what happens with the body um I know because at the end of the day connective tissue is connective tissue right yeah I know very very few super heavyweight powerlifters who train the main lifts like three four times a week like some of the the lighter weight classes do so I do think there's something about like the absolute load so I part of me thinks the the idea that women can recover a little bit better might be that they're just using absolute lower loads but we'd have to have some more intricate there's an interesting point about that study because I know the one that um that you were talking about and I've heard people use that study to suggest that testosterone is not important in muscle gain the idea being if women can add 10% to their base and men are adding 10% to their base clearly men and women have a log full difference into testosterone therefore testosterone doesn't matter but of course you only need to look at tested versus untested powerlifters and bodybuilders to know testosterone's doing something so how do you reconcile these I think part of it is so if we look at like let's take the men and women example um there one of the main benefits of testosterone is the increase in

[00:40:23] Satellite cell number that you get which is going to increase your potential for increasing muscle mass so um I don't want to talk about this like it's hard and stone proven but there's a theory out there I tend to agree with called The myonuclear Domain Theory so for those people who aren't familiar with satellite cells satellite cells are

[00:40:42] Quant cells that sit on kind of the outside of a muscle fiber and through various ways resistance training testosterone whatever uh you can get those satellite cells to be donated to the muscle fiber and muscle fiber is the only cells that are multinucleated and we think the reason is is that each myonuclei can only control protein synthesis for a certain area so you can only get the muscle fiber can only grow as big as it has myonuclei so the more myonuclei you can donate the greater your potential is and so one of the things that we think is a reason that men have more lean mass than women you know is during puberty because up till puberty males and females tend to have similar amounts of lean mass but during puberty that's when we start to see these hormonal differences emerge and that exposure to testosterone um increases that myonuclei number and just gives them a greater overall potential for lean mass which again makes sense if you think about it as a relative percentage um so now when you talk about taking exogenous levels of testosterone now you're donating even more myuc ey and so you can uh reach a higher ceiling so I think honestly I mean this this might give me a little bit of trouble but I think that's actually the strongest argument against kind of the um the crossover of transgender Sports of um you know people who previously were male now identify as female is you can't really get rid can't get rid those extra nuclei of of the of the long-term benefit that's conveyed by the fusion of those myonuclei so for example and we see this with like muscle memory for example so we know that when you stop if you've trained before but you stop training you can gain back muscle much faster than it takes to build it and they've even shown this in people who have stopped training for years that they gain it back faster than it originally took to build it the other interesting thing is they uh did a study where they looked at uh giving testosterone to it was either rats or mice I can't remember which one so they they were able to resistance train them and I it's funny to see these like rat resistance training setups I'm sure you've seen them um so one group they did not give testosterone the other group they gave testosterone now of course both gained strength both gain lean body mass but the group getting testosterone obviously gain more then they had a complete wash out period And basically for as long as it took for them both to get back to kind of their original lean mass number then they both had them train again but no drug in either group and the group that originally had testosterone just that once gained muscle significantly faster than the other group and our best understanding is it's probably these myonuclei that got fused through that extra testosterone that confers that long-term benefit so that's kind of how we think about do we think that that's kind of like only during a critical window of development or does that happen if you're 40 years old and you're taking exogenous testosterone see that's where it gets more tricky we don't we don't really know um I I think part of it may be you know if you're if you have a certain testosterone and I'm there's no data on this so I'm I'm speculating 100% but if you have a certain level of testosterone you've had that you know through puberty and now you're an adult and you kind of maintain that that's just kind of your native natural let's say you don't get too obese or to underweight whatever um you've probably fused the amount of myonuclei that you're going to fuse at least from testosterone right but now if you start taking exogenously you've now ramped that up another notch now you can fuse more myonuclei which again anecdotally would make sense because if we look at the drug use in bodybuilding it's continued to go up up up up up and now we're getting to the point where you know these guys really aren't getting much bigger because uh there's just only so many drugs they can take before I mean and we're seeing it now many of them are

[00:44:56] I think last year there was something like a half dozen uh professional bodybuilders who died so it's getting to the point where they really can't go any higher in drugs and you're seeing that lean mass start to cap out and this is why because you compete in tested or drug-free powerlifting as good as it is they make you guys take a polygraph that says have you used drugs in five years and that's an interesting window of time right because you'd think like why would they care if you used performance-enhancing drugs five years ago but in theory they do care because you may still confer a benefit 5 years later even if you've actually been drug-free so that's what we did in natural bodybuilding when I competed natural bodybuilding in powering they don't do the polygraph they don't so you just you cannot test positive for so we completely underwater so basically the way the water drug testing works is once you enter the water drug testing pool so you've qualified for some kind of international competition um you could be drug tested at any time so you have to provide have to use a whereabouts form you have to provide your whereabouts all that kind of thing and if they if it's during your window and they say hey you need to be drug tested and you don't do it you can get a strike uh against you and be out of competition for a certain period of time so there's pluses and minuses to both methods right like polygraph obviously is not something that's crazy accurate right there's I don't think they allow it in a court of law um but just the the idea that you are going to be asked that and it could be you know something that you fail probably keeps quite a few people from doing it and the other thing I tell people is there's just not really any money in this stuff so it's you know are there cheaters absolutely is it rampant I would kind of be surprised because there's just not that much money now when you talk about sports where you can make millions of dollars yeah I would not be surprised if there's rampant cheating because you're talking about millions of dollar uh I think the most money that's ever been on the line for me competing was like $2 or $3,000 so it's you know I love to do it not being done for the money no no for sure yeah so um with the with the polygraph at least it allows you to kind of go back like you said now interestingly the data that we just talked about kind of suggests that well if it was five years ago it doesn't matter you still got an advantage yeah but they're also trying to balance that with you know at some point you got to let people come clean if they've used in the past yeah and and I actually agree with that point of view in terms of like

[00:47:26] I I spoke with the guy who competed in bodybuilding he's like you know I was 17 years old some guy to gym gave me something I was an idiot I didn't like ask what it was and you know I got like a bunch of side effects and like you know I got bigger and stronger but he's like you know looking back it was like I really regret doing that at that age well should that guy be punished for like his entire life and not able to compete in in drug-free bodybuilding I mean you can make the argument and I understand the argument but you know I

[00:47:54] I'm in favor of being a little bit more inclusive in terms of of that so you know you've you mentioned that you know you're as you're getting ready to train for worlds just I think it was a couple days yesterday you you said to me you know your back kind of hurt you really backed off um also this is your first uh major meet International meet in about seven years and a lot of that was due to injuries y of which back was the most prevalent but I think you also mentioned a little bit of knee pain as well right hipe so how do you think about this personally how much longer do you want to be loading yourself at the you know basically putting cars on your back and lifting cars off the ground right which is effectively what you're doing yeah I mean candidly if I went out and I won Master's worlds

[00:48:48] I'd probably give a real hard thought about like okay I I think I'm done at least competing in this uh but the other part of me is kind of like I think that part of my problem is I love to train so much I never really gave myself the time to get painf free as soon as I started feeling better I would just start pushing again and I do think I've slowly gotten more intelligent because I used to think I was basically Superman so I think I've just matured a little bit and even like yesterday like getting to a certain point warming up on squats and saying all right it's not happening today um there's no reason to try and force this

[00:49:32] I think previously I would kind of create a narrative in my mind of I'm going to power through this because it's what it takes and yeah at some points like you have to I think one of the the most important things is knowing when to press the gas pedal and knowing when to back off a little bit and sometimes discretion is the better part of valor and for me I'm probably a little bit weird in that like I would train three four hours a day because I just love to train I love the way it makes me feel I love feeling strong uh part of me the egocentric part of me probably loves to feel like a badass loading up you know 5600 pounds in the gym and whatnot um but I've kind of gotten to the point now where I'm like all right if it's there today we take it if it's not there we take what's there and then we live to fight another day because I've just had so many experiences where I've tried to press on this and with the way pain works the more pain you have the more pain you're going to have because you just end up getting fixated and ruminating on it and the research actually shows that the more you ruminate on it the more you think about it and the more times you trigger it the worse it's going to get and so it's like this delicate balance between you know I kind of know how far I can press something before I'm making it worse because the research also shows that you don't want to completely just stop lifting because you drain and then when you come back even if you're pain free you're more likely to re-trigger it because you've lost that adaptation so it's kind of like when you have those pain triggers trying to find either a weight amount or a movement pattern or something similar to what you're trying to do but it's low enough pain that you can start to build back from that so like for example yesterday um ideally I would have done some squats and deadlifts couldn't do them okay I'm going to go and do some leg press I'm still going to get some stimulation for my quads the primary movers of the squat uh I'm going to go do single leg dumbbell rdls I was able to do those with no pain is it loading it as much as I would like no but I'm still using my hamstrings I'm using my lower back I'm getting in some of that movement pattern and uh I'm still getting a training effect some adaptation without further triggering that pain so and then so what did you do today so today I I just kind of was like um pretty much just cleaning up stuff I missed throughout the week um so I just had some dumbbell pressing um I did some more single leg rdls and I did some

[00:52:05] Mobility work so not not a whole lot of intensive stuff um but you know really when you consider like what I do ideally all I would do would be squat bench press and deadlifts because it's completely specific to what I'm going to express on competition day but those are also very very fatiguing movements I think I think part of that too is just when you know how much you can do and you know how much you've done you kind of have like this anxiety um about those movements because it's like you're almost being tested and comparing them to what you've previously done so sometimes just creating you know a little bit of a A variation of that movement where you're not you can kind of just let the weight happen and pick your RP and if if it's not you know a previous set weight it doesn't bother you so I've started using a lot more variations to build that Baseline level of strength and then again when it comes to the actual competition lifts I'm mostly just focusing on doing like heavy singles and building my volume through other areas and how many times a week will you do those heavy single workouts uh once or twice okay once or twice just depending on how I feel i' I've often thought there would be really interesting experiment like to do uh I wouldn't do it but I'd like to oversee it I'd like to see it being done I guess which is um you take a powerlifter and their entire training cycle like six months building up to a competition they have no idea what's on the bar so they're basically they have a really good coach and the coach is telling them for every set how many reps to do or what rpe to go until so it's completely being programmed but you get out you eliminate the problem you just talked about which is you take the psychology away and you don't let the athlet suffer from knowing oh my God I should be able to do this many reps I should they don't know so one day they might get down on a bar and the bar is going to be really light and they're going to be told you're GNA you know I think you're going to get 10 reps here let's see it and they have no idea what percentage of their Max it ever is so it's interesting one of the top lifters in the world somebody I competed against multiple times a guy named Bryce Lewis um so he actually trained an entire training cycle that way so he would have his girlfriend put trash bags over the weights um I don't know if he still does that but he so she would load up every set so she but she had to be the one to know what every set needed to be in advance so she was um she's a competitive powerlifter as well I think a world champion as well and so yeah she would kind of like look at what his rpes were supposed to be at load the weight up put the trash bags over it and then he would go do it you know and probably super interesting now for me that might work but I for whatever reason you like to control a little bit yeah there's some people on meet day they'll tell their coach don't tell me what you're putting on the bar just tell me what it is just just put it on I'll go do it right I want to know uh I don't know maybe it's just part of how my brain's wired whatever because I also have a trust with my coach and and all the coaches I've had have been great honestly I've worked with a couple different people and they've all been great um I just had such a good um trust in my coach that I just knew if they put something on the bar they're not going to put something on the bar that they don't think I can do they know

[00:55:38] I can do it it's my job to go and execute and I I think that that's a a really when you have a good like meet day coach that is so valuable because like I know they're not going to put something on I can't do so it's just up to me to go out and do it so what about nutrition how does nutrition faction into factor into powerlifting you're you're at 208 pounds or so right now that's about the weight you're going to compete at um you once told me that the difference between powerlifting and bodybuilding is in powerlifting all of your pain is compressed into the gym in bodybuilding most of your pain is actually out of the gym yeah uh and having not done either I mean I did some powerlifting growing up but but basically having never really done either of those at a serious level

[00:56:24] I I can appreciate it just based on the concept so you know you've been here now a few days we've had a bunch of meals together you're just eating like a normal guy like you know we're we're eating whatever the hell we want um is there anything you will do as you get closer to the meat with your nutrition specifically because I know that you'd like to come in two pounds or so below your target but that's something you can modify in days outside of just calories is there something you're going to manipulate with macros or anything that you're going to be thinking about you know with respect to more creatine that you're going to be loading or anything that you're you're needling that way not really I mean at least for me because

[00:57:05] I'm sitting you know very close to the weight class that I'm going to compete in um I don't really have to make a bunch of changes now if it was you know if I was sitting at say 25 lbs 217 PBS then it gets to the point where a weight cut to 205 becomes a little bit untenable because uh where I compete at it's a 2-hour weighin so if you're cutting you know 10 15 PBS you're not going to be able to rehydrate and refuel quickly enough 2 hours meaning 2 hours between we in and competition and lifting correct yeah so yeah unlike the day before where you'd have a full day to catch up right so there are organizations where you can weigh in a day before and I think actually one organization had 408 hour weigh in so there were guys which actually in a way makes it more dangerous because people will cut way really really cut oh yeah I think Dan Green who's U really well known tested powerlifter uh I think he weighed in at 220 and then like the next day was walking around at like 255 or something like that my God so just incredible like amounts of weight these guys are cutting um and so yeah you'll see them with IVs and and all that kind of stuff so for us

[00:58:16] I mean it's really like you cut two three maybe 4% of your body weight but you really don't want to go much more than that because with two hours you just don't have time so are you sticking with the same are you doing one are you doing five grams of creatine daily right now yep I so I I keep my creatin in because I can modify with just like sodium and modifying fiber a little bit um to get some water weight out those those last few days uh and like you mentioned I'll usually try to be a little bit under the day before the meat so I can eat enough calories the day before where I don't feel like I'm having to shovel down food because you know if you had to go pretty if I have to go pretty aggressive like for a

[00:58:54] Saturday meet Thursday Friday now on Saturday with that weighin I've got two hours to get food down but there's also a lot of other stuff I got to do I got to get um you know I got to warm up I gotta I want my brain free to think about the stuff I've got to do yeah not be like okay well I've got to get down this I've got to get down that like I'll take some pedite or or some kind of electrolytes those sorts of things but for the most part I've never really had issues with cramping uh I've never had issues with energy on meat day um and I think a lot of that is just I keep myself pretty close to within Striking

[00:59:29] Distance and then the other benefit is you know your leverages can change you know based on your weight thickness you know your the tightness of your belt can change all that stuff can make a difference in terms of the style of squat you do or or how you feel so just you know being able to train in a manner that's going be very similar to how I compete I feel like is a little bit of an advantage for me compared to people who have to cut quite a bit of weight and if you had to guess by dexa what would your body fat be at weighin uh I caliper at around 8% so I would say

[01:00:00] Dex is probably like 11 or 12 something like that because in my experience Dex is usually three 4% higher than calipers so by most people standards still incredibly lean yeah but not necessarily by bodybuilding standards of course yeah absolutely so okay well let's actually let's talk a little bit more about creatine um we talked about it really briefly on one of our podcasts but we we were kind of at the end so I want to kind of go back and make sure people understand that it's one of the supplements we get the most questions about it's also one of the supplements that we feel the most confident telling patients like if you know this is a supplement worth taking it's clearly passed test number one which is it safe uh and it passes test number two which is it's probably got efficacy um well I shouldn't say it's got efficacy the real question is you know are you okay with a little bit of weight gain because that's you know you're going to pull more water in so um explain to people a little bit about why creatine is so important and presumably this is something that's really important in powerlifting I'm guessing going into a bodybuilding meat you probably don't want creatine for that extra weight or do you so I think it's actually great for bodybuilding okay great I want to hear about it because I

[01:01:13] I assumed it would you'd have a little more water but maybe the water's all in the muscle and that's where you want it yeah so uh so creatin is a high energy phosphate donor so it in in muscle it exists as phosphocreatine and when you take supplemental creatine uh you'll it'll come into the muscle it'll get a phosphate attached to it phosph creatin and originally the the only mechanism we thought of well it's a high energy phosphate donor so people perform better but then we saw people increase their lean body mass increase their strength uh and there's even like benefits in terms of cognitive benefits appear to be pretty clear that there's some cognitive benefits as well uh so as you mentioned like in terms of safety and efficacy data I mean to me there's no strikes really I tell people I'm like I don't even know why we're having this conversation anymore and it's also you know it's gone up in price a little bit recently because of the supply chain stuff but it's it's still relatively inexpensive incredibly inexpensive for for what you're getting so you know when

[01:02:14] I see people talk about like some of these other supplements and they're not even taking creatin monohydrate I'm like well you're you're stepping over pennies or sorry you're stepping over dollars to pick up pennies because this is just the lowest hanging fruit but are you still even at your size and even at your demand is there any benefit to taking more than about five grams a day some people have postulated there might be I haven't seen really clear evidence for it yet you could argue that there's really no downside to taking the extra that the downside might be some GI irritation for some people creatin can be a GI irritant which I I think we'll

[01:02:51] Circle back to um but we know it it can act as a high energy phosphate donor so when you are exercising or just doing anything you your energy currency of your cell's ATP and in order to drive muscular contraction your ATP donates a phosphate and that liberation of that phosphate to form ADP and a free phosphate is energetically favorable and helps Drive these muscular contractions um so creatin can act or phosphor creatin can act as a high energy phosphate donor to reform uh ATP and allow you to perform better but it's also a really powerful osmolyte and so it pulls water into muscle tissue which in and of itself may actually be anabolic so uh like just a muscle cell being more hydrated there's some evidence that that can actually improve the that it's more anabolic environment uh but regardless of the mechanism we do know that when you take you see improvements in lean mass and some people will say well that's just water well but that's what muscle mostly is muscle is 70% water so whether it's and there's actually research to show that even non-contractile just water improves May improve strength and contract ability so so we're not sure exactly how but it could just be like the volumization of the cell is just a benefit there's also sort of a you you could also kind of make up at least conceptually a framework that says a more hydrated cell is more able to calculate H more more able to carry out its function right so the function of a myofibril is contractile release contract release and it has more water you it sort of seems logical to me that it's going to be better at clearing metabolic waste and recruiting fuel which at least be two things that would factor into its its ability to do that yeah I mean the other thing about it is is um if you look at like anything that improves hypertrophy a big portion of it is water it's it's not just all myof fiiller so I think regardless of the mechanisms I mean it's pretty clear that this stuff works it's pretty clear it's safe uh I mean they've done numerous randomized control trials some of them being well over a year long um yes you get an increase in creatinine which can be a marker of renal function but I think one although the data you know this Lane there was a paper that just came out a couple weeks ago that we were really happy to see we've abandoned looking at uh looking at serum you know uh creatinin for renal function because it's just too easy to get fooled by people with varying muscle mass yeah and training volume so we've completely abandoned it so every time you order

[01:05:45] Labs on somebody and you see their creatinin it'll tell you what their estimated glal filtration for rate is we just ignore it completely we only look at saat and C MH so everything we do is based off that and there was a paper and jamama a couple of weeks ago that basically said as much which is maybe we should look more at cattin C instead of cron so so I would even say that you know hopefully this is a PSA for other docs out there listening and other patients to say please look at my catin c as a way to estimate kidney function yeah I tell people you know there's some other things that can get a little bit wonky like from lifting weights like liver enzymes and whatnot um and I tell people you have to keep in mind these These are markers okay so if you have liver failure or you have kidney failure it's very very likely you will have elevated liver enzymes and elevated uh crine but just because you have elevated liver enzymes or elevated creatinine does not mean that you necessarily have damage to those tissues so you have to disconnect those two uh and I don't think that you know I feel like correlation versus causation is just not something that's taught very well in school because I even see um not really good doctors but some Physicians get so hung up on just well this is on the page and this is supposed to be in normal range and it's not it's like but just look at the person sitting in front of you who obviously works out is in good shape if you're concerned about their their kidneys then do a 24-hour urine collection or an ultrasound or or whatever you have to do to verify that they're safe but I mean I I just I don't worry about that kind of stuff there's also been some people um who have said well creatin can cause hair loss and you you've got to be careful about that um

[01:07:26] I'm not I don't think the data on that's very compelling at all so there was a single study that showed an increase in DHT from uh supplementing with creatin one study 2009 I've never seen it replicated never seen any follow up how much did DHT increase by I'd have to go back and look I can't remember the exact amount it was significant um but the interesting thing is we know creatin doesn't affect Androgen levels so it's kind of like where is this increase in

[01:07:56] DHT coming from right like it has to come from somewhere and we like I said there's no randomized control trials showing that creatin actually causes changes to hair follicules or um actual hair loss so maybe it does but I I would think that if that data existed we probably would have seen it already do we think that there are significant benefits from from supplementation even on non-lifting days so for example on hard cardio days assuming we're not talking about Sprints so clearly there would be a benefit in sprinting because the creatine phosphate system is really lending to that uh ATP generation during that incredibly high-intensity stuff but like if you're out there doing a V2 Max day which is that's a really hard day those are kind of three to eight minute allout intervals um which is aerobic it's Peak aerobic do you still get a benefit do you think from creatine

[01:08:55] I would guess yes um there was a recent metaanalysis that came out and looked at like different ways of taking creatin and it was useful data but it it it in some ways it was kind of uh frustrating because they basically showed well if you take five grams a day you get increases in lean mass in strength and performance you take more than five grams a day you also get increases in lean mass in performance but it's hard to kind of compare them directly based on the way they did The Meta analysis and then they also looked at okay if we just take them on lifting days okay you get benefits if you take them on non-lifting days you also get benefits what I would say is that you probably can get away with just taking on lifting days um but keep in mind that the benefits of creatin are an accumulation so you've really got to saturate the muscle cell that's that's that's the key cuz when we were kids you would load it you would do like I feel like you did 30 grams a day for a week or something crazy and then five gr thereafter and I of course this was reading bro science magazines you would then do that for a couple months and then you would come off it for a month and then you would repeat the cycle am I making that up or is that about no no that was definitely a thing um so the I

[01:10:09] I will say that the research does show if you load it you will saturate the muscle cell faster now I always try to tell people like there's no Solutions there's only trade-offs right so the trade-off with this is a lot of people will get pretty bad GI irritation with loading creatin uh in terms of like GI bloating uh nausea those sorts of things so um if you just take if you're playing the long game it doesn't really matter right I mean you're you're talking about getting the results you want in one week as opposed to three weeks it's really not a big difference so if you just want to take five grams a day within a few weeks you'll be saturated you'll be getting the same benefits so it's really

[01:10:51] I guess if you were somebody who' never taken it before and you've got like a a big athletic event coming up and you really want to be on it for it that could make sense but for most people I would say just take five grams a day and when people kind of say well you know what if I just take it on lifting days yeah you probably could but it's also like it's pretty darn cheap yeah um actually think it's just easier to not for it's easier to forget something when you only do it on certain days sometimes it's just easier to make it a part of the routine yeah and what I would say too is people ask me about timing of creatin those sorts of things there's some really small really tenuous

[01:11:29] I really want to emphasize that evidence that perhaps after a workout might be better than before a workout but I tell people just take it whenever you'll take it regularly so for me I just get up in the morning and I take it and and that's what I worry about now as far as like the cycling on and off so there's evidence that you do reduce your endogenous production of creatin when you're on it there's also evidence that the creatin receptor on the muscle cell does downregulate a little bit now the important thing to keep in mind is that doesn't mean that your intracellular levels of creatin are falling so they've actually never shown that even like far out that those phosphocreatine levels in your muscle drop so what I would say is

[01:12:13] I don't really think there's a reason to come off because they have shown that if you do come off within a month or so kind of everything goes back to normal but you lose the benefit of the supplemental creatin so I would say as long as intramuscular levels of creatin are not falling there's really no benefit to coming off I mean it used to be like I think people kind of just equated supplements with steroids and so like well you're supposed to cycle steroids so we should cycle supplements and you know creatin is not hormonal it's not the same biof feedback loop so

[01:12:45] I would say there's probably no reason to cycle it so something else that kind of bridges the world between bodybuilding and powerlifting is this this question I wanted to ask you about which is basically one of Newton's Laws right so Force equals masstimes acceleration okay so um let's just say I'm on the ground I've got my dumbbells or I'm on a bench and I've got my dumbbells and I'm going to press them one school of thought is press them as quickly as possible because Force equals mass times acceleration the mass of this thing is fixed so any speed with which I lift it is accelerating because I'm moving Against Gravity but the fact faster I can do it the greater the force but of course at some point the weight becomes so heavy that you increase the effort more on the mass variable than on the acceleration variable so in other words we can manipulate mass and acceleration to reach maximum Force now an extreme example of that is you doing a one rep max right but as you pointed out the more Elite a powerlifter becomes the lower that is in other words the lower the acceleration is and therefore the more they're emphasizing the mass which is of course what you get scored on no one scoring you on the acceleration right how does how do we think about that in terms of mixing and matching the mass versus the acceleration variable in an effort to optimize Force because of course we also don't want to go to maximum Force every time because if I did maximum force with a lightweight I'd probably move it too quickly I could injure myself as well so do you think about the variation mass and acceleration when you're moving weight so yeah so if you think about what the expression of strength is it's basically Force um so as you mentioned if it's a very heavy weight it'll just move slower if it's a lightweight you can still apply the same force and it will just move more quickly uh so this is actually a concept that um I Heard uh my coach Zach talk about on a podcast was they do quite a bit of what do to a heavy single or double or whatever it is and then our back off sets are relatively light like talking RP four or five but trying to move them as quickly as possible on both I let's just talk about the concentric now and then I want to actually come and have the discussion about the Ecentric so on the concentric exactly and because that is in terms of strength that is the closest expression of that so in other words what if I'm understanding you correctly you're saying your coach is saying look on the heavy weights we'll they're going to move slow because they have to but to keep training strength I want you to move as quickly as possible as we come down on weight Bingo Bingo and that so the idea is well we're still applying the same Force it's going to move more quickly but it's going to be less fatiguing because it's lighter weight so that's kind of the the concept behind it now in terms of is that happening with you so for example when you did let's just say your back wasn't hurting yesterday if you were out there doing today was an rpe 6 day do you think that your speed would have increased sufficiently that you would have almost matched 90% of the force you'd put out on a one rep max best it's hard to tell because

[01:16:00] I've never actually done the calculation of the force I I imagine there's probably a Sweet Spot somewhere in there where like twoo heavy probably has less Force than you know um but yeah I'm not I'm not sure where that is um as far as like um hypertrophy I think that force is probably less important I think it's more about just having s enough sufficiently hard set however you slice that so uh for example like the whole idea of time under tention training was very uh popular um and if you look at some of the initial research um I think there was a study where they had people doing curls and I may butcher the study so I apologize but it was kind of like a 6-second Ecentric 6-second concentric and they had them go to failure and they had another group that just did normal kind of cadence and they had them match the number of reps and found that the group that was uh doing the slow eccentrics and slow concentrics gained more muscle and so people said we'll see there you go well the problem is they were using like 30% of of their one rep max for like 10 reps going really slow well if you're going at a normal Pace how many times could you do 30% of one rep max I mean you could do 30 40 50 reps right so it wasn't I don't want to say the study was bad it's not bad it answered the question it wanted to answer but but if you're going to compare them straight up really what it needs to be is if you take both of these things to failure so the same level of intensity or sufficient difficulty what does the outcome look like then and so when they do that they really see very little difference between uh slow lifting and fast lifting um there was a study that just came out that looked at fast

[01:17:49] Ecentric versus slow ascentric and found that there was actually a little bit better uh outcomes with fast Ecentric compared to slow eccentrics and that actually relates back to for with respect to muscle mass yeah which you mentioned this to me earlier the only time I've ever done a fast Ecentric is on my xtrafly machine that machine that I in the gym because you're forced to like it's it's pulling you down so quickly that you're screaming down and you're coming to a stop outside of that it never occurred to me to do an Ecentric quickly like if I'm doing Ecentric dead lifts I'm actually almost trying to come down as slowly as I can in my head thinking this is more beneficial because

[01:18:31] I was thinking it's more time under tension it's probably partly with the lift too as well um and um there's probably it's kind it's kind of like you don't want to take it too extreme right like if you're act like if you're doing a squat and you just dive bomb and there's no tension on the bar right one that's going to look really bad when you're trying to come out of it uh and two it's probably not the what they're actually seeing in the research

[01:19:02] I think the idea of let's use a bicep curl because that's a it's a safer exercise so This research suggests that you've take two people that are doing the exact same weight and they're the same people basically and they're doing the same speed of their concentric and one of them is doing let's say a it's a 2 second concentric and he's doing a 2cond decentric and the other guy's going two up six down mhm they're saying saying the 2 two will technically produce more hypertrophy might be better so I say might because it's just so interesting yeah now if you think about like mechanotransduction and you know the force the mechanical tension being applied to a muscle when you're kind of getting to that point where the muscle is stopping and then having to come the other way yeah if it's fast I mean that's probably more attenion at that specific point yeah yeah so we just don't know enough about this stuff right now to really be able to say for sure but I think you know and I also don't want to make it sound like there's no benefit to like slow movements especially for people who like have pain or they don't want to go heavy you know those sorts of things then you know slowing down a movement to either one because a lot of times pain can be tied to Velocity if you just slow down a movement it won't be as painful um so

[01:20:17] I've used Tempo training like pretty liberally in some of my training Cycles just to make it so I had to use less weight weight but still make it pretty difficult now was it as good as you know me doing my regular movement maybe not but it's still better than doing nothing right so it's always important to keep those like those things in mind in terms of like don't let you know Perfection be the enemy of of progress uh so I do think that like slow movements still have application uh for people like I said who have pain or if they don't feel comfortable with heavyweight uh you can make it much more difficult just by slowing down the movement and at the the end of the day the biggest determinant is just doing enough number of hard sets however that kind of looks now there are a couple of patients that I've had over the years whose disdain for exercise is so great that the most I can negotiate them doing is one 20 to 30 minute workout per week doing the super slow protocol where they go to if you you know they have these specific gyms that have very specific types of equipment Y and they're going to do I don't know maybe to 10 different machines and they're only going to do one set and it's going to be to failure um and the sets are typically tight rated to be somewhere between 90 and 105 seconds so about a minute 30 to a minute 45 is the sweet spot right so if you're going more than that the weight's too heavy if you're uh the weight's too light if you're less than that the weight's too heavy and they might do like four simple body four upper lower so there might be a press a pull a bicep a tricep a leg press you know all that kind of stuff now the reason I sort of negotiate that is my alternative is they'll do nothing and I'm thinking I probably can't get any better benefit in 30 minutes once a week than I can there um if it's done right now the challenge that I've realized with that type of exercise because I've done this many times myself it's actually really hard to go to failure at the end of the day it can be done but it can't be done often and I actually think it's really hard to do it eight consecutive times which is basically what you're asking a person to do in 30 minutes to truly go to failure um so so what is your take on the super slow protocols which clearly guys like Mike mener have you know like there are really famous bodybuilders who have taken these protocols to the Limit but what's your take both on the physiology of it and then the psychology of it yeah so I think that just kind of shows that there's you know there's many ways to skin a cat right um and when it comes to hypertrophy uh you really have a lot of options and certainly no one will argue that you can grow can't grow muscle that way because you can um it is kind of remarkable isn't it to think that like yeah these people could do 30 minutes once a week and grow muscle yeah in fact there was there was actually um so a friend of mine Jeremy the he's professor at Old Miss uh oh yeah

[01:23:26] Jeremy's been on the podcast yeah bfr yeah yeah he's great um my my claim to fame is I actually introduced him to bfr so but they actually published a paper where they looked at um just flexing like isometric contraction and we're actually able to show like with long isometric contractions like some hypertrophy which before that we always thought oh isometric doesn't actually grow muscle right like there's there's very little benefit to it so yeah I I think that we just I hate to be the the the typical Tools in a toolkit but things are tools in a toolkit yeah and we're talking about people who are you know they don't want to be bodybuilders they just want to get some of these benefits from resistance training it really is what can we do to get them in the gym consistently and is it as good as like you know compound movements with free bar and you know training at a normal Pace maybe not but it's a heck of a lot better than them sitting at home and doing nothing yeah so I think I think that's really important to understand and when it comes to like the super slow the physiology of the hypertrophy response what's Wild is we still don't fully understand how the process of muscle hypertrophy occurs like we know that you need to progressively overload to continue uh causing the hypertrophy response we know what things are associated with hypertrophy but every time they try to get really granular with it we still have a lot of gaps in our understanding now one of the things we do think matters is uh metabolic stress so this idea that you're accumulating these metabolic byproducts inside the muscle as you work it out so that kind of like the bfr the the pump right um that does appear to have some decent mechanistic data to support it like in terms of you know hydrogen ion accumulation how that may affect uh some you know signaling uh those sorts of things even right down to like calcium release into the cylas so I think when you're dealing with like that super slow protocol you're kind of pushing a little bit more on that metabolic stress as opposed to like the like the mechanical tension portion of it but there still is mechanical tension

[01:25:52] I think a lot of people think about mechanical tension just literally is weight on the bar and I think what people don't realize is mechanical tension is is kind of cumulative because otherwise why wouldn't we just load up a heavy single and just do that every time right because that's the most amount of mechanical tension you can get in terms of like a a set point in time so to me it seems pretty obvious that mechanical attention has has to be like a little bit cumulative throughout a set and so if you're doing super slow okay you might have a pretty lightweight but you've also got a really long time that's it's under that really lightweight and you're accumulating the that metabolic stress and some mechanical tension so to me it makes sense that you would have some of those benefits what I would say is I think the bigger downside is you're probably not going to get as strong doing that methodology as you are actually like doing a little bit more normal pace and it may have a little bit less functionality uh than somebody who's done kind of more traditional strength

[01:26:51] TR that's my bigger issue with it truthfully is it's the the one I don't think people really can go to failure because I I mean hard you'll get a couple you'll get a couple of sets here and there but it's really difficult so I think you're well I think it's easier to do an exercise where you don't have to go to failure but you make up for it on volume but then your other point here is

[01:27:09] I think you're really missing out on the reason why we exercise we generally don't ex I mean sometimes we exercise to be a better at lifting powerlifting is the only example of that but outside of that we lift for life and I do work that when we rob people of movements that require more than one plane movements that require balance and some coordination we're not giving them the full benefit of the exercise of the reason to exercise that is yeah and I would agree with that and again that has to be one of those things where it's better than the couch as you said better than the couch yeah and so I mean we I think a lot of people when they they get into things especially now we have paralysis by analysis and I'll I'll tell people like you know at a certain point you're paralysis by analysis is actually just your excuse to do nothing so just go do go do something right like go go throw something against the wall and see what sticks right um but when it comes to people who may have been sedentary I mean sometimes the conversation I'll have is hey what do you like doing like is there something you like doing right and let's press on that a little bit um because if the if the only outcome that we're going for is perfection well not a lot of people are going to be able to hit that so yeah I really do think a lot of it boils down to a conversation of okay yeah this isn't as good as this but it's still better than that and I think that conversation is a lot of the stuff that gets uh lost that Nuance gets lost in a lot of these conversations especially because and you know you're an optimized

[01:28:54] I love to talk about optimal because it's like as scientists that's kind of where we live and what we think about but it's like do people really need optimal to get out of like the state we're in where so many people have type two diabetes and have uh you know obesity and and these s are dying from heart disease and cancer no we just like honestly if we get to get 50% of the way there probably see a huge benefit well and that's really the flip side to this the stats I gave earlier in this discussion which were how uh High VO2 max and high strength were the two biggest predictors of longevity and that's true by a country mile but the uh part that I didn't mention that is now worth mentioning is that when you break people down into quartiles or quintiles of fitness and strength the biggest jump in uh the benefit right so the biggest Improvement in mortality always comes from being in the bottom quintile or cortile to the

[01:29:55] Next One MH this is a really important point that shouldn't be lost so people are sitting here listening to us thinking look at these two idiots who train all day and love this stuff like that's nice for you to say no actually you're going to achieve the most benefit when you go from being in the lowest 20% of the population to the second 20th percent of the population and that can't be overstated I mean that's so in other words the curve looks like this and I think one of the biggest failures the fitness industry quite honestly is convincing people that they need to have a shredded six-pack and be really muscular to be fit like no you don't have to in fact I would argue that most people that are that lean probably don't feel that fit I know that when I was very lean for bodybuilding I had no energy no sex drive uh thought about food all the time and you know was a miserable human so like the the real sweet spot is probably where you got a little bit of fluff you're still relatively lean but you know even not getting to that point just moving I mean look at the step data the step data is is very very clear too like there is a huge inflection at about 8,000 steps per day um where yeah you still get you still get benefits by going even up to like 20,000 steps a day but the vast majority of the benefits just go from like I mean the the the dip off in mortality I'm sure you've seen it it's like going from 2,000 to 8,000 it's like precipitous it's like free falling off a cliff how how drastically that decreases mortality and I don't think there's anything magic about steps I just think you're just literally looking at people getting more active yeah so I think one of the biggest failures the fitness industry is the messaging that you need to look like this in order for you to be healthy when the messaging should be hey for you to be healthy it's really like a very low barried entry like even if you just get out and walk you know for 30 minutes a day so much benefit from that just compared to just sitting down um you know just doing anything in the gym even if it's people say oh machines are worthless they're not worthless machines are great tools uh you're still applying tension to the muscle would I argue that maybe you know a free barbell movement might be more functional maybe but if it's a difference between the the 70-year-old uh female who's never resistance train before getting into the gym and doing something or not I'm going to be like yeah knock yourself out on machines so I think that is a huge failure of the fitness industry in the messaging which is you need to look like this in order for you to have achieved health so um on that front um because I do want to talk a little bit about bodybuilding uh both in your own personal experience and just again the the insights that we can gain

[01:32:54] I don't think most people listening to this myself included ever want to be 4% or 5% body fat which is you don't trust me yeah so uh but look I'm sure somebody who's 25% body fat would like to be 20% body fat and can they learn something from bodybuilder but just picking up where you went where where do you see you know kind of the general role of fitness experts in social media um how can a person sort of make sense of the The

[01:33:26] NeverEnding sea of experts out there man so a couple years ago we had a guy in our podcast named uh Alan levinovitz he's been on Joe Rogan's podcast too and he's a religious studies expert but uh he had a he had he wrote a book on kind of like the naturalism fallacy and we were talking about like how hard it is for people to identify experts and he said something that I thought was really insightful he said what you should look for an expert is the exact opposite of what you probably think you should look for if somebody sounds really confident they're probably not an expert it what you really want to look for is people who sound kind of doubtful and they say things like probably maybe possibly you know if you when you speak to True experts usually if you ask them a a question the first thing they'll do is ask you a question back unless the question is very contextual ual right so

[01:34:25] I'll get people who say hey uh what are your thoughts on X right and usually I'll say okay well as it pertains to what like hypertrophy or strength or Fitness or you know like I need contexts in order to be able to answer the question correctly and so I think looking for people like people ask me like what do you think about like credentials this and that I'm like credentials help like if I see somebody has a PHD in a certain subject I'm probably going to give them a lot more leeway in terms of okay if they say something I disagree with let me see why they said that you know let's let's dig a little bit deeper but I've seen some PhD see say some really dumb stuff um I've seen people from Harvard say really dumb stuff I've probably said really dumb stuff right like it it doesn't stop you um credentials aren't a they're a nice thing but they're not foolproof so really I try to listen to how people speak um but given that you have such a knowledge background it's it's a lot easier for you to kind of look at you know someone's Instagram account and pretty quickly realize this person knows nothing they might look good they might uh be a great marketer but they don't really know anything yeah um but you know the average person doesn't have your knowledge base correct and so what what else can they rely on so clearly that's one great criteria or two right is you know some sense of credentialing can be helpful uh some sense of speaking with nuance and being comfortable with uncertainty I I think that's also helpful are there any other tools that a person can use to disentangle this world people who say the magic words I don't know you know like that again sounds counterintuitive but uh I remember when so when I was uh part of getting my PhD

[01:36:32] I had to do what was called a qualifying exam and so that is a 4-Hour uh oral examination in front of four professors and when I was prepping for this uh Dr Layman you've had on the podcast he um he said they're going to push you in whatever subject they start out on until you don't know and you need to be able to say I don't know and so they did exactly that like I I'll still never forget the way they started off the qualifying exam was let's talk about vitamins what's your favorite oh vitamin

[01:37:05] D okay where is it synthesized and they kept pushing until I just didn't know and I'll still never forget they asked me like an acid base balance question in the lung and I started to get up on the wipe off board and like try Tow and I just turned around and said I I don't know this one okay move on and when I got done they said you actually one of the best students we've had the last few years because you knew what you knew and you knew what you didn't know and they that division put such an emphasis on not going outside your lane not speaking about something not specul not speculating about something that you didn't know and trying to pass it off like you did so I think that just got hammered into me so when it comes to looking at other folks one if they're willing to like know their scope and not feel the need to comment on every single thing that's a good that's a good metric also you know

[01:37:59] I I'm going to paint with a broad brush and there's always exceptions to this but people who use like tips tricks hacks uh five things to never do five things to always do the best worst people who use a lot of superlatives that's not typically the way that experts talk um you know there I I say a lot there's no Solutions there's only trade-offs right there's certain tools that make a lot more sense depending on somebody's goals and where they're at um than compared to somebody else and and vice versa so um but that almost suggests that social media is negatively selecting because a lot of those things that you said certainty you know a flare for Showmanship uh tips tricks and listicles that's get attention I think the I think the algorithm likes those things because they get a lot of attention even if some of that attention isn't warranted so um that that adds another layer of confusion to this which is it is difficult and it's you know even when I scroll through Instagram um I'm amazed at how much it's trying to push to me you know I missed the day when all I saw on Instagram were the 40 people I followed yep like those I feel like that was the good old days in the sequence of the way things were posted too it was like oh here's what this friend of mine did here here what this friend of mine did here's what this person who I don't know but who I respect and now it's it's insane The

[01:39:31] Barrage of stuff that Instagram thinks I want to see and admittedly sometimes it's right yeah but so many times it's just wrong and it makes me think well if that's my experience that's got to be everybody's experience and and it is and I I think you Allan talked about this as like information silos and this is a broader problem but it is a problem in nutrition and fitness specifically uh you know people don't really if you just follow the people you follow and then the accounts that get suggested to you you're actually not broadening anything right so you're you're sitting in an information in information

[01:40:11] Silo and what happens is or at least what I think is happening is you know previously 90s 2000s 80s whatever you know you'd come across people with differences of opinion to you and you could have a conversation with them and it usually was you know sometimes it could be contentious but for the most part I would say like when you can sit down and look a human being in the eyes and talk about your differences it's usually not as confrontational right now we have whole generations of people who are not used to seeing opinions different than their own or or thoughts or beliefs that are different from their own because they're in those informations silos and when they get exposed to something different they just don't know how to handle it and so I mean like like you see some really like extreme responses even to stuff like nutrition you know like um I can't name how many times I've been called a shill for you know XYZ uh you know uh big meat uh big dairy uh artificial sweeteners Big Sugar you know because it it's almost like Well it can't possibly be somebody just has a different opinion based on this data they have to be a bad person so I do think it's a real problem and what you said is very well taken that is you know you almost have to be willing to do clickbait to really get your stuff out there and so I as a business owner who does a lot of the business through

[01:41:45] Instagram I really have to try to screw a fine line of I am trying to get people's attention and not lose the nuance and the context and all those things are important and you know trust me there's days where I'm like man I could make so much money if I just you know but uh that isn't how I want to live my life or leave my legacy or anything like and so you're you're an interesting person because your personality on Twitter and your personality on Instagram are quite different and your personality in real life is totally different yeah right so people who know you like I know you uh you almost don't recognize now tell me a little bit about that has that been an evolution um because I have to be honest with you I quite envy your personality on Twitter um I've just made a decision that I've almost always been able to uphold which is I'm not going to get drawn into it yeah right um in fact

[01:42:43] I don't really even look at comments on Twitter anymore post and ghost post and ghost as Rogan has adequately reminded me many times so um but I'll be honest with you I see enough negative ones where I just want to spank the living out of the person on the other end I mean I want to with words eviscerate them yeah and 99.9% of the time I refrain from doing it um uh but I but I really get a kick out of the fact that a lot of times you just spank people into the next Century um so tell me about that how you know so so is it a conscious decision because it never comes across as unhinged it never comes across as terribly reactionary it usually comes across as kind of calculated um but uh yeah so so so just walk me through your thinking so I think it probably was a little bit unhinged when I first started you know like the internet was just in general like on bodybuilding forums it's like well you you're disagreeing with me you call me a name well you know but I think you know my style is going to be for everybody um and I think part of it honestly if I had like psychoanalyzed myself probably goes back to like me being bullied as a kid and I I almost view like misinformation and uh people who especially like you've probably noticed

[01:44:12] I save my most the the biggest amount of vitriol for people who is very clearly have a pattern of behavior that's also being monetized right so that's like when you like praying on the desperation and ignorance of people I'm going to have very little sympathy for you and I think part of that evolved too out of my coaching and seeing how many people came to me like quite frankly feeling broken because they tried so many of these things that were the solution and the

[01:44:45] Cure and when it didn't work for them they're just like oh you know something wrong with me it's like nothing's wrong with you you just like you haven't been EX excuting on these principles that work right and so I really have tried to kind of like dial it back a little bit because I think I took it too far at a certain point um but now I just try to like use it to be funny right like to get to get some attention like I think one of my one of my uh most popular so what's funny is like my best Instagram posts are all just screenshots of my Twitter like if you look at my you can go to your insights right and you look at my top performing post it's like 95% uh Twitter screenshot Twitter screenshots right so um yeah I think my one of my top rated posts of all time was um Mark Heyman had said something and my my response was just stop making up just just you know very like you know uh Cavalier and you know funny and you know I think there are some people who would absolutely would turn them off and I get that but then I also speak to the person people who are like yeah I'm tired of like stuff being overly sanitized and I just wish somebody would tell me how they really feel right so and it's funny because I've had so many academics reach out to me behind closed doors and say I love your Twitter I love just watching you like you know break this stuff down and the thing is I'll say to people is it's like you know it's never just me attacking the person I'm also providing like citations and I'm or or logic and data and whatnot uh but I'm just trying to make it funny and engaging you know um you know I but

[01:46:35] I'll always have a conversation with some with somebody like for example um Thomas Del is a great example so uh I've done several videos kind of debunking some of the claims he made and actually one day he just reached out to me and said hey man I want you to know that um I actually really respect you and you've actually made me change the way I think about some of this stuff would you want to come on my podcast yeah man let's do it because I really respect anybody who can be self-reflective enough to go you know what I might have been wrong or just even like wanting to get a different perspective on things so just another great example of that I'm actually going and speaking at a low carb Conference next year um the joke was I'm like are you are you going to need uh do I need to bring bodyguards you know um it that's so interesting to me I I um I I don't know I'm not close enough to any of the dietary communities to know uh obviously I still get very strongly associated with a low carb ideology which is funny given that you see how many carbohydrates I eat um but what is the view about you in low carbohydrate diets because you know I I

[01:47:49] I've never heard you say anything that is uniquely anti- low carb other than you know the stuff we've already talked about on the previous podcasts yeah so what I always tell people is I'm like how could I be anti- low carb if you go to my our our nutrition coaching app carbon diet coach two of the two of the six settings are low carb hydrate there's low carbohydrate and there's ketogenic yeah so how could I possibly be low carb or anti- low carb and I think that this is just an example of uh I call this the

[01:48:21] Timbo effect m so uh but it's just like polarization so you remember when uh Tim TBO was playing NFL football my hypothesis was there is very few people there are very few people in the middle about Tim TBO right you either love him or you hate him and the way this kind of comes up is like if you watch this guy and you're like H you know he's not really that good he's got weird mechanics he's more of a running back than he is a quarterback and he's kind of preachy but you know he's all right but then you see all these people saying he's the Heisman he you know he's going to the playoffs like you know he's better than your quarterback like you know this that you go what are you talking about like his completion percentage is like 45% how could you say he's good but then you have the other side which people like like me I actually was kind of a Tim TBO fan because I'm like you know he seems like a nice guy who works hard um maybe not the best genetics to be a quarterback but like you know he's been successful like that's that's admirable and then you look over here and you you see all these people going he sucks he's terrible and it's like well he did win a playoff game you know so I think this happens in with many different subjects and even right like we were talking about this the other day you know you're uh a car guy I'm not a car guy right so

[01:49:39] I've posted many times in fact when we bought our our new house I'm going to take a picture of me with the car outside the house it's going to be the greatest picture that ever goes of my social media because I've still got my grad school car which is a 2003 Alero and I've just never I just ever felt the need to get rid of it right so you got this really dinky old car with me on the hood sitting outside this you know

[01:50:00] Wonderful you know big house and sure enough I got like 1500 comments but some of the comments were and I was talking about how basically saying you know my ability to delay gratification is what got me here and uh you can do it too like delaying gratification and anything is so essential for success in almost any goal because it's so crazy how in almost anything whatever provides you like short-term relief for happiness almost always makes it worse in the long term and vice versa but people would say why do you why do you hate people who buy nice cars

[01:50:39] I'm like where did I say I hate people buy nice cars I never said that you know same thing with low carb that my messaging has consistently been usually there'll be some kind of insane claim you know like calories don't matter or you know you can eat as much on low carb as you want not gain fat and then I'm like well here's citation citation citation low carb does not appear to be better for fat loss than you know calorie protein equated uh diets that are not low carb but that means choose what you prefer because it's not worse so by all means like if you like low carb go right ahead

[01:51:18] I don't enjoy low carb but I know many people that do and so I think one of the reasons people get so tribal about this is they find something that worked for them and they then retroactively try to find the evidence to show that it's the best thing that there is and which which of the two Landscapes nutrition and exercise do you think is more culty my impression is nutrition definitely nutrition definitely nutrition and and do you think that that's because of the ubiquity of food in our lives and the fact that we all have almost equally a personal relationship with food whereas not everybody exercises the same amount and uh do you think that that's so there's two things um especially here in

[01:52:12] America we we come from a Puritan background and I think there this this kind of thinking that anything that is pleasurable at all must be bad for you and you cannot have it you you should feel bad about it right so I think that causes people to get a little bit tribal in terms of like I mean I've had people like say horrible like moral judgments because like I'll post me eating a bag of Skittles or something like that you know never mind the fact I just went and trained for three hours you know um yeah

[01:52:42] I think somebody like called me a disgusting sugar addict one time um so that that's that's one part of it but I think it's the smaller part I think the bigger part is what you just said if it's funny whenever I meet new people I'm always kind of hesitant to you know if they don't know anything about me to tell them that you know I have background nutrition PhD nutrition because usually one of a couple things happens they either clam up real quick like if we're out to dinner and they get very self-conscious about what they're eating which bro I just ordered the fries like you know you're good um I get or I get like Blitz cried with

[01:53:22] Quest questions but mostly people wanting me to validate what they already believe to be true but if I was if I sat down I said you know I'm a theoretical astrophysicist we might talk about space a little bit but they're probably not going to question my beliefs or my my opinions on string theory right but I think because everyone eats and everyone knows something about their body right or wrong they have drawn certain conclusions about about what they put in their body and what happens to their body and so I think because of that because everybody has an opinion about nutrition it makes it really tough because people are already like just natively have certain beliefs and we know how hard it is to change people's beliefs there was a classic study it was in politics was a classic study where they showed hard data and this was for both parties they would either refute a preconceived belief or uh support it I think one of them was um uh with uh I can't remember what they used for Republicans but for Democrats uh the belief was that uh I think George

[01:54:40] W bush stopped or outlawed funding for stem cell research or something like that um the reality was he just stopped Federal funding he didn't Outlaw it so they they showed people this this um these facts by the way again if I butchered that I apologize to anyone watching but I think that was it they showed people these facts and it didn't matter like if if they um if they believed that he had Outlaw it even if they showed them the facts that he didn't they still it still reinforced their pre-existing belief it actually made their belief stronger and uh the same thing was true for Republicans by the way so and I I I don't think it's a

[01:55:22] Republican or Democrat problem I think it's a people problem to be honest and I think one of the benefits I had very early on in grad school was Dr Layman just absolutely dismantling so many beliefs I had but then but doing it in a way that wasn't judgmental or made me feel bad and what I tell people now it's like being wrong about something is a beautiful thing because if I'm already right about everything then I'm already doing everything the best I can and I can't get better but if I'm doing something if I'm wrong about something that's actually awesome because now I have something I can improve on so now I tell people I like being right right like

[01:56:11] I'll do cartwells in my living room if I'm right but if I'm wrong I I don't really take that much offense to it because it's just data it's not there's no ethical judgment and I've changed my mind about a myriad of things I was I was going to ask you what are three of the most impactful things that you have changed your opinion on in nutrition specifically um and let's make it recent because I know for any of us if we go back a decade it's an eternity in terms of our understanding of nutrition science or something like that but let's pick a narrower window of maybe like three or four years what would be sort of three areas where your your opinion has really changed in a manner that actually leads to either a different behavior in you or a different um coaching input to your clients I can think of three things right away so first thing being uh LDL cholesterol so uh when I got to grad school um the the kind of the The

[01:57:15] Narrative and even out of the lab I was in was H it's really we don't think it's LDL it's more the HDL to LDL ratio and the particle size and those sorts of things and I I kept that probably until about five years ago four years ago and I just saw enough of these melan randomizations come out it's like wow that's pretty powerful when you look at the mortality rate and it is like linear with the exposure the lifetime exposure to LDL I'm like uh can't really hold this belief anymore because it's just not supported by the data uh and it actually um Chang ched my opinion on like you know now I'm a little bit more conscious about the saturated fat I consume uh we talked about like I actually started taking a low dose of a

[01:58:01] Statin U and that's helped that's so I've never had super high LDL but I've always been around one50 to 125 even if I reduce my saturated fat increase my fiber and I eat probably 60 70 grams of fiber a day so um you know I think people get that that one twisted a little bit because they'll hear things like well it doesn't consider HDL it doesn't consider this no you have to understand what an independent risk factor means it means that all things being equal are you better off having higher HDL yeah but HDL is more of a marker of metabolic health because we have some drug trials and and mandilon randomizations now where they modulate

[01:58:43] HDL and it doesn't really seem to make a difference yeah um whereas if you modulate LDL so even at high HDL or low HDL in both stratifications lower LDL is almost always better for cardiovascular disease and Mortal I feel like I need to do a podcast on melian randomization um I write about it in my book um and I actually very powerful yeah it's a and I understand why it doesn't get more attention because you do have to really get into the weeds of genetic sorting and the statistical methods that are involved but I actually in the book write about it as one of the five pillars of evidence that we should be relying on as we formulate uh insights with respect to anything that we do so that's an interesting one um and and and obviously it has a parallel piece which is around the your relationship to saturated fat yeah yeah and I think you know one of the things to keep in mind is when you're looking at mortality cardiovascular disease this is where nutrition science can become so limited the power with melian randomization is you're kind of looking at a lifetime randomized control trial right right so people will point out things like the the Minnesota coronary study um and I think there's another Australian study and they said well look at this randomized control trial where they you know looked at high saturated fat versus low saturated fat and there wasn't a difference or you know that sort of thing and one of the biggest problems with those studies is you know they're two years which is a really long time for a randomized control trial but when you're talking about a disease that is a a lifetime exposure two years in people that are in their 40s I mean you're just not going to have that many incidences to pick up on so when you're looking at mandilon randomization you can get around that because you're looking at people across their lifetimes and the way I kind of explain and I don't consider myself a lipid expert but the way I try to explain like lifetime exposure risks is imagine if you and I start investing yeah right and you get in at 8% we both invest $10,000 you get in 8% I get in at 6% if we look after a year or two I mean you'll have more but it it it won't be like statistically different right but if we look at four years you're going to have a lot more and I don't know how much exactly but my guess is it's going to be magnitudes of times greater because you're again lifetime exposure actually I've done this exercise and it was initially in my book I actually used this exact analysis really was $1,000 invested at I think I chose 6% versus 4% or maybe it was even 6 versus 5 it was something that was small enough that at five and 10 years wasn't enormous but at 40 50 and 60 years was staggering Y and that was the exact point which is the cumulative effect of compounding over a lifetime is so nonlinear that I don't think we are capable of understanding it like I don't think we can ever cognitively realize it until we literally just do the calculations and they're staring Us in the face yeah and

[02:01:58] I think you know that that again that's one thing I changed my mind on that I've pretty had a pretty strong belief about it and um you know it's kind of like well how much evidence do you need like you know we we still have kind of LDL denialists out there and I think it's one of the I think it's one of the most dangerous things I see actually yeah I mean like you have the mechanism the penetration of the IND it's very clear that that happens we have the animal models that show linear dose independent effects you have the mellan randomization and you have the clinical trials in humans it's and you have the prospective cohort studies and then you have the you have the genetic studies so right you have the pcsk9 over and under expressors so so um I want to come back to the

[02:02:42] Minnesota heart study in a moment but let's go on and hear the other two yeah so uh supplemental Branch CH amino acids that's another one I I used to be a big advocate for that in fact uh the first supplement company I had uh five years ago we sold a product with Branch amino acids in it and then my my current Suman company outwork nutrition we do not have a branch amino acid product because that was basically taking the three branch chain amino acids as an inw workout supplement mostly uh as a post-workout recovery supplement I still do think there may be a small benefit for delayed onset muscle soreness with Branch chains that may be outside of just regular protein but based on the cost and honestly like the the negative impact on taste too because that's the Lucine is horrible right oh yeah yeah you know I used I think may have even told you before I used to spike five grams of

[02:03:35] Lucine into my water during a workout I mean it's the most awful tasting is do any other is there any other amino acid that tastes as bad as Lucine probably some of the sulfur based ones you know cysteine or Meine yeah um no it's pretty bad and the fact it's also non-polar so it doesn't dissolve yeah it doesn't dissolve you're you're shaking it constantly yeah so I mean I was a big advocate for that I was sponsored by a company called salvation for years that had a branching amino acid product um has the rest of the world caught up to that or are BCAA still a big product they still are a big product they still are a big product but most evidence-based folks you know will say hey we just there's it's not really moving it's not better than protein right in fact the actual the research tends to suggest whey protein is actually better than Branch chains uh even when you equate for the dose of

[02:04:28] Branch chains in the protein uh so yeah I just kind of got to the point where I'm like if I if I put this in the products I'm just doing it because my you know I'm tied to Branch chains right like people are expecting this from me because like my PhD was in Lucine in the branch chain amino acid and and and their metabolism and their effects on muscle protein synthesis but I just I couldn't hold that position anymore based on the evidence because it was just too strong um and then the other one that I have now lost in my brain oh um so the idea that um I used to really kind of discourage people from intermittent fasting so the other thing

[02:05:11] I changed my opinion on was uh intermittent fasting in at least in terms of like your traditional 168 um because I used to say well I'm I'm worried about the the catabolic effects of it you know that sort of thing at least when combined with resistance training and sufficient total protein and that the caveat should be that they also the in these studies they train within their feeding window there's some really good Studies by

[02:05:38] Grant Tinsley on this um there doesn't appear to be at least not statistically significant differences in lean mass between people who uh do 168 intermittent fasting versus people who just Contin ously so I used to be like somebody like well you know really like every four hours should be getting a protein dose that sort of thing maybe if you plot it out over 30

[02:06:02] Years it'll make a difference on how much lean mass you gain so I would still say if you're somebody who is a bodybuilder and you want to absolutely squeeze out every last ounce of muscle that you can get I still would say like any form of interment fasting probably isn't optimal but for the average person can you get plent strong plenty big and uh still do intermittent fasting at least the 168 I would say absolutely which is really interesting because I've kind of gone the other way from you yeah you were saying I I'm I used to be a big proponent and then what I was seeing clinically so this was really just anecdotal but when you see it over and over and over and over again on so many patients on whom you have dexa data and um was we were seeing a real Det iation of body composition now were they def still definitely getting enough total protein no and that's my point so what I know was happening was they were falling behind on protein and so the question then becomes one of efficacy versus

[02:07:08] Effectiveness in other words the data which are done under controlled settings say if I control for total protein it can be identical but the effectiveness version of that is in practice do people make that happen and I I guess what I would say is we weren't seeing it yeah so we still use intermittent fasting in patience as one of the three big levers of energy restriction but we have a big red caution button all over it that says if you choose this instead of caloric restriction or dietary restriction if you want to choose time restriction as your lever you're going to have to go out of your way to make sure you are not compromising protein yeah and I think one of the things I'll I'll tell people is and I can I can like do dogmatism over all these different disciplines including what I like which is flexible dieting but people get too hung up on the actual fasting part of intermittent fasting you're you're reducing your energy intake it's a tool and a lot of people it works great like they they say

[02:08:18] I'm not hungry um it didn't feel like I was D awesome but so people will say well can I is it going to break a fast if I have coffee will it break a fast if I chew gum will it break a fast if I have a a protein shake what I'll say is like well why are you fasting Y and and usually if they're like um and and by the way I'm only laughing because I'm guilty of this right like I I used to really think about the details of that um and and that you know I just don't think look I think autophagy is an incred incredibly important part of our ability to uh regenerate I just don't think there's a chance you're getting any meaningful amount of it in 16 hours and therefore you know to your point we would even tell patients now to have a protein shake outside of that feeding window in fact I think you and I even spoke about that idea which was if it's really all about energy restriction what's an extra 20000 calories outside of your feeding window exactly and actually if you look at some of the effects of high protein diets they actually are not dissimilar from some of the effects you get from fasting at least in like liver metabolism and whatnot so you know I would say to somebody well you know don't worry about breaking your fast in terms of you're eating something like you know if you're worried about it intermittently fast your carbohydrate and fat intake and just have an extra dose of protein in the morning like or essential amino acids or or whatever you want right because now you're getting that anabolic stimulus spreading it out a little bit more you're making sure you get total protein in during the day and quite honestly I mean this is a a theory that uh Dr Layman and I had which was you know breakfast probably is the most important protein dosing of the day because you are coming off you know you know a significant period of fasting and then if you're extending that out like how much longer are you extending that out what does that mean you know the long term I think I told you I've officially taken to bribing my 14-year-old daughter yeah so it's there's there's now real Stakes on the line for her her to get that minimum 30 grams of protein no pun intended with steak right that's right that's right uh minimum 30 grams before she goes to school in the morning yeah I'm like an awful father just so but it's it's interesting how that that um that kind of dogmatism plays out like you have the same thing with low carb right like people so worried about getting any carbs meanwhile they're like dumping oil on their salad and you know putting butter in their coffee and you know eating like loads of bacon or they're they're eating you know keto ice cream because it's not spiking their blood sugar but it's like have you looked at the keto ice cream it's actually more calories than like like we're we're missing the entire Point here right exactly and the same thing goes for like flexible dieting like I had people who were like it's like they were trying to hack the system of how can I eat as much junk food as I want

[02:11:13] I'm allowed 3,000 calories a day what if it's all Skittles right so like what if I do just protein shake you know Skittles and peanut butter and and my point is like listen like if you take anything too far it's probably a really bad idea right and one of the things I said about flexible dieting too is like we know fiber is really important like you know there are some folks who are kind of antifiber now really oh yeah

[02:11:40] I've missed this I've missed this movie well the carnivore the carnivore folks okay okay it's funny like um I was in a debate one time with a carnivore Advocate and you know my research was sponsored by the egg nutrition center the national Dairy Council and the National catman's Beef Association and I if anybody should be Pro carnivores yeah and I said the fact that I'm sitting here defending plants is actually kind of mindblowing to me and if anything it should actually increase your trust in what I'm saying because I mean I am a fan of high quality animal protein I think it's what is the argument uh let's talk for a moment about the carnivore diet uh obviously for people listening it's pretty straightforward explanation it's a diet where you only eat meat right and i' I've heard some versions now where people eat honey and fruits and whatnot which I'm not sure how that's carnivore anymore but in any case um I would say that's a little better uh but so the argument against or what's the argument in favor of that what do they propose as the reason to do it so the reason to do it is I mean it's basically anecdotal people have done this and they've seen this right and of course like you could absolutely lose weight doing something like that um some people seem pretty easy to see how you would lose weight only through the lens of dietary a strict enough dietary restriction is going to ultimately reduce inan how much meat can you eat even if it's fatty meat right like so and and the justification well I I still go to the bathroom just fine it's like well that's not why you should eat fiber I mean yeah it helps but that that's that's the last reason to eat fiber in my opinion um so the the they also some people have said well it helped clear up some autoimmune issues that's hard to quantify um and some people say well like it lowered my inflammation and and and uh my GI problems so this is one thing a lot of people get mixed up they'll get like bloated or have gi discomfort and they equate that with inflammation yeah you may have like some sis you may have some like some localized inflammation although it's probably based on what we know about like IBS and whatnot it's probably just like like Barrow sensitivity but that's not the same thing as like what I usually say is well did you get your CRP measured like did you get your il6 measured you know that's inflammation when we talk about inflammation that's what we're talking about now but but how do you make let's assume that they that all those things are true let's assume that I went on a carnivore diet and my actual biomarkers of inflammation improved and my symptoms improve I don't know what the number is but if you think of the average number of foods a person will eat in a given week different foods let's posit that it's in the tens maybe a hundred yeah if you eliminate all but one of them it's not a good experiment to you haven't really learned a lot you've learned that something in those 99 might have been the problem yep that's a that's a hard way to learn that so one of the things

[02:14:43] I've said I think a lot of people are getting benefits is they're basically doing an Elimination Diet yeah right so the the for the most part most people don't have sens sensitivities to meet um but like I think many people just not being in tune with their body probably have you know IBS um fod map sensitivities where they're uh fermenting a lot of fruin oligosaccharides you know those sorts of things and that fermentation for people with IBS is is even though it's a um a healthy thing because you know bacteria getting fuel from fiber is a healthy thing if it's causing pain they're equating that with being you know something negative which obviously we don't want anybody to be in pain I still believe that there are a lot of people who have wheat sensitivities that are not full-on gluten sensitivities that don't rise to the level of celiac disease yeah it's possible so it's one of those things where they eliminate all PL everything Y and they go well I feel better okay well now the next step should be adding things back in one by one and let's figure out what's causing those problems so what I would submit to people is like still try to include fruits and vegetables and just slowly add them back in and see what works for you um because

[02:16:02] I think and this gets into kind of like dietary protein longevity I think a lot of this this negative perception of animal protein with longevity and uh health is people who eat high amounts of animal protein these aren't people for the most part they're not eating like lean cuts of sirloin and chicken breast and whatnot people who are eating High meat are typically eating high amounts of processed meat and they eat less amounts of fruits and vegetables in fact there's a really classic study in my opinion from maximoff in 2020 and they looked I think it was quintals so four uh different uh

[02:16:46] Ser like serving amounts of fruits and vegetables and four serving amounts of meat so lowest to highest right and when you look at like low vegetable intake there is like a linear effect of uh or sorry if you look at like going from high to low vegetable intake linear effect on the incidence of cancer um and meat as you go up in meat not correcting for fruits and vegetable intake you have a linear effect of of meat on cancer but guess what happens when you couple the highest quintal of meat intake with also the highest quintal of fruits and vegetable intake there's no effect like the the you have the same risk for uh cancer with high meat and high fruit and vegetable intake as you do with low meat and high fruit and vegetable intake so to me that suggests it's less about the meat you're eating and more about what you're eating it instead of yeah right so one of the things to keep in com mind with nutrition is when we tell people to eat more or eat less of something usually there's a replacement that happens right it doesn't happen in a vacuum so to me if we're talking about carnivore sure okay I like high quality protein great I would argue probably lean cuts are a little bit better option um but for God's sakes have some fruits and vegetables with it because it's what's going to mitigate your risk now you said you're getting about 40 grams of fiber a day I I'm around 60 and that's total soluble and insoluble yeah it's total solu and so what are your sources where do you get the the like what's the main foods that are contributing to that so uh I'll do like a a lot of rice cauliflower um I'll do quite a you know broccoli uh some beans

[02:18:42] I'll also do uh I love apples so that's kind of my go-to fruit Source how many grams of fiber in an apple I want to say it's like three or four gr maybe a little bit less than that it's not a huge amount but like if you want something a little bit more packed you know like berries berries tend to be really fiber dense uh compared to something like apples uh you know like something like like a banana is a fruit but relatively low fiber All

[02:19:06] Things Considered uh but even like the the higher sugar lower fiber fruits are still like relatively well associated with good health outcomes so and then honestly like people are going to laugh and be judgmental I Love Popcorn so popcorn actually is pretty darn high fiber more than corn on the Kernel per kernel basis uh I don't know about that because I feel like you could eat more corn than popcorn oh yeah yeah yeah so popcorn is actually very

[02:19:36] Filly that that's one reason I like I got into eating it during bodybuilding competitions like obviously like um I would use like air poop popcorn and I'll usually like put a little bit of cinnamon and Splenda over that and then like a little bit of like the the butter spray I mean takes you you know for 50 grams of carbohydrate from popcorn it'll take you like 20 30 minutes to eat it you know so I just found that that like helped me control my hunger uh and in 50 grams of popcorn you're getting around like 6 to 10 grams of fiber depending on the specific you know brand you're using so that's actually like I love that as a snack because it's like it's it's you know is it as healthy as if I had some fruits and vegetables probably not but you know as far as a snack goes it's you know pretty good and and very filling so

[02:20:22] I do that and then like just miscellaneous sources throughout the day um but I think one of the things to really look at is you know people I I was in a debate with Paul solino one time and we were talking about fiber and one of the things he said and he's a big carnivore Advocate big carnivore Advocate one of the things he said was well you know this stuff with fiber is just healthy user bias people who eat more fiber are you know they just have other health promoting Behavior now that's a real thing in terms of like cohort studies and cross-sectional data observational data it is a real thing but when you're dealing with something that's kind of a healthy user bias typically you'll see like the data is not consistent right like some one study will say one thing one study might have no Effect one study by say a different thing and that's what like you see that with meat that's right right like you see that with meat and

[02:21:19] Longevity I was just looking at met analysis earlier that one met analysis even showed that after controlling for confounding variables that actually animal protein was not associated with with de with increased mortality um but you don't see it with exercise you don't see it with exercise you don't see it with the smoking studies in the opposite direction you don't see it with fiber the effect in fiber at least in terms of like cardiovascular disease cancer it is a very consistent effect and it's very consistent even across all the metaanalyses I've seen so do we have a 10year randomized control trial of giving people you know enough fiber versus not enough fiber and seeing

[02:21:59] Health outcomes no and we'll never have that but do I feel very comfortable saying that I think fiber helps uh reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer based on the data we have oh yeah I feel very comfortable saying that and what's a what's the RDA on fiber is it 30 grams I not that the RDA matters I'm just kind of curious I think it's 20 to 30 grams I I'll be honest I haven't looked at it in a while I know they I know they changed the guidelines a while back too uh what I tell people a good

[02:22:29] Target to shoot for is like 15 grams per thousand calories I mean I would love to go more but at some point it just becomes intractable to get that much fiber at that low calories now all the things that you mentioned for fiber you're eating real food to get it so how do we think about it in terms of bars and things that seem I've heard different things about this where you know if you look at the incron effect for example you know it would suggest that the fiber that's in a processed bar is not really contributing the way a fiber is in the way you just described it if you're actually eating B cauliflower or beans or things like that yeah so I try not to fall into the naturalistic fallacy right and I get I get a little bit cringed when I hear processed unprocessed because what we do to food now everything's processed yeah yeah processing in of itself is yeah processing doesn't mean bad I just mean and I'm really talking about this purely through the lens of the disruption of the actual kernel and what that actually does at the glp1 level yeah so getting back to that yeah I would say that

[02:23:31] Mother Nature's kitchen is probably you know better than you know a fiber bar that's like some indigestible form of glucose or you know some less digestible form of of uh starchy carbohydrate but is it better than nothing again it's kind of like you know it's probably better than nothing but if somebody says well I'm getting 40 grams of fiber a day and it's because they're eating like three protein bars they have 14 grams of fiber I would argue that well it's probably not equivalent to you know getting six to eight servings of fruits and vegetables so let's let's talk about one other sort of macronutrient or subset of macronutrient which is polyunsaturated fatty acids right so so this is one of those things I always tell people um there's nothing in nutrition that I'm more confused about than the role of uh Omega 6 puas yeah so let's go back to that Minnesota coronary experiment that you mentioned it's it's a very unique experiment probably never to be replicated no no IRB would ever approve it again and um I'm still trying to track down Chris

[02:24:33] Ramon who wrote the like paper that looked at all of the data that were never published in Fran's first study but I I'll retell the study to the best of my recollection which is super foggy at this point so this was a study carried out in Minnesota please correct me if I'm missing any Det details um it was carried out in um an assisted living or mental facility and there might have been two arms I can't remember um what makes this special then is that the subjects in this study were fed every meal so what makes this a really unique study is that it was not a free living study though it had free living duration

[02:25:13] I want to say the average duration was three years it was just over two I think was it just over two so the study was 5 years yes but the feeding intervention was only two two well I think because people were kind of going in and out of facility the average subject duration was about two two and a half years so for this period of time every meal is being fed and there's patients are randomized into two groups isocaloric Isom macro but at the fat level one group was high saturated fat one group was low saturated fat if I recall the the reduction in saturated fat was not trivial it was 30% H what it was 18.5 is a number that sticks out in my mind and I can't remember but do you remember the EXA I don't remember the exact number but you're like it it was it was a really big reduction in Satur not something that I would say well there just wasn't a big enough that's right yeah so I think we can all look at it and say wow these guys were getting a lot of saturated fat these guys were getting a lot of Omega 6 polyunsaturated was it canola what was the dominant uh form of the oil I don't remember that actually um it might have been corn oil I don't remember which one it was which of the big four safflower but I think it was canola but I I could be wrong on that we'll obviously post a link to the original St so the study goes on and it completes they get all the data oh what was the hypothesis that was being tested the hypothesis was being tested was in this really welld designed elegant study the group on the lower saturated fat arm should have had fewer cardiovascular events because this was right at the time when the theory initially proposed by anel keys in about 1961 was that saturated fat specifically was the driver of blood lipids and this was really the connection to the heart uh the lipid heart hypothesis supposed to be kind of like the nail in the coffin for that hypothesis in terms of like cementing it that's correct that's correct because the so the idea was this group on the higher saturated fat they would have more heart attacks and this you couldn't argue these data this was this was really clear you also had a high power to this study because it was very large I I think it was like 500 something people oh I think it was more yeah yeah I think it was a stag I I mean it was a I was amazed at how big the number was and um they were old which meant you were going to see events right you couldn't do a two-year study in 40y olds you see no events in anybody right so had all these things going for it 1973 the results come out there's no difference the study goes unpublished it's not published until 1989 16 years later France publishes it when asked why he said quite plainly we didn't like the way it turned out um now a guy named

[02:28:11] Chris Ramon who I believe is still at the NIH though if you're listening to this and anybody knows him please tell him I've been trying to reach him for the past two years unsuccessfully won't return any emails um he comes along maybe 5 years ago and finds a whole bunch of unpublished data and republishes I think one if not two studies in the bmj before we get to what ramsden's findings are my interpretation of the study that I just described my initial representation or my initial interpretation of that 10 years ago was saturated fats not causing heart disease right 10 years later my representation was or my interpretation was that study wasn't long enough to see a difference cholesterol at the time they did measure total cholesterol levels they didn't fractionate cholesterol at the time so they couldn't measure LDL or HDL or anything like that but there was about a 30 milligram per deciliter reduction in total cholesterol on the low low saturated fat Group which again now you have a biomarker that tells you this this intervention worked right and the majority of that 30 milligrams per deciliter was probably

[02:29:23] LDL cholesterol could they have measured it so then my my interpretation turned into two years of an intervention wasn't long enough if you took a bunch of people and put them on a Statin for two years you probably wouldn't see a difference you could miss a difference now the pcsk9 trials suggested otherwise so it was really interesting The Odyssey and Fier trials in 2015 which were testing the most potent lipid lowering drugs available actually did show a benefit in about two and a half to three years wow but they were crushing LDL right so again it's an area under the curve problem this one was reducing it but not crushing it so that kind of became that's sort of where I left it and I think it's important to point out too that like the modifications that you can make to cholesterol from diet in some cases can be quite small compared to what you can get from pharmaceutical interventions that's right outside of the most extreme you know I'm sure if somebody went onto a zero saturated fat 12% total fat calorie restricted diet they can probably cut their cholesterol in half but they'd be doing a whole bunch of harm I would argue along the way and then in the other direction you do have some people like in the low carb Community who are bragging about LDL cholesterol levels in the 500s well that's what I was going to say you can do the opposite much more it's un it's an unbounded problem above it it's obviously a bounded problem below right Ramon's data suggest that actually the people in the pofa group had worse outcomes so now that really kind of throws me for a loop and that's frankly why I kind of want to have him on the podcast because his data suggests that that at least this particular pufa was had a negative cardio cardiovascular effect yeah now to me that study is probably if if the details of that study are consistent that would be the most damning evidence against n6 puas in terms of lowering lipids but raising events and by the way there is a precedent for that there was a drug that was approved in the 1960s that actually lowered cholesterol but increased cardiovascular events that drug was withdrawn this was back in the day you know what the mechanism was for that uh

[02:31:38] I can speculate yeah so the I actually recently discussed this on a podcast um the the mechanism that it's believed that this drug worked is it prevented the conversion of desol to cholesterol that's the final step of cholesterol synthesis in one of the two Pathways yeah and so when you gave people this drug and the name always escapes me um uh triol or something like that when you gave people this drug their cholesterol went down significantly and the drug was approved on the basis of cholesterol lowering not on the basis of outcomes today cholesterol drugs are only approved on the basis of outcomes as well uh but then had to be pulled from the market because you saw the events so

[02:32:21] I don't think they ever investigated it um but I think today we look back and we think that desol acted perhaps as bad if not worse than cholesterol in terms of the oxidative process so you basically lowered cholesterol but the precursor went through the roof and the precursor was at least as bad if not more damaging ah interesting yeah so that's the that's the suspicion the point only being there is there was a precedent for you can lower cholesterol and worsen events yeah and so Ramden proposed es a series of mechanisms by which that might be the case with at least this polyunsaturated fat conversely there is a lot of epidemiology that says the opposite that polyunsaturated fats whenever you substitute saturated for polyunsaturated things get better nobody's disputing mufa over here like the data seem unambiguously clear that mu more mua is the best of the three fats um both epidemiologically and experimentally so what how do you think about the breakdown not the breakdown but what I mean is the distribution of how one should think about Distributing their fats so I've actually have seen some epidemiology that showed that puas were actually lowering events more no that's what I'm saying yeah that's what I'm saying the pofa data look like it's more favorable than than the the SFA well even than uh mono unsaturated too that as well yeah I got it but I mean again you're dealing with cohort data and whatnot we all know the limitations there uh as far as the Minnesota coronary study I think I get really I'm probably gonna it's probably gonna sound like a cop out but I really gotten to the point after seeing just so many random events and studies where I go I don't know what one study means no matter no matter how well done it is um now I have seen studies that were so compelling that it I swayed my opinion a little bit but it was usually because there was also other contextual data that made sense the way this one kind of came about it's like like you said we don't really know how to reconcile this because even if you look at some of these Omega six fats and I think one of the one of the big mechanisms that's been proposed is well they're going to increase inflammation because those uh those double bonds can be oxidized that oxidation cause inflammation but if we look at the Hard outcome data in randomized control trials where they give like lenic acid or alphal linolic acid or whatever I mean you just don't see inflammation go up if if they're not increasing total calories right um in fact you usually especially if you're replacing it for saturated fat sometimes you see inflammation go down so I just don't honestly this one of those things where I go I don't really know what it means and I think so I don't feel bad now saying I literally don't know what the answer is I mean I just have no clue I think it's one of those things where it's you kind of have to look at the weight of the evidence and then couple that with some of the mechanistic evidence and look at the you know the human outcome mechanisms we can see which is okay maybe we can't do a two-year randomized control trial but 12 weeks is enough time to see differences in inflammation if something's going to cause a difference inflammation so we can look at that I don't know if that was um his main mechanis M that he proposed for how it was occurring it was absolutely one of them yeah um God it's been so long since I looked at his bigger BMG Pap uh uh bmj paper um so I don't I don't want to we'll attach to the paper in the show notes so people can kind of go through it he actually if I recall I can almost picture it there's a figure that kind of actually kind of nicely walks through what the proposed mechanisms are so I think the other thing to consider is like we just talked about how when you suggest cutting something out you replace it with other things and I think I think in the last 20 or 30 years the biggest contribution to added calories in the diet is actually added oils so on a per calorie basis I I don't think that there's like you know the big demon right now is seed oils like that is like I haven't even done a post about it yet because the anti-ed oil crowd is just so vitriolic and so nuts that I'm like all right how how when do I want to weit into this conversation but um I think that and tell me about this crowd this this this um this particular sect is of which religion are they they they're definitely more towards like the low carb carnivore I think a lot of this is there's a lot of people in the low carb

[02:37:11] Community who've kind of like tried to abdicate saturated fat like make it oh it's it's not bad or it's not it's innocuous you know that sort of or even it's it's healthy because look at you know if you look at elderly people people have higher LDL cholesterol live longer and it's like well that's because they're probably actually getting in enough food and when you're elderly it becomes a wasting problem and not a not an obesity problem but that's uh that's a separate conversation but I I think a lot of it stemmed from okay we want to make saturated fat a good guy so somebody has to be the bad guy and so and so it's been it's been seed oils um yeah it's very very like very powerful belief that some people hold on this um so I and and and and again if you just look at top level stuff it fits it fits a pretty good story right which is we never ate these seed oils 120 years ago right they represented this much of our total fat calories today they're this much of our fat calories and look at all the things that are wrong with the world today so it's it's got that kind of top level um story which I think a lot of things do right sugar has the same thing like we ate this much sugar in 1900 we ate this much sugar in the year 2000 look what got worse so it's it's it's important to understand I guess how I mean I've certainly fallen for that right like there's I've looked at that and gone yeah that that's it's got to be the seed oils it's got to be the sugar it's got to be that it's got to be it's really easy to make a boogeyman yeah and I I think when you look through the data and and try try to be unbiased about it what you see is like the continuous The Continuous boogeyman is really it's Just Energy toxicity I mean what what you're dealing with is just extra energy because regardless because people will say well you know we did the the food guide pyramid and people did it and everybody got sicker people kind of did it they they didn't really do it because the food guide perit also said exercise and reduce your calorie consumption um so yeah they they add in more carbohydrates but they really didn't decrease their fat intake either uh and so yeah as we added more calories we had more of these problems and so that's interesting wouldn't it I I'd really love to know because unfortunately we only have food availability and waste data yeah so we have to use food availability and waste take a Delta to estimate um what's happening and i' I've personally always found that to be difficult the other thing I find impossible is to estimate what I eat I want to actually ask about how you do it because I think you're much more dialed into this if I could tell you at the end of a day within a thousand calories what not a thousand I could probably do it within a thousand there's no way I could tell you within a day 500 calories within what I've done it's just not possible I can't personally do it I don't have that that infrastructure um so I I really believe that we've probably underestimated in

[02:40:12] The lowfat Craze how much fat didn't go down and how much lowfat stuff did go up well think about going to a restaurant right and if you've ever been to a restaurant where they like go to The Cheesecake Factory right you look at the calories on the dishes like how do you get that much in there well you C carbs contribute to that but the way you densify food is with fat like fat is what will take something from a 500 calorie dish to a 1500 calorie dish um so I think when it comes to estimations um last night we were out and you were eating ad lib but I know in your head the wheels were kind of telling you like at some point I think I even asked you and you made some comment like yep I got about 600 more to go um yeah is that literally just repetitions like you've done enough food logging in your life that you you can look at a brownie and you can look at a sandwich and you you just sort of know what you're getting so I'll tell people for some people like that's not a sustainable way to live to just like keep a running track in their head or whatnot um cuz you let me back up just a little bit higher level view if you want to lose fat or control body weight you have to practice some form of restriction now you can pick the form of restriction you want for me the easiest thing for me is to be able to eat what I want within reason right what you want when you want but just control the amount Bingo yep right so if you do that you're going to have to track calories or macros or whatever it is or you can restrict time right or you can restrict a certain macronutrient group or you know you say I'm I'm just going to eat mentally processed food so there's some form of restriction you have to do now what's interesting is none of these forms of restriction seem to be emerge as being better than another in terms of adherence across a population level so it really does boil down to the individual so I always say you have to practice some form of restriction but choose the form of restriction that feels is the least restrictive for you so for me that's just been tracking macros did you play much with the others um a little bit yeah um like you know kind of Clean Eating back in the early 2000s which was you know minimally processed foods and you know high fiber and whatnot and I actually found that I just ended up kind of like I wouldn't say I developed binge eating disorder but I I did start kind of binge eating because it was like when you so if you listen if you look at the psychology of binge eating it's really interesting we had uh Professor Jake larden on our podcast a while back and he is uh his expertise is in Eating

[02:42:55] Disorders and uh he said really there's two things that are kind of essential for an eating disorder to emerge the first is uh uh you know some sort of poor body image perception right so that's kind of a prerequisite the second is hard food rules so when you create hard food rules um it does it just does a weird thing in your mind so for example I'm sorry are both of those necessary or sufficient or are they necessary and sufficient both of those seem to predict so when you look at the vast majority of people I don't want to say every single person but when you look at the vast majority of people who develop Eating

[02:43:39] Disorders those are two things those two things show up more more often okay um so what I found was that I would kind of take and sorry for my ignorance is B eating defined as because that obviously doesn't involve purging necessarily binging just means overeating like how how do we technically Define binging yeah it's I actually don't know the the criteria okay but from what Dr lardan said it's kind of like periods of really intense food consumption followed by a lot of guilt like feeling guilty um and with or without compensatory mechanisms because sometimes people will exercise in response some people will resp or deprivation would be another compensatory mechanism got it okay um and usually you're talking about like you're not talking about oh yeah I had an extra cookie you're talking about like you ate the whole box of Oreos or whatever it is um so usually I mean I'm guessing but it would probably be on the magnitude of like you know over a th calories at you know a sitting unintended and the other thing is it tends to be kind of a um it can be tied to stress as well that that's another part of it but for me I found that I would just kind of go you know the bodybuilding magazine said I couldn't have sugar you know can't have you know this can't have that and the the rules for what was clean seemed to be very arbitrary but I was young and I didn't know any better so I'm like okay well

[02:45:11] I'll I won't have these quote unquote bad foods and the weirdest thing started happening I actually started eating more of them because when I would get more of the things you weren't supposed to right because when I get exposed to it I wasn't able to moderate it because it was like you know I'm in college buddies bring home a pizza to the apartment hey

[02:45:32] Lane you want some sure uh or I would like try to avoid and it would feel so bad that I'm trying to avoid but the outcome was the same which was I would just end up eating way more than I had intended to or even felt hungry for but it was like this mindset of well this is bad this I'm not going to eat this again this my last time eating this because I'm going to be really serious after this so since I've already broken the seal might as well just go all the way might as well just go all the way right and so I just kept going through this and finally I was kind of like this seems to be really ineffective towards my goals um I wonder if it's the fact that I'm just you know that I have pizza or the fact that I'm eating like an entire large pizza to myself that's the problem so at that point I was kind of like well let's just try this whole portion control thing and see if this works and funny enough I was able to modulate my body composition by eating

[02:46:29] Foods I still enjoyed uh but controlling portion size and it was really interesting I was supposed to debate this is like seven eight years ago I was going to debate a bodybuilding coach um at a a seminar about uh clean eating versus flexible dieting which is kind of what I practice which is you know tracking my macros and kind of treating it like a budget and my opening argument he ended up bowing out of the debate but my opening argument was I had gone to his

[02:46:56] Facebook and looked at his cheat meals and had estimated the calories in his cheat meals in terms of a per week basis and then put up what my calories were from you know junk food on a per week basis was going to show that his was actually higher because in the concentrated amount he was taking in he was actually taking in more calories from those foods and so my point was going to be so you're telling me it's really bad to have a cookie but if I binge on it it's okay as long as I don't have it the rest of the week because that seems like a really odd metric I mean my guess is that everyone if we exposed everyone to all three different forms of restriction you would have a rank order for any person of what's most effective both biochemically and also psychologically you it's a minmax you'd have to find an optimization what fraction of the population do you think will do best meaning they'll have the best physical response and also just psychologically will have the best response to caloric restriction as a tool or flexible dieting and I say this knowing there's no data but thinking asking you to think about clients and and what percentage of people yeah I I think you know part of it is some people will be resistant at first and then actually really enjoy it later um which I'm sure you've seen that with fasting as well or or uh you know low carb those sorts of things it's but it really just boils down to how how willing is somebody to make this part of their lifestyle right so all of them have downsides right like if you're on a ketogenic diet and you're going out and

[02:48:32] I mean there's there's a lot you can't eat but you can usually make do most places might get some funny looks from your friends and family but you know whatever uh Tim restricted feeding you know uh hey you want to go out and join us for breakfast oh can't I'll sit and I'll drink some water you know so there's downsides with with flexible dieting the downside is um I've got to account for it right and actually so we know the data on on on reporting for food is like hor people under report by like 50% and it's pretty consistent in the studies and people really take that as like an up front so well I'm not a liar yeah well I don't think that people are lying I think people are just really horrible estimators of what they eat you know like if you if you ever want to be depressed go weigh out a serving of cereal or weigh out a serving of ice cream or uh a serving of peanut butter you know people when they do these these food recalls I mean a serving of ice cream is not a bowl of ice cream like a bowl of ice cream is probably three times more than a serving in in terms of what people are actually taking in so it makes total sense as to why people underestimate their energy intake and one of the things I I'll say is even if you don't land done flexible dieting as the tool that you want to use tracking and weighing every single thing you put in your mouth for a week is an incredibly valuable tool because it will teach you about portion control and actually you'll learn more about nutrition in that week than probably doing anything else to be honest now a lot of people don't want to do it because it's a lot the same reason a lot of people don't want to keep a budget for for their money because they don't want to know where it's going because then it's kind of like here's the mirror and you have to look at yourself and say oh where have I been spending my money right oh I spent you know $500 on Uber

[02:50:22] Eats last month or you know whatever it is but then with you know macr tracking again it's very much oh man I well and I've I've I have had this so many times people say I'm eating 1500 calories a day and can't lose weight and it's it's hard to believe you can't lose weight on 1500 calories there there was a I will say there was a uh a metabolic Ward study where a put people on, 1500 calories and there was actually one person who gained just a tiny amount of weight over like a I can't remember the time period uh but the vast majority lost weight right I wonder what was going on with that one person right so maybe endocrine issue or something like that yeah yeah so I I I think the the point that I I would make is that I do think it's useful for people to try tracking for a while I mean again we we have people like you know our app is is different than a a calorie tracking app because it actually gives you um you know macros to eat based on your dietary preference and your goals and then it'll it will adjust them based on how you're progressing so it's not just a oneandone calculation and a lot of people love that but they also people who've never tracked before go oh my God I didn't know what I was eating like and you know it has a barcode scanner and all that kind of stuff so it's much easier like when I first started doing this it was me going to the grocery store with The

[02:51:47] Complete Book of food counts and going okay where is it okay there it is but now after having done this sort of stuff for you know 20 years like last night picking up that brownie I'm picking it up and I know what yeah what's the calculation how did you do the calculation so all I do is I just like I don't know what particular brownie that is I don't know how they made or anything like that but it's likely that the calorie density is going to be similar to other brownies right the carb fat ratio might be a little bit different but the calorie density is probably going to be pretty similar so I really just try to think about what do I think this weighs right and so last night I was kind of like it's a little bit denser than a normal brownie I was I put it about 40 grams right and so I put that in now did I did I hang on you didn't put it into an app did you didn't you oh yeah I just put it in my app oh okay okay I I uh but I just pulled up like some random brownie from s or whatever got it got it um so I'll I'll kind of do that now okay I feel a bit better now I literally thought you were doing this in your head the whole time oh no no no no I was like God how is he doing that so I um yeah the the the apps now make it much easier but then the night before when we were out at dinner two nights ago I didn't see you putting anything in the app and at I did I did it after but how how did you remember what we ate and how would you like the bone marrow and all that crazy stuff we were eating like how are you estimating all that stuff yeah so there was an entry for bone marrow that I found um now again the the point that I think

[02:53:23] I'll make is it's very likely that some of these are inaccurate right but it's better it's going to be more accurate than just kind of going I have no idea so I'm not going to worry about it right do you think that the act of tracking it is what's putting a governor on it in other words do you think the fact that you had to enter 40 grams of brownie is what prevented you from having three um at this point no but for some people absolutely right and we I mean this is the one of the most basic laws of science when you monitor something it changes yeah right so I've done this so many times with people who have said the following you know like

[02:54:02] I'm eating, 1500 calories can't lose fat and I've said listen I don't expect you to do this forever but for one week just one week everything you put in your mouth weigh it on a scale and track it okay and then come back to me and let's talk one of two things happen they go oh my God uh I was actually eating 2,800 calories I go I go well welcome to freedom because now now you know that you're not broken right like you're you're actually like you can modify right or the other thing happens they actually eat the amount of calories they said they were eating they L three pounds yeah exactly so um yeah it's it's what monitored is what gets changed and we know that like write down on a particle basis if you monitor it it changes its Behavior so when you get people to monitor things they change their behavior it's like if I if somebody's like oh we're going to do we're going to do Lane's budget for the month and you know we're going to put it on YouTube as a video or something right okay well like all of a sudden we like I want to spend money on this it's not going to look good you know like when we monitor things it changes but but we know that about behavior and we can use that to our advantage so I think the like if I was getting ready for a bodybuilding show for example I would have to change how I do things like I couldn't just you know go out and just kind of guesstimate like that I would have to get much more granular and now the sacrifice might be okay maybe I'll still go out to eat but

[02:55:36] I'm gonna have to take all the ingredients put them on my scale and you know and then and then track oh God OHS which sucks but no I mean look that's if that's what you're doing that's what you're doing like that's the price you have to pay to to get that good and then the the other the other the other the sacrifice that if I want to do a bodybuilding show is okay I'm just I can't go out my friends anymore right yeah or at least in the final yeah and I would say like in the last four weeks I don't I'm pretty much a Hermit you know what I mean um but yeah it's all all these different forms of restriction are just tools right but I do think having that accounting looking through what you're actually having is really educational for a lot of folks and I would say to people who are listening or who are watching and have never done it like try to do it without judgment towards yourself yeah you know like um really without judgment just be curious you know and see hm I wonder what this is and I think what you'll find is if you just enter it with that genuine curiosity you'll find some things out that'll be really helpful towards you for you and you also learn so much about portion sizes that you'll go whoa uh yeah I didn't realize that restaurants serve such massive portion sizes right like it's going to sound bad but I can't tell you how many times I've been eating something and go yeah I'm good I don't I don't I don't need anym and are you still hungry when you push it away it's you know being in tune with your hunger signals plus like some bit of monitoring is helpful the one other thing I'll say is like you know being in tune with Hunger signals is great but that's also hard when you're eating processed food like energy dense hyper palatable food you know previously based on our hunger signals we could you know Auto regulate what we ate yeah because we're in a situation where food wasn't energy dense enough like you would have to become uncomfortable you know to just based on the volume just based on the volume of food you were eating and even like up until the 1950s we had hyper processed you know food whatever but you had to walk down to the bakery to get it right you didn't have it in like really nice available and I still think the serving sizes were a lot smaller oh yeah if you look at dinner plates from like the early 1900s they're like this and then they're like this and now you got dinner plates they just Mass I think anybody listening to this who's been to Europe will will will recognize this but I it never ceases to amaze me no matter how many times I I go to to Italy or something like that I can't get over how small the portions are and it's really wonderful because I'm just a glutton like I will I don't know I think it's part of it is like you grow up as an immigrant kid you eat what's on your plate like we do not throw out food in this house and how many times do I get that lecture about those kids in Africa that don't have anything and it's like you're going to sit here until you eat that thing on your plate and it wasn't like I was being forced to eat bad food it was like right you know liver and spinach and stuff I hated but like The

[02:58:43] Clean Plate was just a part of your mindset same grew up in a lower middle class family and so it was very much like we don't waste food in this house so I think there's still a little bit of the you know I was joking about it yesterday like I eat off my kids plates now it's like what you're not throwing that out give me that um do you think you'll do another bodybuilding show or you you plan to do that anymore right now I consider myself in a long off season I'm not sure I think you know it's if right now there's just so many things going on business-wise and you know I'm kind of in a place where I'm very grateful for that and I want to get it while I can get it and hopefully we can get to the point where we're working because we want to work not because we feel like we have to work

[02:59:34] I mean that's kind of the dream I love what I do I don't see myself ever like retiring retiring y um but it would be nice to be able to have like a little more freedom to go and and do the things that I really am you know super passionate about doing and not having to worry about doing some of the more granular stuff so you know bodybuilding getting ready for a show would would take a significant amount of energy and time so um and powerlifting already does that it's just that you know I can do that without the brain fog and the uh the the mood swings and all that kind of stuff I mean it is it's really funny if you look at case studies of bodybuilders like by the time they're at show so literally every single case study on natural bodybuilders shows that they're hypogonadal by the time they hit stage of course yeah

[03:00:18] I mean and I'm somebody like my testosterone um I've had it measured probably a half dozen times in the last five years the lowest it's ever been is 900 and the highest it's been I think I hit like almost 1100 and that's you know people will say oh see he's not drug free or whatever but I would tell you my

[03:00:36] LH is normal and my FSH is normal and all that kind of stuff so um but when I was competing in bodybuilding it was under 300 like when I was that close to a show cuz it's just it just I mean think about the hungriest you've ever been in your life and now imagine that feeling doesn't leave you for weeks that's awful and the lowest energy you've ever like um I can how how many what's the absolute nator of calories you're consuming at the lowest so the lowest I've ever been like at kind of this level of lean mass was 1900 and um how many grams of protein are in that 1900 so that was what like 260 g of protein so I was like around 100 or under 100 gram of carbohydrate a day and like 30 40 gram of fat if I recall correctly what does that look like practically like what are the what's the actual Foods you're eating I mean egg whites chicken breast um some Greek yogurt you know fat-free

[03:01:38] Greek yogurt I mean you really you have to be very careful with your fats uh when you're that low calories mean you have to be careful you don't go too low on the fats well and that you get but at at a certain point you know the idea is well keep your fats high enough and your hormon well at a certain point you're like all right yeah I'd like to have my hormones there but I also need to get lean enough you know yeah so so meaning be careful that too much fat isn't sneaking in oh yeah yeah I mean like just eating something that's you know like seven grams of fat which by all you know accounts is a lowfat item I had to be careful about that because it could just sneak up very quickly yeah you can't have nuts or something like that just insane so you know the the low energy too like I can literally be remember being on my couch that's probably three weeks out from a show I had just gotten done training sitting on my couch and the remote control was probably I just like sat down like literally like plopped down remote control was probably you know 5 feet away and the Real

[03:02:41] Housewives of some County was playing I I abore that show and I sat and watched the entire show because I was not willing to get up to go get that remote because I was that exhausted and it's like now you see like and how many weeks into that degree of caloric restriction do you think you were at that point uh that was like 20 weeks in well not not at 1900 calories so that my calories had progressively come down um really it's it's mostly a body fat issue like I've I've had clients who were able to eat higher calories and get really lean at a certain point of body fat level it just doesn't matter if you're that lean and your leptin is that low and your testosterone's that low I mean yeah it's it's just Eric Helms describes contest prep as like you're circling a drain and you're you're just trying to delay going down the drain as long as possible but eventually you go down the drain so how do you get the energy to get on stage is that basically one big push of carbs shortly enough before you go on stage that it's not going to show up in your physique so I will say like there there are spurts where you feel okay when you're when you're in those you know the the dregs of contest prep um I'll also say that like for me to get from like say 15% on calipers to 7% on calipers it it's not difficult at all in fact I I had gone up a weight class in powering a few years ago and then came back down it was about a 30 lb uh weight drop but so 15 to seven easy from seven to and I think the lowest I ever calipered was 2% and everybody watching no I don't think I was 2% um it's probably more like five or six but to go from seven to to three or two which is an absolute lower amount of fat loss was infinitely more difficult it's like um the best way to describe it is like kind of like you get a fresh roll of toothpaste to get out some tooth P very easy then as that toothpaste tube gets you know emptier and emptier how much effort do you have to put in to just squeeze out that last little bit of toothpaste I mean it's it's magnitudes higher than at the beginning and contest prep is is very much like that so like to you but you do have times where you have energy um because you still have to train two or three hours a day right and trust me like that that is actually the part I despise the most of contest prep is at a certain point I just don't like training anymore I'm just doing it for energy expenditure and retaining of muscle I'm not doing it because I'm passionate about training um and I'm somebody who I I love to train it's like my favorite thing in the world and but there will be times where it's like you go in you have a little bit better workouts I did periodize my nutrition so I would have some higher calorie days on days that were more demanding for training usually like lower body training days um as far as like getting on stage um well one thing is I never cut water for bodybuilding shows a lot of people do that um I think it's silly because um think about a muscle is 70% water and in your native state you you keep more water inside your muscle cell than you do outside your muscle cell and you know this is just basic lat Lea's principle if you begin removing more fluid like via dtic or fluid um restriction or uh sodium restriction well what happens well well sure you remove it from the subcutaneous layer but you're also going to remove it in the same proportion from the from the intracellular layer all you're going to do is just become flatter in the intravascular layal you get hypotensive exactly so um one thing that helped me is that I didn't cut water so I felt I never was like dehydrated or anything like that didn't cut sodium and I could go into the physiology behind why I think it's silly to cut sodium as well and didn't take a dtic but yes like during Peak Week food went back up because the idea is diuretics even legal in um T you can take OTC diuretics so you could take like dandelion root and those sorts of things um but yeah it's it's very funny like the the the logic behind why people cut water in sodium and I think it's like somebody just saw a figure of the sodium potassium pump in a book and they were like oh see the cell wants to get sodium out and pottassium in so let's cut sodium and load potassium and it's like if you actually look at the physiology if you get the sodium to potassium ratio to low it'll actually cause you to retain water as well like the you'll actually start reabsorbing water in the distal tubule of the kidney um so yeah I think that that helped with my energy and whatnot but definitely food in the days before the competition comes up because at that point like if you're still trying to lose body fat that close it's probably not going to go well for you um and so

[03:07:41] I'll like usually in peak week I'll start feeling better as opposed to worse and then the day of the show you know I'm usually having you know 3 to 400 grams of carbohydrate something like that so it's you know it's it's very interesting because a lot of the dogmas in bodybuilding originated in like wrestling and endurance running you know if you look at the the correlation was kind of like well wrestlers cut water and they look really lean so we should cut water right and I'll always use the example of um if you've ever seen George

[03:08:15] St Pierre when he weighed in he looked like gaunt you know not very I mean just didn't look healthy not very muscular and then the day of the fight 24 hours later I mean he looks like a bodybuilder you know what I mean like he he looks pretty jacked well that will just show you what like drinking water eating enough sodium and carbohydrate will do for your muscle fullness because muscles are 70% water so yeah I I I think that that all that stuff kind of helped me have a little bit more like longevity in that sport in so far as like I wasn't beating my body up with you know fluid uh restriction so you're 40 now when you sort of think about yourself being 60 or 70 how do you think about aging in terms of the reductions in strength which is obviously an important part of your identity and the change in physique um you know the do you think that it's going to be a difficult transition and

[03:09:22] I'm not suggesting that the alternative to what you're doing now is sitting on a couch all day drinking beer of course but you know invariably whether you're Arnold Schwarzenegger or you know anyone who's really fit like you're not going to look the same when you're 60 um I think about this a lot you know I bug my wife or not bug her I just I I say all the time I'm like God I can't stand my face like it's so wrinkled and beaten up from all the Sun and she's like well you don't do anything about it she's like you could go and see a dermatologist and they and I'm like yeah I'm just too lazy

[03:09:54] I think it's just easier to sit here and sort of gripe about it and think about like just have these vain thoughts of well the older I get the the older I look you know yeah um I mean I could sit here and say oh no I'll be F no of course I'm G to struggle with it like you know look at any like athlete you know that is your identity for such a long period of your life now I think I'm fortunate in that I've kind of had multiple identities so I've had you know academic um you know uh influencer uh entrepreneur uh you know powerlifter bodybuilder scientist so I think it'll be a little bit easier for me because I already have other things that I I care about you know and and then being a dad

[03:10:38] I already have other things I care about um but of course it'll be hard like you know like don't nobody who's successful doesn't have any ego whatsoever you know um and so I'm not going to lie like when I load up a bar with 500 lounds in a commercial gym and you know I'm squatting that like part of me feels like a badass you know what I mean um and so yeah there's going to be part of me that absolutely missed that you know that's why you have the guy who's like well you know when I was in high school you know I benched 405 or or whatever it is or you know I squatted 600 until my knees hurt so my goal is to not be that guy you know other than just like if somebody asked me about what I've done to do it but I think really what's going to be most important for me is just trying to not judge it and just you know find other things that I can you know be interested in and I'll still always lift

[03:11:38] I'll always train I love it too much to not do it makes me feel too good yeah um and quite frankly like if you look at some of the people who have been doing it for a really long time I I mean you know uh it was I got a great compliment the other day cuz I was in the gym and I just kind of casually brought up that I was I turned 40 this year and lady was like what I was like yeah you know and she's like oh I I would have guessed that you were like you know mid-30s well thank you you know but I I think like resistance training I mean as far as like keeping you young that's one of the I agree I feel like I feel like for both men and women it's a it's it is it is a fountain of youth both cosmetically and also internally oh well even look looking at some of the um the bodybuilders out there not withstanding like some of the the drug stuff yeah but some of them still look really good into their 50s you know if they if they continue to do it now there's a lot of guys who get out of it and kind of once that identity is gone they just go what's the point of putting energy into lifting but you know like Jay Cutler's in his 40s and yeah I was about to say Jay Jay Cutler is my favorite of the kind of recent bodybuilders um he's the only bodybuilder like of that group that I follow on Instagram I enjoy looking at him yeah know I mean he's he still looks to be in insane shape yeah and he and if you look at him he goes trains every day he still eats really well you know he just kind of got he likes that lifestyle and got used to it and you know it shows yeah but um yeah it'll definitely be a hard you know transition but I'm I'm sure I'll find something to you know bury myself in and uh you know who knows we'll see well we we went a little longer than we we expected to we we've cut ourselves out of a few extracurricular activities

[03:13:21] I had planned this afternoon but maybe we'll have time tomorrow so anyway Lane awesome to sit down with you thanks again for making the time yeah thanks for having me it was fun [Music]
