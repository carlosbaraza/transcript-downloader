Stuart McGill is a distinguished professor emeritus at the University of Waterloo and the chief scientific officer at Backfitpro Inc. (https://www.backfitpro.com/about-us/) where he specializes in evaluating complex cases of lower back pain from across the globe. In this episode, Stuart engages in a deep exploration of lower back pain, starting with the anatomy of the lower back, the workings of the spine, the pathophysiology of back pain, and areas of vulnerability. He challenges the concept of nonspecific back pain, emphasizing the importance of finding a causal relationship between injury and pain. Stuart highlights compelling case studies of the successful treatment of complex cases of lower back pain, reinforcing his conviction that nobody needs to suffer endlessly. He also covers the importance of strength and stability, shares his favorite exercises to prescribe to patients, and provides invaluable advice for maintaining a healthy spine.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Stuart McGill, a renowned expert in spine biomechanics and back pain. The discussion centers on understanding, treating, and preventing lower back pain through a mechanistic approach. Dr. McGill emphasizes the importance of proper assessment and understanding individual pain mechanisms rather than applying generic solutions. The conversation includes personal experiences, clinical cases, and practical advice for both prevention and treatment.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Disc delamination occurs from inside out, often without symptoms until final breach [15:03]
- Healthy discs don't have nerve innervation, but damaged discs develop nerve growth [29:55]
- Joint instability can occur without showing on static MRI images [1:14:58]
- Muscle contraction creates both force and stiffness for joint control [2:16:59]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal recommendations:
- Avoid prolonged sitting without breaks [2:35:33]
- Morning walks before work can help prevent pain [2:29:17]
- Maintain proper posture while sitting [2:29:17]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Virtual surgery approach for some patients (forced rest) [1:57:02]
- Different approaches needed for flexibility vs. stability issues [2:23:01]

4. **Exercise & Movement**:

The "Big Three" exercises:
- Modified curl-up [1:06:53]
- Side plank [1:06:53]
- Bird dog [1:08:11]

Training methodologies:
- Russian descending pyramid approach using 10-second intervals [1:06:53]
- Focus on proximal stiffness before distal movement [1:02:51]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"There is no such thing as non-specific back pain" [2:35:01]
"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger can be true for the spine" [1:37:13]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What specific assessments can be done at home to determine if stability or mobility is the primary issue?
2. How should exercise progression be modified as symptoms improve?
3. What are the specific indicators for when to transition from virtual surgery to active rehabilitation?

Would you like me to expand on any of these sections or provide additional analysis of other aspects of the episode?

[00:00:00] ultimately what we're trying to do is to empower people in showing them they have the ability within themselves they just need to understand the mechanism and most of the time they are able to mitigate the cause and then build a robust Foundation hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter AA

[00:00:31] hey Stuart thank you so much for joining me today um wish we were doing this in person because there's so much I'd love to get into but I have a feeling we're going to be able to do a pretty good job remotely and I get the sense that you're very well-versed at communicating your ideas in two Dimensions rather than three so anyway uh great to make your acquaintance today same here Peter I've been looking forward to this day for quite a long time um at some point I'm going to thank you for writing your book you are one of the few people on this planet who uh a I allowed and B I did change my behavior so uh thank you very much for that and uh let's uh let's see where we go today

[00:01:24] I don't you're going to leave me hanging with that I can't I'm I'm curious to know what it what it was uh were you a smoker who somehow stopped no I'm kidding I I what was it well uh I uh couple of years ago uh my family dock right now is one of my former students this is this may bring a smile to your face I don't remember this but apparently when he was an undergrad and he asked me to write the letter of recommendation for medical school I told him of course I'm going to write this because one day I'm going to need a a good doc when I'm an old man well wouldn't you know anyway so uh we did my Bloods and I was just on the edge of uh what the Cardiology Association is saying meing a Crestor or Lipitor or something like that and this doc knows me well enough uh he said uh let's run the experiment and so we're we're we're doing it for three months I'm uh living

[00:02:29] Peter aa's life and then I love to work hard physically and finish it off with a beer which of course six days out of seven I'm denying myself of that but uh long story short I have my Bloods done again in two weeks and we'll see if this three-month experiment has uh uh paid off he says no it's in your genetics you're not going to move the marker but my sister says oh no you you will she did so uh anyway uh thanks and no thanks but uh I think I'm sleeping a little bit better I think I'm a little more mentally sharp but we'll see over the next hour if that's true but anyway well we we can revisit this I'll uh I'll I'll reserve the right to come back and say maybe um maybe you don't have to be quite as restrictive and uh but I I I I I I I don't necessarily believe in denying all the all the pleasures of life uh and I certainly don't and I don't deny them myself so um there were some paragraphs in your book that just burned into my memory that that the day you allowed yourself some french fries and I thought oh okay I'm going to stay with a plan come H High want but anyway there you go well I'm I'm gonna start with a story um steuart because U it's a story that some of the listeners might know but but you probably don't know in this level of detail and it sets the stage for why this is a topic that is of great interest me personally um and of course by extension I I suspect that there are very few people who are going to listen to us today who can't relate to the subject at hand so the very Abridged version of the story is um I I grew up uh doing all sorts of really aggressive things and really took to powerlifting when I was probably 14 um and found myself reasonably strong for a little scrawny kid and between about the ages of 14 and 19 I really really pushed uh couldn't bench press to save my life but seemed pretty strong in a squat and deadlift um and kind of ignored any claims my parents made that maybe I was doing a little too much um and and um truthfully and sadly had no formal instruction there was no you know I was just watching the other grown men in the gym who were insanely powerful um and sort of just trying to replicate what they were doing but but truthfully had no sense of what I was doing anyway fast forward um I am 21 years old I'm rowing at the time so rowing crew and for the first time in my life I experienced lower back pain and um this really rocked my world because I always thought that people who got lower back pain were people who did nothing I it I I never really thought someone who was as active as as I was could get it and for about two weeks Stuart it completely completely disabled me um you know I could sort of get around but barely um and being a college student I didn't really have any resources I didn't know what to do I I was able to get to this was actually I think it occur during the summer so I didn't have classes but you know I had to stop rowing I remember that and otherwise I was able to work um it went away and I thought everything was fine and I never thought about it again until the summer 3 years later when I was 24 years old and I remember exactly where I was I was in San Diego riding my bike up the steepest hill in San San Diego which is a certain patch of a mountain called

[00:06:14] Mount solidad and uh there's a a a section of this thing where you make a sharp right turn and at that moment it's about a 25 degree pitch and I experienced this very sudden pain in my lower back and like a typical idiot just kept on pushing and climbing to the top and finished my ride but then went on to experience the exact same thing Stuart for two weeks I was debilitated couldn't do a thing other than sort of lay around and walk but then it got better and I kind of just forgot all about it and then fast forward to the big one it's I'm doing pattern recognition here yeah so the big the big one occurred in my third year medical school I'm now 27 years old and the remarkable consistency of this is not lost on me it is every 3 years by the summer the summer of '94 97 and 2000 and I'm riding my bike from class to the gym and um I get to the gym hop off my bike to lock it up and all of a sudden I feel that same familiar de just horrible pain in my back but this time it's a little worse than the the previous two bouts and it was so bad that I did something I'd never done before Stuart I decided not to go into the gym and so I just slowly got back on the bike and limped my way back to my apartment and wasn't able to do anything other than just sort of lay in bed I assumed I'd be fine the next morning and I woke up the next morning and actually couldn't get out of bed uh luckily my roommate and I each had separate phone lines so I was able to call him from my room and uh so began the a really painful Journey over the next couple of weeks where the only place I could find relief was bent at 90° forward where I would basically stand and bend over the nurses station by this point I was doing my clinical rotations and as every good gunning medical student knows there was no way I was going to miss a day of this so I would drag myself into the hospital each day and somehow managed to get through this the nurses took pity on me and so did the residents and they were injecting me full of Tor doll and this went on for a month and um and it got so bad that eventually the pain progressed from just being debilitating in my lower back to a nerve pain that felt like my foot was being skinned and it was interesting in that the pain in my lower back started to to subside as it was replaced by the feeling of my left foot being skinned from the bottom um uh I'm not going to go into the more details of the story because it gets worse and worse before getting better but needless to say um I I have a graduate degree in back pain um there's a happy ending to this story Stuart which is after this partic this bout which occurred when I was 27 which took a year to resolve um

[00:09:30] I made it kind of a mission to figure out what was going on and I'm not suggesting that I have but I know so much more now than I did then and fortunately um anytime I've had back pain since then it has been a very very short-lived experience um I'll plant one last seed before we jump into this just for both you and The Listener so that we can come back to it if you are to look at an MRI of my spine today um you would ask yourself maybe not you because you're so well-versed but a reasonable person would look at an MRI of my spine today at the age of 50 and say how does he Walk Like H this person must be in so much pain he doesn't know his name and yet I can tell you for the most part I'm not at all occasionally I get a little tight in my you know my lower back musculature but you know I don't have radicular pain I I'm not I'm not limited in anything I do um again suggesting that the correlation between the image of my back on an MRI and my symptoms uh is pretty light okay so with all that as a backdrop um the fact that you're smiling so much as I tell you this story tells me not that you're taking pleasure in my pain but rather the familiarity of my story exactly I've been doing pattern recognition there's only one thing that would account for the rep repated acute episodes in the interim between each one you were quite fine then it shifted to a ridicul pain and now you're at the stage of your life where it's more an occasional grumpiness when you cross what we call the Tipping Point so if you did the pain go to your foot Peter yes go to toes big toes or little toes no it was actually really interesting it was it was a it was a burning pain that was like the bottom the foot was being skinned I should have I I there's one detail I should have um uh shared with you that might explain this when I finally did have surgery um it it it it turned out I had a free fragment that was about 5 cm long from the L5 S1 um disc so that free fragment had broken off well I was going to guess this for you actually that I was going to ask you which foot and did it uh so the fifth route goes to your big toe but anyway you carry on and so so basically the really really unbearable pain I was having presumably was because that free fragment was parked on the S1 nerve route um and even though it ended up taking two surgeries to get that out uh and those surgeries ended up causing more damage that needed more repair that turned into a journey of uh A Thousand

[00:12:20] Cuts um you know I was on the I was on the I was on the road to recovery but but the radicular pain seemed to be directly a result of the uh S1 nerve route right well if if you want me to react to that story a little bit I I'm smiling because you told me exactly what the pain mechanism was I knew it was a disc with an open Fisher disc bulge it would be on the side of your foot pane it was it right or left so what what what foot was it it was left okay so you had a uh posterior left-sided biased open Fisher disc bulge that would open and close as a function of the flection postures bending down to uh lock your bicycle uh you know you just gave it to me every single time and then you were able to uh vacuum that in it lasted for a couple of weeks now you're in the unstable phase so if you want I can uh show and tell if you want me to show you do you want me to show you a couple of mechanisms yeah in fact what I was going to suggest even before we get into that because I want to this is exactly where

[00:13:36] I want to go Stuart is um let's walk people through the anatomy of the back now I understand that there are some people who are going to be listening to us so whenever possible do your best imagining somebody can't see us but I think there's also going to be enough people watching on video um and we'll certainly refer people to the video at least for this section in addition to some diagrams but let's really explain to people what this remarkable structure of the human back is right the stability the flexibility the mobility the amount of nerves muscles and ligaments that are involved it's um you could almost argue it's a miracle we don't get more injured even though the frequency with which we do is intense take us take us through the anatomy right I would almost argue the opposite Peter there was a television show that they were producing and asking various experts around the world if you got to re-engineer your particular area me being the spine guy and and uh this thing you know they had a cardiac person a endocrine system person person Etc how would you re-engineer it and make it better and every expert said they couldn't it was perfect so everything in terms of systems in your body comes with a tradeoff and there are rules that manage the tradeoff so with that I can start the uh

[00:15:03] Anatomy uh the spine is a series of vertebrae as you know forming a flexible Rod this allows us to dance and move and procreate tie our shoes and do all of these wonderful things but at some point you now say are picking your child out of the crib you reach across the crib gather your child pull them in if you had a flexible Rod consider a a series of stacked oranges it would fall apart uh so you need a flexible Rod that you can then stiffen to Bear a load you cannot push rope but you can push stone or in this case an ibeam to Bear load so all of these things are necessary to have a functional spine uh what else can

[00:15:52] I say let's look at the structure of the diss which are the uh fabric it it it the dis actually forms the subcategory of a biological fabric it's not a ball and socket joint could you imagine if we had vertebrae with ball and socket joints like you would need an enormous musculature around that flexible Rod to control all the ball and sockets you would need an enormous motor cortex to coordinate all of these you would be so wide you couldn't walk you couldn't run uh Etc but we have this very slender torso because we have discs now the stress strain curve of a disc starts out with a little bit of a neutral zone in the neutral range and as you approach the end range the disc provides stiffness a mechanical stop to motion fabulous I didn't need all this complex musculature to do so so the dis creates tremendous evolutionary efficiency in in your spine um let's see now either end of the

[00:17:02] Torso strategically is a ball and socket joint the ball and socket joints of the hips and shoulders are designed to create power power is force times velocity so if you were to watch a sprinter Sprint the extensor muscles explode like a hammer hitting a stone a stiffen structure if they hit rope they you the hips would bsome you couldn't run anywhere you can't even walk without sufficient stiffness um in the core so uh I can get into a an interesting discussion of how stability

[00:17:42] Works proximately to unleash and enable this distal uh athleticism so in terms of anatomy we have a flexible disc that is a fabric that great Advantage is the efficient y of your Dimensions that I'm talking about we're light narrow in the waist we can run Etc the price that you pay though is being a structure of many collagen fibers if let's take my shirt which is a fabric if

[00:18:19] I wanted to delaminate the fibers I would have to create stress strain reversals back and forth and slowly we would debond the fibers this is what happens to people's discs they debond the fibers with too much load and motion simultaneously and this is what you must have done as a younger fellow but the concentric rings of collagen that are held together with collagen Type X The

[00:18:47] Binding substance uh they hold a pressurized gel which is this incompressible hydraulic fluid that creates the ball that that gets pressurized but it's always seeking the weakness in the wall if you delaminate the collagen fibers then the nucleus seeps through and in some situations the fibers are pulled together and they uh create a fragment as you descri uh described earlier or if it's an open Fisher and contained underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament there's a good chance it's going to get vacuumed back in and off you go for another two or three years um I I don't know how much well I can talk about the nerves I suppose uh if you have a disc bulge there is the spinal cord centrally behind the vertebrae and at each lumbar or spinal joint is a pair of nerve Roots sorry maybe maybe one thing we can talk about before that steuart is the other point of fixation which are the facet joints so if if anteriorly this structure is bounded and the vertebral bodies are stuck together through their sharing of the dis on the back we have these other joints that come from each of them called these facet joints so yeah why don't you talk a little bit about that I don't know if you can see those but the facet joints are guiding of motion so uh you can see as I'm flexing and extending and twisting this model spine these are articular joints in the back that are guiding motion uh what you will find if I I know what I'm going to find if I look at your

[00:20:44] MRI at the level of the disc bulge the facet joints will now be getting a little thicker a bit more gnarly looking am I am I right because the Petes almost always two or three years after a major your disc uh injury they take much more load as you think of uh air in your car tire if you let a little air out of your car tire it bulges on the road it gets a bit sloppy to drive your car you have to tune the pressure um this is exactly what happens with your body so when you lose the controlling stiffness of the disc you get more work performed on the facet joints and they wear a little bit faster than the adjacent joints and they grow thicker and facette pain is very different from disc pain uh it's more of a an ache uh it comes on a bit more slowly uh if you have a wound up Facet

[00:21:46] Joint it can take two or three months to wind it down versus a disc that as you described you can wind down in a couple of weeks um but if I can show this as a model now this dis is normal this bottom disc L5 is normal L4 has been damaged I'm just going to apply a torque to this spine do you see how the majority of the motion now is occurring at the Joint that's lost stiffness think of it like a knee that has a damaged acl ligament it no longer has the guidance and the rotation motion of the knee which is normal is now substitute with shearing motion so shearing motion uh indicates it's the metric for instability so now you can see the shearing instability and now look at the work being performed by the facet joints at the level of the dis being damaged and losing stiffness now those will get grumpy and they will wear a little bit faster if you continue with the behavior that you did prior to so injury and this

[00:22:56] Cascade changes the rules a little bit so initially uh the the goal was to create power in the shoulders and the hips and transfer it through a controlled spine but now the game has changed a little bit you're 50 years old you will have a little bit of uh joint instability it's more important now to create a muscular girdle around the uh joint that has lost a bit of stiffness and for the next little while uh do your core exercises develop a bit more muscular control arrest the shearing motions and uh By the time but you and I are very similar by the way so I'm in my late 60s now my pain is gone so the joint has become so stiff it's uh it's I can still do everything I want to do but the joint itself has stiffened up and and

[00:24:00] Professor caldi Willis the the famous uh Canadian spine surgeon wrote a book called managing low back pain and he described very well the process that most of us go through the instability and the Very acute episodes that come every two or three years that are very debilitating to a muscular ache and you wake up in the morning on one side with this ache in your back but if you push one heel away or put a pillow under your waist or something like that you can get rid of the egg and then if you live a little bit longer and behave by the new rules you're back to uh I I don't have any back pain and I can encourage that uh you will seek that relief as well

[00:24:48] Stuart give us a sense of the the prevalence of acute lower back pain episodes so is it acute is an acute lower back pain episode defined as one that lasts up to some period of time two weeks or something like that no I I don't Define it that way at all and you'll be surprised I'm not the guy who can give you those statistics I don't worry about those sorts of things all I worry about is the people who come here and ask for help with their back pain so

[00:25:17] I'm not out there doing population studies to track incidents and even having said that when I used to study that as a younger scientist what is back pain what's an acute episode is it sufficient to be debilitating so you don't have to work I was a professor I could have an acute attack and go to work if I was a construction worker I couldn't so even the definition of whether it was disabling or not gets lost so I didn't really get into those statistics um but having said that uh I don't categorize pain as being acute lasting a certain period of time and chronic lasting a longer period of time because when we measure people here with back pain very rarely do we find chronic back pain it's almost always due to them repeatedly insulting their back with many cute attacks and offenses all day long so they think they have chronic pain because it lingers when we show them a strategy or whatever the the treatment happens to be to stop the insults that occur throughout the day all of a sudden their pain goes and then they realized you know I never did have chronic back pain so chronic back pain to us is pain that is intransigent unrelenting um their brains have changed they've been traumatized that is chronic pain and not always having a strong mechanical trigger so that's how we separate chronic uh and acute but the pattern that you described of the uh two we disabling terribly disabling pain you had was only one thing that that could be and that was an open Fisher disc

[00:27:15] Bulch yeah let's talk about the mechanism of the discomfort so um for example is that disc actually inated is the pain that's being perceived due to sensory fibers of the dis or is it the response of the body sensing that damage going into some sort of protective mechanism that is you know seizing all the muscles within the proximity of it it could be either or it could be both um so here's how I would answer that a healthy disc so get one here and by the way all these models that I'm using biofidelic models are made by Dynamic dis designs so when a dis is healthy uh you know people say well what's the number one thing you can do to keep a healthy spine and I will say keep your end plates healthy and and they they wonder about that you know don't damage their your joints as as you wrote in your book you if you damage your knee ligaments you will now uh have have uh in your last decade disabled Mobility that's that's a fact so it's the same with the spine if you can look into the nucleus of this model you'll see that there are red vessels and yellow nerves now there are all kinds of papers oh there's no nerves inside the dis and then you'll read another paper oh there are nerves in the outer third and then there are nerves all the way through and the reason reason is a healthy virgin disc doesn't have any vascular tissues going into it nor does it have any nerves um when you and the reason is when you squeeze a disc you build up tremendous intradiscal pressure that kills any kind of vascular Sprouts or neural Sprouts it's a healthy environment containing the pressure when you damage the disc and you lose the ability to contain the high pressure now all of a sudden vascular sprouts grow in and so do nerves so it's so unfair you damage the disc and now the body grows a hardware more nerves to feel pain even more and then eventually uh this just goes to a very fibrous gnarly uh structure um highly inovated but now it it just basically gristle to

[00:29:55] Bone and all the pain goes away but you can see where the damage line if I can get the contrast there do you see those fibers posterior laterally on the right have delaminated and if I squeeze the disc and you see this I'm going to squeeze and flex yeah do you see the fibers laminating and allowing the nucleus to seep out but here's the anti-dot pater stay stacked and tall and I'm going to squeeze the whole disc bulges in a defuse bulging pattern but nothing comes out of the delaminated uh uh region so there's a little bit of an explanation of why some studies will show an interated disc and other shows they're not interated at all it depends where they think of where you get cabers from it's not young healthy people dying and donating uh their body it's almost always older people so those discs are uh innervated unless they're horribly down the Cascade and they've gristle and all the nerves have now uh disappeared once again is is that what you were looking for in that answer yeah that's very helpful and I was totally unaware of that by the way so that's um very interesting and as you pointed out almost a very cruel adaptation um that is that is quite counterintuitive let's talk a little bit about the curvature of the spine what is it about the way we interact with the world and the curvature of our spine that tends to produce the majority of injuries at either the interface between

[00:31:45] L4 and L5 or the interface between L5 and S1 oh what an interesting question I'm I'm thinking of several things that are going through my mind as as you you asked that well first of all it's the thickest part of the spine so if I was to take a thin Willow Branch and bend the Willow Branch back and forth no stress tissues damage because of one metric and it's strain not the force supplied not the pressure anything it's just strain on the tissue that is the metric of when it's going to disrupt so it's thin the radial distance to the neutral axis which is the axis down the middle of that thin rod that doesn't go into compression or tension y uh it's all very low now let's take a thicker stick and we bend it and it shatters right away because it's much thicker so the bend and I I'm going to digress a moment go back to the flexible Willow Branch it's wonderful at bending that's what it's made for but don't ask it to Bear compression because it buckles right away y the thicker stick can bear tremendous compression but it doesn't tolerate bending so you look at the neck very thin uh uh small diameter vertebra it's made for bending and Mobility fabulous but as you move down the spine and get to the bottom two where the thickest is they do not tolerate bending near as much as they tolerate compression so there's the first um uh anatomic feature that describes why the bending stresses are greatest at the thicker Two Joints which are uh at the bottom the uh other things that matter are the shape of the disc so uh some discs are ooid and the bigger the skeleton they tend to go to a limacon so you have the spinal cord uh there and then the two loes of the limacon so the bigger the spine the more limacon the disc becomes when you twist limacon you create a stress Riser right on the edge of each lobe the bigger the person you will see they don't tolerate situps look look at YouTube who is the man who has the world record for consecutive situps do you think he has a thick spine or a thin spine you know he won't be a powerlifter uh and you know having work with with with some f fabulous powerlifters and and and strong men competitors uh uh not one of them does a situp they they they train other things to tune their body and and make it suitable to that particular uh training stimulation so now we see that shape thickness uh determines uh why uh L4 and L5 are are the target we know that they don't twist uh as well as a slender spine um the facet joints are also very interesting as well so some facet joints since you brought those up earlier uh are orientated like that in the sagittal plane others are orientated more open as we say so if you look at a gymnast who uh in but by definition me I would never choose to be a gymnast but you can tell look at my facettes they're closed I don't twist for well however when you

[00:35:31] Flex forward and pull a load those facet joints just Glide past one another so a gymnast by definition is someone who has a lot of mobility in their spine you will see that their facet joints tend to be open now if I said to you who among your patients gets fondal is thesis the broken pars bone that holds the facet joint joint on basically you are going to say well dancers gymnasts the very people that had the mechanical advantage to twist now when they go into extension their facet joints are like shingles on a roof they bend the pars bone creating stress strain reversals and eventually that bone will uh get a stress fracture or a stress reaction and if they keep going fullblown spond all this thesis so there's all kinds of reasons uh I'm I'm just giving you a few now uh as to why those two diss really are the as an engineer now stress risers when I developed our uh in my PhD thesis actually a very detailed anatomical model of the spine computer model uh that that hit home loud and clear we did stress maps of real people moving the pain and the injury was almost always at the sight of the highest stress and remember I said the metric is strain that actually leads to uh uh damage or it actually if it's below the

[00:37:13] Tipping Point it actually strengthens you so we can have that conversation as well what does not kill you makes you stronger can you um help folks um because I I there's a risk that you and I talking about this because we're both Engineers will easily get into the weeds of compression strain tension strain but for people listening to us who might not have that background can you explain the difference between stress and strain and what's what happens under tensile load compressive loads and things like that yes um let's not talk about stress and strain let's talk about applied load and deformation so stress and strain are normalized to an area we won't get into that so if I apply a force to a structure it deforms so I'm applying a force and I'm getting a deoration um mature sceletal bone breaks at a certain amount of deformation a child's bone breaks at a different level of deformation when you take a long bone and you bend it the upper surface goes into tension it's trying to pull apart the lower surface goes into compression some biological structures are stronger in tension than they are in compression uh a child is actually weaker in compression in a bending bone and then the adult is weaker on the tensil side so a green stick fracture or a buckled bone in a young child would be very rare to see in an adult as an ex example so the behavior of biomaterials when you load them and how they deform uh explains a lot of injuries so if you were to put me on the witness stand as as people do occasionally to explain is the damage that we see professor in this MRI or in the cadav or whatever consistent with this particular mechanical Alle scenario yes or no and that's how we reconstruct that so so tissues stress and strain Shear Bend uh tensile pull apart uh Etc and the deformation causes very specific types of uh damage so so let's I like to use this example for people um I like to use the example of concrete which is every ing students favorite example right so concrete is so strong in compression and yet intention it is so weak that we need to come up with a hack how can we use this material to allow it to be both strong and compression and tension because the example you use is really a good one right if you have a bridge made out of concrete and you're driving on top of it the bridge wants to deform which means you're putting the top in tension well that's great it can handle it but the bottom is in uh sorry you're putting the top in compression which it can handle the bottom in tension which it can't so we put rebar in because the steel rebar is of course strong intention and you know the saying is the whole purpose of conrete is to hold the rebar in place so when when you when when you think about the spine I think it's I want to dig into this a little bit more if you think it's helpful right so we we take an axial Lo on the spine and as you pointed out the cervical spine is not built for tolerating a big axial load it's designed more to provide movement it's a it's a joint for great flexibility the lumbar spine for all the reasons you just explained is really designed around taking a large compressive load and it's in the process sacrificed the mobility we have in the neck but now let's talk about load in the context of flinch F flexion and extension where you now do have within the disc it's not just pure compression it's actually again if you're in so maybe just even explain to people flexion is bending forward extension is going back so um now if you have an axial load in that position which you could easily have if you're deadlifting something or squatting something any given disc in that especially in that lower spine region can be under compression and tension at the same time correct absolutely I I have a little bit of a story on that Peter it's so interesting when uh I I say I'm asked to give a lecture to a group of Radiologists and and they describe very well all the subcategories of disc bulges and disc deorations and that kind of thing but they've never been taught what the applied load nor the adaptation was so let me paint a little picture here of the deadlifter a deadlifter almost always gets a posterior disc bulge as you you may know so a deadlifter is under tremendous compressive load and if they say get to the bottom of where the hips run out of room now the femur collides with the pelvis and thereafter the rotation takes place in their low back because the nucleus is under such enormous compressive pressure remember this model I had to bend it forward to get the nucleus to squirt back so you're creating a center of hydraulic effort now let's consider a person who's adapted their spine to do yoga this is why I say please never mix up deadlifts and yoga if you adapt your spine to be very flexible you adapt the Type X collagen holding the type one and type two the heavy gristly collagen and then the elastic collagen all those fibers together a powerlifter wants them to be stiff and tough they even wear an exoskeleton of a lifting suit to add even more stiffness and toughness but the yoga master that would be the kiss of death they want nice pliable flexible spines they soften the ground substance holding the collagen together so when they Bend forward in contrast to the disc bols going backwards the front of the disc now buffles under um compression so when a power lifter typically now of course there are very odd cases that are the exceptions the powerlifter bends forward and crushes the dis bulge posteriorly but when when the yoga person or very flexible spine when they

[00:44:30] Bend backwards the collagen under compression buckles so one gets a disc bulge from extension and the other gets a disc bulge from flexion isn't that interesting and it all depends on how they ad adapted there's fine but my my final point in all of that is don't mix up the adaptation schedules so if you want to be a powerlifter train your hip mobility shoulder Mobility uh but torso stiffness uh try not to throughout the day do a lot of uh bending versus the yoga Master please stay away from the very heavy loads what is the pathologic response to the anterior bulging of the disc because when you have that posterior bulge I guess we we should have mentioned this earlier and I guess it's worth stating the spinal cord stops quite high up the spinal cord does not run down the entire

[00:45:28] Canal it stops around L2 so for most of the people experiencing lower uh back pain Visa a herniation the fortunately the herniated disc is not hitting your spinal cord it is hitting the nerves that emanate from it but again there's so much real estate in that area it's it's it's insane right because you don't just have the nerve Roots you have the dorsal Roots you have all all of these other tiny little nerves that are going to the facets and to the disc and to the vertebral bodies that's Sur running musculature and to your genitals and and and do everything that's important of course that that's that's that's absolutely correct and I learned that the very very hard way um and um but tell me about the laughing again I'm laughing with the with the here not at the person yeah no no it's uh yeah we could tell tell some stories if we weren't on the air um and so the uh tell me about the the manifestation clinically of the anterior herniation in that very flexible person who's presumably greatly lacking in any spinal stability there there probably won't be too much uh they will go along with their merry life and uh be flexible uh the anterior bulge is not as a rule picking up any nasty nerve root compressions and uh on the grand scheme Peter it's probably a non-clinical issue for them now do those people still they wanted to lift uh you know they were in an emergency situation now they've come across a car wreck someone is in the car and if they don't get them out the car is going to explode so we will all be placed into these situations at some point in our life and and whether or not we have the physicality to deal with them is is another issue but uh anyway that that's the downside of that particular adaptation and lifestyle perhaps and which of these types of injuries leaves a person more susceptible to the movement of the vertebral bodies in a slipped fashion where we now get that spondo what I I I can never remember which spondo we're talking about I think we're now talking about spond thesis when the vertebral body on top moves relative to the bottom correct yeah that's the interior one sure the answer is uh both so a very flexible spine can get sheer translations just the way as a as a stiffer spine can uh so again we wouldn't uh a priori uh judge and uh attribute one of those to the symptoms the we always go by the assessment and it could be there's mine for sure want to back up for just a second to the the story I opened with and just kind of dig in a little bit more to the pathophysiology so that very very first bout of back pain I had when I was 21 years old um clearly the previous eight years of or whatever maybe seven years eight years of really really really heavy lifting with kind of a blatant disregard for any technical certainly the technical knowledge I have today about how to do these things correctly was completely absent if you had to guess and this is purely speculation what was the process that led to that injury on that day that manifestation you know if I had had MRIs examining my spine every year starting at the age of 13 until that first real insult at age 21 what would you have seen well I've done studies do you remember the NHL hockey strike a number of years ago yeah that was 94 wasn't it it was whatever year it was uh I that was baseball but anyway okay yeah anyway well whatever year it was the younger players they would go to

[00:49:45] Russia and whatnot and still uh make a salary but the older veterans hung around and I I saw quite a few of them you know my shoulder colleague SE them for shoulders I end up seeing them for low backs but it was a fabulous natural experiment Peter because they brought their MRIs every year so say they were 11year veteran I would look at the mrrs from the first year the second year and then I would watch the Cascade and then

[00:50:11] I would say what happened in the eighth year oh that was the year I started with a trainer and the trainer believed in doing asag grass squats with a heavy weight aha look what happened to the to the spine when was the last time you saw a hockey player doing asass squat in NHL in any case that was a wonderful experiment to do exactly to give us Insight in into what you're describing and then the the second layer of evidence that I would add there is I'm probably only of a handful of people in the world we had a radiology Suite in our uh kadaver lab where we uh would take kabers and apply very specific loading scenarios to it and we would watch the Cascade of damage over time so both of those I'll put together and give an answer to what I expect I would have seen so we would have seen a lovely young spine in 14-year-old Peter I think you said you started yep and then over time we would have seen delamination from the inside out so you are ACC accumulating the delamination but on the outside it was still Christine Peter never knew and the delamination would continue to progress layer upon concentric layer until that day when you were 21 or whatever and the last uh layer was breached and the nuclear gel extruded just a little bit now when you were fertilized as a an embryo or a Blas assist I guess still at that case around the end of the first month that little flat plate rolled it's called neurulation as you know to create your primitive spinal cord on that day your mother has not given you an immune system yet so now it's fused up that nuclear gel has never seen the immune system yet the plates are pristine it's never seen your blood which is where the immune system is active so now you're 21 for the first time that nuclear gel comes out and sees the blood immune environment it kicks off a hell of an inflammatory response and you couldn't even move it locked you up and that's how strong and powerful that was takes two weeks to subside now here's the rub uh I don't know if you've been following some of the recent literature on anti-inflam I was going to just I was going to ask you would I have been better off if I had taken a prazone taper or had some local anti-inflammatory therapy of course none of these I were at my disposal as a poor dumb college kid of course not but I can't tell you how much joy I'm having speaking with you because your logic is fantastic and the answer is it could have gone either way so the anti-inflammatory might have cleaned up the immune response and giving you faster resolution or what the recent literature is showing there's a purpose for that inflammatory response it brings in the immune system and all the macr phases

[00:53:49] Etc and it starts eating up the extruded material now that process can go one of two ways as well it can wall off what's extruded and I think you've experienced that into a free floating body or it it it choose it up digests it for lack of a better word and if I wish I knew you then because I bet I could have got you into just lay on your tummy and breathe and that Vacuums in in fact we did experiments we would create partial disc herniations and then if you traction the spine and give a little bit of motion all like do is wiggle your legs you can vacuum in the disc bulge in a matter of two or three minutes some people will say you know you're you're dreaming no we we' measured it in some types of subcategories that's actually possible so the answer to the uh inflam is at least some of the more recent data is showing dispense with the anti-inflammatories let the inflammatory response give the patient hell for two weeks it's the best medicine for them in the long term because it is helping to reduce the uh the long-term disc bulge whether there's any basis to what

[00:55:05] I'm about to say uh I I don't know but I will just say that anecdotally um these days when I have a flare up and again to be clear these are really really minor Stuart they don't interfere with anything I do other than if that were a day when I was going to lift a little heavier I would back off but that's but but even that I given that I don't squat or deadlift or do any heavy stuff like that anymore it's kind of a non-issue but what I find to be the most efficacious is not any sort of anti-inflammatory but a light muscle relaxing like a back lefin so not a benzo or anything kind of sedating but just something that allows the uh paraspinous muscles to sort of relax a little bit um and frankly use that to allow ow me to do some deep breathing and we're going to talk about the three most important exercises that you prescribe at some point today I'm sure so it's it's mostly just a vehicle to break the cycle of tension but not the inflammation cycle and and truthfully more of that is not because

[00:56:14] I'm familiar with the literature that you've just spoken of but frankly because you know there are downsides of taking prazone as well and we have to be mindful of those and I I don't want to suggest people shouldn't take prazone but one needs to be circumspect about the frequency with which they do it okay here's where I think you are now to answer the first question I will bet this is where you are now you've got a little bit of micro movement in a sheer mode so this joint isn't translating as it should it's lost a little bit of height and those are the things that are causing the low grade aches not kicking off the heavy acute attacks that you used to have as a younger man now test number one um I understand your brother has a farm up around here somewhere and you occasionally visit yep if you want to spend an extra day come on by to Gravenhurst and we'll have some fun but anyway what I would do with you is I would get you to stand just as you are and I will bet you stand differently when you get out of that chair after doing this podcast for a bit versus of you just walking around there would be a and an antalgia and if I palpated your ular spine a they would be active Y and

[00:57:33] I would left the coach you to open up your hips a little bit ears over your shoulders shoulders over your hips and now all of a sudden we've achieved that muscular relaxation that you're after so be next time before you think you need to take the relaxing humor me lay on your tummy and I again I don't know your spine well enough but I would lay on your tummy maybe put your hands Palms up under your hips maybe make a fist again I don't know where you are but we would find a nice little relaxation place and then I want you to melt into the table every time you exhale keep doing that and tell me a if that doesn't uh remove the ache and we will play with your hands to realign that little shearing micro movement and then stand up we might open up your hips a little bit with a SE specific uh strength uh stretch and see if we can then you will monitor your back muscles and and see if you've you've shut them down but then if

[00:58:43] I said you know poke your head forward muscles on P your back muscles off soften your knees a little bit some people they will stand with a strategy of ramming their knees back into heart extension feel your erector sping maybe it's just simply Jazz knees and soften your knees in other words those little postural cues I have a sneaky suspicion and and I've seen you enough moving on

[00:59:12] YouTube and whatnot that I bet we could hack our way around that so there's our challenge let's see if we can do that without the med well you got you got yourself a deal I um I will happily add an extra day to my next uh Toronto trip when I'm up at my brother's farm uh and I'm sure and I'm sure my brother will want to join as well um so so we'll we'll take you up on that um let's let's let's talk about those three exercises

[00:59:40] Stuart there are three exercises um there's two of them that I've done consistently for quite some time I really uh fancy them a bit um the the the third one the bird dog I I only do occasionally um but let's go through the three of them and um is it safe to say that that you and and just for the listener we're going to link to videos of these right so you know you're going to do your best to explain them and provide the rationale for them but ultimately a demonstration will be forthcoming through videos we'll link to in the show notes um but but this is kind of like your I don't know your core nutrition right this is sort of the everybody should be doing this you don't wait till you have back pain to do this is that safe to say no it isn't no that that this is a bit of a myth and something that I've been fighting basically my whole career oh Mill is the big Migel big three okay uh there are some people that are far too stiff and this is not the mechanism of their back pain and we don't need to go there um have you ever seen the type of bodybuild where they have a huge pneumatic cushion in front called a belly and it slaps on their thighs it's that pelus of this do you ever see spine instability in in in that type of architecture I don't interesting so probably those people have difficulty getting on and off the floor the big three is not for them so there might be again the assessment always leads us to the solution and so uh no The Big Three uh well let let let me I need to have a discussion of what stability is in terms of creating resilience and performance then why are those particular exercises important and then how to do them if if

[01:01:45] I could follow that logic line Peter absolutely yeah let's let's do it and then the other thing steuart if you want to throw it in there do you want to talk about some of the Hallmarks of your assessment wherever it fits into that into that uh into those three things so so take it away yeah all right so remind me we're going to talk about non-specific lowback pain and how I think it's a myth and it doesn't exist that will take us into the assessment okay so let's go back to a basic discussion of stability so if I was uh I might use an example of a back hole so a back ho is a machine with a tractor and it has an arm on the back to dig Earth the first thing the operator does is put down the stabilizer bars to lock the tractor into the ground because if you don't do that you can't pull Earth you just pull a machine around so what's the human equivalent of that we live in a linkage just like Machinery in other words let's take the bench press muscle

[01:02:51] PEC major PEC major originates on my rib cage spans ends my ball and socket joint of the shoulder and inserts on the humoris so when I contract and shorten the tech major it flexes my arm so if I'm wanting to do a push or a punch there it is that's on the distal side of the joint proximately that same muscle shortening collapses my rib cage towards my shoulder joint so all I used was the muscle that spans the joint that isn't a very effective push all I'm doing is collapsing my own linkage or as an engineer we would say well we've just created an energy leak so I'm now going to build proximal stiffness so I'm going to lock my core create stiffness through my torso which is proximal to the Joint so now when I contract the muscle 100% of the motion is directed distally now

[01:03:53] I've got my push so what is the best most efficient way to create a proximal stiffness we searched for years doing all kinds of tests of uh uh every abdominal exercise you could think of back exercises twisting Poff presses throwing things Etc the three exercises that kept bubbling up to the top in the criteria of sparing the spine while you're doing them because these people are hurting you you don't have car blunch to load up their spine uh a guaranteed stability or proximal stiffness and it was later in my career that we found um there is a residual stiffness that occurs so if you do the big three and you are an NFL football team if you do the brg three prior to practice you will run and cut just a little bit faster so you're on the field you run and you cut the stiffer the core when the hips explode into external rotation you're now creating a a faster directional change so uh what were the muscles or what were the exercises um a a modified curl up which remember and now I'm just going to start a little an assessment I'm going to take a patient I'm going to have them sit on the stool and I say do you have symptoms right now and let humor me and let's say they don't now I'm going to say drop your chest down is that CA your oh yeah my left toe is going numb and I've got back pain good bring your chin down and they might say that'll increase your pain or decrease it but the point is that Foster created their pain if that is true when they lay on their back and they imprinted their back into the floor doing a Pilates rollup for example uh that would be their specific pain trigger so it's not much of a therapeutic exercise but we would say put your hands under your low back as you're laying on the ground lift your elbows now hover up your head neck and shoulders and we're going to propel the abdominal contraction breathe through per flips and allow the diaphragm to become the athlete inside this Barrel so that was the foundation of the modified curup now if the person has a rotator cuff issue or we will hack it and make it uh tolerable um then I would see people well let's let's take a a dumbbell or a kettle bell and we're going to raise it up laterally in the frontal plane like this for the side of the core that would trigger pain in a lot of people but uh

[01:06:53] I'll demonstrate all this if you want uh but we could then do a side plank on the floor the beauty of the side plank is only half the musculature is heavily challenged the downside is heavily challenged the upside is not you've only got half the load on the spine very spine sparing we prescribe it on 10c intervals why we use the Russian training science to show you build endurance through repeated tens second exposures not getting tired to the point where you break form nor do you no nor do you develop a neural fatigue and you get a much higher tolerable training level with this what we call the Russian descending pyramid and then for the back muscles look at the beauty of the bird dog where you extend one leg on the one my low back is active one half of my upper back is active on the other side we developing a nice dnf pattern we're creating stiffness and stability in the core we're teaching the brain to disassociate ball and socket joint motion of the shoulders and hips uh with only half the spine load of say a Roman

[01:08:11] Chair extension or something like that so that bubbled up to be uh uh a fabulous uh exercise then we did experiments where we would train people we would just have a single session exposure we would measure the core stiffness prior to doing the big three they do the big three on the Russian descending pyramid and then we would remeasure their torso stiffness Peter they they were they were stiffer and some of my muscle uh physiology colleagues said well you've added a turdness to the muscle I don't think so I think the brain created a lasting mural stiffness and in some people it lasts about 20 minutes some people it lasts longer so you will see some patients who say you know when I do the big three I don't have pain for the next hour fabulous what you're going to do is mid morning do a 12 minute big three session midaf afternoon do a 12 so these are the little tricks and hacks to slowly wind a person down out of pain that was the pain side of the big three then we started to look at the performance side uh if you train a group of athletes versus graduate students the typical

[01:09:38] University experiment uh not much difference was was found in the uh athletes but in The Graduate students we would see an increase in stiffness over a six- week training trial now really interesting things started to happen if you do isometric holds in the manner I've described you punch harder we took a group of uh mui uh athletes and when they did the big three we measured the punching uh impulse uh it was greater after they they trained for uh for six weeks when we did Dynamic core exercise sizes it increased the closing velocity so the closing velocity is when you first get the the first muscle pulse boom and then you relax closing velocity and then you strike with a second pulse boom boom the closing velocity was faster with Dynamic core exercises but the stength force boom in the end was greater with the asymmetric big three and again talk about performance I

[01:10:53] I know you a bit of a pugilist uh I I certainly study the the the combat uh techniques you know if we were to take um three Styles let's take Joe Frasier and you know you would see him just always on forward progression but the punches came from his body weight behind them he would create a beautiful thrust line straight but his body rotate and he lent his weight into them and that was the that was his footwork wasn't the greatest for getting hit because that means you get hit a lot now Mike Tyson different body type uh very compact type of a body but contrast his footwork oh it was just beautiful he would drop step drop step drop step hook the liver come back very quickly b boom and cross him and there was the The Knockout again all coming from the hips drop step boom you see it's all hips you know this and then Al break breaks all the rules little my little Al Shuffle and then he turn rotate hang on to it and then at the end look it up beautiful thrust line all through the S and

[01:12:18] Flor I can go through athlete after athlete you know I saw the other day I I've never with Mick Jagger but there is Mick Jagger you know doing the bird dog in his training usin Bol the fastest man on the planet does the bird dog creating extensor pulsing power into a a stone or just to finish that off us bolt does bird dogs so you know again this is bird dogs are beneath people really they should see what I see anyway I I just want that was the end of that story yeah no I I was just going to add to it by saying I I think that what what I've become interested in as I've aged is looking at the greatest performers because I think that you know we there's no doubt that the best athletes have a remarkable natural talent that the rest of us don't have

[01:13:17] I've measured it without question where I think people miss the talent what they're missing is a big part of the talent is the natural stability in other words it's the Force transmission without the energy leakage and when I contrast really good athletes with myself and I examine my athletic past what is clear to me is that in everything I have ever done despite all of my hard efforts my lack of both natural ability and at the time coaching has meant that I have always suffered from an unbelievable amount of energy leakage whatever I have done whether it's been you know you know boxing swimming powerlifting all of those things um what's you know again there's such a Chasm between me and the really good ones and it's not due to hard work

[01:14:17] I I can promise you it is not due to effort it is it is due to probably some combination of natural ability and coaching that has allowed the really good ones to do what you've demonstrated right which is you know a great punch begins in the back foot and it's transmitted through the hip and it goes into the the opposite fist I mean that's just how you know it's it's just hard for people to understand how that through line of force can't lose anything along the way um and again you talk about running yeah I was just goingon to say Peter the stories I could tell you about the number of athletes being detuned by their trainers and coaches violating this principle that you're describing it it's astounding to me you mean you why are you getting them to do that you just detuned their athleticism but anyway I interrupted you and I I well I think where I want to go with this is you know most people listening to this are not going to ment the fact that they didn't run as fast as they could have when they were younger or that they didn't punch or swim with as much you know prowess as they could have where I think we should all care about this is that it's not just that the energy leakage costs you performance it clearly does it's that it predisposes you to injury and that's where I think we have to bring this back right is what you know when I exercise today I don't care about the performance I care about the preservation and longevity of my body for whatever number of years I have left so this is really where I think stability matters it's you know what are the exercises I need to be doing what are the exercises my patients need to be doing so that as we age and we walk up the flight of stairs or carry something heavy we don't hurt ourselves because we don't have that core stability that can resist the deoration that's going to allow energy to seep out of the system well said a story was coming to mind as you were saying that I'll be giving a lecture or teaching a class and I'm and

[01:16:47] I and I'll show some data from an elite athlete and there will be therapists and clinicians in the room who say we don't deal with Elite athletes we deal with the elderly or we deal with sick people and I think what are you thinking I'm showing you what the human body has the potential to do and your arrogance won't allow you to learn what is possible and I'm going to give you a a very emotional I hope I can get through this a very emotional story to to to show the the arrogance that exists among some of our colleagues occasionally medical groups a hospital or whatever will ask would you come out and assess three patients in our Auditorium in front of all our medical staff I was at this facility it was in Europe and they brought out a the first person was a rugby play fair enough and I had 20 minutes and declared what I thought was going on the next one was a woman in her early' 70s clearly distraught you could look at her posture her carriage she was defeated by the world and uh she came onto the stage and

[01:18:07] I said can you tell me your story and she she said a little few sentences and then she said but the therapist says that I have to leave my home now when I get off the toilet I'm a bit unsteady she's afraid I'm going to fall on the floor I can't get off the floor by myself and I'm just going to lay there and no one will discover me I have to leave my home she started to cry at this point Peter she said what's going to happen to my cat and all this sort of stuff and I said really would would someone please bring me out a stool and this will be our simulated toilet so an assistant brought in a stool onto the stage um I said okay pretend that's the toilet and the seat she turned and and and had no idea how to move and just sort of plopped and collapsed on the toilet and then I'm just going to turn this down because I want you to see my lower body kinematics as we're moving here and then uh I said would you get up uh off the chair and I can't remember whether she was wearing a skirt or pants pants I think it was but nonetheless knees together and she just sort of collapsed and I had to help her she was going to collapse onto the floor and so

[01:19:25] I said I I I want you to humor me now you're my mirror and I try when I coach I try and use minimum words I said do this with your hands put your kneecap between your thumb and your hands as you slide your hands down good now I want you to be a leaning tower Leaning Tower forward and backwards and play with the curve of your back do you have any pain now she said no and I said watch my shoulders you're Shrugged I want you to anti- shrug she did that perfect and now I said pull your hands up your thighs by pulling your hips through don't lift with your back pull your hips through he she had it done in three repetitions that was now her pattern and I said okay think of what we've just done and sit on the toilet and I said whoops spread your feet apart and there she went slid her hands down and now I said then she put her knees together and I said now stand up she was going right back to the incompetent movement that caused her inability and disability before I said spread your knees apart and pull your heels underneath you sniff some air now lean forward and do what you now know how to do and she did a perfect squat do it again again and then by the third repetition big smile came on her face was the emotional part I said what's up with you she said I don't have to leave my home do I said no do you know many of those hard-baked surgeons and clinicians started to cry as well for the first time they realized all I did was teach her weightlifting 101 and remember how this story started with the arrogance of some of our colleagues who say I don't want to hear stories about Elite athletes I deal with old people or sick people and that's why they continue to not have the skill set to help their people all I did was learn from the best windlifter in the world people who know how to move load learn what the efficiency was and turn it into a hack to change a person's life anyway that that's that's a pretty emotional story and I I I hope we do that quite often but it's a matter of you know I I know you like cars why does Honda race

[01:22:07] F1 race cars well they don't anymore but when they did and the reason was they learned about automotive technology and the gear shift change in your Honda Civic came from the F1 racetrack so that's why we work with Elite athletes so I can bring it down that's that's I I love working with them of course but this is the they just give it away free to us and yet some of our colleagues are are just so closed off they don't want to hear about Elite

[01:22:40] Performance let let's talk a little bit about first of all that's a that's an absolutely beautiful story Stuart and and thank you for sharing that um uh you know it's a sadly common story too and and to me I think the saddest part of that story is how many of those patients don't get the chance to sit on a stage with you for 30 minutes and learn that movement um and um I I I I don't you know you've been around long enough that

[01:23:07] I'm sure you have a better sense of this but I feel maybe optimistically that we are in a place now where people are starting to appreciate the importance of strength and stability and that we're less afraid of this you know there's more discussion of the importance of resistance training and that it's not a it's not a young guy thing to do it's an everybody thing to do but given the Arc of your career am am I being just sort of delusional or do you really think that that we're we're in a in a in a in a in a Coming of Age here the way you phrase questions are fabulous what was going through my mind what I mean I try and answer every question what's the evidence and what's the application so the the evidence uh at the University with all our first year students one of their first courses they took was on just basic Fitness evaluation range of motion strength hand grip um V2 Max some of these markers and they would measure each other and we kept the scores year after year of the incoming class the students got terribly soft and

[01:24:23] I can prove it based on that dat and we would graph it now whatever year was the year where the students had grown up with the personal computer it was right at the very late 90s I think all of a sudden we saw the incoming class Fitness plummet but then something happened they were a soft Bunch for about five years and then slowly to your point they started to come back and so I think your perception is is right on there the the it did go to a terrible State however many years ago uh that was 15 or 20 years ago uh but it but it is coming back uh now and among our colleagues and and uh but having said that I I think some of them are terribly misguided as well you know they think oh you're not a a real woman because I heard this on uh social media until you can deadlift twice your body weight well wait a second if if if they could come here and see the number of people who've been caused by overzealous trainers and going bonkers on on deadlift magnitude uh you know yeah where where let's talk a little bit about that because I have to tell you steuart I'm a bit conflicted personally and and I'll explain why um I obviously have no desire to do anything that I deem stupid anymore right so that my days of gritting through painful anything are long over um I know the difference between discomfort that is worth pushing through and pain that is not but when I when I think about in particular squats and deadlifts I I'll tell you where especially around the deadlift which I is an exercise I really really enjoy where I feel conflicted on the one hand I feel like now that I'm so tuned in to how to do this movement correctly it's a really wonderful a it for my stability system right again I I I'm embarrassed to tell you how much I didn't know when I was deadlifting at no point did I understand the importance of tension in the arms intraabdominal pressure you know the the variability in foot pressure on the ground like none of that stuff right it was just pure be Brute Force stupidity today as I know those things it allows me to modulate force and to on a good day kind of push the envelope a little bit in what I perceive is safe so on the one hand I think yeah I should be deadlifting my whole life not I don't need to deadlift 400 lbs anymore but I should be deadlifting because it's this great audit and on the days that I don't feel it I back off and then on the other days I say

[01:27:13] Peter you don't need to do this anymore because honestly you can still get the same or nearly the same activation for all of the muscles involved using other movements single leg movements in particular where you don't have a fraction of the axial loading loading and yeah you might need to do two exercises instead of one but at the end of the day there's a there's a lower risk approach to get it and in other words deadlifting is is valuable but you have a narrow operating window in which you can potentially hurt yourself so I continue to go back and forth on this steuart and as as such here I am telling you I still will go periods of my life where I'll deadlift every week and then

[01:28:00] I'll take 3 months off feeling like I don't want to push it h how would you advise a middle-aged person or even a non- middle-aged person um who's sort of thinking through this particular issue again I have so many thoughts going through my mind it's interesting when we have a back pained 50-year-old coming here and I'll say whatat are your goals oh I want to set a personal best and deadlift and I said really okay um let me tell you some stories let let's let's talk about Ed con do you know Ed con great power Li of all time I was with Ed a couple of weeks ago I'll tell you a funny story about him if you like in a minute but anyway Ed when he would set a personal best he'd take a couple of months after off afterwards to to set a personal best is so demanding of your body there are actually if you said a true personal best most people experience micr fracturing just underneath the end plate of the tacular bone um if you look at the great strength athletes they train deadlift uh and again if you go to our website look at the testimonials at the bottom the number of worldclass deadlifters who are on there so you know i' I've worked with with quite a few of these people through their injuries now those micr fractures could be a good thing or a bad thing the professional powerlifter will take a week off they train heavy deadlifts or squats once a week uh because it takes a week for the bone callus to not only attach through the chemical Electro attraction but to really scaffold on take takes a week if you deadlift it in another three or four days the way some trainers they might deadlift a client three times a week that allows those micro fractures to accumulate until finally you've got a full-blown endplate fracture what not so these are the people that that that come here and then

[01:30:10] I say how about this for a goal do you have kids yeah do you have grandkids yeah how about this and I've since learned about your Centurion uh decathlon which I love by the way way um I'll say would you rather as your goal have the ability to play with your grandchildren on the floor when you're 80 and get off the floor and pick them up and they pause for a minute and they'll say yeah I like that goal I so well you can't have both if you think you're going to continue having deadlift uh personal bests you will not you will have artificial hips all of these other things because how how many old powerlifters do you know do you really want to be like that group of athletes so I can talk them into changing their long-term goals now is the time to get on the program and make sure you get there if that's the case we eliminate deadlifts um we had an athlete here yesterday and uh they're they're at the uh end of their career and I took them out and we went for a 10-minute walk to a hill that we have and I'll say here's why you're not going to do deadlifts but here's what I want you to do I showed them a monster walk okay monster walk now we're going to the bottom of the hill and I want you to lean back into the hill and we're walking backwards you're going to align your foot ankle knee and hip and push through the knee through the knee through the knee backwards up the hill do you know after 30 meters they were absolutely done here they are doing all this deadlifting and they don't even have the leg strength endurance to walk backwards 30 me meters totally inappropriate stimulation of their athleticism to make it through to 80 so good poor you let's do it again we walked down the hill we did three sets they could hardly walk and then we played the neurological trip which I like to do a lot of now I said walk forwards up the hill but pretend you have $100 in your butt cheeks don't let anyone take it now walk forwards up the hills and they say I've never felt this before the brain perceives exhausted quads it now has to go and get the glutes it's the only thing left so quite often we'll we'll do a uh an exhaustion uh Focus to stimulate the thing that we really want to uh stimulate and I convinced that person after that what they're going to do and train now to get a well-rounded and sustainable athleticism that will spare their joints still have great training capacity um but I think their athleticism is going to go through the roof and you know I've taken some very accomplished powerlifters and we've taken out all the squats and just do squat uh sled work backwards walking uphills some of these oldtime techniques and their joints settle down they get a sustainable Fitness they lose this idea of Maximum effort uh squats and debts and now they're thinking of the word sufficient strength sufficient Mobility sufficient endurance and uh we've been doing this long enough now that we've tracked them and those are the ones that are getting through uh you know again you you let's go get any one of our colleagues who are orthopedic surgeons tell us who you're replacing the hips of well uh 50-year-old Caucasian women who have done yoga for 30 years okay uh and uh men around 50 who've uh done deadlifts all their life who are you not the middle of the road moderates not the ones who've rusted out and not the ones who worn out but the ones in the middle are the ones who are so this idea of sufficient Fitness um because I still believe we are all called upon to do things in life at certain times I hope we're already enabled and uh it's more fun too just to be able to continue to do those things so I'm like you I don't do deadlifts but uh I pick up 100 PB bucked up logs as an example Big Oak log so so that's my stone lift load that into the log splitter and uh still split my wood I uh people comment on my hands this awe who came yesterday I I shook his hand when he came to the door and uh he couldn't fit his hand around mine and he said whoa When We Were Young we we we didn't have dumbbells my dad would give us a cinder block cinder blocks yeah that's how you develop a anyway as you know the importance of of grip strength I will take any day over how much you deadlift yeah uh people often ask me steuart why do you think grip strength is such a great proxy for longevity and um I I say it's the same reason I think V2 Max is a great proxy for longevity those are probably the two best biomarkers we have it sounds crazy by the way that your V2 Max and your grip strength are better predictors of how long you're going to live than whether or not you smoke drink uh what your family history is for cancer like those things all matter but it's amazing how dwarfed they are by those two and my best explanation for it is that those are the best two integrators for the work you've done right so you know you can't cram for a VO2 max the week before like if you have a high VO2 max you have done the work to get it if you have a strong grip you didn't just buy little grip squeezers on Amazon and and filter away at them while you were you know on on calls on Zoom like you had to do the work you had to be carrying heavy things you know whatever it be chopping wood carrying cinder blocks doing farmer carries and um and of course that also speaks to stability right that speaks to the stability that you have to be able uh to to transmit force from the Torso right to the hand so um so agree completely let's pivot for a moment to talk a little bit about um the the amount of psychological trauma that exists in the patient with lower back pain and I'm I'm thinking very specifically even about some of my own patients or friends who have been in the throws of lower back pain and um if if nothing else steuart I take a great degree of comfort from the injury the third injury that I had the one in 2000 because it lasted so long and because it was so debilitating and because I'm here today without pain my confidence around small recurrences is so high that I don't tend to aize about it and work myself up but

[01:38:04] I have great empathy for a person who doesn't have that knowledge and instead I don't know how to help someone sometimes because I can't tell what is mind and what is body at this point and I suspect that there's a significant interplay so can can you speak more about this phenomenon and what those of us who want to help these patients can do

[01:38:29] I am certainly much more conscious of the point you're making now than I was 30 years ago absolutely I'm going to start with a little story but I this happens very often you mentioned earlier how MRIs don't show you the mechanism some of pain and I can give all kinds of reasons why but let's let's take this patient he came to see me and uh he said uh hi doc

[01:39:04] I hear you're different um I've got this pain the i' I've Been Everywhere I went to the pain clinic they gave me narcotics and now they say the pain is in my head I can live with the physical pain I cannot live with with someone telling me the pain is in my head because that means I'm crazy and if I'm crazy I don't deserve to live you've got two weeks and in two weeks I'm blowing my brains out now there's a heavy psychos social

[01:39:40] Challenge and a little bit of a story what the system does to people and and it's not unusual for someone to come here suicidal so I said all right uh you don't appear to have pain right now and he says no I don't and I said okay what causes your pain and he said well it's when I do a certain movement that I get a flash of pain and it feels like someone has broken a beer bottle and have ripped open my hamstring muscles it's awful and I said oh c can you show me the pain and he said what you you you want me to show you how I create the pain and I said it's the only chance I have to understand it I said you've been to 15 different clinicians has no one ever asked you to show them the mechanism of your pain has anyone ever touched you he says no I said well it's the only way I know Peter I put on my instrumentation which was muscle EMG over the Torso the glutes Etc we put on the spine motion monitor 3d motion spine

[01:40:50] Monitor and then I said all right let's let let's let's see what causes this so he stood there and he did a very weird thing and he said all right well here you go and he wound himself around in a circle like this and when he got to 10 top de center now at that time I heard like a little cavitation little pop come out of his back and that was the Trap of the sciatic nerve and he was in a bad ways you know I I laid him falling on a table tried to give him a bit of decompression and he went home and I said I know exactly what the mechanism of your pain is here's what you should do over the next 3 days but I want you to come back but promise me you aren't going to do anything silly remember what the threat was hanging overs he said I promise I called him that night I called him the next day just to make sure then he came back and

[01:41:45] I said I know exactly what your mechanism is as and and here's what the data showed as he was winding himself around he was using muscle muscle is stiffening and stabilizing it's centrating of the joints and as he got to top dead center he shut all his muscles off he completely relaxed and then there was a little sheer translation or a clunk and that's what we heard and that's what trapped the sciatic root I said okay you have no pain push my fingers out harder good hold that now talk to me and keep talking to me with that controlling and we coached him through this and in a minute very simple I said keep the tone now and we're going through and as he came to top dead center you could see him I said we're there do it again hold on keep control he didn't clunk now it took him about four months to wind down the ache but he never had another clunker a trap 10 years later he brought his daughter to me and uh I saw her for back pain and he brought me a case of beer and uh and uh he said I said you know I did my one-year followup with you but but how have you been he says fabulous I said did you ever get another episode never had one now some people will think that that's a a fantastic impossible story

[01:43:23] Pete after that one coaching class we gave him he was so coachable and he got it he understood he was a mechanical mind you know he never had another acute episode ever and uh so think of a a suicide case from the medical system not having a sufficient evaluation procedure to really get at what the mechanism of his pain was to a point where they defaulted and said we've tried everything with you it's not working therefore the pain is in your head now think of the psychological uh anyway to to to coach him and the key was to prove to him immediately that he had the ability it's just he had to be shown how so it was a process of understanding the mechanism giving him a strategy to address the mechanism and the just changes it empowered him may I give you one more story absolutely okay I was giving a lecture in England and there was a fella off to the side and he was slumped down now if you get a a clinical psychology textbook the picture of depression is this knees together slowed down in that demeanor now if you have a posterior disc bulge that is not a good position to be so there were starting with clinical depression feeding a disc buul so don't go together and he just sat there and then in the break he came over to me very quiet uh spoken fella and he said I

[01:45:06] I I hear what you're saying do you have 30 seconds for me to tell you my story and I said sure he said I used to be a police officer I uh hurt my back I went through the NHS system uh the they only gave me EX exercises that hurt me more finally they gave me a pamphlet how to live with your back pain and he said that book destroyed me what you mean I have to live the rest of my life with my back pain and no one's ever touched me or shown me any of this and I said oh and then you'll remember that squat procedure that we went with the with the older woman that I descried early I simply showed him that and he went back and he sat down on the chair nice and tall and then at the end of the lecture I went over to him and I saidh how's your pain and he stood up and he said it's gone and he started to cry because he realized now what the system had done to him in the meantime he lost his job and he realized that he'd been stolen from and those are his words he said they stole my career from me giving me that book how to live with my back pain why didn't anyone show me what my pain was like you just just did in 30 seconds and it was just I've been watching this pattern for so many years you could see it a mile away anyway those are two stories to link the mechanics and ultimately what we're trying to do is to empower people in showing them they have the ability within themselves they just need to understand the mechanism and most of the time they are able to mitigate the cause and then build a robust foundation so I wrote back mechanic and people would come I I started the experimental research clinic at the

[01:47:06] University of waterl we were the only Clinic maybe you've heard of this but I've never heard of another clinic where they follow up with every single patient that they ever saw we did a two-year followup with every single patient who came in and we subcategorized them because we assessed everyone into the mechanism of their uh pain pathway we gave them an appropriate exercise prescription we followed up to see did they even comply because some people didn't uh and then how are you doing after two years if you were in the subcategory that everything has failed you've been told you need surgery so you're at the end of the road now you're a surgery case in the 2-year followup following the plan that I just described for you with this thing called virtual surgery which is part of it 95% reported that they avoided surgery and they were glad that they did so that's my efficacy to the empowerment and psychology issue I don't know if that answers your question sometimes S I get a little bit

[01:48:24] I I try and create a logic flow I hope that worked yeah I'll I'll tell you what stands out to me the most in those stories Stuart is your kind of um consistent adamant drive towards understanding the mechanism of the pain so it's a um you know how do we break this down into a physics and biology problem and um it I I guess my question is where where which type of Health Care

[01:49:00] Providers are most in line with that right so your training is in is it is your PhD through through the school of Kinesiology yes and um so so well I I I should back that up yeah there's a lot of mechanical engineering in there and but but nonetheless yeah basically but when we think of all the different practitioners that interact with patients who have lower back pain ranging from neurosurgeons orthopedic surgeons chiropractors physical therapists kinesiologists I mean there are so many people and I never want to suggest that the profession determines the the school of thought like I really think that indivi there are great people and there are lousy people within all of those categories but AG what are the characteristics um uh you know that you see driving that type of search for a true mechanistic understanding of the pain because I'll be honest with you like in all of my back bouts of you know misery nobody ever explained to me what was going on I mean nobody said to me this is happening even as a medical student yes I could look at the MRI I could see the fragment it clearly had to come out presumably uh given that I was in such excruciating pain and the thing wasn't you know it might have taken months for the thing to have been resorbed um but but there wasn't a sort of we need to understand the why this is happening so that we're going to fix the underlying

[01:50:35] Behavior that's causing it that's the thing that strikes me as the most interesting um of those stories and is that I guess what my long winded apologies question is is that a function of the individual or of the school of training both so the elephant in the room here is there is no billing code that exists or an assessment of back injury mechanism doesn't exist you can't build an insurance company and say well I assess the person's back pain when I started the experimental research Clinic I set aside two hours to see a back pain to person and I'm that guy that's all I ever saw two hours my medical colleagues who'd been through medical school training which I had not I'd only have have ever been a guest professor at a medical school but I sure didn't graduate from one and um my medical colleague said two hours what are you going to do for two hours well I've been spending 30 years figuring out how I'm going to test sheer tolerance to compression pulling a nerve Route One

[01:51:44] Way pulling it the other way is it flossing is it friction is it stuck um Etc um I'm probably again I said a handful of people in the world that would take Kadabra spines and create the injuries so I knew how to measure them and and and what to look for in terms of uh the full pattern but that that's the first political impediment to all of this there's no billing code therefore you're left with clinicians who are billing for a procedure that they've been trained to perform well if you have non-specific back pain it's an absolute crapshoot whether a manipulation for Mobility uh an exercise prescription for stability um just a movement tool not to create a stress Riser or a stress concentration on the tissue that is sensitized simple as that so where I've arrived at with all of this um we have to train our own clinicians and that's what I've been doing through uh backfit Pro and I do not care if you come from a chiropractic Physical

[01:53:07] Therapy coaching training physiatry neurology uh Radiology even uh background all I care is that you have passion and we then uh it's it's a 50-hour online course of me going through Anatomy physiology neurology psychology uh biomechanics uh Etc and then the probably 100 subcategories of of pain mechanisms and then how do you test for all of these and then uh how do you coach them and then after all of that we have three days together where we do hand hands on skills training at a at a table so again there's no subcategory in the medical rubric that trains how to assess uh back pain from the perspective of biomechanic psychology neurology physiology Etc they don't exist so that was my Challenge and and what what's the what's the name of that course it's called The Summit course and you can read it uh read about on backfitpro

[01:54:46] docomo a member of the lay public because some of them are very Savvy uh from taking however the gatekeeper of all of this is there's a fairly extensive exam at the end it is a written exam there's a practical exam where the person must assess a real patient usually online with one of our examiners uh they have to come up with a written explanation of the pain pathway and then a program of what they're going to do with the person and then they have to coach elements of it so they have to see the coach skill as well so that that's sort of the gatekeeper at the end that I think would only be for clinicians but uh that's the only way that I found uh possible and I'm having said that you know I I I I'm like you I'm I'm very agnostic in in terms of preparation there are fabulous chiropractors and there the absolute opposite this fabulous therapist fabulous and there were fabulous profess and terrible professors it's just the way it is but anyway I don't know if does that answer yeah no that's a that's a very interesting course it's almost something

[01:56:01] I wonder uh I'd love to figure out a way to make the time so it's 50 hours online plus three days in person is what it sounds like correct yeah um let's talk about the cases where you think surgery is really the best course of action and again I think it should always be stated that you know surgery with without understanding how you got there and then making sure you correct it postsurgically is not what we're talking about so it should always be assumed that you want to understand what got you there but what are the indications in your mind for where a patient is better off G getting a surgical procedure and we could talk about the different you know whether you you know what do what do you think are the best indications for disectomy Fusion Etc um versus when you think where would you take a contrarian approach where many people would say yes surgery and you would say let's push a little bit harder before wow a lot of elements there so

[01:57:02] I'll just uh start at the beginning and hope I can create a a logic story I did mention the followup that we did where 95% of people who were told they needed surgery in fact avoided it and what we did there was I am anointed them and said there is your virtual surgery this worked really well on people who I'll paint the picture of let's take a stay-at-home mom with two young kids uh every day has to go to the gym and ride the elliptical for 20 minutes do something else as a stress reliever otherwise she's going to murder her husband you've heard that story before and uh I'll say good go get your surgery are you going to do that tomorrow no you are going to lay in bed you're going to behave like a postsurgical person you're going to get out of bed and go for a pee three times that is your total workload tomorrow and slowly you're going to build yourself back in other words surgery may work for you because it's forced rest now I'm going to give you a tool that will mimic the forced rest it's called virtual surgery tomorrow here's the plan here's how you're going to behave we are going to desensitize strategically the pain mechanism as we've measured it and we're going to retune your body with strategic mobility and stability plus movement skill so we don't replicate the stress concentrations that caused your problem in the first place let's see how you are now if they can do that 95% will avoid surgery so there's my first little story for people in that uh category just uh and and steuart just to be clear are what are the patients who you would not offer that virtual surgery too give me an indication where you would say you know what we we this is too pressing obvious red flags which before we see a patient we don't take patients uh off the street never they always come through position referral so I'm hoping they've been checked for red flags do you know how many have not even though we state in the referral directions to the referring medic we've had cases of uh uh aortic aneurism lung embolism cancerous tumors metastasized um all sorts of things that somehow these poor people got through the system and we were the ones that found it and uh saved their lives so I I wish that wasn't the case but all of those obviously are surgery uh cases and they should never have come to us in the first place so obvious red flags is number one number two is when the pattern doesn't fit so I was smiling when you were telling your original story only because it was such a familiar spot-on pattern consistency you fit the pattern I knew exactly what it was when the pattern doesn't fit I'll say no something's not right I need you to go back to your Dock and here's the reason why there is you know a tness under your liver uh we're not able to move that

[02:00:29] Pain by moving stress concentrations around your spine so it's not a nerve it's nothing vertebral or facet the pattern doesn't fit it's something else so there is a person where we refer back and say something uh needs further investigation but now the last part of your question was about the need or when we would say for a person you're not our person you need to see a surgeon surgeons and by the way we see far too many postsurgical patients who they went through maybe the surgery was botched when I see a horrible scar on the outside of the skin I think man if that's the pride that the surgeon took on the outside what Carnage has gone on the inside or sometimes it's a happens Story the nerve scarred in and adhered Ah that's that's rough you know or uh the post-rehab was terrible here's a person who went to a fabulous surgeon and the surgeon says oh go do pt that's your rehab and the PT goes and gives them toe touches or something after they just had a micro disc surgery and guess what they're reated again and now we're seeing them um but when would we say no you're not for us here here the surgeons are at their best in cases of a real heavy stenosis so there's not much room in the in your neural Canal the facet joints are thick in behind so You' got encroachment from behind you've got a a calcified disc bulge coming from the front uh so a uh you know a couple level laminectomy to give the the nerve some space that really is when the surgeons are at their best uh some of the spondo myopathies that we'll see in the neck you know I think of a a lead lawyer in uh in the courtrooms and the judges would ask him sir are you drunk and he said to us well when I I I stand I start my presentation

[02:02:46] I'm fine he says but after two or three minutes I'm losing my balance and falling over and the judges think he's he's drunk and then we found it it was a cervical spondo myopathy that was also uh co-presenting with back pain but no one had figured this out uh so that that was a a surgery case obviously so it's either uh post- trauma and then that one's obvious they they've got they need a little bit of Hardware to stabilize their spine um but it may also be uh spondo thesis the lith thesis or the sheer translation is just choking off the uh call it aquina or another nerve um it's it's best to uh and then now we recommend surgeons who who we have really good luck with and in that situation that if the spond if the spondylothesis is significant enough is the only treatment of fusion I'm going I'm going to say yes yeah there's no amount of stability you can generate in the paraspinous muscles in the ql in the soos to compensate for that I mean I realize that because you have to forgive me because I'm not an orthopedic surgeon but I would assume that there's some threshold right 1 millimeter of spondo leth thesis might be tolerated and at some level they would say no it's too unstable but you know no no I wouldn't agree with that Peter it's not the distance at all you go with the assessment and the again the evidence I offer there is we're coming coming down to the next Olympics now so I don't know how many Olympians and people who are tapering now for the Olympic trials we've had here over the past year but this is every four years we're inundated with these yeah these types of athletes and they come in pairs where we might have two young women who are uh competing for a place on the US Olympic team uh in gymnastics both have the same spondi uh one uh we'll say we need six months off here uh of gymnastics and here's what we're going to do we're going to do a heavy stabilization program the next one says oh no we really got to make the the trials we're just going to keep going with h going to gym and I can almost predict with 100% accuracy who's going to make it so I wouldn't say at all that uh we don't try uh a heavy exercise stability program uh regardless of the amount of uh slippage and I've done that with you know people trying to make uh the uh special forces in the US you got to do a speed setup test you've got to do all of these things oh but you got a heavy Spa okay here is the program to try and get there you might make it um anyway uh so what about what about nerve pain what about Pati Pati s who um are either having weakness such as a foot drop or significant pain like the pain I had where in the very first case where it was yeah okay so yeah take take that away yeah we we have them all the time

[02:06:09] Peter uh if I can get the nerve pain pain to move on the assessment uh please don't have surgery let us have a try at it most of the time they will be uh pleased wow and what you're basically doing is play with certain rules and give give me an example of some of those so let's say your assessment comes out that this person who's having intermittent sciatic pain um and um and you do an assessment and you say look there is no doubt that you have a ruptured uh annulus here you've got a protruding um segment of of disc and it is clearly at times depending on your activity getting nearer to the nerve route it's driving that sciatic pain but it but during your assessment I assume what you're getting at is through some of those positional things such as laying the person on their front manipulating the legs getting the uh the herniation to retreat into the annulus if so you're saying if you can demonstrate resolution under a changing movement pattern that gives you enough confidence that this is this doesn't need to be removed surgically not not resolution can I move the pain a little bit can I make it worse and can I make it better now I'm starting to understand the variables that make it worse make it better and I play with those I see here's here and again I'm

[02:07:34] I I'm I'm trying not to sound boastful I'm trying to be scientific here there was a a day not that long ago I'm losing track of time it was probably uh well it was the NHL playoffs so there's our time marker I just I don't watch TV really but for some dumb reason it was Saturday I flipped on the TV uh it was the NHL playoffs and I listened to the announcer the name oh that's my patient and then I next player my patient two of my patients are now in the

[02:08:08] NHL uh playoff series a little bit later I flip over to TSN uh Tour Tennis uh what um what's what's the big professional tennis tour I look at that my patient and then that night the UFC comes on there's my patient so in one day I see three different Pro Sports every single one of them had sciatica when they came to me and so that's some evidence that I can offer now let's take

[02:08:42] I remember one of those uh players in the NHL um if he fully flexed he would stir up sciatic and increase the risk of a full-blown acute attack as you know you and I know very well so we got him to move well he uh played hockey mindful of a skating style that he didn't get too flexed up we didn't allow him to tie his own skates he said tying my own skates really set my back up I said good now

[02:09:17] NHL players are very particular how they tie their skates but they qu one of the training staff to tius skates for now I know some people will laugh at that but that was all part of the plan to keep the capacity as high as he could to utilize in the game how he sat on the bench was also uh instructed uh the uh fellow in the uh UFC this is no slouch uh Jujitsu really put his spine in a place where it could fire off an acute attack you do not want to be in the cage fighting for your life and having an acute attack that's the last thing you want um we would limit the mat time uh on jiujitsu he would do standup all kinds of things to minimize the accumulative stress on the disc bulge causing sciatica and uh he competed and again I I wish I could tell you who he was and what he did that night so I'm not afraid of nerve irritation sciatica uh Etc and it certainly doesn't fall into the category of you need surgery we've proven that far too many uh times um but as I said heavy instability and when we fail to arrest the shearing movements uh trapping nerves uh it's gone on for for quite a a time we can't hack our way around it it's best to see uh a surgeon stenosis and stenosis as well yeah Ste many different forms Central stenosis it might be a foraminal stenosis and a bit of arthritic activity where they can just basically take a

[02:11:12] Dremel tool to describe it for your audience and bur out around the uh fan or the hle it the lateral nerve comes out um another one is uh you know I know a lot of our medical colleagues say well a tarof cyst a neural cyst well they don't cause pain really I will prove to you very quickly whether or not that's causing pain by pulling the nerve root one way or the other you know I I can typical pattern recognition might be a physio might do a slump test which is you straighten one leg and you flex the spine and net but the net stress in the middle of the cord is zero you're pulling it one way you're pulling it the other way it just goes into a little bit of tension if that's a taroff cyst that won't be triggered a taroff cyst doesn't like being pulled one way so that patient on exam might say well I don't get pain with a uh a uh slump test but I can't stand driving my car oh tell me about your car well I sit upright put my head back and extend my leg to push on the accelerator you're pulling the nerve root One Way where's the pain it's in my big toe ahuh I am now going to inform my inspection of the MRI because the

[02:12:32] Radiologists missed it they're not going to find a tarof Cy distal on the fifth route but I know that the symptom and the assessment took me there logically to say I know there's something hanging up there that's directionally specific it's not a friction it's a direction specific tension there's the T off cyst I found it now boy what's the surgical procedure there typically they'll try and drain the cyst and it comes right back again typically but there's a there's a doc in

[02:13:03] Dallas who uh we send all our carof Cy uh patients too and he he has a reasonable rate at least better than anyone else in in dealing with those P pesky cysts that we've just proven is so there there's another you know bit of an offthe wall I can't do a damn thing about that assist it's it's eroding the bone they're they're pesky little things but here's a surgical referral sorry is that was a bit long-winded too but no no that's that's that's great Stuart how often um I mean if you're doing a two-hour assessment on a patient I assume you're also looking at an MRI let me stop that after the first year of the experimental research Clinic running two years I changed to a three-hour consult wow yeah I needed even more time so now I uh you know there's are I uh if if they're an old athlete and they still have uh films on the film remember how we used to get MRIs I read them on the reader I put them up on the screen there so yeah no full medical images we uh go through what are the things you're looking for in the MRI that that maybe aren't as readily apparent in other words where what are you looking at in an MRI that isn't obvious to the radiologist because presumably you know you yeah you can maybe explain to somebody what the MRIs are showing but you're you're you know you're getting axial Cuts you're getting coronal and sagittal Cuts they're T1 weighted they're T2 weighted so so you know they highlight the disc a nice healthy disc looks white on the MRI of course Min are jet black um what are things your yeah what are what are things your pi picking up on that MRI read well all of the things that you've mentioned um but the

[02:14:58] LA I don't know if you looked at my CV and the number of papers and the topics that we covered over the years but the very last study that I ever published as a professor was exactly that and we took a cohort of whiplash patients I didn't do very much cervical spine specific work most of mine was lumbar but uh just to to just to answer your your question we took Whiplash patients every single one of them had been denied compensation because they're now more than two years post Whiplash they still continue have symptoms the medical profession and the legal system was declaring them pain magnifiers they were exacerbating their pain for financial gain terrible the mrss said there's no reason for your pain really the Mr is a static picture what do you expect so we took video fluroscopy which you know is a real-time moving x-ray so we're watching the bones move now and we would have them move through their pain and their pain wasn't very rarely at the end range of motion it was actually somewhere in the middle of the range and they would move their head like this and then the spine would clunk and then they go and then they continue to move through on the video fluroscopy we watch the rotations occurring between every vertebra but we know what instability is it's when the rotation stops and the shear begins so the ratio of rotation and Shear is the marker of that cervical instability so if I can just show with my hands here would be the neck moving rotating well and then it would clunk it was the clunk that corresponded 100% with the shot of pain now you and I both know that the muscles when a muscle contracts it does two things it creates

[02:16:59] Force but it also creates stiffness the body uses stiffness to control motion okay so if you just want to observe me now and you can play along and do this if you like I want you to lightly up stack your ears over your shoulders and have a pitch to your head that's neutral stare straight ahead now lightly touch yourself under your your jaw just above your Adams Apple don't retract don't you're too stiff feet relax now push your tongue hard to the roof of the mouth behind your front teeth you felt the Deep flexors activate now corners of your mouth Grimace down do this to your neck now keep that imagine the person who's rotating and then has the clunk keep that controlling stiff and repeat the offensive movement would you believe in most people the clunk was arrested it was gone proving that the Mr had no ability to pick up that Dynamic pain trigger we just proved what their pain trigger was you can imagine the psychological relief that they had to know that it isn't in their head the medical profession was wrong and uh finally their empowered now because they have a strategy to start learning just a little bit of a strategy to take the clunk out if you arrest the clunk over time the joint will stiffen the bad news is you don't move so well through that joint the good news is the pain clunk is gone so we all experience this and you're going to be experiencing this now over the next 15 years particularly if you're in your early 50s things are going to be stiffening in your body the good news is your pain will go the little you know who really gets this I've worked with a couple of former Mr olympias that's the top professional level of bodybuilding they put a lot of mileage on their joints they don't really get joint pain when they're competing because the muscles are so big so bulky they have enormous wrench handle moment arms and the stiffness holds the joints together when we work with them tapering down back to civilian life some of them don't look that different than you and me believe it or not what they look like in their former glory they ache like hell all their joints have these shearing translations to them now so the

[02:19:43] Cure is getting a little bit of the muscle bulk back to add some controlling stiffness and Aller go away so anyway these are all sort of fun stories but uh I I don't know if that's really answered your question on instability sciatica brachial plexus nerve traps numb thumb and First Finger whatever that they're not indicators for surgery at all try some of these voluntary skills and uh nature take its course and uh most of the time and I can with confidence prove it and say most of the time uh it will work out well with some patience and skill one of the really good spine surgeons I know and you can always tell a great surgeon by talking to them and maybe I'm fortunate because having trained as a surgeon you you sort of learn what the signs are of the hacks and the and the good ones and and you know as as we can all attest to in our own perspective profession we're pretty good at picking up who the who the good ones are and the bad ones are but you know in speaking to this spine surgeon you know it's just really clear she's a really good surgeon and one of the signs of a really good surgeon is a surgeon who's really happy to not operate the really good surgeons are really happy to not operate on somebody they're you know partly what makes them so good is they're they're judgment it's their knowing who to operate on and who not to um we did a really fun exercise one day where we went through my MRI um and I every time I get an MRI for another reason if it's going to get any sort of back cut I just send it to her even if it's not a dedicated spine MRI and I say what do you think of this does it look any worse and again we're always collectively amazed at how bad my spine looks on MRI relative to the fact that I don't have any symptoms and um one of the discussions we had prompted her to to to contrast my back with that of another patient she had who has no obvious dis pathology and yet is in debilitating pain and um she said look at the difference and and again I'm not saying this just to be boastful but I'm just trying to make the contrast she goes look at the difference in the musculature of your soas your ql your erector spine a like these are Big beefy muscles Here and Now compare it to this other patient they look the first of all the muscles are about half the size and they look like wagu they're very fatty and you know the way she was explaining it to me she goes there's a this is a person who's never lifted anything in their life and they don't have any of the disc pain you know they don't have the their discs haven't been decimated like yours have but they're more debilitated their inactivity has led to instability and tremendous pain can you speak to you you've already sort of alluded to this where we've agreed that the the the the you know the the deadlift till you drop strategy and the do nothing strategy are both bad but can you speak a little bit to why that person might be in pain and because what

[02:23:01] I don't want anybody to come away from this podcast feeling is oh I better not lift weights right because that's clearly the wrong message 100% okay I'm so glad you brought this up I would love to talk to her and I'd say tell me about your training program or your daily routine or your life in physical terms I will bet she's a Mobility monster and she keeps pushing the end range softening the joints even more so on MRI they look plump and pristine but if I I bet if we put her under load or we put her in bed and she had this instability that I've showed earlier and she lays in bed and the joints just fall like that a little bit she'll get a hell of an ache to her back my first question would be when you roll over in bed do you ever have a sharp pain that's a beautiful uh follow-up question it is so indicative of if if she has nice plump discs but Micro movements how many pillows do you go to bed with at night that is a wonderfully telling question the more the pillows the more the joint and stability it's quite High Coral anyway uh I'd love to have that conversation with her and I will bet we will get some real insight from that versus uh the person who has a mature strength history and the joints are held together uh a little bit of arthritis and people are going to nail me for this one but a little bit of arthritis is good for adding certain amount of joint stability and holding it all together uh I uh had a fra of C4 as a young fellow and uh oh I would have some terrible episodes checking my black back uh my my blind spot or craning my neck to back a trailer up or something I have zero uh pain now my neck is bulletproof again it looks horrible on a CT or an MR but my point is the arthritis has now stabilized The Joint all the Pain's gone now I I don't move it very well but uh I don't worry about it but my sister's a vet she sends me Mr not mrss but uh just

[02:25:28] X-rays of a dog terrible and as you know uh spine arthritis and uh nerve compromise in dogs which is very breed specific as well um but they they lose their hind end and uh it just atrophies just just like in a person but anyway she'll send me this x-ray of a do she says what do you think this dog's doing right now and I said well it's just laying in its bed she goes no that just won the Frisbee Championship the Frisbee catching championships so um again it I just keep coming back to the assessment uh and between you and I I don't ever want to see another MRI of my spine until the pattern doesn't fit and I can't move the paint anymore only time I ever want to see an MR of my own back uh like you doesn't look so good however

[02:26:24] I've got a few miles on my back and I'm the person I am today because of that and uh I I do everything I I want to do uh with certain guidelines you know I'm not 16 and I don't have infinite capacity so I I I play with that Tipping Point all the time but uh does does that answer the absolutely uh let me ask you another question let's um what would you say to the person who's watching or listening to us right now and I realize that there's a pretty good chance that by now because we're a couple hours into this podcast if you have never experienced back pain you might not be listening anymore cuz the truth of it is there's going to be a lot of people listening because if you've experienced back pain especially if it's happened more than once or if it lasted more than you know a week or so you know this is a riveting discussion but if you were talking to a person of any age who had yet to experience it but in particular maybe a young person someone in their 20s or 30s um what would you say to them and how would you counsel them with respect to what they could do to maximize the longevity of their spine right what a fabulous question if I was to say to you a young fellow comes into your office with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth what would you say to him that he hasn't already heard and uh you know I would love to take you over to the

[02:28:04] Cancer Ward at the hospital and I want to show you how your last days are going to look that might uh convince a few of them on the lunacy of what they're doing to themselves uh but you know it won't be 100% effective and I would Hazard a guess it wouldn't be close to 100% their friends and peer pressure is far more important for them now and that's how I'm going to answer the question you just asked of me

[02:28:35] I don't have very good luck when I see uh someone who's just all balled up kid called me not a kid a 30-year-old called me last week and uh this guy was all balled up like this and he said ah he says whenever I do exercise I'm just exhausted said oh yeah and uh I I I said uh would you move away from your your desk a little bit and would you ask someone to come in and hold your cell phone up so I can see all of you and there he was and I said all right would you now sit at your stool your chair sit upright for me do you have pain he goes no I said good drop your chest down and

[02:29:17] SLO and lower your head you pain this yeah I do think I just proved to him what uh what caused his pain and I said um he said well I've heard that before i' I've sat like a cashew and that was his exact words since I was 14 and I said you know but I can't I I coached him okay sit up lay on your tummy for a little bit let this thing calm down and uh by the way what do you do when you get up in the morning uh well I go down and I I get a coffee and I said how do you get to work he says I drive and I said tomorrow I want you to get up half an hour early and go for a walk and that beautiful and it was snowing here so I said it's snowing outside you live in LA get your you know what out of bed and go for a walk for half an hour tomorrow morning before you get in your car do you know he was bucking me on that so to your point I don't think I changed his behavior one little bit and he's going to have to suffer a little bit more before he comes to a realization that he does have the power to do something and you know I I know your thesis loud and clear in outlive we're identical we're trying to get people on a program now when he's 30 and not wait to have more misery and more misery it's so hard to motivate someone may maybe you have a a hint for me no I I I I share your sentiment exactly and that's why I've often referred to that third bout of back pain that I had the one that lasted for a year as the best worst experience of my life uh it was it was the worst experience in that I wouldn't wish that duration or depth of pain on anyone but what was so good about it is that it lasted for so long that it created a lifelong change in behavior and an appreciation for something which is without that experience this idea of a centinary into cathlon wouldn't exist because you have to sort of see what a life looks like with immobility and pain because even though I was only 27 I lived that year as though I was 87 and a year is long enough that it imp imprints right if it was only a week no matter how bad it is I don't think it would have imprinted but a year of that really imprinted in me i' I've said this before many times but you know to this day I still enjoy parking as far away as possible in the parking lot even if there are plenty of spots close to the grocery store or wherever because I remember what it was like to not be able to walk from the car to the grocery store so um unfor fortunately that's probably the nature of of our species in that it's very difficult to make a short-term sacrifice for a long-term objective without a more pressing reason so instead I'll turn my attention to who I think is the larger population listening to us which are the people who have experienced either personally or through watching someone they care about perhaps um let's start with this what are the best online resources we can point people to that can help with the types of exercises maybe some dos and don'ts around lower back pain um and again I I love that you even clarified around the big three which is hey The Big Three are great if you need stability but you know we if you need Mobility we might need some different exercise so so how can how can people sort of navigate their way through through that all right I challenged myself with exactly the same issue uh 15 years ago just as the internet was was getting going but here's the thing there is no such thing as non-specific back pain and if that's what the person operates on in their strategy this non-specific thing it will only be dumb if they're able to come up with a strategy to mitigate it they have to have an assessment well they can go and see someone who is very knowledgeable in converging on an understanding of their pain most of the time well short of that I wrote back mechanic now it's not on the internet and the reason is they have to have some background understanding of how their back works and then go through a series of self tests that's what the book does the first thing is it just says draw a table what are activities that cause you pain what are activities that either take your pain away or are neutral write them all out now here is how you patter recognize those all of those activities involve you bending backwards guess what change a light bulb overhead that triggers your pain we're starting to learn a little bit about what could the candidates be then we take them through some physical tests sit on a chair slouch extend drop one shoulder back hold five PBS out at front with arm straight so that's a compression test then we do a few self

[02:35:01] Shear tests then we do some nerve tensioning postures to start converging on subcategories of their pain then we say if you have this subcategory if you have let's do a real simple one you get pain when you sit in front of your computer going for a walk is relieving the next person sitting in the computer is their relief and they go for a walk and that causes their pain probably more in the stenosis older person kind of category the other one is a a younger

[02:35:33] Dynamic dis buul okay sit with a lumbar support number one uh number two we are now going to have a strategic exercise session uh you're going to do it every day you're going to do the big three we'll mobilize the hips um you're not going to sit longer than an hour at your computer you just cannot reach a stage of sufficient Health if you continue with that behavior um Etc so that's why you won't find it on the internet you are going to be you're you're going to find a lot of people who do not have the expertise oh here's the quick fix for your back pain well good luck with that so that's my answer to your question and uh the solution um and and just going back to to listening to you uh just as you started to answer that question I I I've got a little bit of good news for you uh in terms of your own back and by the way I know who I'm talking to so I know you get this but this is for the readership listening or the listenership I retired early I retired when I was 60

[02:36:50] I reached a stage where I realized what I'm what my job was I got when I I started as a professor in 1986 student meetings meant students came to see you and we would get up and we work through things and we do things in the laboratory and whatnot and then the students started to migrate to this idea oh sir could we have a uh an online call for student hours no you can't you get down there we going to we really this problem in other words my job got turned into a sitting job and it was killing me and I realized that my health was declining my fitness was declining I still walked to the university I strategically bought a home right on the edge of Campus so I would have a 20 minute walk to and from my office and laboratory still I was declining so I walked away I shut the door on my office

[02:37:50] I said to The Graduate students there's all my books go take them to all the other professors there's my lab go take it I'm I'm and I just walked away never thinking that anyone would ever ask me again because I'm not producing new data anymore I was sort of wrong on that estimate but anyway my point is Peter

[02:38:08] I'm healthier now than I ever was in the latter 15 years of my computerized work life I heardly go on the computer it's fabulous uh I can talk about my life now if you want and what I do but uh my point in this story is I think you're going to look forward to a Resurgence uh of your health maybe you've got it dialed in with your seeing patience and traveling and everything else maybe you don't but trust me when you retire and that doesn't mean leaving your whole medical family and expertise I mean I'm sort of working right now uh I still see patience two days a week it's it's it's a wonderful marker for my week I love it but the other five days I I I I I live a healthy life anyway my point in all of that is things are going to get really better for you they're not to decline more I've heard you say that and I think Pete come over with me man spend a couple of days and and and you you'll see how you're not on this decline as as you think is a fade to comply well you you just said something a moment ago that I was going to ask you about so um at the risk of overwhelming you because I know that there are going to be so many people listening to us who are going to say you know what I am not happy with the assessment or lack thereof that I've received I'm not happy with the care that I'm receiving with respect to my lower back injury I need to go and see Dr Mill what is involved in arranging that type of a consultation with you and again I I feel awkward saying this but that's why

[02:40:01] I wrote back mechanic so I don't see anybody until they've read the book and most of them say I don't need to see you now so they've been through the self assessment they've got enough out of it now if they're not getting enough out of it uh on on our website backfitpro do.com we have two layers of clinicians we have the uh certified clinicians who've taken that 50 hour course they've gone through the uh Hands-On skills training they've written the exam but

[02:40:33] I've never worked with them personally but they are all there on on a on a page uh then we have a different level called Master clinicians I have worked with every single one of those people and train them I've seen patients with them they have my confidence now that uh I can send them uh any any patient and they will subcategorize them and know pretty well what to do with them I continue to train those uh individuals I I seek out stars or people who have the passion and the skill and I go to them and say would you now study with me and I'd like you to become one of our Master clinicians so that's my uh answer to and and how many uh how many

[02:41:20] Master clinicians are there in North America Stuart not many I I don't know a dozen 15 maybe something like that but they're all identifiable on the website which was backfit pro.com correct and the certified that that's growing all the time there's maybe 30 or 40 of them uh okay we add to that every maybe one or two uh every couple of months okay but uh anyway

[02:41:51] I I think people in reading that book it's a it's quite a quick read it was a very difficult book to write uh as as you can imagine I was I've written my medical textbooks for my medical colleagues those are easy to write you put in the references you make your points you show the strength of evidence

[02:42:09] Etc but you can't do that with the public uh you have to give them enough of the truth to guide a effective strategy but you can't overwhelm them with jargon and all of that so that that's why those things are so difficult to write but people tell me that back mechanic in any case I I sent you a copy I I hope you got it and not only got it I greatly appreciated the inscription in it thank you ah yeah okay that was special um in any case uh that is my solution to that conundrum and that's why going to the internet as you know it's the wild west you can get screwed up as much as you can uh be helped yeah well Stuart this has been a really um enlightening discussion for me and given how much I've thought about this topic uh I think that says something but it tells me that more than anything else a lot of people listening to this uh which again I think is a lot of people who can relate to what we're talking about personally um I think this I hope offers a more than just a glimmer of hope um and and also a set of resources that people can look to and I will take you up on this offer the next time I'm in

[02:43:33] Toronto um we'll we'll make that trip up to to Gravenhurst uh apologies for my poor Canadian geography I always thought Gravenhurst was just outside of Toronto I didn't realize it was that far north but uh yeah Huntsville Bracebridge Gra HST if you know that area right in the heart of MPA so just from like Aurora we're talking like what 90 minutes two hours we'd be uh a good hour north no about an hour and half an hour and a half north of Aurora okay yeah um all right well we'll we'll make that happen Okay I well

[02:44:12] I hope so Peter I've looked forward to this day for uh ever since we scheduled it a couple of months ago uh the leadership that you've provided uh is is fabulous I uh have spent many hours listening to your podcasts and getting wisdom from uh your guests and and the level that you take all these issues to is uh just the foundation I need for uh a lot of the things that uh I think about so for all you do thank you so much and uh the way you posed your questions today were uh not really typical so I appreciate that very much but uh again thanks for all you do thank you for what you do because that's uh that's where
