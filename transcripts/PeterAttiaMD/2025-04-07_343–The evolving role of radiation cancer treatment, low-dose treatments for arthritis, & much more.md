## Transcript

[00:00:00] Again, hearing you say this, Sanjay, the listeners are going to be thinking, "What?" Yes. Because we're all so brainwashed into believing that radiation is horrible. I don't think we can have this discussion without giving people some understanding of what radiation is. Essentially, the bottom line is that the low energy stuff that is nonionizing cannot damage tissue.

[00:00:22] Fallacies about your cell phone giving you brain cancer and all are just that. They're they're fallacies. So, first off, which patients are typically being radiated? It comes down to two things. You want you want to be cured. Cure rate is key, but quality of life is equally important, if not more important for most people. And so, now that cure rates with our modern focused radiation allow it to get such a high dose into the prostate, uh, we can say that they're essentially equivalent to surgery. Let's use that as a bridge to talking about using radiation to enhance tissue. You usually see depending on the joint somewhere between a 60 and 80% success rate where the pain is if not zero at least marketkedly decreased. I don't think patients will have any patience for turf wars. Yes. And so if I'm a patient, every doctor needs to be a fiduciary. They need to put my interest ahead of their interest. It's highly underutilized at this point and the

[00:01:17] Europeans have shown us the way. It clearly works and America just has to catch up. Yeah, this is definitely an area where we are way far behind. Hey everyone, welcome to the drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Aia.

[00:01:35] Sanjay, welcome back to Austin. Thank you, Peter. Pleasure to be here. I think this is the first time we're together not driving, right? I think so. Yeah, that is true. So, I don't know. Somehow we're going to resist the urge for most of this discussion to not talk about cars. Don't want to bore your audience. I know it is called the drive. This is true. So

[00:01:57] I feel like we have we will reserve the right to have some automotive discussions at the end. For listeners, Sanjay might be one of the most knowledgeable human beings on cars. Uh he's also a very dangerous friend to have um because he's always the bad one on the shoulder when you're contemplating a new set of wheels or a new something for your cars. Um but in his other life, in addition to being the founder of MD Motorheads, right? That's right. Yeah. Which is a Facebook group of doctors who are gear heads. We're about to crack 3,000 members. It's It's exploded. Yeah. That's awesome. So, shout out to MD Motorheads. U you're also a radiation oncologist, which we also spend some time talking about, right? And um I guess we thought it would be a really fun idea to do a podcast for a couple of reasons. Um one is just the bread and butter of what you do as a radiation oncologist is a bit of a black box to many people, myself included, if I'm going to be completely truthful. um even training in surgical oncology I feel like I had much more familiarity with the medical side of oncology than I did with the radiation side of oncology. So for myself, for the audience, I think it would be wonderful to understand more as it's a field that has evolved a lot, right? I'm guessing the last 25 years has seen a lot of change. It's one of the youngest fields too. So I think in in that respect, it's uh uh you know, not steeped in some of the traditions that that you know, surgery and medicine are. So yeah, it's a new field, highly, you know, evolving very rapidly and the technology has changed so much just in really in the last decade or two. It's it's pretty incredible. And and just out of curiosity, when when did it become its own discipline, its own set of boards and everything like that? Yeah. So, you know, as a kid and growing up in

[00:03:47] Houston, some of my uh family friends were radiologists and I remembered as like a probably an elementary school kid that some of them were talking about radiotherapy and they were these were diagnostic radiologists who at the time were, you know, CT scanning was pretty new in the in the 80s. And so it was around that time that prior to that in the 70s and then prior to that it was kind of just a fellowship where people basically would radiologists would have a cobalt 60 machine that they would train on for a few weeks and you do a few easy calculations and do some crude treatments but it really started it came into its own starting in the 70s and really more into the 80s and that's when it became its own discipline and the the

[00:04:24] ACR had a separate carve out and so our residency training is completely independent of diagnostics now. So we just do it's a it's an intern year followed by four years of radiation oncology with a little bit of overlap but not a lot of diagnostic training at all just because there's so much to do and you know just on the therapeutic side. Got it. See I I had no idea that it was that new then and in terms of medicine that's obviously like that's very new. The second thing that I wanted to talk about on the radiation front um is this idea of using very lowd dose radiation to heal injuries. Right. And I actually I think that while people will be incredibly interested to understand the ins and outs of radiation oncology, again given the ubiquity of it in treating people, I I think a lot of people are going to be very interested in this idea that why aren't we using lowdosese radiation more to heal some of these nagging orthopedic injuries that that people have. And of course, we'll we'll we'll go far down the rabbit hole on that. But I don't think we can have this discussion without giving people some understanding of what radiation is.

[00:05:27] Um, and I' I' I would like us to do it in a way that's both rigorous enough that we can really get into some of the science of this. Um, but also get into it gently enough that people that maybe don't remember high school physics well enough can come along for the ride and not get lost. But once we sort of get into grays and Millie severs and all that stuff, I want everyone to be fluent when we start talking about doses.

[00:05:53] Right. Right. Right. So you know um radiation itself the the term itself has kind of got a bit of a negative connotation but basically it's part of the electromagnetic spectrum. So you know we have everything on the one in in the range of increasing energy of of photons which are just particles of light. On the one end you have radio waves and microwaves and the other end you've got infrared and excuse me you've got ultraviolet and then you get into x-rays and radio waves. And in the middle of all that is the visible spectrum. So when you see I'm sure everyone's seen the graphs where you've got the rainbow, red, green, blue that we can see. The human eye can only perceive a tiny little narrow spectrum and then on the on the low end you have radio. These are wavelengths. These are actually wavelengths and energies which are which are the very low end energies you have things like radio waves. And in that in that situation both radio waves and microwaves are what they call nonionizing. And I know you've talked about this on some of your previous podcasts and you had a really good one with uh Atari Walla from uh Prouvo where he went really it was really nice in-depth discussion but essentially the bottom line is that the low energy stuff that is nonionizing cannot damage tissue and that goes all the way up to visible light. Then when you start going to the higher energy X-rays that's when you get uh both X-rays as well as ultraviolet light and then the the high then the higher particle stuff. But basically, the higher you go in the energy in the in the energetics of the particles, the more likely the exposure to these uh packets of energy are going to cause damage to your DNA. And why is it that the shorter the wavelength, because that's what's changing as you go from radio waves to microwaves to visible waves to ultraviolet, why is it that as the wave length gets shorter, the energy gets bigger? Yeah, I'm not sure what the reason is. They're just they are inversely proportional to each other. I don't know that. I guess I'm probably not enough of a physicist to answer that question precisely. But having said that, that that is the the the uh uh the characteristic of this. And in doing so, that's one of the big reasons why all the uh uh fallacies about your cell phone giving you brain cancer and all are just that. They're they're fallacies because even having a cell phone on your on your ear for hours a day, it's it's nonionizing radiation. And standing too close to a microwave oven, again, nonionizing radiation. So that cannot damage your cells. the way that the radio wave is too long. The the microwave is too long. It doesn't have the energy. You can stand on it all you want. It can heat, but it can't damage.

[00:08:20] Correct. It can excite the molecules, but it won't actually eject an electron, which would which is what would cause an ion to form, which is why it's called ionizing. And that's where we deal with on the uh I'm on the therapeutic end. So diagnostic radiologists deal with lower energy X-rays than we do uh the very high energy X is what we use in our linear accelerators to treat cancer. So that's the big difference there is kilov voltage versus mega voltage but all of these are ionizing. Okay. So let's talk about how these are measured. How do we quantify them? Because people on the podcast have heard me talk about this. I suspect we talk a lot about calcium scores and CT angiograms and PET CT. And so that I think the the the frequent listener will have been somewhat familiar with how we talk about how to dose those things. Right? So radiation dosage, there's a couple of different terms that we've talked about. The main one we talk about when we're talking about patient treatment is is the unit called the gray and that's an SI unit that essentially is jewels of energy per kilogram of tissue. So that's what they call absorbed dose. So that's in tissue.

[00:09:25] Whereas when you're talking about exposure in the general like in the air and just in in in general exposure, it's in the air and that's we usually use the term sever for that. And actually both those terms for the most part are equivalent. It's just that uh the sever itself will take into account if you have different types of u uh of of x-rays, different qualities of x-rays that have different degrees of potential to be ionizing that they have a a quality factor you'll multiply it by.

[00:09:51] But for the most part, we use the term gray when we're talking about, for example, when I treat a prostate patient, they're going to get somewhere between 70 and 80 gray, but it's fractionated into small daily doses as to be tolerable for the body. And then when we talk about like millisevers like we're going to that's really just a measure of exposure not not absorbed dose in tissue per se. And what's the relationship between a gray and a millisever? Is it a onetoone relation? A gray and a severt technically a lot of so the the the gray also if anyone's kind of old school you read you listen to older stuff you heard the term rads.

[00:10:24] A lot of people have heard rads. So one rad is equal to one centigra. 100 rads is a gray. It's just an SI unit versus the old the older terminology. And a severt is the equivalent only it's in air, not in tissue. But a seavert is a gray. Correct. Correct. So when you give n 70 gray, you're giving 70 seaverts or 70,000 mill severts over the course of the treatment. That's correct. That's correct. Yeah. Um, and just so people can kind of anchor this to things that are familiar, uh, living at sea level exposes us to 1 to two mill seaverts of ionizing radiation a year. That's exactly right,

[00:11:04] Mon. And then of course at at altitude, it could be double that. That's right. If you live in Denver, it's easily double that or triple that. Correct. Uh just another thing for comparison, a pilot who spends a lot of time traversing the North Pole, right, which is typically how they're going to fly. They're not going to go all the way around the center of the Earth. Um might get another three or four mill severs. Quite a bit. That's right. Per per trip, actually. So that that can add up. And I was actually talking to a pilot friend about this and uh they don't really have any uh uh sort of a limitation in terms of total exposure that requires them to be to be uh out of the to be taken out of the air. a lot of them they're they're forced to retire at 65 I think is there's the commercial requirement but there's really they don't really monitor the uh actual uh exposure to that level to where they it's and I think the reason they don't really use that as a as a limiting factor for the amount of work is really just that even though they can get a higher dose there's been no proven increase in cancer in those types of populations even in you know flight attendants or anything like that the same way that the people in Denver and the people here in Texas don't have any higher incidence of cancer

[00:12:17] Now the NRC recommends that a person not be exposed to more than 50 I believe 50 millisevers of radiation in a year. Correct. Now someone like me that that's easy right unless I'm out there getting a lot of diagnostic radiology or of course undergoing therapeutic radiation uh treatment. Um, but for someone like you who has to set patients up or one of your techs, is that a are you guys approaching that level of exposure? Not at all. And so it depends on what type of radiation we do. Now, typically for our external beam machines, we're doing it all remotely from behind a shielded wall. So the vault in which the machine is placed is customuilt just to shield based on the angles that the machine can move through. through if there's like a direct angle where the machine is hitting a wall, that wall has to be built 10 times thicker than the walls where the beam can't reach. So essentially, our dose when treating remotely is close to zero. So we keep film badges and we've been it's almost become kind of a joke that when we're not doing breaky therapy, which is dealing with actual live radioactive sources, our exposure is super low, almost negligible really. But back when

[00:13:28] I was in residency doing a lot of gyn implants and things like that where you're putting cesium or aridium actually into the body cavities and you're actually up there putting it in up close. We had a a ring badge on it and we would certainly as a residence we'd rotate every month but if we didn't it didn't rotate some of the faculty actually got pretty high doses. And any idea what the squella of that was? I I know of a couple of folks, the ones who did a lot of gyn therapy, especially in the older days, we're talking about in the 80s and the 70s where you could actually see dermatitis on their hands from doing that just from the hand exposure. One of my faculty members actually had a giant cell tumor of the bone in her finger. And again, this is after decades and decades of doing it.

[00:14:05] It was a, you know, it was a benign growth, but uh that that was a real thing. There's a lot of uh uh uh data out there on especially people who were dealing in e x-ray for dentistry and stuff like that back in the day when they didn't have shielding or anything like that that they would get dermatitis. The most common thing you'd see is skin irritation in that sort of situation. Dermatitis and even some kind of chronic flaking and things like that.

[00:14:28] So let's talk about some types of X-rays that people are familiar with and give a sense of radiation dose. And I'm also curious as to how much this depends on the size of the individual. In other words, does a person that is larger receive more radiation for the same test like a chest X-ray? Sure. And they certainly do because you have to use more energy to get into a larger person.

[00:14:53] Having said that, there's two different things here because in what we normally deal with when I'm talking about dose to a tumor is the dose actually at that spot versus a whole body dose, which is a very different uh metric. And so for someone who I'm treating with say eight weeks of radiation for prostate cancer, their prostate may get 80 gray in two 1.8 to two gray fractions per day. But that's literally only to a small volume roughly the size of the prostate gland itself. And when you even get just a few millimeters away from that, that dose gets cut in half. And then it's exponentially lower because the intensity of the radiation varies with the square of the distance. So as you get even you know a couple of feet away that goes down significantly. But typically a patient who is getting you know 80 gray is a if 80 gray was a whole body dose that would obviously be lethal. Uh but um the the whole body dose is is more like a few milligra in that sort of situation. So we typically don't see like full body squelli or anything from doing even the heavy duty diagnostic treatment. Now for the CT scan, we almost consider that negligible in our area cuz again I'm dealing with mega voltage highdosese cancer killing radiation. And so when they get a CT scan which is going to be just a few millisecevers or milligra um that's almost considered rounding error versus what they're getting to the uh to the tumor. Let's take something like a chest

[00:16:15] X-ray. Sure. So chest X-ray again I people should anchor to this idea for what it's worth and we can come back to this. NRC says, "Hey, limit your annual radiation to 50 millisecverts." Uh, you got 2% of that just being alive because you happen to go outside and be exposed to the sun, right? So, the other, you know, uh, 98% might come through. Flying diagnostic, let's say you fly a lot, that might get you up another 10%.

[00:16:44] Right? Um, so let's talk about a chest X-ray. You got a cough, you go to your doctor, they do a chest X-ray. That's how many millisever it's for a normal sized person. Normal sized person it's it's a fraction. It's probably less than one millisecever actually. So it's it's significantly it's it's it's something that where um you know people who are concerned about things like diagnostic mammogs and all every year you're still talking about maybe one millisecever even a little bit less than that with some of the newer machines. And so, uh, you're in a zone where it is, you know, there there's a principle we talk about, it's called ALAR, A L A R A, which is as low as reasonably achievable. And that's been the sort of the uh mantra for our radiation safety people, the nuclear regulatory commission and whatnot, that you want to keep things as low as as possible. But having said that, when you get when you're talking about numbers of less than 50 millisevers, u, that's kind of an arbitrary number. So, it's not like getting, you know, people who've got I I should have maybe gotten a chest

[00:17:40] X-ray when I had my cough last time, but I just I just don't want to do this. I don't want the exposure, but it's so minimal in terms of biologic effect that we really don't even really worry about those, even if it's getting one of them a month or so. And a big reason for that is a lot of these numbers, especially the 50 millisecever number, is extrapolated from higher exposure rates.

[00:17:59] And so, it's a there's something called a linear no threshold model or LNT. And that's been written about extensively and that's what we're all taught in radiobiology and residency. 1/4th of my radiation training in in in residency was actually radiation biology in addition to clinical oncology and radiation physics. But so the linear no threshold model is what states that even you know we we know based on all the the data from uh you know from nuclear fallout from Chernobyl from three mile island of course from Hiroshima Nagasaki from the bombs that um at a certain dose exposure there's a certain risk of developing a cancer or any other endpoint whether it be dermatitis or bone marrow suppression there's all all these numbers are well sorted but when you try to extrapolate lower so you take maybe say a dose of say one full sever you know a thousand millisever and you start extrapolating that lower and lower to where you're looking at like 100 or 50 milliseverts the linear model assumes that there's some level of damage even at those lower levels but in reality there's actually a threshold there the the LNT which is linear no threshold has actually been proven to be uh actually erroneous and so at very low doses it's actually been shown that there's almost no incidence of any sort of biological damage And there's also, it's controversial, but there's animal studies showing there may be a hormis effect at low low doses like that. So when we get down, tell people what that means cuz that's that's obviously going to come back later in our discussion.

[00:19:26] Yes. So you know, regular listeners of your podcast know all about hormesis and you talk about in the exercise realm and cold plunges and saunas and whatnot, but the whole idea is doing some degree a small amount of cellular damage. uh when the body repairs that it actually comes back stronger than it was without the exposure in the first place. And in animal studies, they've actually shown at very low doses, we're talking about singledigit milliseceverts here, that they've seen in mouse bones, for example, increased osteoclast activity, excuse me, decreased osteoclast and increased osteoplastic activity. the bones actually heal quicker and some of the soft tissue as well has been has been shown to actually recuperate and much in the way you see in uh hormesis from other causes and that's not something that we're I'm claiming is uh you know widely accepted but there is a lot of data showing that that is certainly a possibility which goes against this classic L&T model and the

[00:20:22] L&T model itself the guy that won the Nobel Prize for it in the 1940s did this all on fruit flies and his work was disproven over the years after that. And so a lot of this lowd dose radiation safety stuff we have, it's certainly a a noble goal to keep the dose as low as possible. But when we get down into these millisece ranges, I think that they're probably a little bit overblown in terms of the actual uh negative effects on the human body. When I think about where for example something like a

[00:20:48] CT angoggram used to be, right? So, uh, right that that would easily have exposed a person to 25 millisecverts to do a CT scan of the heart for sure. Um, you're doing it, you know, slowing the heart down, getting the contrast in there, etc. Uh, today the really fast scanners, the the best of the best scanners are somewhere between one and three milliseverts for that same procedure. Sure. I certainly favor having patients get it, you know, getting a scan with that. Acknowledging though that I don't have amazing data to point to to say that the 25 mill severt one versus just to make the math easy, the 2.5 mill severt one, 10-fold difference uh poses any difference in risk. Exactly. Um what yeah, how how do you think about that? would would you say what would be your confidence in saying that 2.5 is not actually better than 25 from a cancer risk standpoint?

[00:21:49] So again going back to that allara principle there's not a whole lot of data at these levels. I certainly would strive to keep it as low as possible, which is what that mantra says, but uh I would go with the machine that has the best resolution. And if 25 is if the radiologist tells me that the that that image is significantly better than a 2.5 uh milliseceiver exposure, some of the older machines are just less efficient, you may get a better image with the with the lower dose. I think the dose is pretty negligible. It really wouldn't.

[00:22:16] Got it. So in other words, you're saying, I don't really care if it's 25 or 2.5. And the good news is these brand new scanners are faster which is why they're giving you less radiation. Um they have better you know and they have they seem to have better resolution and the same thing applies that's on the diagnostic side. On the therapeutic side where I am, our machines are called linear accelerators and there's a similar uh progression as you know we as we've been able to focus the beams more and more precisely that actually c it's a modulation of the beam meaning you have a lot of photons being showered in the general vicinity of a patient but you're blocking out everything except for a small area to treat and the same way the newer machines do definitely have a lower uh exposure to the to just in the room in general. So what should people be thinking about in terms of extraneous radiation? When should people be saying to their doctors, "Hey, do I really need this?" You know, for example, when you go to the dentist every year, they typically want to do a set of X-rays. Is that anything people should be worried about? Not at all. Not in the least. I would certainly not skimp on on uh dental x-rays, mammograms. uh if it's someone that needs cardiac workups and things like that, the potential the risk benefit ratio is so heavily in favor of doing these studies that I don't even think twice about them. And when and I think part of this comes from, you know, I've been doing this 25 years now. I have so many patients who've been through when by the time they come to me as a cancer patient, they've been through so many CT scans and nowadays we do PET scans. We follow up with annual PET scans after the fact, which are not only the CT, but you've got a radioactive isotope that's being injected into them. And we just really don't see now there are certain situations where you are giving a like for example an intravenous therapeutic dose of radiation say for thyroid cancer or things like that there's certain uh new theronostics that are out there in those situations you have to be concerned because they can get into the multiple you again to a sever range but when you're in these milit ranges it's such it's so important to do these studies the benefits of mammograms are so proven dental x-rays I I don't really think twice about them Okay.

[00:24:22] Um, by the way, just on the PET scan, the rate, what is, so if you do a PET CT, for example, which again, these are not routinely done. These are typically done in oncology patients only. Um, but just for my own understanding, are we talking 50 to 100 millisevers if you're doing a a whole body PET CT? I think it can be in that range. Yes, I think that's exactly right. And uh so PET CTS are relatively new, but uh up until maybe a decade ago, the PET scan was independent of the CT. They would do them separately, but the data is so much better when you have the anatomical CT data overlay with the PET that whatever that extra dosage is, I think it's well worth it in terms of the resolution of what we're able to see and what we're able to gain from that information.

[00:25:04] Okay. So now let's pivot from the diagnostic to the therapeutic. Um, is it safe to say that the majority or the most prevalent or common type of radiation oncology treatment would be for breast cancer? Uh, breast and prostate are the number one and number two depending on what patient population you're talking about. Prostate may even be a little bit higher. And this goes back to the 80s when the trend from doing a holian type of radical mastctomy was uh falling out of favor and the randomized data was was obtained in the 80s showing that a lumpctomy breast conservation which is lumpctomy followed by radiation has the same uh outcomes in terms of overall survival as a full mastctomy. That's when breast really took off in the 80s and around the same time is when prostate radiation started becoming a thing. But at the time radical prostatctomy was obviously still king. But now in the 2020s uh I think prostate has taken off and it's probably close to matching breast cancer now.

[00:26:08] Those are number one and number two. But we also do depending on where you are in the country and what your affiliation with the hospital is tons of CNS, lung, lymphoma, GI uh not colon but more rectal and anal distal GI cancers. Um even um in the pediatric world we try to avoid radiating children but it's it's a very big part of that as well. So we use it for almost almost all types of cancer now actually all solid tumors anyway.

[00:26:33] Well let's let's talk a little bit about breast cancer given how common it is. Um and I'll tell you something funny despite training at Hopkins I never once did a radical mastctomy. I mean it was already long gone right uh from clinical practice 25 years ago. Um and and again just for listeners to make sure they understand the difference between a radical mastctomy and a mastctomy or what's called now a modified radical mastctomy. The current version of a mast of a mastctomy removes all the breast tissue uh along with the uh lymphatic tissue in the axilla. uh and though certainly I did more than my fair share of those but the radical mastctomy the holstadian procedure removed also the entire musculature of the pec uh pec major pec minor the whole thing it basically was a disfiguring operation left the woman with nothing but ribs here and can imagine what it's like to not even have pec muscles you sort of take for granted what you need to uh do to move your your humorus

[00:27:37] Um, and yeah, to think that it's only been 40 or 50 years that someone had the courage, I think it was probably Fiser, right? Fischer's big study in the 80s, which now we have 40-year data from that. And it's interesting how now even the modified radicals are relatively rare. We still have some advanced cases that they have to go that route. But we see tons and tons of patients now who are so much happier, their quality of life is much better by just having a simple lumpctomy, uh, central node biopsy. And if it's all negative, especially if they've had their mammograms, you get a small T1 or T2 tumor. Uh we give radiation to the whole breast following that. And the radiation is again fractionated into small daily bits. They'll get somewhere in the neighborhood of uh these days it's actually only about 3 weeks of treatment, maybe about uh say 40 gray and roughly 15 fractions. Uh we used to give even when I was in just just really a couple decades ago, we were giving 50 to 60 gray was quite a bit higher dose. uh but 40 gray and 15 fractions to the full breast and with the modern technology we can cover the breast tissue without uh a significant heart or lung dose. We can even use tangential beams even if it's a left-sided tumor to stay away from the heart which are things that we couldn't do very well in the past. And so the the overall and disease-free survivals are pretty much comparable to someone who had a modified radical. Yeah. For folks who want to know more about that, um, Sid Mukerji in

[00:29:01] I think it was in the Emperor of All Maladies has a chapter on this. Fantastic book and one of your best podcasts. Love that guy. Yeah, he's he's a legend. Um, so let's talk about that. Okay, so so a woman has a stage one or a stage two breast cancer. Typically these days, I think they're moving mostly to neoagivant chemo before resection. Yes. uh in a more advanced case but if it's a typical T1 or even a small T2 that we see they may not need any neoagimment therapy they just will uh have their lumb if it's a like I say a one and a half centimeter um mass that's that's easily reectable they'll remove that just without any neoagivant treatment okay and we'll do adgiant radiation and then potentially depending on the receptor status adgivant hormone therapy as which is the domain of the medical oncologist but we still work with them so just surgery followed by uh the three to week three to four weeks of radiation

[00:29:52] How long after surgery can you begin radiation? Wound healing. We give them a little bit of time. We generally do our CT based simulation and threedimensional planning maybe three two to three weeks after their their surgery and then by the time it takes about a week to do all of our computer programming and then we'll uh start the treatment within 3 to 4 weeks posttop. So tell me a little bit about that. I was completely unaware of that. So I'm a woman. I've had a lumpctomy sentininal node was negative.

[00:30:17] So I've got an incision about this long for the listener. you know, 5cm, 6 centimeter incision. Uh, they've probably closed it with beautiful internal sutures. I've got some stere strips. They're off in a week and I've got a nice little scar a week later. When I come and see you, how many weeks after that? I usually will see patients for consultation. A lot of times the breast surgeon will send them prior to anything being done. So, I'll see them for their initial consultation ahead of time, but then we plan on doing what's called a a planning procedure or a simulation where we're going to put the patient on the table and essentially do a dry run for their treatment, usually a couple of weeks after treatment. And that involves essentially positioning the patients, typically for a breast patient, they'll be prone with their arm behind their head. We call it the the movie star pose to get the arm out of the way of the axilla essentially. And so by putting them in this position and then putting them on a wing board that'll slightly elevate their torso. We can and there's a lot of different geometry here that we can use. Uh back in the old days, they had all kinds of ways of doing plaster casts and things like that, but we essentially do now is we will uh we'll use a a what we call a vac lock. essentially a bean bag with a vacuum port and they the patient sinks into the bag. We suck all the air out of and lock it. Becomes a rigid cast of their body and that way they fit into the groove that we've made for them.

[00:31:28] We'll actually will kind of uh form it, mold it around their elbow so they're comfortable. Many times with patients who've had an axillary dissection, they may have a little bit of uh scarring, a little decreased range of motion to be able to get their elbow back there. So, we'll work with them the best we can.

[00:31:41] Whatever position we get them in, we do a CT in that position and that's the position we have to reproduce for the daily treatment. And the key there is that when they have their arm out of the way, we have to have room so that the machine can move around from different angles. The actual radiation machine has a gantry that can move really 360° can treat from any angle you want, but we have to be able to model tangential beams. We don't want direct anterior field that's going to radiate the breast, but the photons are going to go right into the chest. By using an angle, we can kind of cut across the surface and actually shape the beam to match the curvature of the chest wall. So we cover the entire thickness of the breast tissue or even many cases in the case of a advanced um um um more maybe a T4 patient something like that we may even do this postmastectomy. So you're treating the full chest wall and we go a little deeper below into the ribs into maybe the first inch of lung tissue below that. But by using these tangential beams, that really minimizes the treatment, the the photons damaging the uh the lung tissue. So all of that is planned ahead of time when we do a CT scan. Sorry, just to be sure, planned pre-rection because you're seeing the tumor itself. Actually, no, I I what I meant was pre-treatment. Got it. So post resection, we you'll see a tumor bed.

[00:32:52] The lumpctomy cavity is obviously clearly visible. It's a fluid pocket on CT. So I'll scan the I'll scan the whole chest. Uh it takes about a week. I have a whole team. have a wonderful staff, a radiation doymmetrist that helps do the computer planning and then a radiation physicist that actually cal calibrates the machine prior to actually starting the patient. So, we do the scan. Of course, the CT scan is two-dimensional slices, but we have three-dimensional modeling software. So, I have a full 3D model of the patient. I can look at any slices or how thin. Uh, it it varies.

[00:33:21] Usually, we don't need this is not a diagnostic scanner thing. So, usually something like 2 millime 3 millimeters. We don't have to go super high resolution. And so that way uh once it's once it's reconstructed, then I can have a nice idea of what angles to bring the beam in because beams in at because every person has a slightly different curvature to the chest wall. You're going to have to customize the anatomy.

[00:33:40] Different breast sizes. We have all kinds of different techniques. So I won't go too much into the details, but if someone is very large breasted, we could even treat them prone to get the have a special pillow to allow the breast to hang down. And it's also I'm guessing where the tumor was in the breast. So if you have large breast and a superficial tumor, definitely prone would be amazing because now you're the the the tumor bed is so far from the patient. Right. That's true. But our technically at what we call the uh clinical target volume, the area that we're trying to radiate would actually include the entirety of the breast tissue even Oh, really? Even uh all the way down to the chest wall. So there's two different ways. There's full there's full breast radiation, which is what most people get. But what you're describing actually is partial breast.

[00:34:21] We would just target the lumpctomy cavity. And that can also be done. We save that for usually for older women who have a very small tumor. Uh and when I say older women, it's it's more because of the fact that uh u the remainder of the breast remains untreated. So a local recurrence is a little bit more likely in someone that has not had full breast radiation. But in a selected subopul of small breast cancers in someone with a very large breast you can do partial breast where you're only targeting the lumpctomy cavity. But for most of our patients we actually do treat the whole breast as standard of care plus or minus the axilla. That's where the pathology comes in because if they did have a positive lymph node then we have to go after the axilla and sometimes the superclavicular and even inframame intramary nodes in some cases. Okay. Yeah. So, this is infinitely more involved than I thought, which means I'm not the only one that probably was ignorant of what is involved, right? Um, how long does each session take? When they're actually on treatment, it's about 15 minutes, sometimes even a little bit less than that. Some of the newer machines can deliver the beam even faster. But when I say 15 minutes, I'm talking about I have four patients an hour typically. So, in and out of the room in 15. So, that includes getting them on the table. The key thing for accuracy and reproducibility is positioning. So, the reason we made that mold and we've not only did we get them in position, but

[00:35:41] I've also got a couple of dots on their skin to use as reference marks to make sure that the patient is is uh in in the correct position. Uh that whole process probably takes 5 minutes every day when the patient gets in the room and then maybe another 5 to 10 minutes for the actual beam to be on. And my favorite thing is to come in the room after the patient's first treatment and then the most common question I get is hey doc when do we start and I'm like no ma'am that was they're like really that was it because they the patient feels nothing.

[00:36:09] So the machine will go through its various angles. It's pre-programmed. The entire process is about 15 minutes a day and they can leave feeling the same as when they got there just like getting any x-ray. They jump in their car and go right back to work or to to the gym or the golf course. When did this become so automated with the robotic arm and stuff? I mean when was the hu like did you do this in your residency or were you were you the ones manually doing that in residency? So uh it I was in residency in the late 90s early 2000s.

[00:36:36] So it was a very interesting time because we were at the cusp like my first year of residency and I was at UTMB in Galveston and we did a lot of it was a combined rotation with MD Anderson. So we were at a time this is 1998 we're talking about where we were on the at the end of the old era we didn't even use CT planning. We just had a couple of orthogonal films and we were literally drawing our tumor volumes out with a grease pencil on a physical X-ray and cutting and using that cutout to go trace a styrofoam negative and make a metal or a lead alloy block which you would slide this basically this aperture in the path the path of the beam. That's the way it was done for decades. And so we were still doing that when I started residency. But by the end of residency we had full-on CT planning where now we're doing a full CT scan doing everything virtually. And of course, it's far more precise and you can model basically you can model multiple different iterations. Okay, do I want a beam coming in from this angle? Do I want to bring in a an orthogonal beam from here? Do I want to u uh block out a little bit more of the chest wall to get the heart dose down? I can see all that stuff now. So, we by the time I finished residency, we were basically doing what we do now, albeit with much slower computers and and you know, just being in the infancy of that, it was probably more like 20 to 30 minutes per patient.

[00:37:47] But the last 15 years roughly to answer your question, things have been much more automated. And instead of having lead blocks that you're sliding into the path of the beam, now everything is shaped in the head of the beam by our computer. So you hit a button and when I've already programmed the the the uh treatment pro the treatment planning values, the machine knows how to shape the beam to match the aperture of whatever you're trying to do. So that's all fully automatic now. So the therapist job, we have a radiation therapist who actually positions the patient in the room. They get them in position. They take a picture X-ray first, either a cone beam CT, which is a lowd do CT, or just a a a PA and a lateral film. And we actually overlay that with our planning imaging to make sure that the original reference from the planning day matches today's image.

[00:38:33] And the beams, the the machines will actually superimpose the daily image with the reference image. So everything is automatic. We I can see, okay, are we directly on if everything lines up correctly, then we literally have two images that look identical. I just see one image. But if it's slightly off, if there's even a few millimeters this way or that way, we account for that by moving the table. The table is motorized. So the patient will be laying there and they'll feel it move just a you know a few millimeters this way or that way until we have perfect concordance between the daily setup and the original. And that way that's really really improved our accuracy. And the regional miss the geographic miss which was a problem in the old days when we didn't have digital imaging and all this stuff is essentially gone. Now the actual radiation beam is generated by what? The ion is generated by what?

[00:39:18] Right. So that's another thing that has changed. Now essentially when I say now the last basically 30 years most machines in the US are linear accelerators. So these are artificially generated X-rays. It's essentially accelerating electrons through a long vacuum tube. You know essentially electron gun. And at the very end of the tube you've got a tungsten target. And so the phot the electrons hammer that target and then they shower photons out.

[00:39:42] So you're generating the X-rays that way. And this has been done actually I think your alma moater Stanford had the very first one in the US the medical linear accelerator. But prior to that they were using these for atom smashers and you know they had the the gigantic machines that were used for physics. But u they started in London I think in 53 and then I think in the late 50s Henry

[00:40:01] Kaplan at Stanford had the first one. But so we're essentially still doing that even today what 70 years later. But the key difference is how we're able to shape those photons once they come out of the machine now. And so when the actual photons are coming out, they're completely unfiltered. It comes out in a cone shape and it diverges as just as any light source would. You know how when you you hold a flashlight to a wall, you get a nice precise uh circle.

[00:40:23] As you pull the flashlight away, it diverges. So we have filters and we have what's called a multileaf columator that can actually shape the beam as I mentioned earlier that can actually match the anatomy of the patient. But now that's all done uh automatically. We program it ahead of time as opposed to the old days when we had to use lead blocks that were actually physically blocking the beam. But basically the lin has has been the standard. Prior to that we were using a cobalt 60 machine which is essentially it's not even a machine.

[00:40:49] It's basically just exposing a patient to a radioactive isotope and then shutting the jaws again. So that's how and actually those are still in use in most of the world. There's a few left in the US, but they've mostly been decommissioned now because the linaxs have have taken over. When you say that uh a typical treatment might be 15 gray over the course of the 3 weeks fractionated over 15 treatments. So it's actually about 40 roughly, you know, 2.5 2.6 gray per day. Uh and you're right and times 15 treatments. So you're getting roughly 40 gray to the breast. And then we usually actually do a boost. So we'll give what we call a a tumor bed boost where we give a little extra dose to just the lump itself, the lumpctomy cavity itself. And there's a couple of French trials that showed that adding an extra 10 gray over an extra 5 days. So two gray times five just to the lumpctomy cavity itself improves local control over just whole breast. That's actually what I was going to ask you. I was asking I was going to ask if the 40 gray is distributed completely uniformly across the breast. The answer is no. it is, but then you have that boost extra boost and it's, you know, it's a it's a customization based on the patient's pathology. I'll occasionally have a patient that the breast surgeon will call me and say, "Hey, you know, Sanjay, we did our best, but we had a persistent positive margin. I went back and did a re-rection and there's still a positive margin or maybe the positive margin is uh is at the chest wall where there's only they can only go so far. In that case, instead of giving a 10 gray boost,

[00:42:15] I might give a 16 gray boost or something to account for instead of just treating microscopic disease, potentially macroscopic residual in that sort of situation. So, every patient's a little different. And then the axillary nodes themselves are normally not treated in an early stage patient, but depending on the risk factors, if it's a very large tumor or if there was a positive sentininal node, maybe an incomplete axillary dissection, then in many cases, we end up treating the full axilla. And in and in some cases when it's advanced disease, we end treating level two and level three. So you end up getting the super clab as well. If we go back in time to 25 years ago, 30 years ago versus today, what are the typical side effects that a woman experiences from this treatment? And by the way, was she typically getting 40 gray 25 years ago or was that a little more? I think you said, and now they've come down a bit. It was sort of 50 60 gray back. And so this brings up a point I need to kind of emphasize. It's not so much the total dose, it's the dose per fraction. So, how quickly are you getting it? So, the standard of care was actually 50 gray rather than today's 40ish gray, but it would usually be given in two gray per fraction daily doses rather than the 2.6 2.7 that we're using now. So, the effective dose when you take into account, there's a whole radio lecture that we're not going to bore people with, but taking into account the dose per fraction and the total dose, the biologically equivalent dose or the beed is roughly the same. now at 39.9 gray given in in 15 treatments versus the old 50.4 gray that was given in say 25 to 28 treatments. So it was a longer process.

[00:43:47] You're you're right. Uh and we still do that in some cases. And this comes back to another question you asked about about the homogeneity of the dose. And so our goal of course is to have 100% coverage of the whole breast. But the reality is when the the way that photons are going to be interacting from different beam angles and whatnot, you're always left with hot spots and cold spots. And so the biggest difference between what we're doing now versus the old days wasn't so much the total dose. It was the actual homogeneity that you touched on. So the heterogeneous heterogeneous old way of doing things with a cobalt machine or with a low energy X-ray unfortunately meant that there were hot spots and cold spots in the breast. And that of course could either be manifested as scar tissue if it's a hot spot or heaven forbid a a geographic recurrence if there was a an area that was underdosed.

[00:44:34] So with the modern computer planning we were much more homogeneous. So even though you may say I got 50 gray back in 1995 and now I'm getting 40 gray. You're now getting 40 gray in two and a half gray fractions which is equivalent to the old 50. Plus we don't have a 150% hot spot and a 60% cold spot. we have a nice 100% match all the way across and that can that's all uh it's like a CAD

[00:44:58] CAM type of thing. I'm about as close to an engineer as a as an MD can be. And so we do actually simulate the dose of the the dose distribution of the radiation in the tissue. And so with a nice modern days, we get a nice homogeneous dose. And therefore, that goes to your next question, which was what is the what does the patient experience? Uh maybe not so much 20 years ago, but more like 30 40 years ago with the older cobalt machines, they would get a terrible dermatitis. Like many times it was moist desquamation confluently over the whole course of the over the whole chest wall.

[00:45:31] Axillary desamation is always bad because of the friction of the arm. Uh but with the modern treatment now with first first of all not using cobalt using linear accelerators the energy of the photons is higher which means the skin dose is slightly lower. So you're getting maybe 100% on the skin rather than 150% like you once did. So we don't see anywhere near the skin reaction that we used to. It's more of a, you know, maybe a grade one or a grade two arythemma. So mild redness or maybe sometimes a little bit of, you know, like it's a sunburn, but nothing as severe as we used to. So these days patients do still get a sunburn. We give them a little uh some free samples of

[00:46:09] Aquafor or they can use an aloe vera plant if they have it. just you know your normal type of skin care stuff as opposed to the old days when we were actually treating essentially burn victims with silver sulfadine and heavy duty narcotics and things like that. the modern era, it's so much better that a lot of the patients, especially if it's someone that doesn't have a very large breast, there's less energy being put into a smaller sized person. Uh they don't get anywhere near the skin reaction. And that's why if you did have a very large patient, we actually still use the old 50 gray in 25 because you're giving less dose per day and you do have a very large breast where you're going to have areas that are going to have hot and cold spots. Sometimes that's still needed. So, we have to tailor it to the individual is is I guess my bottom line there. Did anybody ever look at those when you had the very desperate hot and cold spots and follow women for recurrence and yes was there any association between the cold spots and recurrences? There certainly is. And and so the problem was is that the cold in the old days you didn't have computer modeling. So and actually the old school physicists got to give your hats off to those guys that had slide rules and probably abacuses or whatever the heck they had back then. You couldn't really you couldn't really tell exactly where the hot and cold spots were by by actually having a computer show you. you had to go based on the fact that you you use what energy you choose a photon energy and you know what the dose distribution at various depths is and so you would try to minimize that by again having beams coming in from different angles and then by using uh multiple angles and multiple fields you could paint in the dose as best as you could but um yes certainly there were issues where as you get deeper into the tissue the dose would be lower and then this is again before my time but there certainly were were studies showing that there were ge graphic misses and uh there was that was obviously not good which would sometimes would lead to like a salvage mastctomy or something like that but in the modern era not so much. uh what is the impact of breast implants in this type of treatment either saline implants or uh the older uh actually they're not older now they're back in vogue right the silicone silicone implants either way what we can so the photons the x-rays we use they they are not at all affected by that it's essentially tissue equivalent and I pardon my ignorance I completely forget are those implants typically under the pec or between the pec and the breast so we see both you know it's interesting how there's I guess subard

[00:48:30] I'm not sure what the current I think most of them we see are actually under the muscle. That's I I don't know. I've actually seen both even recently. Mhm. But I've seen them both even I think even now the plastic surgeons have different uh criteria for that. But regardless of what it is, our whole if it's under the pec then of course it's really a little farther away. Not a huge issue. But we still the radiation will still affect that area. But typically these these implants are pretty pretty tolerant of that. The only issue down the road is they may have a capsular contraure or something from fibrosis.

[00:48:58] The bigger challenge we run into is for our postmastectomy patients who are going to be reconstructed and they have expanders put in and that's where the relationship between the radiation oncologist, the surgeon and the plastic surgeon is key. Yeah. Explain to folks what expanders are, how that works surgically. So essentially what's happening is when you have a full mastctomy if a patient wants to have their breast reconstructed later on the uh uh the surgeon the breast surgeon will remove the breast but then the plastic surgeon will come in and place some sort of a placeholder to allow the the soft tissue the connective tissue and the uh and the skin to stretch to allow for future implant placement. And so those tissue expanders typically they can actually inject uh saline into them with a port and gradually stretch them with time. And so that's normally what they would do if there was no radiation involved. But if it's a patient and again most mastctomy patients really don't need radiation because this gets away from what we mentioned earlier where breast conservation is lumpctomy only. But there are some patients with a full mastctomy who are going to get reconstructed. So they come to me when I do their CT scan they have this expander in place from the breast surgeon. So, we have to again modulate the beams and we treat the entire chest while we make sure we're covering everything, but simultaneously we have to make sure that we don't have those hot spots in the area of the expander where potentially you could cause scarring and fibrosis and cause the uh the expander to have to be removed, have the plastic surgeon have to revise it. That becomes a whole another hill of beans there that we don't like to mess with. But we have techniques now to be able to keep the dose off of them. And again, as you mentioned earlier, whether it's silicone or or saline, it's roughly the same density, but some of these tissue expanders have bits of metal in them, they may have other artifacts. And so when I'm treating with photons, with

[00:50:43] X-rays, depending on what you're hitting, the the the effect is based on the density, the atomic number of that tissue. So metal behaves very differently from bone behaves differently from air. But when you're in the spectrum of saline, tissue, water, it's all basically the same. We can model all that very much like I I'm getting ahead of myself, but very much like when we have a prostate patient with a prosthetic hip, a piece of metal right next door, we're able to compensate for that with the modern computer treatment planning systems. Do women experience any systemic symptoms from radiation like nausea or vomiting or is that not at all the only time we see radiation patients who have nausea or vomiting it's typically it's a lot of times for for other sites they may get concurrent chemo radiation where the chemo could be responsible but for for breasts we don't do concurrent it's usually sequential the only time I really see radiation induced nausea if

[00:51:34] I'm treating an esophagus or a pancreas or something that's in the it's treating in the in the abdomen or somewhere along the GI tract where nausea is more of an issue typically not for breast. Okay. Um let's talk about prostate which is obviously also the the sort of um the the bread and butter of of the field. Um so first off which patients are typically being radiated. And so that the answer to that has been evolving.

[00:52:00] There was a time as recently as probably 20 years ago where uh we only treated patients who were probably medically inoperable that the the urologist would say hey you know this is a high-risisk anesthesia patient let's send them to Dr. Ma for radiation and that's a big reason why a lot of the older data was not as good for radiation because of the patient selection criteria. Uh but in the modern era as we've gotten more and more precise and our side effects have gone down and our cure rates have gone up, now it's pretty much wide open where pretty much anybody who's eligible for surgery would also be eligible for radiation. So there's not that big of a divergence as there once was. So and obviously you've gotten to know Ted

[00:52:39] Schaefer um who's not only on the podcast but is is equally um let's just say interested in cars. He sure is. So, so you you me and Ted have a lovely little text thread about cars. He and I may have another text thread in case our teams meet in the playoffs as well. He's a big Ravens fan. So, and I'm from

[00:52:58] Houston, so yeah, I'm hoping we get there. Um, so let's talk about um kind of a patient that comes in to see TED for a biopsy. They've got a Gleon 3+ 4. Um, and then another patient who's a Gleason 4 plus4 or 4 plus 5 or something like that. Right? How does that patient navigate their way through the system as to whether or not they need radiation or should they undergo surgery? And does androgen deprivation therapy necessarily come with radiation or is there a scenario where you undergo radiation but you don't require androgen deprivation?

[00:53:35] Sure. So to answer your last question first, androgen deprivation for high-risisk disease is certainly standard of care. Uh Gleason 8 or higher for sure. The gleon 7s are always a a uh sort of a gray zone and so a 4 plus three with high volume disease typically also do get concurrent and adgivant androgen suppression along with radiation. Uh but one of the things that's really changing now is I know Ted talked a lot about this with the decipher score where they can look at the chromosomes of the actual cancer cells and have a much more granular view of exactly are they are they truly high risk or can you can you uh uh maybe say that this one 3 plus 3+ 4 is more like a 3 plus 3. So we can so for a lot of the 3+4s now with the decipher test and there's also an an AI test. I know you had a really interesting discussion with your AI uh expert that wasn't too long ago uh called artera and we're using that that's actually in the NCCN guidelines now. So that artera test can help us differentiate between a unfavorable and a favorable intermediate risk patient and essentially actually I treated my own father not too long ago.

[00:54:39] He was the first person I did this on. Uh the artera test is essentially they just use the actual images of the H& slides that were already done from the pathologist and it's interpreted by a machine uh machine learning computer that has been trained on hundreds of thousands of prostate images from the old RTOG studies the 94s all the all the stuff that was done back in the '90s and it can now come back and say okay very much like decipher it can say that this is a 3+4 but it's a favorable or an unfavorable person in that in that subgroup and so because of that we can stratify better and actually tailor it to where maybe a 3 plus4 doesn't need androgen ablation at all and maybe even some 4 plus 3 so they come back low enough on the scale where you could make you always have to talk about the side effects and whatnot but the standard of care was always to give concurrent and ablation for intermediate risk but now we're able to really take some of those people out of the equation with these new studies and is the main selling point because most patients just want things taken out right I have cancer take it out so is the reason that a person might select radiation therapy especially if it comes with androgen deprivation therapy because of the sexual function and urinary fun like what's the main advantage those are number one and number two yeah lack of incontinence and lack of impetence but of course when you have androgen ablation that sort of clouds things a little bit uh but typically the number one thing we see is uh patients who don't want to deal with diapers and for the most part although uh incontinence is still described uh to some degree in the literature. In my personal experience, I don't think I've seen a single patient who came in continent who left with anything less than that.

[00:56:19] There's no pads, there's no nothing. Um and then of course also being uh uh you know with our as I talked about with breast cancer, we can also focus very precisely on the prostate itself. So the dose to the penile bulb, the dose to the rectum, the dose to the pro to the uh bladder are so low now that uh the side effect profile is essentially zero from a radiation standpoint. Now they may be having hot flashes from the androgen deprivation uh and decreased libido and fatigue as you know. But on the radiation side because we have all these tricks now very much like with breast the way we can avoid the heart and the lungs in the case of the prostate we can almost completely avoid the bladder and the rectum and even the uh the penile bulb. Now, so the quality of life, those are the reasons why people tend to choose radiation. And I know we've talked about this before. Um, you're just not seeing the procatitis. Yes.

[00:57:10] Almost none. In fact, uh, now, um, I know I think Ted had mentioned in his last talk, there's a there's a gel spacer that that is often inserted. It's it's an injection that's done transparentally and it's separates the the rectum from the um, from the bladder. But in my years of doing this, when you're very diligent about how you do this, very much like a, you know, like a surgeon pays attention to details, so do we. I can actually trim the dose off of the posterior prostate and just make make sure the dose fall off between the posterior prostate and the anterior rectal wall is so rapid that the anterior rectal wall is always going to get some dose, but usually it's not clinically significant. and and and what we do to to manifest to make sure that that is is a daily thing because we're talking about treating patients for multiple weeks. We actually coach the patient to come in with a full bladder and an empty bowel. And by being diligent about that and imaging daily to double check that in fact the bowel is empty and the bladder is full. That that allows those two organs to separate from the prostate. And even a few millimeters of separation is all we need to take advantage of our modern focused radiation beams. And does the patient need to be coached to time their breath or anything as the beam is at that most delicate edge of the rectum? Great question. So not not so much for pelvic patients but we do that for breast cancer especially left-sided breasts. So just to go back to that uh you actually have a deep breath hold which will get the chest wall away from the heart. So we do that in the case of thoracic tumors but in the pelvis that the diaphragmatic position doesn't really make any difference. It's more about bladder and rectal filling and emptying, respectively. That's much more important. Everybody I've talked to who's had LASIC eye surgery always says they're so worried that they're going to do something or flinch and it's and and do do patients feel the same way when they're undergoing radiation. Like, what if I just flinch my pelvis or, you know, do something like that? It's going to get too close. I get that question all the time. And from a LASIC standpoint, I think I would be worried about that's probably why I'm still wearing these

[00:59:03] Coke bottles, unfortunately. But uh in the case of prostate cancer, first of all, the dose is given over the course of several minutes and then each of those fractions is again from you we're talking about one fraction out of multiple weeks. So even if someone absolutely had a coughing fit or something like that, first of all, we're watching them. We can stop the beam. We can stop it at at any given moment. But slight variations daytoday, the biggest variations are going to be based on bladder and rectal filling. We take that into account when we're doing the treatment planning. So there should really be no adverse outcome because what I actually do is I'll map out where the volume of the prostate is and we will actually purposely expand that volume and treat the full dose of radiation even a few millimeters outside of the prostate to make sure that there is any internal organ motion or anything like that that we take that into account. But typically if someone's coughing or something like that we just we can just hit the pause button and get them reset and ultimately it's not an issue. What about patients that are inoperable?

[01:00:00] Um first of all, you know, what leads to a patient being inoperable and how do they show up? So, you know, typically the urologists have already screened the patient because everyone's first uh first exposure is going to be to what the urologist tells them. And luckily in this day and age, I'm lucky we have uh people much like Ted who are very open and who are very uh open to not just doing surgery, but who actually look at the other options and present everything to the patient. But typically a patient who maybe was medically inoperable will will certainly come to me. But even somebody who maybe is on the borderline who wants wants to see both sides of the token. A general urologist will send them to a surgical specialist and to me.

[01:00:37] And we'll go through all the pros and cons of everything. And really what it comes down to to not to not, you know, belabor the point. It comes down to two things. You want you want to be cured. Cure rate is key. But quality of life is equally important if not more important for most people. And so now that cure rates with our modern focused radiation allow us to get such a high dose into the prostate. Uh we can say that they're essentially equivalent to surgery. So we don't have that deficit like we did 20 years ago when our fields weren't as precise. It was sort of the shotgun approach versus our you know sniper approach. Now um because the cure rates are better then it really comes down to uh the quality of life changes and that's where there's a spectrum of things. Now, is this an applesto apples comparison? Because the patient who undergoes the robotic prostatctomy today does not go on androgen deprivation therapy. Right. Right. They get to walk around. In fact, you've probably heard

[01:01:31] Ted on the podcast. He says, "We'll give those patients TRT if they're hypogonatal." Right. Right. um why does the patient after radiation therapy still need to be androgen deprived if in theory the radiation is as effective as the surgery? And that's that that comes to a key point where you have less surgical side effects. You don't have it's it's trading one thing for another.

[01:01:53] You don't have the incontinence. You don't have the at least the short-term risk of impetence like there is from surgery. You don't have the you know the penile shortening or whatever other sort of things that they have to deal with. But you have to deal with hot flashes and decrease libido and whatnot. But again, most of the patients who are intermediate or high intermediate risk are going to if if they if they end up uh not having a uh a negative margin or seminal vesicle invasion after prostatectomy, they're still going to come to me for radiation anyway and they're still going to need to be on androgen ablation. So there's a significant number. Now these days we'd certainly treat a lot less Gleason 6 than we used to. We observe most of them. Yep. But there's a lot of Gleon six folks that even in this day and age will choose to have radiation just because it's maybe a little bit more aggressive form of watchful waiting. And in that case, there is no Androen ablation and they just, you know, they just glidec of Gleason 3 plus 3 watchful waiting versus XRT no ablation. No, unfortunately there's no actual trial.

[01:02:52] There's just observational studies. That's that's kind of what we're dealing with there. Oh gosh. And obviously you can't figure out what the biases are. But what do those observational studies show? They show you know essentially because people don't die from gleon 6 disease as we all know they really do because quality of life they do so well with the radiation there is just less of a chance of it progressing to seven and and when they come to me to be seen I get a it's interesting the different patient populations I also get people this is not mainstream but I get a lot of transplant candidates who need a renal transplant and they cannot get their transplant unless they're they're cancer free even if it's even if it's one core of a glyon six they're ineligible for their transplant so Those guys I will certainly treat but I've been following them now for what 20 plus years that we've been doing it. They quality of life they do so well and this way they don't have to worry about androgen ablation when they do become a glyon 7. Yeah. So it's really interesting. There would be a very interesting and elegant study taking let's call it medium to high risk 3 plus 3es. So people based on family history or some other phenomenon genetic or otherwise right? you randomize them to watchful waiting versus radiate them without androgen deprivation and you're really looking I mean you'd have to do this as a very long-term study. So the question is outcome number one could be conversion to 3 plus 7 requiring surgery or andor androgen deprivation therapy and then of course outcome two the very long-term outcome would be overall survival.

[01:04:27] That's right and that's the key. That's why these haven't been done. You wouldn't need decades to do a trial like that. It's a 20 year study. So yeah, definitely. But it certainly certainly would be interesting to see what it would show. But the real world observational studies show that all the Gleon 6 guys like I would say until maybe maybe a decade ago, we did a lot of Gleon 6 patients. They mostly were sent for radiation and they just because of the Why were they sent? Well, you know, um I guess it's a combination of different things. People have different levels of tolerance for watchful waiting. uh pre in the preMRI days everyone had to have an annual biopsy and that alone is more anxiety invoking than really the radiation is not to mention we see fair number of folks with eurospsis and you know complications from that so now in the MRI era we don't really see that anymore but that was done very routinely and because the patients had so little proctitis and and cyitis especially in a gleon six where not only am I not worried about pelvic lymph nodes I'm not even really worried about the seminal vesicles so my field is very small which really minimizes the the side effects because the the bladder a full bladder when it's when it's actually full it'll move superiorly and anterly where the dose is is close to zero. So most of these patients they just kind of laugh and say I'm coming in for my daily my daily treatment and I'm you know right back to my normal life again. So with in the absence of androgen deprivation, radiation is has become very simple for prostate patients now. And again, what fraction of Gleason 7s can do radiation without requiring androgen deprivation therapy? That answer would have been zero probably 5 years ago, even as recently. But now with artera and decipher, it's probably

[01:06:04] I'd say a quarter of them don't need it. if it's if it's a 34 with a low decipher low art tera score. Uh and again this is still an evolving area where I don't think anyone has the exact answer but that's what most people are doing nowadays and even some 4 plus 3s that have load deciphers are potentially candidates to avoid that and the biggest thing the biggest uh change in this has now been our ability to do PSMA PET scans to follow up because otherwise I think that the extra androgen therap androgen deprivation was more of a a sort of a band-aid for not being able to see what's going on afterwards. Now, if someone has a recurrence and you do a

[01:06:41] PSMA PET, I've got a guy that had treatment 20 years ago with radiation. Now, he's rising PSA. Otherwise, he'd just be stuck with ADT for years. Now, I see we see a positive parotortic lymph node on a PSMA PET. I can just treat that area and not worry about Mhm. and very successfully. There's no long-term data yet, but it seems to be working really well. Similarly to how we would use a FDG PET to target a lung tumor in the past. What about these patients that show up with uh two spine mets? How effective is radiation there given that that's a favorite spot for a prostate to you're talking about uh like an initial presentation with oligo metastatic disease. No, let's say okay we could talk about that or we could talk about post treatment three years later. So post treatment three years later paliative radiation does work very very well. It would be probably five treatments. You can even do what they call SBRT, which is stereotactic body radiation, maybe in a single fraction.

[01:07:35] Um, and it it definitely is very good at we we kind of joke about it and just kind of spot weld that spot and of course it's not going to prevent something else from popping up elsewhere, but that's extremely well tolerated and usually it'll stop the progression at that site. So there are people who had high-risisk disease u and to get back to what I mentioned earlier if they had a couple of spots like that at the time of initial diagnosis. Now it's been shown that you can treat the oligometastic disease if it's in the bone only at the same time as the primary lesion and the outcomes are actually not significantly worse if it's just limited disease. And what is a more favorable presentation oligometastic to bone or oligastatic to paraortic? Bone for sure. Yeah, you can have actually I had a guy walk into my office with a PSA of 1900. He looked just as good as you or me and I I actually took him on a TV show I did many years ago. It was kind of a interesting story. 1938 65year-old guy, Mr. Macho had never been to a doctor in his life, widowerower who decided that he was dating a younger woman now. And she's like, "If you want to be with me, you got to go get checked out. Colonoscopy clear, blood work all clear. Oh, by the way, your PSA is 1900." Which means the lab made a mistake if you're I mean that's what you would think. That's what you would think except for his bone scan looked like a

[01:08:47] Christmas tree. This was in the prepet era with I mean he had disease in every bone in his body with zero symptoms. So this is an obviously an outlier situation but in that type situation you need lifelong androgen deprivation and uh chemotherapy. Uh you know usually at back then it was mostly taxol based therapy. We didn't have all the second generation uh androgen uh ablation drugs that we do now like enzolutamide. But at that time uh when when he when we saw that you know he went and got chemo and got engine ablation when he came back to see me again fully functional guy perfect shape his PSA was down to 1.5 with just the systemic therapy and at that time the tumor board we we presented him the the decision was made to go ahead and treat his prostate as though he was a you know a denovo presentation because all the bone disease had had uh resolved and he did great. He So you treated his prostate.

[01:09:39] Mhm. And how long did he live? He's still alive. This has been I got an email from him just about a year ago. So I think at least as of a year ago, he was 12 years out. Still doing great with zero side effects aside from, you know, he did have to be he's on and and ablation for life. So he's certainly going to have issues from that. Uh but overall still very functional. How is this possible? What what is what's the biology of that tumor that allows him to still be alive? I don't think it's even necessarily just prostate. I've even seen it in in breast cancer patients in the small subset where it's bone only disease with no visceral metastasis.

[01:10:15] Some folks can live for a very long time with bone only disease. And I'm not sure what the answer to that is. And has he suffered any debilitating fractures? You would expect that at this point, but nope. Not not even one. That's this guy's in his late 70s now. Now he's in his Yeah. late 70s and has not fractured a thing and is still active. The guy plays golf and uh I hope he still has that young girlfriend. I'm not sure about that. But uh but other than that, other than the hormonal aspects of it, yeah, it's amazing how and I've seen many many people with fourdigit PSAs that we get them down at least NED for some window of time, even if it's not that long. Fourdigit PSAs. Yeah. I think the highest I've seen is 7,500. And that was not that was a person that ended up passing away. But uh the the guy who was 1900 he I think a lot of it is a function of just like any other type of tumor. He had all the other risk factors that were lined up. He was young, healthy, no other coorbidities, active you know you name it. But still well it's interesting Ted has told me about some of the most terrifying cases are the exact opposite. These guys that show up with a low PSA with a very low PSA a

[01:11:24] PSA of 1.9. Those are worse. and for sure uh rampant metastatic disease. Right. Right. Right. And that's the thing. You get some of these really poorly differentiated cancer that no longer resemble their prostate progenitor cells and they just they're very hard to monitor and a lot of them even don't even show up on a PSMA PET scan. Anything else you want to talk about on the oncology side of this as far as what what should people know as they're engaging with a radiation oncologist? uh what questions should they be asking? What you know, it sounds like it's no different than surgery where there's clearly a difference between good surgeons and not so great surgeons. There presumably are people that take the kind of care you take and agonize over the details. Um how can somebody find out if their radiation oncologist is kind of practicing in your philosophy? you know, it's it's difficult in terms of uh actual metrics very much like even even for the surgeons like you know TED is has excellent outcomes but it's not like it's a published series you just have to and not only that the best surgeons often are treating the hardest cases true it's a handicap right there right there% so you know it really comes down to finding someone who's got got the experience and in my case because we do so much prostate I think I've done something close to in the modern era 7,000 cases probably 10,000 when you include pre-image guided radiation days.

[01:12:53] Um, someone who specializes in the area that uh that the cancer is located in. So, someone like me, I may be extremely experienced in breast and prostate, but maybe for a pediatric malignancy, you're not going to come to me. You're going to go somewhere or CNS or something that's unusual. You have to find the right tool for the job. But you have to just interview your doctor. I don't think there's anything specific to radiation that's really asking about complications, right? I think being very open with them and saying, "Yeah, exactly." And so, uh, ideally maybe you you come to someone who knows something like I get a lot of patients who aren't familiar with the field, but they'll have a patient, they'll have a family member that's a nurse or a dentist or a veterinarian or whatever it is, someone that has some medical background, they can say, "Okay, let me ask the more specific questions." And these days with with the internet, you can do all kinds of research in terms of like when I'm when I'm talking about matching my my volume of the dose distribution to exactly conform to the tumor volume.

[01:13:47] That's something that's very easy to talk about, but I mean for a for a uh an educated patient, they can ask to see the actual computer simulations. A lot of my engineering patient I was just about to say engineers probably have an easier time. They do. I love my and my engineering patients are really the only ones who do this and I'll be I usually pull out all the graphs. I show them dose volume histograms with area under the curve for each organ. And you can see, okay, the prostate dose area under the curve is huge. The dose of the bladder and the rectum is super low. You can actually quantify that. But for a lay lay patient, it's it's hard. You know, it's not that easy to do that. You really got to go with I think a lot of it you have to go with your gut, too, in terms of this guy's had a lot of experience. And the initial consultation is where it all comes down. I'll spend an hour with a patient and go through every little nuance of what could and couldn't happen. And my main I think my main mo is to sort of overprepare them and have them be pleasantly surprised maybe when the side effects aren't as bad rather than the other way around.

[01:14:39] And you just it's it's hard to find the right person, but there's a lot of good doctors out there. So, uh, let's spend a minute just on the the brain. Um, and because I guess I that's sort of a a unique case. I know it's not where you are, but but I'm sure you know I still do a lot of it. Oh, you do? Not as much as prostate and breast, but Yeah. Okay.

[01:14:58] Both primary and metastatic. Yeah. So, again, because the brain is such a sink for Mets, you know, a, it's a source of a lot of primaries, but it's also where a lot of cancer spreads, right? um it's often a place where you can't operate uh either because the the the tumor the MET or the primary is too close to say the brain stem or something uh too vital. Um so so radiation is a pretty common tool there. So talk about the history of radiation in the brain. Sure. And and the spectrum of everything from whole brain radiation to gamma knife and stereotactic and all sorts of things in between. Sure thing. So uh really the the main differentiating factor for brain patients is whether it's primary or metastatic disease. And although primary brain tumors are relatively common, they are dwarfed by metastatic disease. So the vast majority of what most radiation oncologists see when you're treating CNS is going to be uh usually lung especially small cell uh based brain metastatic disease. And so in those situations the the trend used to be where everyone would get wholeb brain radiation but now with the advent of stereotactic radio surgery which is more focused precise radiation. Uh the newer data shows that you can actually just treat the area of metastatic disease as as a as a delineated MRI scan and not necessarily radiate the whole brain like we used to. For decades, everyone got whole brain radiation. And for the most part, they did all right.

[01:16:21] But the problem was you're looking at a patient population that maybe doesn't have that much of a life expectancy. Now that systemic therapy, amunotherapy, everything has gotten better, especially in the case of lung patients, they're living longer. Um, we we have evolved where we've been finding people that were previously radiated to the brain were having cognitive issues years down the road. not for the short term they would tolerate it well but maybe they'd start to have more forgetfulness an inability to remember numbers and names and whatnot and so the modern era now and this was from whole brain radiation whole brain radiation and give me some doses so we're talking about 30 gray to the whole brain given in 10 fractions of three gray each that was a typical sort of a three gray time 10 was a was a sort of a standard thing and again this is a staggering amount of radiation and that's what and when we consider that again it's to the brain so it's And just to be clear, do you need to use way more radiation because that's what you're delivering to the brain? So the this is is this an example of where the severs and the gray are very different because the skull is pre is you have to get through the skull. So no uh so this the only difference between severs and gray in any patient is going to be whether we're talking about dose in tissue or coming out of the machine. Basically the the dose in air versus dose in the patient.

[01:17:39] The biggest thing with brain tumors, yes, the bone certainly is going to attenuate more dose, but what I'm talking about is actually 30 gray into the brain itself, the actual brain tissue. And so the So, doesn't that mean you need much more than 30 gray coming out of the machine? A little bit more. You know, the bone doesn't do that much.

[01:17:56] It's not like they're wearing a football helmet or something. Yeah. Photons can still pretty much go through everything. It's not that's not metal, so it'll still go through, but the dose is a little higher. and it gets to be like for example in a lung patient it's more of an issue when you have multiple different areas you got bone soft tissue and air in that situation you have to modulate the dose more but in the case of a whole brain uh it's been found of course that the hippocample dose is very much uh uh uh related to their cognitive deficits down the road so now that we have IMRT which is a term I had didn't mention before but that's basically intensity modulated radiation therapy which is also the magic behind allowing us to treat a prostate without burning the bladder and the rectum. And the newest form of IMRT is called imageguided radiation therapy. So you hear you'll hear IGRT. Basically, those two terms go together. But by using

[01:18:45] IMRT, it's kind of like an HD TV versus this 1960s black and white blurry set where we can treat with multiple small pixels and in high definition so to speak. So now when we do a whole brain, if I have to do a whole brain for multiple metastases by using IMRT, I can literally carve the dose out. I can map out the hippocampus and carve the dose out of there. So you see these two cold spots on the hippocampi and not and really have a very low dose there while still treating the remainder of the brain parankma. Are there other parts of the brain that you carve out and protect? That's the main one. Of course we are going to not necessarily completely carve out because when when you have multiple metastasis really the whole incraanial space is at risk. You have to cover everything. So believe it or not 30 gray sounds high to you which it is. Uh but for a glyopblastoma we use 60 gray but granted that's not to the whole brain that'll be to the either if it's an unresectable patient it'll be the primary mass and then we will give maybe 46 gray to the to the perurmoral edema uh but then the rest of the brain is getting much less hopefully zero in many cases. Do we know what the survival difference is for um an unresectable glyopblasto with and without radiation?

[01:19:55] It's it's certainly worse, but typically the one there's there's again multiple confounding factors there because someone who's unresectable probably has other other negative issues as well. If they they have uh you know a poor overall performance status, they have neurologic deficits. Whatever the reason, the surgeon can't operate that makes it worse. But yes, even then in that situation you get probably you again you're measuring survival in weeks to months, but it's probably double with radiation than without. A lot of our

[01:20:20] GBMs though are reected hopefully fully resected in terms of rad at least radiographic the posttop MRI not showing any enhancement. If you have someone that's got a fully rected primary who's a younger patient with not a lot of neurological deficit uh they can live a couple of years actually. Why why is this cancer unservivable? Yeah, you know that's the that's the key question. I know you and I are both Rush fans. Neil

[01:20:43] Pier was lost to GBM as well. And you know, it's it's so many people that's taken away. But I think it just has to do with the the invasiveness of the fingers of the tissue in terms of even when it you think you've gotten the whole thing. Uh there's microscopic fingers that are always on the periphery and you can't just radiate it indiscriminately like you can other parts of the body because you've got the brain there. So yet there's a there's always a a fine line you're walking between causing you know say for example necrosis of the brain versus letting the tumor recur. And so that's really the number one issue. We do have a new tool now as far as radiation oncologists in terms of treating CNS tumors which is called proton therapy that you've probably heard about. There's several centers in the country now. MD Anderson where I am in Houston has a huge one.

[01:21:27] But with protons, you potentially can have the dose go into the brain to a certain depth and not exit out the other way like an X-ray would. X-rays are like light. It goes right through you. You may have a decreasing dose, but it's kind of like a bullet. You got an exit wound going out. With proton therapy, this is one of the areas where protons shine because you can actually modulate what's called the brag peak of the physics of the protons to where it'll go at certain depth and not go out the other way. So down the road, hopefully we'll start to see improved survival. So far, it really hasn't shown to be a huge improvement, but there's less less integral dose to the rest of the brain.

[01:22:01] And it's especially important in pediatric patients where you've got, you know, uh, children with growing skull bones. And if you can avoid radiating the the growing bone to cause a, you know, a deformity later on, that's huge. So, proton therapy is one tool we have. But, I wish I had an answer for GBMs.

[01:22:17] You know, that'd be that's going to be a game changer whenever that does happen. Yeah. I I I find GBMs to be just such a a frightening uh type of cancer and I I do wonder if it's going to require some sort of injectable amunotherapy or something like I just it's it you have to basically figure out a way to treat the brain systemically and that's right and but you you have to mechanically overcome the bloodb brain barrier and and come up with some sort of systemic treatment for it. Um um okay so today how many patients are undergoing wholeb brain radiation?

[01:22:58] Wholeb brain radiation is probably to give you a number it's I don't know what the absolute number is but it's probably 10% of what it was 20 30 years ago. the original studies out of Kentucky that Patel had done in neurosurgery, everyone used to get wholeb brain radiation following uh either following resection of the metastasis or even if it was unresectable and there was some good data back then supporting that. But nowadays rather than whole brain you're usually going to do a focus treatment just to a smaller area and this is kind of a you know a universal trend to less radiation dose to a smaller volume. Same thing in lymphoma. You want to treat just the enlarged lymph node and not the entire lymph lymphatic axis. So it's the same idea where you're trying to minimize side effects. So wholebrain we still use it in specific cases like for example small cell lung cancer part of their uh regimen is going to be once the primary has been treated if they have a complete response in the thorax.

[01:23:53] Prophylactic cranial radiation only for small cell PCI 20 gray five fractions been done forever shows an advantage. They have lower low lower uh a reduction in CNS. It's a lot. I think it's probably 70 80% reduction in in CNS failures because they all fail there otherwise. That little small cell, they just all do that. And at 20 gray, they really don't have too many side effects.

[01:24:16] But again, of course, the caveat is always small cell, you know, extensive stage small cell lung patient isn't going to have a long-term survival, but at least they won't fail in the brain. It's a quality of life issue. And I'm sorry, this is done with every small cell patient, no matter how early it's caught. if they have a complete response to primary treatment. Yes. Okay.

[01:24:35] Basically every maybe there's some nuances but for the most part. Yeah. Okay. So what's a gamma knife? So gamma knife is a is a instead of using a linear accelerator it's actually using cobalt 60 like I described earlier but you have multiple small sources that can actually be used very high resolution cobalt essentially. So you're doing the same thing but instead of using a linear acceleratorbased treatment it's it's using cobalt. So is that used anymore or is it there still are centers that use it. It still works very well for what it is, but the focus is very narrow.

[01:25:04] There's a lot of children's hospitals and all that. I think we're still using it. But the linear accelerator, which I is abbreviated lac, the lacbased stereotactic radio surgery for the most part has sort of taken over from that because it can do all the same things and also have more flexibility to do more than just CNS. Uh St. Jude's

[01:25:21] Hospital has a fantastic PDCNS program and they still have well, it's been a while now, but they did have a a gamma knife last time I checked. So, we've talked a lot about radiation. We've touched a little bit on the idea of radio, but but maybe let's let's use that as a bridge to talking about using radiation to enhance tissue um as opposed to eradicate a subset of tissue.

[01:25:45] Sure. What does it does it stem from, you know, nuclear accidents? Is that largely where radio comes from? I've done a deep dive into this this year which goes along with all these benign cases that I'm treating now. They're essentially arthritis tendonitis which we'll talk about. And what's really interesting is that this radio is largely a US-based phenomenon because the first cases first of all X-rays were discovered in 1895 by

[01:26:15] Renkin. In 1898 there was the first case described of actually radiating a uh both arthritis type things or ankylosing spondylitis or other arthritities and also tumors. Even back then we had no idea how it worked but there were cases pre900 that were already being used for that. And then in the subsequent now 120 plus years we have this divergence where

[01:26:37] Germany and the UK are using and all of Europe really are using radiation routinely for arthritis and tendinitis. But in the US, it seems to be a basic there was a a lot of a was nuclear phobia, the cold war like you mentioned. But another thing that's that's been talked about, there's a guy named Jason

[01:26:53] Bea that has a really good podcast on the subject. He's out of Vermont. Um, Standard Oil, the Rockefellers and all actually had a massive lobby group that were actually actively promoting oil over nuclear power plants. And they the the amount of spread went from just the energy industry into the just the general zeitgeist of the of our entire country. And so at that time the radio phobia just caught on and it was of course um uh bolstered by World War II and seeing what happened in Hiroshima

[01:27:23] Nagasaki. And then on top of that you had the you've probably heard about the radium dial workers. Uh there was a movie it's actually it's called the Radium Girls. These are essentially uh women in the 1920s that were using radioluminescent phosphorus paint to paint the watches. Watch dials. Yeah, being a watch guy, you'll probably appreciate that. But they literally that was the only source of illumination they had. So in order to keep the brushes very fine, they were literally uh dipping it in the radium paint and then after each brush they were licking the brush to keep the the tip real fine. And so they were ingesting bits of of radium. And uh so there were a number of cases where they ended up getting the the radium is metabolized like uh calcium. So it was actually incorporating into the mandible and they were getting osteorradio necrosis of the jaw and things like that. So all of these different phenomena kind of added together became a became a big deal because prior to that people were using radiation for all kinds of crazy things.

[01:28:17] It was in suntan lotions and waters and there was something called vigoridine that they were using for ED that you could topical salves that had radiation in them. It was there was literally no end to it. And then when all this squella started to come out that hey maybe this isn't such a good idea. That's when things took off. But now that we look back the reality of it is is that a lot of that was really overblown. Even so much so that those radium dial painters which we we hear about this from day one in our residency training there was only a small percentage like I think 50 out of 1500 roughly that actually had toxic squella.

[01:28:49] So most of them didn't. Is there a way to quantify how much exposure they had to and that's the thing you know they may they have licked different ways but there there have been some basic ideas. is it was again we're talking about uh it was probably at that era was probably a couple of millisevers to the to that particular area but it was daily for decades and so part of the reason why they if you actually look at the numbers it was probably a super high exposure but when you spread that out over such a long period of time that's sort of the general trend like I mentioned earlier it's not just the dose it's the dose over time it's you know and the denominator matters a lot and so that's why most of them actually did very well they even used to use radium internal internal nasal applications in the 19 I guess 1920s to 1940s essentially a rad a radiation equivalent of a tonslectomy or adoidctomy and it was done in something like a half million to two million children in the US and even in the armed forces it was done routinely back then and there's been very few adverse squella that were reported I don't even know what the dose was but it was high so there's a lot of cases where the exposure based on our 50 mil deceiver rule we talked about would just make people fall out of their chair but the the actual reality of it is is that many times the the actual end results aren't as bad as we had expected. Again, hearing you say this, Sanjay, the listeners are going to be thinking, "What?" Yes. Because we're all so brainwashed into believing that radiation is horrible. Right. Right. I can tell you so many stories. You know,

[01:30:18] I got patients who I've had to treat. I had actually had a guy who was involved in nuclear testing at Los Alamos in the 1940s. He's passed away now, but I saw him in his 80s. So, this was in the early 2000s. This was 60 years after that. They had very little monitoring back then, but he was close enough to feel the heat from a thermonuclear bomb.

[01:30:37] And by the time I saw him, he had had thyroid cancer, as you would expect. He'd had one or two lymphas. I think I ended up treating his prostate. So, he'd had at least four or five different malignancies, but the guy was as functional as most 80-year-olds are. The guy was still walking and talking and doing just fine. And it actually seems that the when you look at the population studies that were done outside the blast at Hiroshima and Nagasaki when of course you the initial concentration everyone dies from the thermonuclear energy. But as you get several miles out not only are the cancer rates actually roughly the same as the background you actually see again evidence of hormesis where you have some patients in whom or maybe not hormesis but some sort of radio protection where you actually have lower rates of leukemia and thyroid cancer when you get a few miles farther out than you did in the general population.

[01:31:20] So it's all very much dose dependent, time dependent. But I think the human body, we we're evolved really to handle this to a larger degree than we realize because again, mamalian DNA, we came from, you know, the background of the animal kingdom where there was tons of exposure from natural cosmic rays and whatnot. And then, you know, our our predecessors had to be able to survive.

[01:31:41] Our DNA had to be somewhat resilient in order to get to this point. I think it's more resilient than a lot of people give it credit for. So, this first came up maybe a year or two ago when when I was lamenting it must have been two years ago, I guess, because I was kind of lamenting um my Achilles tendon, which wasn't I wouldn't say it was injured. I just had a little bit of tendinitis. It was just bugging me a little bit. You and me both, brother. And um I know exactly what you mean. And uh and and so it was through that discussion that that we we got into what we're talking about now. um which seemed crazy. You know, I just decided I didn't feel like driving to Houston all the time to undergo therapy and my Achilles is fine now. I just did sort of standard therapy. But right, um I've sent a few patients to you who have had similar injuries, uh both, you know, high hamstring tendonopathies, Achilles tendonopathies.

[01:32:35] So, so talk a little bit about this idea. How prevalent is this type of treatment in Europe? Who you know how prevalent is it here? Right. So prior to probably 1970 or maybe 1980, it was very prevalent even in the US. It was very widely done. So this is kind of everyone I talk to them about it now. It sounds like I'm doing something experimental and radical. But if you go over to Germany again going back to ankylosing spondilitis papers in 19 1898 uh they've done they do something like I hear between 20 and 50,000 patients a year in Germany and they there's tons of it's mostly observational studies. There's very few randomized trials but uh lowd dose radiation for tendinitis, osteoarthritis, plantar fasciitis, all the ites you can think of, berscitis. Um a low dose of radiation has a similar anti-inflammatory effect to what you would get from a cortisol. Let's define the dose. So now we're talking about very low dose meaning 50 centigra or 50 rads given uh six times over two weeks. of three gray.5 * 6 is three gray to the affected joint um and uh using a very low energy machine. So this is especially in the case of someone who's got a hand. You're talking about electron beam radiation. Sorry, let me just make sure I got that straight. You were giving 40 gray total to a breast. A breast. And now for the Achilles, you're giving how much? Six. Three gray. Six fractions of half a gray each. Okay. Got it. So all six fractions combined is about the dose of one fraction for a typical cancer. Got it. That'll kind of give you the idea. and giving it in a superficial fashion where especially if it's a hand you only have a couple of c maybe a couple centimeters of thickness.

[01:34:19] So we use what's called electron beam therapy. The same linear accelerator when the electrons go and hit the tungsten target and make photons. If you remove the tungsten target, you just get direct electrons. And electron energy can be modulated to where you can treat a superficial skin cancer. You can treat a knuckle. I can treat a temple squamus cell and not go into the brain. So these superficial things and in the old days before they had linear accelerators, I told you this goes back to the turn of the previous century. They had ortho voltage machines and these basically created kilov voltage x-rays not the mega voltage x-rays we use now and all they could do was superficial stuff back then and that's where it worked very well the dosage has changed tremendously but these days with the modern the biggest data comes out of Germany half a gray three times a week Monday Wednesday

[01:35:04] Friday for two weeks just to the affected joint and it has an anti-inflammatory effect very similar to either a either a cortisone shot or an inset and how many weeks is the course two weeks That's it. So Monday, Wednesday, Friday, six treatments. And the protocol is uh what we typically follow, the German protocol is to wait 12 weeks. And you usually see depending on the joint somewhere between a 60 and 80% uh success rate where the the pain is if not zero at least marketkedly decreased.

[01:35:32] And then after 12 weeks, the German protocol allows for a retreatment. And at that point, you get up to 90 plus% success in terms of reducing pain. And this is for joint arthritis. Arthritis, tendonitis, berscitis, plantar fascitis is a really big one now that we're doing a bunch of. I've done probably close to 70 cases across the board. It's kind of remarkable because anybody who's had it, you know, I had it once back in med school. So about exactly 25 years ago.

[01:35:58] Did you get it treated or was it just went to PT and rolled on golf balls and did the usual thing, but it, you know, it took months to get better? It's such a big deal. So you're saying so of the patients that are coming to see you with plantar fasciitis, how many of these patients, how long have they been hurting? First of all, many times for years. And in fact, my biggest cohort recently, which is still relatively new,

[01:36:21] I haven't done thousands of patients. Like I can speak from decades of experience with cancer, we're talking about, you know, dozens to hundreds. Um, couple of surgeons that were having trouble standing and operating. They literally couldn't uh, you know, couldn't perform their normal duties. uh six treatments to the to the fascia and they're walking like nothing ever happened. How long after the last treatment did it take for them to experience? In the case of plantar fasciat was almost immediate like within within a week. Uh I have other cases especially when we do like knee arthritis if there's a lot more pathology going on in a knee. Uh I treated my own Achilles which I can tell you about took two months or so. So it was almost I was almost wondering if it was going to work or not. I was my own first patient before I offered to anybody. I treated my own true doctor. I was a physician heal thyself, right? And so I literally jumped on the table because a colleague of mine had posted about it that he did his he's a radiation ocologist in Florida. He tried it out and so I was like, you know, I have the machine. I know this should work in theory. We were just never taught about it in residency. I look at all the German data. There's tons of it's like why do we not do more of this?

[01:37:25] And sure enough, like I I'm actually my own personal case control study because I did steroids and PRP in my left Achilles and then later on this past year did the right side with only radiation and no steroids and now I'm walking without a limp. And you obviously did the other side. Mhm. No, no, actually I didn't I didn't repeat because I the PRP actually finally did.

[01:37:42] So I had two cortisone shots and PRP in the left and then a year later radiated the right and so both of them are are holding up pretty well so far. Got it. The other area that is of huge interest for me at least is the very very high uh hamstring tendonopathies. So that that istial tuberosity pain very very common for runners uh seems to be anecdotally much more common in women than men based on pelvic. I've only treated women for some reason with that and they've all had tremendous results. Yeah. Uh again, so it's still the same protocol. It's the three gray over six treatments over two weeks. Exactly. For any type of an arthritis, uh you're essentially licing all the macrofasages and all and you're eliminating that cytoine storm that would have normally resulted. It's very similar to what cortisone does, but the difference is it seems to be based on the studies we've seen it's much longer lasting than a cortisone shot. Not to mention the fact that you're not necessarily violating the capsule and causing other, you know, in the case of an Achilles tendon, you run the risk of rupturing it with multiple injections.

[01:38:45] So, totally noninvasive. you just get up on the table. Most of my patients go right back to whatever they were doing and many of them are actually quite athletic and they don't take any breaks during treatment. They just do what they do. They're still working out. Is there any literature looking at this for uh spine injuries? And by injuries, let me be clear what I mean, right? So when you think of all the times that people are getting spinal epidurals for irritation of spinal nerves, herniated discs, things of that nature, is there any reason to believe this could have any efficacy there? If indeed there's some efficacy, which there clearly is due to spinal injections or epidural injections? There there is some data for spinal osteoarthritis specifically. Uh it's less robust than all the extremities. Uh I've actually done a few cases and it's actually worked quite well. We've even got, you know, essentially Medicare actually does uh reimburse for these things. The issue with the spine is it's such a multiffactorial area where if you've got a nerve root compression or a disc issue, I can't fix that part of it. But there is limited data that I've seen out of Europe that did show some degree of relief, but it's not the 80 to 90% that we quote for the extremities. And do you think it's because of patient selection? Like if you if you knew you were dealing with a facet arthropathy, that should in theory respond well. It should and it does.

[01:40:02] I've done a few of those. SI joints seem to respond quite well and that's in the literatur that's included. So hips, SI joint, lumbar spine, those sorts of things. Uh they are described. They're just not as routinely treated. There's not as the level of experience that we do have with your ability to center the beam is remar. like you're using the same highfidelity equipment you're using for raton. So you can hit a P inside if you want to. You could, but that's exactly what you don't want to do because you're basically trying to eliminate all the macrofasages in the region. So you're actually better off treating larger fields. So it's the exact opposite of what we do with cancer therapy. And because the dose is so low, you're not really gaining anything by being too cute with the small fields.

[01:40:44] You actually want to treat the region. It's like almost like an abscopal effect for the whole area. So when a if you're treating somebody that comes to you and they've got an Achilles tendonopathy, usually there's a point of maximum tenderness, but it usually hurts up and down the whole Achilles. How do you position the beam? And are you literally hitting from mid calf down to heel from the insertion and the gap even treat up to the in my case part of the g the inferior gastro was painful too. Okay.

[01:41:12] So I treated that entire region. The field was probably about that long all the way down to the calccanial insertion and even onto the a little bit of the plantar surface of the heel because again when you're talking about these super low doses of radiation there's no like if it was a saroma of that area I'd be treating a tiny little area but over here we we want to treat the whole region and in the most of the most radiation oncologists we talk to their experience treating an extremity it's usually for a saroma. So that's a whole different ballgame where you're giving 60 gray to someone who's had a saroma in their in their leg or something and you have to worry about things like uh uh edema you know essentially if if you you can have lympadeema of the distal extremity if you've radiated the whole the whole circumference of a leg or something like that. But with these low doses it doesn't affect any of that. So you do treat large fields. So it'll be from the entire from the insertion of the Achilles all the way down if it's a plantar fascia the entire plantar surface of the foot. Another thing that we see a lot which is not arthritis is dutrins contraure and also the foot equivalent which is leader hose disease.

[01:42:14] I had to look that one up. That was a like a trivia question but it's essentially palmar or plantar fibrosis. And so radiation works well there as well. Very well documented. And that requires a higher dose though. You're talking about uh three gray per fraction. Five fractions and then you do it again after a few weeks. So 155 it's almost cancer. Yeah. almost um paliotative cancer, not not a high dose, but again that's for fibrosis. Uh kloids, it works very well to get teenagers with big old uh u golf balls hanging off their ear after getting their ear pierced and things like that.

[01:42:48] And so again, you're treating the fibroblast. In that case, you use u four gray times three treatments. So 12 gray, relatively large dose per fraction. You can totally protect the brain. Totally 100%. Yeah. And just tell I've seen obviously patients with debilitating kloids. What does it look like after the treatment? So the treatment has to be adgiant after a surgical resection. If you just radiate an intact koid, it's not going anywhere. Okay? Because you don't have the the DNA mechanisms of, you know, a weak cancer cell that can be wiped out. So kind of like doing a lumpctomy, but obviously if the surgeon just did the resection, the kloids coming right back, the fiber blasts go crazy and they roar right back. So in order to do it right, a lot of people do and they have multiple recurrent rate uh treatment koids even after treatment.

[01:43:34] You have to do the first treatment the same day of surgery. So you're just not letting those fibroblast get a chance to have any sort of a foothold. So I would literally arrange it with the dermatologist to do the resection send them straight to me. So we get the first dose in that day and ultimately the cosmetic outcome is as good as if they didn't have radiation that you'll see the scar wherever it is. We get sometimes kids that have had acne scars all over their chest that have these bumps everywhere and they were all resected flat and you radiate them, they just stay flat. You don't see any sort of dermatitis from radiation. I think what's amazing to me is I I just think there's too many people that don't know this, right? I think there's too many people that are walking around sort of suffering either from something that's cosmetically upsetting like a huge kloid uh especially on a visible part of their body. Uh obviously the people everybody listening can relate to some nagging injury. Tennis elbow, golfer's elbow, Achilles tendonopathy, hamstring tendonopathy. Uh these things nag for years at times. Yeah. I think they the data was showing something like one in seven people in the country are afflicted and the the uh socioeconomic costs are massive. And there's also, you know, going to your whole uh uh quality of life and longevity bias. I mean, we're talking about something that can really affect someone's ability to exercise at all and it can lead to exacerbation of other medical problems.

[01:44:51] So, it's a huge problem. You know, I was very encouraged to hear you say a second ago that Medicare is covering some of these things and private insurance, too. Yes, for the most part. Now, a lot of times, because it's relatively new, I'll have to get on there and do a peer-to-peer with the company, but I've had no rejections at all. Even for the spinal ones, which are a little bit, there's less robust data, but I've gotten everybody covered.

[01:45:11] So I think the question is, do we need more radiation oncologists, right? Because how are you making room in your practice? Yeah. To treat these patients when your cancer patients are probably ringing you off the hook as well. And that's a big reason why it hasn't caught on. I think there's a component of just, you know, when you've got 8 hours or 12 hours a day that the linear accelerator can run, we're we're busy with that. But one of the things is that uh because unless it's a deep hip or something for most of the superficial for all the other joints, you can use one of those old style ortho voltage machines that I mentioned earlier like what they use in

[01:45:45] Europe. They still sell those here. There's a company called Extrawl that still makes them and they're perfectly acceptable for all the joint stuff except for the very deep ones like maybe a an SI or hip joint. Um, but you could have a, you know, a small center set up and those types of machines don't even require the shielding because the energy of the photons is very, very low. So, yeah, this is something that could be it. It's highly underutilized at this point in the and the and the Europeans have shown us the way. It clearly works and America just has to catch up. Yeah, this is definitely an area where we are way far behind. But it's truly exciting.

[01:46:18] I mean, I love treating cancer patients. It's really personally very rewarding to tell someone that they're NE. there's no evidence of cancer in their body anymore. Their PSA is low, their mammograms look good. It's a it's it's that's what's kept me going this long. But the amount of immediate relief we're seeing from from all these inflammatory conditions right away, it's just like it's a night and day. Patients come in one day, they can't grip a door knob or lift a gallon of milk out of their fridge, and after six treatments, they can, and they're just they think you hung the moon. It's it's an amazing thing. Yeah. I I I I really I I'm I'm hopeful that people listening to this, so if there's a million people listening to us have this discussion and you know, one in seven of them, let's just say one in 10 of them at some point in the next couple of years are going to experience the type of injury that would benefit from this. How can they go about finding

[01:47:09] They can't all come to Houston to see you. I'm trying to get you to move to Austin, but regardless of where you end up, yes, they can't all come and see you. So, where Oh, that's you already said the answer. I'm just going to move to Austin. We're just going to do this full-time and drive cars in the in the on the weekends. No, but seriously, uh it's it's there's an uphill battle because as I've been going out and trying to get the medical community in

[01:47:29] Houston aware of it, you have a lot of push back because number one, you've got orthopedic surgeons, podiatrists, hand surgeons who are looking at this like number one, what are you doing? What are you talking? Are you They look at me like I'm crazy. And number two is like even if this actually works, the concern is someone's got maybe a knee arthritis that's been nagging them and maybe they're going to need a total knee at some point. Their concern is wait a minute is is this taking surgery off the table? They have all the which it's not by the way because it's such a low dose.

[01:47:54] There's been plenty of cases of surgery after the radiation. It's not an issue or you're taking away from like your when you had your plantar fasciitis. I'm sure the podiatrist build something for they do those extra corporeal shock treatments and steroids and whatever it is. It's it's a different uh paradigm that would potentially be taking away that these a lot of p a lot of doctors are very negative about it. Most of them at this point are very negative. But I think that tide is going to turn just like anything else. It's just going to take a lot of education, a lot of time, a lot of talk. Well, I think at the end of the day, look, I don't think patients will have any patience for turf wars.

[01:48:28] Yes. Right. That's true. And so if I'm a patient, every doctor needs to be a fiduciary. they need to put my interest ahead of their interest. And what's interesting is that I think you can have your cake and eat it too. And the reason I say that is many times this is an adgiant for other things. So if you've got a podiatrist that's doing all these PRPs and other things, I'm actually looking at starting a protocol. I just treated a nurse in Houston who's who's a NP who does stem cells off label, but she does them routinely, has a quite a big practice. We're going to look at maybe you can do radiation with adgiant stem cell treatment. There's I think a lot of reasons because it's such a low dose. may be the sort of combined modality thing down the road that we haven't really approached where there may be options to do other things still. But again, the fact that medic I mean for

[01:49:12] Medicare to improve something is a huge bar, right? So how did you how are you getting Medicare to approve this? Are they basically acknowledging that well hey if everywhere else if if Europe's been doing this for 100 years and it's working like what's their bar that's what it looks like when you when you you know I've got the C61 which is the uh

[01:49:29] ICD code for prostate cancer which is in most of my patients we got the osteoarthritis codes now they just go right through typically without any sort of a problem. some of the private insuranceances uh you have to get on a peer-to-peer call. But when I all I literally will do is quote them a couple of the German studies. Unfortunately, uh we got a little bit of a setback because historically there's only two randomized clinical trials that were both heavily underpowered, poorly run studies, just not well done. So that's been a little bit of a setback. But uh and the and the randomized data may never come just because of the nature of this sort of thing. But having said that, um that's not the obstacle anymore. We got it's really just public awareness and like you said once you get it just like a a guy that doesn't want a radical prostatctomy and wants radiation therapy for his prostate he's got to be his own advocate and the data is out there the information is out there I've actually there's a couple of big Facebook groups and one is only the putrin's patients and they literally will post up I've got this big nodule what do I do my surgeon wants to cut on me and so there's actually a whole whole network now so there's a lot more of that education going on they've got big PDF files of doctors all over the US that will do deutrans radiation. So the putrans is a little bit more commonly accepted. But as I'm slowly talking to these folks, they're going to sort of uh you know uh migrate into the arthritis space as well. So I think it'll come and the patient the the general public has nothing but great positive outcomes from this. I mean it's and do we do we have a sense of the durability of this? So for example, I have a little bit of um osteoarthritis at my AC joint on the right. Um, it's it barely bothers me, but every once in a while if I'm doing something really violent overhead, you know, reaching for something or I play a ton of football with my son, it'll bug me for like 3 weeks. I'll take a little bit of Advil, it's fine. If I did a treatment there, would it be done or am

[01:51:15] I doing this treatment annually? How would it work? And that's there's a lot of variability there depending on what the actual anatomy that's causing it. if there's, you know, uh, if it's literally just a straight up osteoarthritis case with no physical structural issue. I've seen cases I've, now again, I've only been doing this about a year, so I don't have the 25 years of experience I did with cancer, but I've talked to there's a there's a couple of doctors who do this routinely. They've been doing it for 20 years in LA. One of them treated his own neck, shoulder, and spine. He's 15, I think he said 15 years out.

[01:51:44] Anecdotal obviously, but never had to retreat himself. Typically the German studies allow for two treatment, two retreatments. Because the dose is so low radio, I don't see any reason why you couldn't do it. I don't know about annually, but you know, maybe every few years or something like that, but there seems to be a fair bit of data that a lot of patients who don't have other struct like a like a knee that's bone on bone, it might only last them yep a month or it may not even work. But uh for the other ones like the the hands and all, it seems like it's certainly longer lasting than any sort of cortisone shot. But I think months are very reasonable and probably years for most people. Now, what about non- osteoarthritis like rheuma rheumatoid arthritis and things like that? Is there any reason to believe that this could help with sort of the debilitating injuries that those patients So, I've done three cases of rheumatoid arthritis and one guy that had a gouty arthritis as well because again, it's a systemic disease. I'm not going to pretend to be able to cure that with a local treatment, but to a single knuckle that's driving them nuts, it's still an an inflammatory process. And yes, it works great for that. So, I've done that. So if a patient has rheumatoid arthritis where they're really experiencing a lot of deformation in the hands, you you think you can help that that patient with with the local part of it which is it won't reduce the deformation necessarily because a lot of that is you know longstanding and if they but if they were treated early enough in the course of the disease I think it that there's no strong data to support that but I don't see why it wouldn't work personally and it definitely from a purely paliotative standpoint just to reduce pain it does work. You just have to you have to manage their expectations. What are some other examples of where this could be used in your at least in your experience so far in terms of reducing reliance on

[01:53:25] NSAIDs or opioids or other things like that? Uh tennis elbows become a big one doing several of those. Um and how much do you how far down the arm do you radiate? I would I I base it on where the patient when I if they palpate if they if they're getting pain down into the brachior radiialis and if it's if it's if it's sort of radiating further down I'll treat a larger field because again there's no reason not to. Bigger fields are better. No need to be and again it's just six gray or three gray three gray. So and again that's three gray locally and it's it's to an area where there's no vital organs nearby.

[01:53:56] The total body dose is negligible. It's like it's like getting a CAT scan initially for the rest of the body. So, I would treat definitely the joint capsule and a little bit of the distal humorous and the and the proximal uh radius and and whatever else. But if if it's hurting larger, I'll just treat a larger field. And in that case, we use opposed lateral beam. So, the patient will just lay there. The beam will come in from one side and rotate around from the other side and we treat them both because that way we get the same type of homogeneous dose we do with our cancer patients. But if it was if it was more dis if it was more like we I've actually done several piano players that have decor veins tennis in their wrist and because when you're stretching to play those notes all my music I'm a musician as well all my musician friends are coming to me and the and the uh the wrist pain is going away and actually again very quickly my biggest patient cohort so far are former patients because they don't have radophobia they're like I've been through 80 great of my prostate this is a joke and I'm bringing my wife with me and half the times the wives sit there for their daily treatment anyway way and they start chatting in the lobby. So, we do the wife's hand the same time we're doing the husband's prostate. And for the most part, the hands, the wrist, the elbows, it's very rapid. In the case of the tendonitis, like my Achilles, it was a couple of months, but that's not outside of the window of what we're we've been conditioned to expect from all the German studies. So, it can be not as immediate of a of a relief as a steroid shot, but it does seem to be more durable. Yeah. We failed to mention at the outset that that you're also a remarkable musician. Uh, I don't know about that. Um, how much do you still play the drums? Uh, I try to play with I got a couple of actually a couple of doctor buddies. We get together and jam every every week or two. And one of them is actually a guy now who's actually got his own YouTube channel and Spotify. And he was actually professional musician before becoming a cardiologist. So, we may actually start touring again. But back in the day, we had a full uh full doctor band, a full uh 70s rock cover band called

[01:55:44] Ultrasound. So, those are the good old days. We used to play, you know, Journey and Rush and and Led Zeppelin all day long. So, Yeah. I was commenting recently on a podcast how much I regret not seeing Rush during their last tour. Yeah. Yeah. Again, because of a GBM. Tie it back into what we're doing here. Neil

[01:56:03] Neil was a it was a genius. Uh so greatest drummer of all time. Are you going with Neil? Are you going with Bonham? Neither because after coming I went to went to college here at UT and that opened my world opened my entire eyes up to the world of jazz. And so the jazz drummers can all drum circles around those guys in terms of pure technical ability. But yeah, feel rhythm, not necessarily being able to to wow people the way the jazz guys can, but yeah, probably Neil and Bonum are both right up there on the rock. Would you put them at the top of the rock list? I would put Neil first. I'm just partial to Rush. And a lot of that has to do with their music. Not necessarily.

[01:56:41] Now Neil was obviously an innovator, but as a 16-year-old, I'm sitting there trying to imitate every single note on his his drum. solos of everything like that. So Neil number one but Bonham and uh I mean there's plenty and the the new generation rock guys are incredible. The guys that grew up with Neil as an inspiration now and you've got you know 12 year olds who can do this stuff in their sleep and then all these math metal bands. You got you know uh Dream

[01:57:06] Theater and you've got uh things like um animals as leaders. Some of these guys are doing things I I pride myself as a drummer on be able to analyze the music really well. It's getting to the point where it's almost more math than music. Like it's so intricate the modulation of the of the time signatures and things like that. It's it's actually getting beyond where even I'm having trouble understanding it now. But these days and can you appreciate it from an auditory perspective or is it is it is it does it get too technical where it's hard to appreciate and distinguish? That's a fine line because when you think about it, math music is just math with emotion added in and it gets to a point where some of it is not appreciable anymore.

[01:57:45] At least not to me. Some of these guys love it, but that's where the jazz side comes in where it's all about feel. But even the jazz guys will be extremely uh, you know, talented in terms of their ability to to feel the beat and have it be pleasurable to the ear, but they're doing such intricate things and you can when you can balance those two things out, that's that's heaven as far as I'm concerned. When you can when you can have the emotional side and also have be technically challenging and not just playing a straightforward, you know, the straightforward stuff is great, too, but it gets a little bit tedious sometimes.

[01:58:15] So, we met actually driving AMG Drift Academy, I think it was. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Which, by the way, not to crap all over it, but it was like I ended up doing it because at the last second, I got a phone call from my driving coach and he was like, "Hey, I'm doing this AMG driving school and they got an extra spot in the advanced drift school. Do you want to come?" Right. But I'd already been to, you know, the drift academy with my friend Josh Robinson. I was like, "Yeah, sure. I'll go." And I was like, "Boy, this is the last time I ever do one of these schools." Josh's school is 100 times doesn't compare. If you want to learn how to drift Yeah. If you want to learn how to drift, you go to the Texas Drift Academy. I'm going to go to Minnesota with him and do that ice class. Are you going on this on this run? I don't know if I'll be able to make it or not. I'm trying to. Yeah. Um, so anyway, we we met and uh but it was totally random, right? Like it was just

[01:59:02] Well, I knew who you were cuz I've been a member. I've been a follower for years. I was like, "That's Peter Tia over there." So, luckily we got paired up in the same group and that's kind of where it started. It was totally random. I was actually just It was a last minute thing. That was actually a level two. So

[01:59:14] I was like, you hadn't done the level one, right? So I was like, man, how did this guy get in here without even doing the level one? But and so having done that, I agree. Especially those cars with the automatic transmissions and the turbo lag, not the greatest for drifting. You've been kind of a car nerd your whole life. Um and and what is it about cars that that has you as excited as as you are? You know, I think whenever anybody asks me that, I kind of think about it in terms of every 3 or fouryear-old boy is enamored by cars, but normal people just grow out of it and some of us never do. My dad certainly liked cars. He taught me how to change my oil and whatnot, but he wasn't a fanatic like I am. So, it just kind of started there and then it got to the point where like, you know, my parents will tell you the story about how I like I was that four-year-old who could tell you a car driving by if it was an Oldmobile that had Cadillac hubcaps on it. Like, how the hell does this kid know this thing? But I don't know where it just kind of clicked and um over the years it was always just a nice nice release and I I guess being a mechanically oriented type person. I think if I didn't do medicine I would have done engineering which is why did you study in college? I was actually biology. I did a BA with art so I did a lot of jazz studies at UT. So I was a music guy. Engineering just seemed fascinating to me but I you know I was always interested in medicine from day one. But I think that it's really the mechanical side of things like knowing the every every car's five gear ratios and what their torque converter lockup is and what their horsepower and torque is. It's just, you know, and what posters of cars did you have on your wall? The same as everybody actually.

[02:00:40] No, cuz everyone had a Countach, right? I never had a Countach. See, I had a Countach. What did you have? I mean, they're cool. I would have like a Callaway Corvette, uh, Miami Vice Tessterosa, uh, 928, which I'm almost done with my old 928, getting it back on the road. Uh, you know, um, more the domestic stuff, the stuff that was more attainable. Fox body Mustangs, the 5 liter Mustangs of that era, really cool.

[02:01:04] C4 Corvettes, you know, back in that era when they were state-of-the-art. I mean, I loved watching Nightrider, so I thought Pontiac Firebirds were super cool. Um, you know, it's funny. I just bought my youngest his first Lamborghini poster. He's mostly got sports posters on his walls, which is great, but I was like, "You got to have like a

[02:01:24] Lamborghini poster, so let's go pick one out." So, we scrolled, you know, Etsy for hours, right? And cuz I wanted to figure out what his taste was, right? Did he want to go retro? Did he want like a Countach? But, um, in the end, I think we went with uh I can't even remember now, actually. We just ordered it. I think we went with an Urican.

[02:01:42] Orcon. Modern car. Great car. Oh, yeah. Ultimately, he was it was gonna be an Aventador or an Urchan. Um, but get the color right and get the angle right. Have you driven a Countach yet? I've never driven a Countach. Have you? It's I have. It's one of those don't meet your heroes kind of things, you know.

[02:01:57] It's It's cool, but it's kind of a POS, too. You know, it's it's there was just the bar has moved a long way since then. But even if you don't expect I mean, you clearly don't expect it to perform like a modern car, but but even if you judge it for what it was in the 80s. Would it is it still not enjoyable? It's enjoyable because of the 80s campiness in retrospect, but even compared to its contemporaries, you look at an 80s 928

[02:02:24] Porsche or even a Tessterosa, those cars are beautifully driving, you know, long distance cruisers, super comfortable, compliant suspensions, you got good ergonomics, and the Countach is so awesome because it has none of that. It's awesomely bad. Yeah. Yeah. I've driven a Tessterosa. Um, have you ever driven an F F40? I have not. Yeah. I would love to have ridden in one, but I haven't driven one.

[02:02:45] It's it's it's a race car, so it's, you know, you're basically just sitting on the ground with a carbon tub around you. So, if you could have three road cars, um, but you can't sell them. So, you can't, you know, you're not you're not making the decision based on economics. Um, okay. What What are the three you want? Three road cars, not daily drivers. Are we are we talking about just three cars? That's all you can have in your garage. No, no, no. These are fun. These are your these are your three grail cars. Okay. I would probably say, man, there's too many to choose from, but probably you have to go with it's going to sound like a cliche, but

[02:03:20] McLaren F1. I mean, how do you not pick that? I I if I could only have one, that's the one I want. I sent you the picture of me sitting in that one. Yeah, I was jealous. I was jealous. Oh my god. Um, that would have be number one. But then, God, there's there's at least 10 that I could pick from be happy. But I would probably say uh and one of them is one that I have a lot of experience with, which is the

[02:03:42] Ford GT. I just think that's the gen one. One of the all-time greats. And I would probably pick stuff that's manual and somewhat analog. So, I'd probably have to say Carrera GT, Porsche Carrera GT with an NAV10. And uh they're they're unobtanium now, but they're they were reasonable just a few years ago. And they're just again, you just don't get there's plenty of faster cars. A Carrera GT today is going for about 1718. Mhm. 10 years ago it was half that. Yep. Um and what's an F40 going for today? It's got to be three, I think, at least. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, six, seven years ago it was half that.

[02:04:19] Yeah, it was half that. It totally was. Do Do you think this is a bubble or do you think these things are not coming down in value? They're never making any more of those. Limited supply. Demand is never going to Wayne for those at least. I think when you look at other collector cars like some of the pre-war stuff it's going down because the the target market is all unfortunately dying off. They're just those people aren't around and who appreciate that. But uh and that may happen at some point. I suppose there going to be a point where nobody cares about this. We'll probably be long gone by the way. But the McLaren F1 is unattainable. Oh, that's I mean and there's so few of them. Yeah, that's in a completely different league than the other cars. But even like something a

[02:04:53] Ford GT, they made 4,000 of them. It's not that rare. But a few of them are gone. A lot of them are gone thanks to yeah lack of traction control. Uh but still I don't think they'll ever go down just because that era I think the Gen two the current Ford GT which is a twin turbo automatic car will ultimately be eclipsed in value by the old one. Even though right now there's still more.

[02:05:13] Yeah, they're almost double or triple but I think it's going to go the other way. So where would where would you put the 959 on this list? We talked about that a little bit. It's right up there. The only downside to the 959 is that it was so ahead of its time. That essentially is what a modern Porsche is now. So, yeah, it's super cool. You got the 80s campiness and the looks, but it's basically like driving a 993 turbo for the most part. It doesn't have that

[02:05:38] NAV8 or V10 sound. It's a It's a turbocharged flat 6 like everything was after it. At that at time, there was nothing like it. Didn't it have four-wheel steering as well? I You know what? I think they did. Yeah. like it it was so modern. So modern. Uh sequential turbos and even water cooled heads. Those were all air cooled Porsches back then. They managed to water cool the heads. Um and now Kenipa does a really cool version, the restood version, but those never came to the US. I think you know about that, right? It was the Bill

[02:06:07] Gates rule. Did you hear about that? Wait, I did know about this. Say more. Say more. I don't know all the details. I should have read it. But essentially, he was able to get the gray market passage for these cars for some loophole. I don't know the details of it now and only after that were they able to import them into the US and so of course now that they're older you can get anything under a 25y old rule. I like the oddball stuff like that that's just unavailable. But the 959 I would still put a click below the Carrera GT just because of that naturally aspirated

[02:06:35] F1 drive V10 that just sings and the 959's motor is not as doesn't have that level of character. I'll tell you what's interesting about the Carrera GT which by the way would be on my list of three um as well. Um, most people listening to us now, if they're not car nerds, wouldn't spot a Carrera GT if it ran over their toes.

[02:06:57] Yeah. That that's that's like a bigger Boxster, right? It's just like some They're like, "What? What is is that a Porsche? What is that car?" Like, that doesn't even look like It doesn't stand out at all. Whereas, if you saw a McLaren F1, you don't need to know anything about a car to know you saw something special. For sure. For sure.

[02:07:14] Um, it's And I think the same is true with the GT. The GT is absolute head turner right no matter what. And the interesting thing there is it's really based on a 60s design. It was a tribute but Camilo Partarda who was the the designer for Ford who basically reinterpreted it for the 21st century kept that original character but made it aerofriendly and did you know was able to use all these hard points from the old car but make it modern and basically upsize the car. or it's like 110% size of the original that you could actually fit two people in because the original GT40s were tiny and they apparently generated tremendous front end lift in Lemon. So the and the modern one I've actually run at the Texas Mile and on an airirst strip over 200 mph.

[02:07:58] It's it's dead straight. It's I mean it's they did everything right without resorting to the modern cars with all the big wings and all the big downforce. It's just well balanced. It is a they just did everything right on that car. Um, okay. Now, of the modern cars, okay, anything that you really, really fancy kind of 200. Okay, let's go. Let's define that first wave of hypercars in the 2015. So, when the Laaf Ferrari, the

[02:08:27] P1, um, and the 918 came out, which is 2014, 2015, so 10 years ago. They call it the holy trinity for some reason. Yeah. So, yeah. I mean, golly, that was staggering. Right. First, yeah. So from that era forward, right, what do you fancy the most? The most, you know, those cars again, at that time I liked them more than I do now, just because again, the hybrid technology is leaving those kind of they're a little outdated now. I think out of those three, I was personally, maybe I'm sounding like a

[02:08:57] Porsche fanboy, but the 918 was just stunning. Part of it was just the design. Forget about the performance. And it had an again NAV8 high revving bespoke to that car, not in any other platform. and the electric component was just sort of a that was the g- whiz thing of the moment which of course made it un ungodly fast but that NAV8 and the way the exhaust sticks out of the back.

[02:09:18] Well, that's why by the way if you you know I've I've I've got a friend who has allin silver 959 Carrera GT 918. That's the trinity right there. Like that's a trinity. That's like having, you know, F40, F50, Enzo, Laaf Ferrari, same sort of thing. Um, I mean all of those cars were amazing, but since then it's gotten and that was probably the the the interesting thing about that era a decade ago was that was probably the inflection point after which performance doesn't matter anymore. Who cares? We've saturated performance. Who cares? You can buy a you're traction limited at this point, right? And not only that, you can buy a used EV. You can buy a

[02:09:56] Tesla Plaid that'll do 60 in 2 seconds flat. That'll for grand that'll smoke everything. So, it's all about the Tell everybody about the time you took your Tesla Plaid to Kota. Uh before how long did it take you to smoke the brakes on that? Um so I when it was stock one stop incredible. Make sure people understand this cuz they don't know. So that means you came out of pit lane. Right. Right.

[02:10:20] So you're going up to turn one. I did an outlap. So I didn't outlap. So but but the first Yeah. Coming down. So the first hard break is going into turn one. Going to turn one. And my buddy was in an SF90, which is a 1000 horsepower Ferrari hybrid, which is basically the fastest Ferrari you could ever buy. And

[02:10:37] I was I found I was kind of catching up with him in turn in 20 and coming down the front straight. I caught an SF90 in my daily driver, but I nearly rear ended him because the car was able to stop just barely for turn one, but the brake fluid boiled at that point. The car was not designed to do that, unfortunately.

[02:10:56] And what's interesting thing is it's not you would say okay it's an electric car it's heavy blah blah blah other electric cars don't do that the Lucid the Tyan they actually have really good brakes but I at the time I didn't realize this because they had been advertising as being track ready or at least able to run a like they were talking about how it ran so good at the Nurburg Ring but the factory brake fluid is DOT3 I find out after the fact which is low boiling point just boiled it the car is designed for uh uh efficiency low drag by I didn't even use DOT 3 in my simulator I was running DOT 4 in the sim probably boiler simulator. So, a 5,000lb machine stopping from 100 and I probably did 160 on the front straight more. Yeah. Well, it's about I think it was limited actually that time. It didn't have a track mode. That the amount of BTUs that you're trying to shed off of those brakes, it was just forget about it. So, thankfully it had So, the brakes are fine if you put better fluid in. Well, they're better. They're less terrible.

[02:11:47] So, but if you want to track a plaid, you're going to need new brakes. So, I don't Did I tell you what I did? I ended up having a full Willwood setup put on the car. So, all new rotors, custom ducting. Mike Doul, Doul Designs, actually he he bought a plat for himself. He's built he's the guy that built the Z06 I'm driving now, but he ducted into the front brakes. Uh, basically custom custom brake ducks cuz that car is sealed. The whole front end is sealed off. It's not meant for that.

[02:12:11] It's meant to just be low. So, you weren't getting any air on them? Nothing. Nothing at all. So, he actually made custom ducting. And after that, the car was unbelievable because you could actually late break and and do really well. What lap time can you do in a in a tripped plaid? Now, a tripped plaid will only do one. Here's the problem. You can only get one solid lap before it starts pulling power due to heat to the battery. But my best was a 224.

[02:12:34] And so that's at a 50 5,000lb car. That's no weight taken out. Just a stock car. Didn't do any mods to it other than just the brakes. But you do one lap and and and the uh so just to re answer your previous question, I don't know how much time we have, but I'll just I'll keep it brief. That one stop turn one brakes gone. Thank god I have regen. So I just literally nursed it. But I was already I couldn't turn off. So I go through the

[02:12:57] S's and I'm just, you know, 30 miles an hour, whatever. I got down through the regen is enough to keep the car from from completely just going off the track. So 30, 40, 50. So coming through 910 coming into 11. Again, I'm not on the throttle at all. I'm just maybe going 40 miles an hour. But the regen has slowed coming down the hill towards 11. The regen has kept me from gaining any more speed, but my my my right foot is on the floor like it's the fluid is boiled. So, I had to go wide in 11 into the gravel completely around. And then, you know, that that's when I found out about all that and the McLaren Senna both um taught me where all those orange squares are spray painted on the arm code where you can have the emergency offs. So, I literally went through the gravel, came within inches of the arm code 11, and then just hobbled in. But then after that, the next time out, we put DOT four or put uh Castro brake fluid in it and changed the pads. Then it was good for maybe a lap. So then ultimately that still wasn't good enough. So we did the big brakes that

[02:13:53] Now I see guys out there with Teslas. They're clearly not pushing as hard as you or they're mostly Model 3s. The Model 3 is 800 lb lighter. It's not as fast, but it's a way better track car. So I've I've got dozens of laps in Model 3s. They do fine cuz they're not making a,000 horsepower and they don't weigh 5,000 lb. They still will boil their brakes, but if you just do pads and fluid, that's actually a very desirable, especially if it's a little bit damp outside, not much can keep up with you in a Model 3. And autocrosses, they've won national championships with just coilovers and in a 4,000lb sedan. That's where EVs have gotten. But just to answer the previous question, we did the brakes on the on the Model S. And then once that was done, the only thing uh that that li that eliminated the brakes as this as the weak link, but the battery, the cooling is still not there.

[02:14:37] So, you got guys spending tons of money. I actually was looking at doing a really heavily modified arrow Tesla Model 3 like Randy Popes drives. It'll only do a lap at at KOD because of again it's such a high high speed and high braking, but it will literally just you can you can hot pit and go right back out and you can keep hot pitting, but you'll never get lap time, but it'll do just fine if you do that. But the nextG cars, the

[02:14:59] Porsche Tyan, the even the Lucid Sapphire now, those cars can they're just as heavy, just as powerful. Have you taken the Tyan Turbo S out? I did when it first came out in 2020. And what will that lap at? Uh, that was at the time I was on stock tires and everything. Probably a 230ish right right around there. Much I mean it 7 I think I probably sent you that video. Um, at John Hennessy's track, I had the Tyan, the Lucid, and the Plaid all lined up on the drag strip. I'm in a 750 horsepower Porsche that can run tens in the quarter mile.

[02:15:33] And the Plaid and the Lucid walked away from me like I was on foot. You just didn't have the traction control. No, it didn't have the power. 750 750 horsepower versus 1100. What? How much does the Lucid have? The Lucid has 11. This was the old Lucid. Now the new Sapphire Lucid has more. It has 1,200.

[02:15:49] But this was,00. And it's still a tenth or two behind the 1000 horsepower because they all have great traction. They all have and they're all all-wheel drive. The traction is is a is a non-issue. All the same tire. It's literally just powered to weight at that point off. So I didn't realize that. So the Tyan Turbo S was only 750. When you when you stand on a on a Turbo S, if there's a Plaid next to you, he will leave you like you're not moving. And you're in a and that's like the Audi is a super fast car in the real world, but that's why horsepower doesn't matter anymore. But that was more horsepower limited. The TYAN would happily do and actually I had a Turbo before the Turbo

[02:16:20] S, which had steel brakes. Turbo S had ceramics. And even the Turbo would do it on allseason tires. The very first Tyan that came out, this was in the early days when Porsche was VW was having to respond to dieselgate. you remember diesel gate, that whole deal. So, they had to build these electric cars and they had to go to um uh states that were carb, basically the California Air

[02:16:41] Research Board emissions compliant because of all the diesel penalties they had. So, the first cars didn't come to Texas. They only went to New York. So, I got a a non-turbo S, a regular Tyan, allseason tires out of New York and on steel brakes. Porsche is Porsche. It just it I mean it was squealing in the corners with an allseason tire, but it lapped 20 minutes, no problem. brakes were solid. There's just something about the German engineering there. But having said that, the Lucid is now equally good, if not better, despite being a brand new non-leacy company who's again not they're not trying to build a track car, but the the Lucid Sapphire is faster than a Plaid now. It runs eights in the quarter mile, but it can actually track. And even my old Lucid, which I was expecting to it can run eights in a quarter mile 90s. Yeah, it can crack in and sub nine now. So, it's it's several car lengths ahead of a plaid, which is beyond bonkers. I mean, it's just it you have to warn passengers. You these are these cars now. You can't just accelerate them. You have to say, "Hey, hang on. Just put your head against the headrest before uh I concuss you."

[02:17:43] By the way, we failed you you very very briefly mentioned it, but my favorite car post that the holy trinity of 2014 is of course the McLaren Senna. The Senna. Um. Yep. Where does how how does the Senna stack up for you? And what was your fastest lap time in a Senna? So, my best again the biggest limitation of the tires the non GTR the Senna GTR can probably I've seen guys run like I think two flats in those things. A couple I know a coach of mine had run a 208 just barely even trying. But the street Senna on the Tropho R just it under steers.

[02:18:16] It's really just not meant for that. But it'll still and it got tons of downforce, tons of braking, but it just doesn't have the grip. So, I think the best idea was a 215. And again, when you're driving car that value, that's insane for a street car with street tires. That's insane. But the but at the same time, I'm sure a pro could do better. I was still thinking, you know, that Armco gets really close to a car of this value. It could be really breaking into turn 12. I wasn't breaking actually 150 even on Tropha RS really. And then I f, you know, McLaren doesn't want you to put slicks on it. And so I violated all the rules and I ended up putting a set of Pirelli tires off the Ferrari

[02:18:50] Challenge cars on it. When I first put it again, slicks need camber. Y you can't get much camber out of a street center, which to me was the most disappointing thing. Whereas the GTR, you got four degrees. But anyway, even without camber, when I first stopped on that backstraight, completely stock center with just slicks on it at the 150 mark, I almost parked it in the corner.

[02:19:09] It was incredible. Even with the Trofeo R to stop at 150 in a car that in a tire that drove me to Houston and back. The bandwidth of today's tires, that's a whole another topic. It's incredible what even an on allseason Michelin has can generate 1G. 1G is nothing anymore. All my old car and drivers I have a library of thousands of magazines. 08.9 was a huge deal 30 years ago. Now you got minivans that do that. And even allseason shod sports cars that are heavy can do that on a on a regular tire. The chemistry of these tires these days is unbelievable. Yeah. And the pro

[02:19:43] Mazda we're 2.3 2. Yeah. Right. Yeah, I mean that's just and that's not even on a Pirelli. That's like I'm I'm a cheap guy so I run uh I run hard AMG GT3 I was running handcooks which would at least last me like two weekends and even then like that car was running 211s on handcooks with just me driving it. So the pros are running faster than that. Yeah, I think

[02:20:06] I think Senna GTR not a street car of course but just the the problem with the Senna street car is it's too track for the street and it's too street for the track. It's just like a 720S which is mechanically identical without all the downforce is a beautiful GT car. Drive it cross country. You can store stuff in it. Super comfortable. And on on Hooers, not on Slicks, but on Hooers and and I changed that to steel brakes. That's a 216 217 car. It's not It's not that much slower. So faster than like the your old um um GT4.

[02:20:40] Yes. Yeah. the the McLaren GT4. Yeah, that one I I'm sure I think Randy Popes could probably run close to that. But when driver to driver, driver to driver, three seconds probably. And that's all in the straights because the the GT4 car has half not half the power, but it has and actually my GT4 I I I actually cheated. I uh tuned it. Okay. So, because the those the 570S GT4 was was already d-tuned from the street car, but you can you can tune the street cars as well. So, when I was I pushed an extra 150 wheel just by tuning it cuz stock turbos can handle that. And uh so that would go 175 on the back straight whereas a regular GT4 can do 20 miles an hour or less than that. But even then the 720S and the actually the 720S and

[02:21:21] Senna are identical on the back straight. The Senna can stop later though. Stop later. Yeah. The Senna you can stomp on you can wait till 100. Yeah. Probably 100. But in the in the 720 with the aftermarket steel brakes pads and a Hooser not even a real not even which is still a DOT tire. You could still break it a little bit after 200. It's not bad at all for a car that you can go shopping at the outlet malls in because it's got a massive frunk and and the ride compliance. That's the biggest thing about McLaren's. So, the

[02:21:49] Senna is more tied down, but they all have that active suspension that doesn't use sway bars or springs. It's all hydraulic. It's all fully active. There's hydraulic lines that diagonally connect the front right to the left rear wheel. So, the pressure in those lines kind combats body roll. So, you can have it be a plush highway ride or you can have it be a a stiff track car. the bandwidth is almost unobtainable in any other any other car. Do do you think in the in the in the sort of maybe in the public eye, I mean, do you think McLaren is somehow underperforming relative to what they should be doing given both their quality as an automotive brand and as a as a racing brand? Underperforming in terms of sales, is that what you're talking about primarily? They are. Yeah, they they truly are. And a big problem is I think is the is the perceived and actually it's not just perceived the actual lack of reliability. I love the cars but they're always there's it's all the jokes about British British electronics. They all come to bear. Even the Senna would go into limp mode on between nine and 10 if you Florida. We even we had it wasn't just mine. We had

[02:22:49] Senna Fest going on with 20 I think we had 20 on track at one time. Almost every So some guys were just kind of tooling around so they were fine. But if you were hauling ass between 9 and 10 when you get a little bit of suspension droop Yep. We go into limp mode if you're if you're accelerating through that. I would literally even a GTR. No.

[02:23:05] No. Streets. I'm sure the GTR is fine. I haven't tracked one of those unfortunately, but uh over a GTR. And is that a mode issue? No. Uh no. Like if you were in track mode, that was in track mode. I think it happened to me. Even one time I forgot to put it in track mode. I think it still did it. It was It's a GeForce related to um suspension droop issue.

[02:23:25] They just freaked out the computer. And they had a they had McLaren guys on site who were actually working on patches and they could patch it. They did and I think it made it less frequent, but I think it still happened after the patch. I have to ask the McLaren guys about that. I think it's safe to say nobody's listening to us anymore now. Anyway, but in case anybody still is, um, this has been an awesome discussion. I really appreciate the uh the offer to come out here. This is a true privilege, Peter. what you have done in this community is unparalleled in terms of like I think I told you when I first met you I was like dude how do I get CME for this stuff your lectures are better than almost all not lectures but your podcasts are better than almost all the CMEs because you get the right quality people on here much better than me by far and you get people and and the way you phrase the questions and the way you you kind of parse everything it's so understandable for a wide bandwidth I got you know my non-medical friends and family all the way to the colleies everybody gets something out of them and that's that's hard to do. Well, hopefully today we delivered a lot of insight both to people who are obviously interested in radiation therapy for cancer which unfortunately is is going to be a lot of people uh and then of course this other application around the treatment of inflammatory conditions which again inflammation lies at the root of so many other things, right? Um and just in case anybody cares about a little drumming in cars, they'll got something too. We got to meet I think we have a whole uh indication for a whole separate series here that truly is the drive that we can do that. All right. Well, thank you.

[02:24:54] Awesome. Thank you, Peter. [Music]
