[00:00:01] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia this podcast my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness full stop and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level at the end of this episode i'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to peteratiamd.com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode [Music] my guest this week is dr ezra raza dr raza is a professor of medicine and the director of the mds center at columbia university in new york she is a practicing oncologist and a cancer researcher who has been published in over 300 peer review manuscripts she grew up and attended medical school in pakistan before moving to the united states for her clinical training which we discuss briefly she's an expert in myelodysplastic syndrome which is a form of pre-leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia aml she's a recipient of a number of awards including the 2012 hope award in cancer research which she shared with nobel laureate dr elizabeth blackburn dr raza is an outspoken advocate for completely reconfiguring the current model of research in cancer and the purpose of this discussion is really to dive into her beautiful book the first cell which really is a completely critical look at how medical research is using the wrong types of models my words not hers the roi on spending is completely out of line with what anybody would consider reasonable if they were to consider it from an objective lens and frankly we we end with what i think is a very thoughtful discussion around what the way forward looks like because you could easily get through this i always love to speak with a person a little bit before and a little bit after and at the end she said you know gosh i really i hope we didn't get too much onto a down note and i said no i don't think we did i think that there's enough sort of hype around cancer research that it's okay to lift the sheets a little bit and show this side of things a couple things i'd say about this episode first of all azra goes out of her way both in the book and if you hear her on other interviews to say look this is not someone who considers herself a writer this is a person who considers herself both a physician and a scientist and in many ways sort of wrote this book because she just really needed to talk about this stuff to which i would say one it's very beautifully written but two i was blown away at the literary sprinklings that made their way into this i mean and you have to remember we're doing this by zoom basically or a comparable platform so we can look at each other on video and just as sure as i'm looking at another person across from the table you know i would ask her a question and she would respond by quoting emily dickinson and not just quote it like i've memorized this but quote it in the most lyrical way so i think if you're a fan of literature science you have an interest in oncology there are a lot of things you'll get out of this episode so i'll leave it at that and i hope that you do enjoy my conversation with dr ezra [Music] ezra thank you so much for not just making time to be here today but as you told me before we started setting aside a lot of time it's an honor to sit with you i've known a little bit about you before your book was published because one of my colleagues knew about you and said hey this is an amazing woman who's in the process of writing an amazing book and you're definitely going to want to not only read it but more importantly i think speak with her and be able to interview her and talk more broadly about this subject matter and it's hard to believe that that was probably a year ago if not more you're an oncologist by training and i've seen a couple of your short interviews though i've gone out of my way to not listen to you on previous podcasts who is not color how i want to talk with you but the two times i've seen you on very short clips on youtube you've made it very clear that you are not a writer which i find ironic given how well you write so at what point did you decide that a book was an appropriate tool to communicate the amazing ideas that we're going to spend a lot of time getting into thank you peter for having me on your podcast i have been an admirer of your work and of the kind of wellness philosophy that you propose you belong to you practice you propagate you promote i love it all and the number of things you do is very admirable so it's really a pleasure to be on your podcast i have to tell you that dorothy parker once said that if one of your friends come to you and they say they want to write a book the second biggest favor you can do them is give them a copy of the elements of style by strunk and white and of course the first paper is kill them immediately [Laughter] so i knew all along that i'm never going to write a book because i'm going to i'm a big admirer of dorothy parker and then what happened peter is that one of my dear friends in new york who happens to be a literary agent john brockman and his wife katinka would often talk to me and say ezra how about writing a book and i would say no i'm not a writer and they would say well you're haranguing us with the same things for 10 years all that is wrong you want to do something you want to change the field write a book i will get it published and i would keep saying no until i had of course as an oncologist number one after 30 years of being in the field i had a little bit to say but then the second thing is that i'm also being a basic science researcher i've had a very active lab all along and my third credential is that i'm a cancer widow so i have experienced oncology from all three perspectives as an oncologist who sees 30 to 40 patients a week for the last 30 plus years as a basic researcher who's had a well-funded lab for 35 years and as someone who stood on both sides of the bed at the same time of a cancer patient who was the love of my life so even these credentials peter were not sufficient to motivate me to write the book what did it was my daughter shahzad's best friend since 15 years of age not her boyfriend her best friend who is gay andrew at 22 years of age finds the field's weakness in his arm and taken to the emergency room his quadriplegic within hours and he's found to have a nine centimeter large brain tumor which was unresectable and pathology showed that it is one of the most malignant tumors ever known to mankind glioblastoma multiforming when this boy opened his eyes and he stole his diagnosis the first thing he told his mother peter was mom don't worry just call ezra she's on the cutting edge she will cure me so here i am it slapped me in the face physically that on the one hand the ferociousness and violence of his tumor and on the other hand the utter helplessness of all of us his oncologist to do anything about it our complete failure in front of andrew how is it possible that we are so spectacular failing a 22 year old boy that's what forced me to write the book someone once said and i'm sure it's been paraphrased and so i won't attribute it because i don't know where it came from but the only reason to write a book is if you absolutely can't not write it and it sounds like that's sort of where you were after all of the things that you've described which is not only losing harvey which i think he died in 2002 is that correct and then the story about andrew who obviously was about 60 70 years too young to die from anything let alone a gbm which is a tumor i've certainly spoken about on this podcast before and i think we'll talk a little bit more about it also the other things we're going to talk about which are the sort of the structural failings of the system that you felt were if i were going to sort of try to describe your book a big part of it is the return on investment has been very poor that's sort of one way to summarize it there are many ways to sort of summarize it but an overarching theme has been it hasn't been that we haven't spent a lot of money it hasn't been that we haven't made some progress it hasn't been for a lack of trying but by any objective metric that we would apply to any standard of anything else the return on that investment has been so paltry that if we are not smart enough to at least consider doing something totally different we're completely deluded and again i think that's one tiny piece of it and that's probably that burning piece that i think your agent was ultimately saying this is either going to erode a hole through your the gastric lining of your stomach or you better put it on paper yes i agree so let's start with oncology what drove you to oncology why did you choose to become an oncologist in an era when women could have chosen far less demanding fields in medicine not that any field in medicine is more or less demanding but oncology is about as demanding as it gets what was the thinking for you that's an astute observation actually because when i was going into oncology it was the least popular field in fact most people when i said i'm going into oncology thought okay she couldn't get into any other fellowship that's why because only indians and pakistanis go into oncology who else would in their right minds would want to go except for me it was a deliberate choice so peter i was born and raised in pakistan but since i was a little girl since as far back as four years old that is my first memory i was very interested in the natural world around me i would be at four years i'd be following ants around and imagining all kinds of things and started reading about science for as far back as i remember really and as i was growing up i got more and more interested in different fields embryology at one point became an obsession by the time i was 16 i had read all about evolution and evolutionary biology i had become a big darwinian fan everything i was looking at was through the prism of evolution for a long time but then had i grown up in a country where choices were available to me i'm confident that i would have gone into molecular biology as a pure science or some of the one of to study one of the natural things like marine biology maybe or probably murmicology ants but in pakistan where i grew up there was no possibility of entering science except through medicine so very cleverly i thought i'm going to go join medical school as soon as i complete i will proceed to the west and there i will start my phd in real scientific training but the problem that happened with me was in third year of medical school when i saw my first patient one look was all it took and i realized from that moment on that all of my life would be devoted to somehow use the best that science has to offer to reduce human suffering and i have stuck to that the second thing that happened was so i knew that i will do research in science but it would be therapy driven and the patient would be front and center for me always second thing that happened was that i was in karachi pakistan karachi is the largest city in the country and people who get sick around karachi in the suburban areas have no access really to medical care it's a very impoverished third world country with a very overcrowded city where i grew up so cancer patients when they came peter they would travel long distances on their donkey carts and on foot by the time they came they would have hugely advanced tumors that i've never seen since even in pakistan we don't see them now but back then in the early 70s the kind of end stage malignancies sprouting through breasts or like huge lumps just breaking out of people's heads and arms and sarcomas that i saw so it was the malevolence of the tumor the violence of the disease on the one hand on the other hand the intellectual challenge of trying to figure out how this whole thing began in a single cell and how that cell goes rogue what journeys has it undertaken to reach this level of malignancy so it was the dual emotional as well as intellectual grip that basically caught me and at a young age and i'm confident that if i'm given 70 more lives i will do exactly the same thing 70 more times do you still remember that first patient you saw as a third year medical student do you remember what anything about them what condition they had anything about them the way they looked actually thank you for asking absolutely the patient was a young woman with acute myeloid leukemia and she was very strange because she presented with a very large spleen as well so we knew that she must have had a prior myeloproliferative milo dysplastic some sort of a precursor that led up to the acute leukemia so right there and then i started having discussions with my teachers that how much easier it would be to study a liquid tumor because cells are already in suspension and you can go in and sample them so many times instead of trying to study a solid tumor which is a mass that you can only remove once next time it appears it wouldn't even be the same tumor and you don't have the luxury of accessing the tumor before during and after treatment so that patient is etched on my brain as if it was yesterday's breakfast yeah i find that phenomenon to be interesting amongst many physicians both oncologists and not oncologists steve rosenberg who is my mentor talks often about a patient that changed the course of his life when he was early in his residency a patient that had metastatic gastric cancer to the liver five years earlier was basically sent home to die shows up in the er to have his gallbladder taken out should have been dead five years less six months earlier he's completely free of tumor which ultimately after double triple quadruple checking led steve to conclude the only way this is possible this is back in 1968 is if his immune system eradicated that cancer and steve became one of the people who has pursued that two incredible ends and though i've done nothing special i still remember the first patient i saw in the hospital and so though it wouldn't become the catalyst for anything particularly unique we send first-year medical students on day one into clinic they can't do anything they are literally there to just watch and try not to get in the way but i selected oncology and i went to the medical oncology clinic and i remember that very first patient on that very first day and i still remember strange details like what the color was of the clothing of different people in the room that day he had stage four colorectal cancer it was my probably one of the first times i'd ever seen a ct scan and certainly seen it with such a clinical emphasis on okay look these are now tumors that have spread to both sides of his liver the primary tumor was here you can see all of these places i would go on to become very close friends with that patient who ultimately died two years later his widow would come to my medical school graduation two years after that so yeah there is something really special about medical education and it can totally derail the best laid plans of becoming the world's expert on ants yes and by the way i do teach a course that is foundation of clinical medicine where first-year medical students at columbia university are exposed to me in clinic and i'm mindful of this experience what are how is this going to change the rest of their lives the experience has to be somehow we can't take away the pain it's like emily dickinson said tell all the truth but tell it slant success in circuit lies too bright for our infirm delight the truth superb surprise as lightning to the children eased with explanation kind the truth must dazzle gradually or every man be blind so i'm very mindful of that when first year students come to me you're the only person who's going to not just quote emily in the midst of discussion but do so eloquently and to think that there was any doubt you were a writer is only comical to me but we'll come back to that so when you finished medical school not only did you realize you wanted to be a clinician but i think the hook of oncology was already well into you yes absolutely now let's pivot for a moment to allow you to explain to the listener what the state of oncology looked like at that time specifically when you consider what it meant to have metastatic cancer and let's for a moment pause it that we're going to talk about solid organ tumors separately from liquid tumors if a woman had breast cancer and either at presentation or later it had spread to her lungs to her brain to her bones if a man had prostate cancer that had spread to his bones if a person had colon cancer that had spread to their liver what was the prognosis and how long would they be expected to survive i think to start with peter the important thing is that when i started in oncology it was almost a stigma to have cancer the kind of causes of cancer we were taught were basically either there's a genetic or hereditary component where you have a predisposition for high risk of some sorts of cancers or is it some environmental exposure some kind of toxins that you've been facing or pathogens pathogens were considered a very exciting new avenue for research at the time that maybe it's a viral disease of some sort especially retroviruses and clearly there was already a very strong component of association with things like smoking so while there were these kinds of positive factors for cancer most people who presented already had rather advanced diseases and very little screening measures were being performed at the time so they would come with in pakistan especially with the kind of textbook pictures of fungating masses coming breaking through breasts and women or men suddenly showing up within with complete urinary blockage unable to to urinate and we would have to do emergency kind of thing it was just it would be quite devastating and of course there were people who women who felt a lump and came in and so i remember how many times i was assisting in mastectomies and considered for a long time to go into surgical oncology because that seemed to be the cleanest treatment at the time cut it out you don't have to start chasing the last cancer cell with these poisonous things we were giving even radiation was quite primitive at the time and quite terrible to patients so it was all in all it was a stigma to begin with people didn't want to talk about it many people hid it the tumors from themselves even would delude themselves into thinking that this is some kind of an infection it will go away so most people presented with advanced cancers the problem that i see though before i end this answer is that today in 2020 if you want to measure the success of treatment in cancer then the thing you need to look at peter is what is the age adjusted mortality of cancer today in 2020 you know what it is it is the same as it was in 1930. so that's interesting i usually make this statement it's the same as 1970. i didn't realize it was still the same as now you go back even further i usually just make the point that in 50 years it hasn't changed you're saying in 90 years it hasn't changed yes i'm saying that because the 30 percent or 27 decline in mortality we are seeing in the last 30 years is following a 30 years increase in mortality from in cancer you see what happened was that with all the smoking anyone who watches mad men is shocked to see it like my daughter saw it and she was mommy is that what people used to be like everywhere they were just smoking everybody was smoking this led to such an increase in the incidence of cancer so that the decline in mortality basically parallels the decline in smoking that is all that has happened otherwise we are really at square one and that is the embarrassment that nobody wants to recognize in fact somebody asked me the other day what exactly is your point in saying i said look niches thus speak zaratustra opens with this man running around with a lamp at noon in the middle of the market saying i'm looking for god for me it's like i'm running around looking for an adult in the room yeah so let's explain to people let's explain some of the nuance here because most people are confused by what an extension in disease-free survival means not that the average person knows what the difference is between a pr and a cr but you and i both know this world well because we've been on the inside of how these clinical trials are run so we understand that hey this drug got approved because x number of people met the criteria for a pr which has a kind of a funky arbitrary definition if you're going to be brutally honest of what a partial response is defined as a complete response is a little easier to define but then we don't talk about what durability means in all of these things so i could give an entire soliloquy and lecture on this but i'd much rather listen to you do it eloquently because the chance that you're going to quote more poetry is reasonably high so can you explain for folks what it means to have a partial response a complete response and the reason i think it's important to do this even though it sounds a little dry you're saying things that seem completely at odds with what the propaganda machine is saying now i know you're right because i know how the sausage is made i've been inside the belly of the sausage i understand how to read the literature that is actually asking a lot for someone who maybe just wants to better understand oncology but they haven't had the luxury of training in oncology or even more importantly i think doing research in oncology so can you go through some of the fundamentals of what these semantics are that are used how these terms get thrown around and how ultimately it can lead to some statements like the one you just made frankly which is as extreme as extreme could be with respect to saying hey look in 90 years we really haven't gotten better at extending life in people with cancer once they have cancer so let's unpack some of these definitions a bit i think that's a good place to start so let me begin by a little bit of just history because before we get into nuances why not just talk about the very gross facts cancer is a very bad disease everybody knows it the only good news you can give to a cancer patient is that oh we caught it early so we can get rid of it so we know that cancer itself may not kill it's the delay in treatment that really kills so the earlier we pick it up the better how have we treated cancer which has been found even in mummies so we know cancer has existed all along but the incidence probably it is a disease of modernity associated with many many of our lifestyle changes from hunter-gatherer society to modern humans nonetheless cancer was identified in mummies and has been there all along in human history how have we treated it well the first treatment of cancer even though it wasn't even called cancer then was in 500 bc when the persian queen a tosser had felt a lump in her breast she tried to hide it by covering it with sheets and things and eventually asked her greek slave who took out his sword and simply slashed off her breast she survived it she was the wife of darius and she survives it and this is the first known surgery we were slashing women's breasts in 500 bc what is the primary treatment for breast cancer today same slash and we typically give halstead credit for that so this is my point that for 2500 years what has exactly changed slightly better scalables and giving anesthesia while doing it okay yes then second is that when you couldn't so whatever cancer was detected early enough as a solid tumor was cut out and the liquid tumors you couldn't cut out so you needed to poison them somehow now how do you poison these things there is really nothing could be done about it until in the first world war of course it wasn't called the first world war because we didn't know there's going to be a second so it was called the great war part of development of weapons against each other was use of chemicals and so when these vats of chemicals were sitting around that were dropped on humanity people noted that one of the side effects that people died from was low blood counts so goodman and gilman two pharmacologists sitting around in yale decided that this could be used to treat cancer then these chemicals so do you know the first three chemical weapons that were used to treat cancer cytotoxin chlorambusyl and melphalan we still use at least two of those i gave all three with my own hands to my own husband harvey so we are slashing we are poisoning the same way and then burning with radiation therapy the same way so i wanted the audience to understand the kind of dramatic statements or melodramatic statements that i'm making are not baseless people just have to stop deluding themselves open their eyes and see what is in front of them so to just finish this part with a quotation of statistics in this day and age today 68 of cancers that we diagnose new cases 68 are cured cured with what peter slash poison burn surgery radiation and chemo except for a few cancers where there are targeted therapies or antibodies available really not much has happened the 32 percent who present with advanced disease that we can't use slash poison burn so imagine the same treatments that were working in earlier stages are not working in later stages this is the best proof that the only thing we can do right now is to find the cancer earlier and even some of the therapies not working like targeted therapies may work better if we don't give them to stage four split three mutations quarterly may respond much better to flip three inhibitors this is the point i will keep making over and over i want to stop you for a second there ezra because honestly that is something that i have only in the last few years come to share your zeal for and i can't emphasize it enough so there was a day when i believed incorrectly now i believe i was incorrect that burden of tumor was not the primary determinant factor stage four cancer was stage four cancer whether the burden was high or low and it was really a property of the biology of the cancer that was the issue so in other words if you took a whole bunch of women with stage 1 breast cancer you took 100 women that had sub centimeter lymph node negative breast cancer and you had a machine that could tell you which ones had the potential to go on to have metastatic cancer versus those ones that did not and let's maybe breast cancer wasn't a great example because of the hormone complexity of it that whether you acted then or acted later it wasn't going to matter well i no longer believe that is true for reasons i could expand upon i want to emphasize the point you're making which is i mean it's the contrapositive of your point which is we don't really have therapy that works for systemic disease so metastatic breast cancer metastatic colon cancer metastatic prostate cancer metastatic you fill in the blank you are no better off today than you were 50 years ago and that is a very sobering if not outright depressing statistic it's very difficult for the average person to comprehend that for all our advances once colon cancer has gone to your liver in 2020 you are almost as hopeless as you were in 1970 and in fact you can probably put more color around it and say well technically peter you might live four and a half more months and i don't want to discount that i want to talk about what the cost of that is but i mean do you agree with am i also being a little too dramatic or would you agree with my assessment i think you're using meiosis meaning understated seriously how do you tell a 22 year old andrew that we will add four months to your life you should go and celebrate and proclaim from the rooftops what kind of nonsense is this four months of improvement in survival and that is the lucky ones who get it you know what it is why people will be shocked why should they be shocked they'll be shocked because they are listening poor things have been subjected to the ultra hype of all this self-promotion of scientists and oncologists patting themselves on the back for game changers that they have allow me to expand on what has in my opinion put the field back by decades and that is the treatments that are most celebrated in cancer are treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia this is a disease which is a disease of the myeloid cells in the bone marrow which undergoes a chronic phase where nothing much is happening except one fine day something mutates something happens the disease takes off into an accelerated phase and then becomes acute leukemia and it is universally fatal and all of us who are older like me have taken care of dozens of these patients who died in our own hands young people as well as old well it turned out that chronic myeloid leukemia is caused by one genetic change that can be targeted with one magic bullet and that magic bullet is gleevac and that was fda approved in 2000 and now these people are being cured with one drug and this is a fantastic success but peter the same drug doesn't work when the disease starts to accelerate so chronic myeloid leukemia think of the word chronic hair it's not really a malignancy it's like a pre-leukemia right now you caught it early that at that stage there was only one problem and you could fix it with one bullet right can we put that in perspective for people because i want to make sure we're not i don't want the naysayer to have too much wiggle room to say well you've discounted the success stories gleevac we're going to probably talk about some of the checkpoint inhibitors as well which have probably been the single biggest victory in the past five years do we have a sense of what percentage cancer mortality has come down on the back of gleevac not just from cml but let's also look at gi stromal tumors which have at least for some period of time responded to gleevec though it might not be the most durable remission ever i mean what type of numbers are we talking about has that put a one percent dent in cancer mortality in the past 20 years it's that it's a very rare disease yeah yeah exactly very rare but it did prove a point which is that targeted targeted therapy can work this is the point i'm making that it's not even really a cancer yet in all its malignant manifestations that other cancers are the second thing we celebrate is again in hematologic malignancies which is acute pro-myelocytic leukemia which is cured with arsenic or with vitamin a analog vitamin a let's say atra it cures acute promyelocetic leukemia one of the deadliest acute leukemia but do you know it wasn't as if scientists sat down studied this disease found the lesion of retinoic acid receptor and started to reverse it poor chinese were saying for years that we are curing acute promylocytic leukemia with vitamins and the west didn't believe them and finally they sent somebody over and they saw all the patients and were convinced and came back and did a trial of atra here and then were convinced and then worked backwards to find the molecular lesion so please scientists do not take credit in front of me for acute promyelocetic leukemia you did not work it out you only worked it out in retrospect so those are the two biggest advances now lymphomas absolutely agree that throwing cocktails of chemotherapy together testing this one and that one they worked as because of the biology of the disease that was responsive to those chemotherapies that's what i'm telling you that some of the things that have progress in a way is because we become convinced of a paradigm that oh if hodgkin's disease can be cured with these four drugs we just have to find the right for drugs for pancreatic cancer or ovarian cancer and we'll fix it and that's how we kept working throwing crazy combinations of drugs together to follow the paradigms the few successes that we had seen hodgkin's disease a few non-hodgkin's lymphomas or acute promyelocytic leukemia chronic myeloid leukemia i mean my multiple myeloma now has been very successfully treated but at that time it wasn't but now it is definitely a night and day difference but these are again rare types of cancers melanoma dramatic differences in survival today but again all of these together would account for less than 10 percent of cancers together still we have to go back to whatever we can slash poison and burn and successfully we are able to do that for 68 cancers either because their disease is responsive like in hodgkin's lymphoma even if it's advanced or non-hodgkin's lymphoma or cll or because it is amenable to surgery that's it so where a counter argument here is look this is going to be a game of inches and the 10 that you just described you basically gave the tour to force explanation of oncology's greatest hits in the last three decades and again we didn't pay a lot of spend a lot of time on it but i think the checkpoint inhibitors also have this huge impact beyond just melanoma because anybody who shows up with a checkpoint mutation even if you have lynch syndrome and you go on to get pancreatic adenocarcinoma you're probably going to respond let's just say that adds up to eight or nine percent of the 68 so the skeptic would say but look ezra like that's amazing progress give us another 40 years give us another 30 years and cancer is eradicated that would be the optimistic view of this how would you counter that view i don't want to counter anything i mean that's the way the field has been i've been hearing the same self-satisfied voices saying the same thing how wonderful they are how they will understand every intracellular signaling pathway in the cancer cell and reverse it how they will understand the metabolism don't even get me started on that because it's as if the last hundred years haven't existed and people haven't had any ideas until these new investigators came around to on their white horses with their over confidence and contempt for the past armed with new things we are going to reverse all these i mean clearly whatever advances there are and i don't want to argue with anyone about advances you are saying there are a lot of advances great do they really reflect the quarter of a trillion dollars we have invested in research is this all we have to show a few checkpoint inhibitors fine i agree with you even if i agree with you so let's just talk about immune therapy for a minute you say checkpoint inhibitor there are many different kinds of immune therapies 14 15 different kinds the two most popular we talk about when we talk about immune therapy these days is either the cell therapies that are given where you train the lab that is the pioneer of all of this work with cell and cytokine il therapies combined with t cells etc or the checkpoint inhibitors because normal cells will have signals on themselves saying hate me or don't eat me and these can be masked and these signals are the checkpoints and by using drugs you can unmask the signal which has been covered up by the cancer cell very simple explanation for checkpoint so the two main ideas in immunology that came along were how to target these checkpoints so that the body's own immune cells can recognize the cancer as being alien to the normal functioning of the body and must be eliminated and the second is can you take the body's own immune cells and engineer them in such a way that they can selectively kill cancer and car t cells have been proclaimed once again as revolutionary of course the science behind it is beautiful it's very sophisticated it really it's one of those things that make you want to celebrate humanity's accomplishments it is just a gorgeous thing but the problem is that it has done very little for patients why because what all the oncologists talking about cardi never mention in any of their talks and by the way every morning i run every morning and after i run i jump on a small trampoline for 20 to 30 minutes every day because that's one way to stimulate your lymphatic system and the trampoline is small rebounder i should say not a trampoline it's one of the best exercises you can have been doing it for 25 plus years so during that time i listen to youtube lectures to all of you cancer researchers out there understand that there is one person who listens to your youtube lectures every single day and the kinds of things people confess to in public forums very different than the scientific papers they're writing in all of those talks i have never heard any serious scientist oncologist or immunologist say that their car t cells cannot distinguish between normal and cancer cells they just ignore that it's like they just don't want to acknowledge it why don't you say that basically car t cells are just in the form of killing machine indiscriminately so what car t cells do is whatever antigen you put on it and whatever organ expresses that antigen it will go destroy the whole organ taking down every normal cell of that organ also so basically the only thing car t is working for right now is b cells because you can replace b cell function after you kill every single last b cell in the body but you can't do that to pancreatic cancer because it will kill the whole pancreas and then you can't replace the function but how many times have you heard people say this picture well i mean do you hold out hope that some of the case studies because we've seen the case studies the cholangiocarcinoma here the pancreatic cancer there the colon cancer the breast cancer there where they are able to identify the unique antigen of the cancer and by unique i mean distinguishing antigen of the cancer such that you can send the t cell loose and it can eradicate not the entire biliary system but just the cancerous piece and to be clear i'm not speaking one way or the other other than to sort of help me think through the is this a sufficient proof of principle that we believe that adaptive cell therapy of which cars are the most far and away the most prominent and checkpoint inhibitors are really going to be the way the future you didn't allude to it you and i know this as well as tuesday follows monday there are also very nasty side effects of checkpoint inhibitors and for every patient we see who has a response to them some of the autoimmunity can be quite devastating and in fact vitiligo for a patient with melanoma might not be such a fatal form of autoimmunity but certainly when people have life-threatening enterocolitis yes they're cancer-free but they die from bowel disease that follow so certainly not to suggest these are benign i guess the point is do they represent a demonstrable step function forward that now puts us in a new era of okay we've found a new beast that goes beyond surgery radiation and indiscriminately killing chemicals how do we figure out how to tame this new beast does that resonate no not particularly because steve rosenberg has found this ages ago that this is the right way to go but yes we are making advances and i do think that all of these need to continue i'm not saying we should stop any of this i'm just pointing out where the field is right now i think these are fantastic they should continue what needs to stop here's the problem 95 percent of experimental agents that we bring to the bedside today 95 percent in cancer fail completely the five percent that succeed should have failed because they are only prolonging survival for 20 to 30 percent of patients by a few months and you began by asking me what is progression-free survival what is i mean we don't even talk about survival anymore we just talk about progression free survival because survival has become too big of a obstacle to overcome so as long as you don't see the tumor but the patient dies within the same four months or five months it doesn't matter but you didn't see the tumor for two and a half months that's progression-free survival so this drug should be approved and the sponsors of the drug will make billions of dollars let's stop on that because it is just so darn important let's use a tangible example avastin okay i don't want to put you on the spot because i don't remember the numbers of avastin but the only reason i bring it up is that an okay do you know enough of the examples that i could use avastin i mean i don't use it myself but i do know that it's one of the more successful we could pick another one that you know i'll explain so avastin was a blockbuster in the sense that it was the first of its kind and it explored a brand new idea so judah folkman had this idea that many others followed in the footsteps of which is look if a tumor can't make new blood vessels it can't get very big therefore the ability to make new blood vessels must be of paramount importance to met metastases and therefore this concept of neovascularization became key and so this was a beautiful story of science and pursuing this thesis and doing all of these experiments and one step leads to another and before you know it you have a whole class of drugs called anti-vegf drugs of which this drug and i assume it was genentex drug i can't even remember at this point but i think it was genentech that was the first in line they have this drug avastin and i believe colorectal cancer was one of the first places they looked again in the show notes we'll have the story more accurately laid out but the gist of what i remember ezra is the following you took a patient that had metastatic colorectal cancer which again means this is a patient who had a colon cancer that has left the colon left the lymph nodes it is now somewhere else usually in the liver this is a patient who is absolutely not going to live and if one percent of those people live five years that would be very generous and this is asking the question if you use all of the standard therapies we have today the entire cocktail of chemotherapies and then you do the same thing but you also use avastin how much do you change the median survival notice we don't use mean because that can be very impacted by outliers we use median and i believe the answer with avastin was on the order of four months with avastin which cost at the time in the neighborhood of a hundred thousand dollars it was going to extend median survival for those patients by four months and what i remember most about the discussion ezra is it prompted a discussion about what is the value of a life and different countries around the world especially countries without private insurance but instead those with public insurance had to put something called the quality at the front of that discussion a quality adjusted life year which says do we believe that the cost of a life is worth x hundred thousand dollars such that a publicly funded insurance for health would be accountable to spend that money and and if you don't like that example because i might not have the details right that you can use a thought experiment which is if i told you azra you have a condition that is going to allow you to die but i could extend your life by a month and it's going to cost a billion dollars do we as a society think that that's a reasonable cost for society to bear on your account despite how wonderful you are and how much amazing stuff you could do with an extra month so it started to get into this discussion of the cost benefit analysis which gets to that return on investment do you want to use a better example a more recent example than avastin to illustrate how relatively small changes in median survival or disease-free progression and maybe you can explain the difference between those two because you and i will go back and forth between them but i think the listener could be confused and then again just talk about the literal economics of that because i do think people will be staggered by what the actual numbers are you know john dunn said something very beautiful so when you said give a literal example i'm going to give a literary example no man is an island entire of itself each a part of a piece of the continent part of the main any man's death diminishes me that's what you said what is a human life worth john dunn says any man's death diminishes me because i am for mankind and therefore never sent to know for whom the bell tolls it tolls for thee of course every human life is important and of course every oncologist is working to try and save every human life i'm not saying we are deliberately not doing enough in fact in all of my career in this country in the last 43 years i have yet to meet an oncologist who didn't care for their patients never they're all trying their hardest but it's like trying to use a map to find your way in london but you're using a map of paris it's not going to work so how have we become so misdirected you asked me to give a more recent example or something i'm familiar with i started landed in this country in 1977 as a fresh medical graduate before my residency could start i had six months and i'm not someone who can sit around at home doing nothing so i asked my sister my older sister who had just finished the rotation she was a pediatric resident in buffalo new york i was staying with her and she just finished the rotation at roswell park cancer institute and i said to her that you know all the on college is there can you get me in there and i'll just work for six months that i have so she went and spoke to her boss arne freeman and he said well if she's half as good as you we'll take her so i joined pediatric oncology at roswell park but within a couple of months it was very clear i couldn't handle it i couldn't last because i was crying the whole time i just can't handle children being sick so my sister's friend who happened to be my boss at the time judy oaks one day just took me by hand because i was hiding in a room crying away i had lost a four-year-old that day and took me to the adult oncology unit where i met harvey preisler who was later to become my husband and harvey was heading the leukemia program at the time at roswell park and he took me on i started working on the wards immediately at that time we used to have 20 30 aml patients acute myeloid leukemia patients on the floor and i started seeing and working completely as a fellow i was hired as a fellow we were using two drugs to treat aml back then in 1977 a combination of arrow c and donomycin they were popularly known as seven and three because you give seven days of one and three days of another by the way harvey and i started to use this seven and three acro as a kind of a code word between us we would be sitting in a meeting and how we would suddenly leave nowhere and say to me as that person is doing seven and three and for us that seven and three meant somebody is using seven words when three would suffice another mark of a great writer so we were using seven and three 1977. guess what we are using in 2020 seven and three all these years imagine the thousands of patients i personally have had to see and describe the same side effects and the same potential benefits they will have now when i started the survival was ten percent five year survival with seven and three today with the same drug it's about 26 percent why has it increased because the supportive care measures are better we have better antibiotics we can give more platelets and red cell transfusions are easier to give we've learned to manage better that's it the supportive care is better but the backbone of treatment is the same seven and three so now a company comes up with combining these two drugs seven and three in a fatty envelope so they come up with this new drug now and it's the same seven and three but it gets approved in this country and this approved form which is i believe for a little older patients like 60 to 75 years if you have acute myeloid leukemia you can get this combination of seven in three which is inside this fatty capsule now the regular seven and three costs five thousand dollars five thousand dollars for how long for the seven days and three for the seven plus the three days for one cycle okay five thousand dollars this fancy version seven and three costs forty five thousand dollars and do you know what is the improvement in survival under the best conditions when they ran the study where you select patients the eligibility criteria are so stringent their kidneys have to be working their liver has to be working their lungs have to be at capacity etc etc you know how we choose and select patients for clinical trials they are the best of the best right they have to be cherry picked they represent the upper limit of what you expect in the real world yes and even in those cherry picked patients the basis on which this 45 000 combination is approved is an improvement in survival by 3.7 months that is a median improvement in survival which means a fraction of the patients like maybe 30 percent experience 3.7 months improvement in survival what does that mean median survival so even out of those 30 half of them didn't even experience that but we are paying 45 000 now if i don't prescribe that drug and continue to give seven and three then i can go to jail because tomorrow if the patient dies which they eventually do because it's an older age group then the family will sue me dr raza this drug was available it could have given 3.7 more months so now the decisions that we are making as individual on colleges are not being made by us they are made just by key opinion leaders or the very institutions like fda which are supposed to protect the patients uh have fallen a victim to this kind of propaganda where under the pressure of advocacy groups who are demanding more drugs for cancer patients at any cost just to be able to say that we have 72 new drugs being approved this year for cancer look at the fantastic advances we have made so under pressure from advocacy groups from patients the fda has lowered its bar of approving drugs to laughable criteria it would be laughable if it wasn't so tragic here you have 3.7 month median improvement in survival for a fraction of the patients for 45 000 dollars instead of 5 000 are you surprised then that 42 of cancer patients were diagnosed today will be completely financially ruined by the second year of their diagnosis 50 percent of breast cancer women are being hounded by collection agencies with stage four cancer your friend marty mccary has written a fabulous book the price we pay people should read that book and see the obscenity we have reached vulgarity of it all completely not thinking about patients at all talking in terms of well ezra 3.7 months meant a lot to my patient who could go and attend his son's graduation or grandson's bar mitzvah yes of course like i said john dunn said every human life is important but you asked the question earlier at what cost to the others i mean i think marty's work does a great job of explaining this and the only way i can sort of explain it is i think the united states has basically become the one that has to subsidize the rest of the world in terms of medical research i mean that's the only way i can sort of make sense of how outrageous these costs are by the way that's not a justification so i could go on for days as to how frustrating it is but it has basically become a form of subsidy and i've been trying to get my head around what are the biggest drivers of spending in the united states because overall as a country we don't get a lot in exchange for what we give that's going to be a very polarizing comment i just made so let me clarify it if you take someone in the top income tax bracket in canada of by all estimates a socialized country you compare them to someone in the top income tax bracket in in the united states especially in a high tax state they're paying about the same amount the difference however in what they get is fundamentally quite different in canada everybody gets health insurance no ifs ands or buts everybody basically gets exceptional education at a fraction of the cost homelessness mental health a lot of these issues are just so much better i still think i would still make the case by the way that the extremes of health care are better in the united states i would much rather receive my medical care in the united states than in canada but ultimately it points to a gross inefficiency in terms of how those dollars that are collected are then turned around and spent and i could probably point to three things that the united states is disproportionately spending money on that other countries are not spending money on and it's those three things that are creating the biggest gap and one of them is healthcare there's simply no way to avoid it and within the morass of healthcare drugs might be one of the most egregious examples there are others that are less sexy to point your finger at but as you note i mean marty makes a very good point that the drug story is a revolting one actually after harvey died with a five-year-long battle with leukemia you were in your early 40s at this point in time basically when you're widowed yes and we had a four-year-old daughter yeah when he was diagnosed so after he died my younger sister who's now the head of women's radiology at the brigham she said well i have to get you out of chicago because just five years of thinking of nothing concentrating continuously on this one thought only which was harvey and his illness so we went to england because well london is one of my favorite cities and i wanted to take my daughter to see reading jail because i'm a big oscar wild fan and we went to reading and the reason i'm telling you this is one of the most gorgeous ballads ever written the ballad of reading jail the refrain is very beautiful yet all men kill the things they love by each let this be heard some do it with a bitter look and some with a flattering word the coward does it with a kiss the brave man with the sword but each man kills the thing they love let by each let this be heard so wild wrote this poem when he was in this ballad when he was incarcerated in jail and when he came out his boyfriend lord alfred douglas asked him what do you mean by this refrain all men kill the things they love what does that even mean all men kill the things they love and while tried to just diss him and said well nothing you know it's just whatever but uh bosey alfred douglas kept insisting no you have to tell me what this means so you know what wild said he said look it's like this when we meet someone or we have an idea we make immediately an impression in our mind we meet them the next time and they don't correspond with the impression we had so instead of correcting our impression we start trying to change the person and this is how we enter the cycle of self delusion and kill the thing that we love why am i telling you all this is because we started with good intentions peter but somehow remember in the beginning i said i'm looking for an adult why aren't we taking stock of the situation why is it that scientists who are going to now let's say attack the metabolic pathway of cancer cells to improve the efficiency of chemotherapy by simultaneously changing the dietary patterns for the patient a very good target to think about but before even a phase one trial has started they are monetizing it making companies out of it i mean yes this is a capitalist system everything is legal everything is allowed but then it somehow leaves such a bad taste in my mouth all the time all the time it's all about think about it you are never going to be able to cure an advanced cancer of the kind that andrew had by a diet of any sort or even by supplementing chemotherapy he's getting with a diet of any sort all you're aiming for is improving their survival by a few months but more important is to make companies why why have we come to this i mean i think in defense of that type of idea which i don't really know about specifically they would probably argue changing nutrition if a change in nutrition could have a comparable benefit to a change to the use of a drug it's a fraction of the cost and presumably without the destruction of the quality of life i mean one of the things i'd like you to come back to is the idea peter sorry i'm not questioning the idea at all i'm questioning why do you have to monetize everything is what i'm questioning yeah i mean i was going to ask you the same question which is how do we think about the role of pharma in this entire landscape i mean it can't be denied which is progress has to be funded by somebody you have different animals so you have public funding which has been the majority of it through nih via nci which is by far the largest of the institutes within nih and has done the lion's share of the cancer funding so i actually did the analysis five years ago which means it's probably dated but directionally correct but if you went back to the declaration by richard nixon of the war on cancer so circa 7172 more than half of the total research dollars in the world into oncology funneled through nci slightly over half was my recollection again i could be a little wrong on that but that's a big piece of it of course pharma as you know has really outsourced r d they just don't do r d anymore the way they used to so they basically now acquire r indeed products and so smaller and smaller companies which means it's shifting more to venture type investing and biotech investing is taking that early stage 1 early stage 2 risk at which point pharma brings in for the huge capital allocation required for late stage 2 and stage 3 approval that gets to drug approval which then gets to the point you raised which is you've got these two drugs that have been off patent for since moses was throwing tablets at people what are you going to do with it well you could keep selling them for five thousand dollars or you could repurpose them and increase by nearly 10x and i know that it sounds egregious i don't have an answer though because i don't really like this is almost to me a question of economics is the answer that all of this stuff has to be done publicly so that shareholder value is no longer the thing that's being optimized for because as long as these companies have to answer to shareholders i don't think they'll ever figure out a way to put the woman with breast cancer who's going to go bankrupt ahead of their shareholder as awful as that sounds i think they're always going to say i have a fiduciary responsibility to my shareholder and that is to maximize the price and i do think the government is doing a better job at catching the most egregious examples of company that are grossly exploiting this but in the end is kytruda really worth what it's being charged today i don't know how to answer that question i really have no clue how to answer that question and you've more eloquently than me said every life is valuable and that includes the lives that remain which i think is a very important point that's the counterpoint that's never made it's not just the life of the individual that we're debating extending by 3.1 months at some unbelievable sum it's the lives of everybody that remains and what it says about their social security check and what it says about their schools and what it says about their health care wait i want to answer this if you take a living frog and you throw it in boiling water it will jump out but if you put it in cold water and start heating it slowly it will die in that because it has been desensitized so slowly we began all these things with good intentions that's what i keep saying to you over and over some of the saddest things to me are this 95 drugs we bring to the website fail why because the pre-testing platforms we are using are so artificial we are taking a very complex disease like cancer and we are trying to reduce it by reductionist approaches into trying to replicate this complexity in mouse models in tissue culture cell lines and if those don't work we add layers upon layers of complexity to it by genetic engineering immune compromisation of the animal you know after reading my book the first cell a young woman wrote to me saying dr raza i am a phd student i'm working on this cell line model of breast cancer testing drugs against it but using a two and three dimensional in vitro system and once this is successful that the drugs work against the cell lines then i will go to the mouse model and if that works then i have to go to human but reading your book i realize that it's all a waste of time what should i do is this even something i should spend the next 10 years of my life doing so but 90 percent of research is still funding things research dollars you are talking about nci dollars what are the funding for god's sake the same old same old ancient platforms which have shown a 95 failure rate and the 5 success is ludicrous secondly before you go can you say more about that actually i'm glad you brought this up because i sometimes forget that i know a lot of the things you're talking about and i take them for granted but i think this is worth a bit of a detour if you don't mind explain to people what that phd student was doing what is a day in the life for her or what is she going to spend years doing and how does that sort of model fall short i think you can explain it better than me because you have spent so much time in dr rosenberg's lab but very simply stated when we want to try and find new drugs for cancer we can't give drugs directly to humans so we try to first give them to something in our lab what should that something be well it started by taking patients tumor cells but they don't last very long in our cultures in the lab so then that becomes a problem how should we perpetuate these cells in culture by serendipity some cancer cells began to grow in the labs and one of the first was the famous hela cells from a patient with cervical cancer and these cells grew so well that they became immortalized they self-perpetuated they can be grown from flask to flask transferred from lab to lab they can be put into mice and grow and so all this reproducible system that became available is called a tissue culture cell line and we learned with time to make more and more of these so you make a pancreatic cancer now just like the hela cells with cervical cancer you take a ovarian cancer a pancreatic cancer you grow them and one of them will by chance mutate enough to become immortalized and then becomes a tissue culture line now you can test drugs against it but one of the first things that i have written in my book in the first chapter is that by using these cell lines when it was tested to see what kind of genes are they expressing it turns out that instead of expressing genes that were faithful to the tissue of origin from which they came for example an ovarian cancer cell line should be expressing genes that are expressed in ovarian cancer pancreatic cancer cell lines should be expressing pancreatic genes instead it turned out that there has been a transcriptomic drift that basically all the cell lines irrespective of their tissue of origin express similar genes that make them survivable under adverse in vitro conditions so let me explain one other thing for the listener here which kind of ties in another theme of yours which is because when you go back to what we learned in the great war killing cancer cells is easy i've had guests on this podcast before who have eloquently stated there's no one sitting in a home right now that doesn't already have 30 chemicals under their sink that will kill every cancer including the most devastating cancer like the one that killed andrew the challenge is killing cancer and not killing everything else and so now when you fast forward to what you just said when you have immortalized in vitro cultures that have become so genetically skewed that they no longer actually represent a human cancer you will learn a lot about what it takes to kill them and not kill them it just won't be relevant to the species of interest which is a human being this is why i read the oscar wilde thing to you that all men kill the things they love we started with a good thing when it didn't correspond to what we were hypothesizing instead of changing our concept we keep tinkering with trying to change the other thing this is exactly how you kill whatever you started out with and you know what's worse peter is that 90 percent 9-0 i want the audience to hear this clearly ninety percent of the papers published in the highest profile journals of science are irreproducible i didn't know it was that high it's still that high up to 90 percent if different studies some show 30 some 80 some 90 it is unconscionable what we are doing why are they not reproducible because for the same reason one set of milestones correspond to another set of mice in another lab so the point i'm making is 95 of your drugs are failing until now after a quarter of a trillion dollars in research like you said that is between six billion dollars a year right now and i nci funding and another six billion from philanthropic funding where is all this 12 billion dollars going and then breast cancer alone raises six billion dollars in funding and what are they doing studying breast cancer cell lines against drugs yes it will get that young lady a phd eventually and then she will try to get grants eventually she'll get fed up and go to industry and i must take exception with you condemning the industry they are the easy target pharma companies they are the easiest target but the system of research and development in america is that somebody like me who is an academic researcher will write a grant to nci they will fund me for 250 dollars a year for three to five years if i'm lucky but let's put that in perspective by the way by nci standards that's a lot an r01 at this point what is an r01 down to now is it down to 450 000 a year for four to five years yeah that's almost as big a grant as someone's going to get yes and with that all you can do is study one gene one signaling pathway but let's say i luck out and i find something which i think is looking very encouraging and is a potential target the next step is obviously to take it to the bedside but to do that i have to now test this in mouse models first in two mammals in fact and then to take it to the bedside for a phase one trial alone will cost 30 million dollars and by the time this drug will get approved will be two and a half billion dollars nobody can fund that kind of work except industry it's a very strange kind of thing where we are strange bedfellows academics and industry academics will develop the biologic insights which are needed to identify targets but we don't have the bandwidth to take it to the patient so industry comes in takes that but then they have to bring it back to academics because that's where the universities will help accrue patients so due today the criterion for recruiting young faculty the young faculty is complaining to me that dr raza all the universities where we are applying ask us for is how many clinical trials are you going to open when you come yeah look it's a symptom of a broader issue which is the incentives have come out of line i don't know how to fix that by the way but even taking it one step further look just the entire system of publishing in academics has become so skewed because you took a good idea which was wouldn't it be great if scientists would do work would publish them in journals would have them peer reviewed would share knowledge broadly so that others might see it learn from it and not make the same mistakes and build on the work of others right a beautiful idea you can't disagree with any of it and by the way recheck things that have been done to make sure they were done correctly because under different conditions we want to make sure they're reproducible okay understandably then that idea gets extended into this should be a criteria for promotion within the academic system which invariably turns into an entire cottage industry of garbage journals and garbage study and garbage publications which are driving up the fraction of studies which can't be reproduced and by the way the fraction of studies that can't even get cited they're so insignificant and so you sort of think my god if something as pure and ideal as scientific research and publishing has become so difficult to do and i don't have a great solution for that the process you're describing is a logarithmic order in front of that which is taking research from the so-called bench to the bedside that's the thing that i still don't even after reading about this topic and not just your book but other books i still don't have a great sense of what the future looks like i don't disagree that the water is starting to get uncomfortably warm here as a little frog and i don't disagree that we need to get out of this bath of water and into a cooler bath of water but boy i have to be honest with you i'm discouraged no no don't be i have a solution for us and a very important solution you know peter de rice is a writer who wrote a book in 1961 he wrote a novel because his own daughter who was 10 or 11 died of leukemia in his arms and after a horrible battle in 1961 peter derice says so the treatment for leukemia today is a local rather than an express stream same run a few more stops but that's how medicine functions perfecting the art of prolonging disease this was in 1961. how is this different the run for leukemia is still a local what i want to say is i feel like i'm living in a theater of the absurd why aren't other people seeing the spectacular failures we are dealing with and why do we keep molly coddling the public why do we keep promoting the two three months or five months advantage in survival why aren't we going for bigger goals and better things we can do it you know how we can do it is very simple what has worked in cancer until now early detection how is it that we are living in an era of the most sophisticated technologic advances possible and yet the treatment of cancer is paleolithic it belongs in the stone age in the caves giving the kind of disfiguring horrible treatments we give is like beating someone said this beating the dog with a baseball bat to get rid of its fleas have you ever seen somebody being treated with car t therapy my god there are whole industries sprouting up to control the side effects why are we even developing such terrible therapies the yes we should develop them but they should be used when the tumor burden is not that high so once again i want to be very clear about a couple of things before i give you my solution number one i am not against animal research at all for biology it is very important to use the animal model all i am against is drug development in animals because what you learn in animals by using drugs is only correct for animals it does not automatically extrapolate to humans so just to be clear you're saying you would still use animals for safety but you would disregard them for efficacy i would not use them for safety either why should it give me any level of confidence that the drug didn't kill mouse it wouldn't kill a human it is very little to do with each other we don't have to go into it now but i guess do you know from sort of even back of the envelope how that would change the regulatory landscape if we now had to go to a much earlier phase one in humans obviously probably using a milder dose escalation or would you be talking about doing primates instead what is the actual model none of those in fact the fda has a system which is called phase zero in which you don't just bypass any animals you use one five hundredth of the dose starting those in humans and work your way up that so basically it's homeopathic all the way up yeah so that's how you do it with a phase zero trial what i'm saying is look the only thing that has worked is early detection we have great technology available we shouldn't be talking about early detection doesn't work because mammograms have not been helpful or psa have led to over diagnosis and men undergoing very macabre surgeries and things no all i'm saying is that we should definitely take advantage of the cutting edge genomics transcriptomics proteomics metabolomics the scanning and imaging devices that have been developed and use artificial intelligence to put all this together develop 50 tests if we have to to identify biomarkers which are based on all these things and combine them with the latest technology to try and start monitoring the human body not once a year but continuously like a machine and how do you do that well you see this chip you can see it the audience cannot it's a small chip the m chip you can look it up because it is fda approved it is based on microfluidics you put one drop of blood here which it goes through microfluidics and interacts with the biomarker put here the biomarker in m chips case which is fda approved is psa so men who have been diagnosed with a high psa can use this chip it can slide into a small device and very soon into your cell phone and give you your psa four times a day if you want to see it and if you're diagnosed with having a high psa you don't have to go in and have a complete abdominal resection with the removal of every lymph node and be eviscerated no you follow this at home if you have to as often as you want i'm saying that if we develop a biomarker that is identifying the earliest footprints of pancreatic cancer we put that next in the next lane and for ovarian cancer in the next or for each cancer we develop like a bar code and with one drop of blood so toshiba a company just announced that they can detect 13 different cancers from one drop of blood in four hours for 180 dollars there's a company in the bay area that i follow very closely called grail and they're doing something very similar at this point they're you know in phase 2 with probably almost 30 different cancers i agree with you completely i mean my view of cancer is rule number one is don't get it i mean that sounds glib but i don't think enough attention is paid to the don't get it rule which is why aren't we trying to better understand what the environmental triggers of cancer are because while as you point out it has always been with us i think there is reasonable enough evidence to suggest that its incidence is higher in a modern world than in a non-modern world and therefore what is it about a modern world for example what is it about our diet or about our stress or our lack of exercise that could be amplifying our risk and if you think about it if changing factors of our lifestyle could reduce your risk of cancer by 30 to 50 percent which my reading of the literature says is absolutely the case how could we not make that a high priority to understand and when you pair the rule number one don't get cancer with rule number two very smart screening for cancer you then get into rule number three which is if you get cancer treat it so early treat it when it is basically in the millions rather than the billions of cells and for someone who might not have the familiarity with cells a million cancer cells is not even detectable to the naked eye a billion is and so there's a very big difference between when you can catch a million cancer cells versus a billion and i agree with you by the way completely that most people who are critics of early screening are unfortunately lacking the nuance to appreciate the accepted failures of things like psa and mammography which i won't go into here i've covered them in great detail in some other podcasts two in particular i'll just direct the listener to i think the failures of psa stand alone as a failure has been covered very well in the podcast with ted schaefer and ted talks very eloquently about how if you are wed to psa using psa volume where you take psa normalized to prostate volume and psa velocity which ezra you would get out of what you propose which is the rate of change of psa over time so psa has a rate of change called psa velocity psa volume become much better indicators of prostate cancer risk than just psa but also you go far beyond psa to things like 4k and other types of tests that add more nuance to this i think the story becomes much more clear that this type of early detection matters and i think as it pertains to the limitations of mammography i would direct people to the podcast i did with raj atariwala where we talked about cancer screening and we actually very specifically addressed some of the limitations of the literature on these isolated techniques like mammography so you're not going to get any disagreement out of me on both of those fronts so i guess the question is do we really believe that by taking those types of steps we will reduce the need for the cancers for which we have just not had the big breakthroughs which is basically lung pancreas prostate breast colon and gbm those are basically the most lethal cancers outside of gbm it's the metastatic versions of the others obviously gbm doesn't leave the brain it kills locally that's got to be two-thirds of cancer deaths and you're basically saying we have to catch these things long before they're ever in a position to leave the primary organ and not try to reinvent the onc drug discovery wheel coming up with another cocktail that's going to be as lucky as we were with hodgkin's lymphoma is that i don't want to put words in your mouth but is that your view yeah well sort of but let me restate what specifically i feel first of all about the lifestyle you're talking about of course lifestyle is it's only common sense that if you smoke it's not going to be good for you your likelihood of getting not just lung cancer but many diseases will be high so yes lifestyle changes have we have to continuously drill into our consciousness what is good for us and what is bad for us and try not to get it the problem is that with cancer as i began by telling you heredity and pathogens and environmental exposure like smoking etc do account for a certain percentage the vast majority there is no reason why they get cancer we at least a reason that we can identify yet i think that's the challenge is that with smoking the difference between the people who smoked and the people who didn't smoke was so great that it was appreciable but you're right with most other environmental contributors with maybe the only other exception being obesity it's very difficult to tease out what else could be contributing for example i don't know if you're running or the trampoline is making enough of a difference because it's very difficult to study that longitudinally and prospectively and secondly i don't know that enough people are doing it and it would create a big enough signal that we can measure it well that's what i was going to say we don't even know whether eggs are good or bad for you to this day so those are the kinds of issues with lifestyle large studies now the point i'm trying to make though is slightly different a lot of people smoke not all of them get cancer so there are other cofactors that exist all these things have to be worked out haven't we been trying for a hundred years for god's sake don't the investigators who act like this is something they have discovered today to be looked at no this is what we have been trying to do forever it's not that simple what we are finding is that for the vast majority of cancers their random mutations account for it which means that cancer is most common with age increasing age why because with age many more of the cells in our body have undergone several divisions and with each division we pick up some dna copying errors two to three on an average so by the time i sell is now from birth to like 60 years of age every cell has undergone multiple cycles of proliferation therefore multiple gene genetic mutations have collected and these are making the cell susceptible that now it's like dropping grains of sand and they will form a pile and at one grain of sand which is no different than millions before that had gone before it will suddenly cause an avalanche and the pile will collapse not because the glass grain of sand was different but the pile had become unstable so with age the body becomes unstable because all the cells have these kinds of mutations so and not only that metabolism can go wrong and sometimes as shown by whole genome sequencing of over 2000 tumors that there are a few cancers where no mutations were found in advanced cancers so how did that happen well because sometimes it is the disturbed metabolism that then leads to production of reduced oxygen species or free radicals for example that go and chop up and cause mutations and that genetic mutations are a secondary event the primary event is a metabolic disturbance so i mean all this needs to be done all this needs to be studied and it isn't like it hasn't been studied since 1921 poor otto warburg made the first observation of anaerobic metabolism and sin i was doing ketogenic type diets in the 1980s so please don't think that any of these things are new but the question that i am asking is someone who's been in this field for 43 years now is this if i'm still using 7 and 3 to treat aml and for most common cancers we are still using slash poison and burn it is not for lack of resources it is not for lack of very very smart people hundreds of thousands of them who are working 16 hours a day to try and find the answer but the answer is very complicated it has too many aspects to it so the only thing we should do is i am beseeching everybody in cancer related fields let's just spend a little more effort a little more resources in earlier detection yes keep trying to understand metabolic pathways and intracellular signaling and checkpoint and car t's and everything else but instead of spending five percent in prevention let's spend 50 percent in prevention and early detection that is all i'm asking for so a lot of people have asked me peter because i've been completely uncompromising in my criticism as you've heard now i am completely merciless you know why because i have brought the patient back front and center and everything i look at is through patients human anguish our problem is that 90 of our researchers never see a cancer patient because they are basic scientists and they study tumors that they grow in on their own in their labs so they don't see a disease they are trying to develop treatment for and they are using animals who don't get these diseases spontaneously how artificial can you become for god's sake so my thing is while you're doing all that at least let's employ all of this sophisticated technology and a lot of the intellectual resources to developing biomarkers for early detection why not look at every compartment whether it's blood sweat tears saliva urine microbiome study everything but human stop studying animals for one thing study new issue you're making so much sense to me that i'm struggling to come up with a counter argument to that point you're making i mean should 50 of our resources be put into prevention and early detection rather than 4 percent if that absolutely should we also shift this to study disproportionately in the study of interest i couldn't agree with you more you made a point a moment ago about the nature of contact i wanted to use that as a point to come back to omar why did you include the story of omar in your book he's not unique right i mean you've treated a million omars what was it about him that spoke to you so much it had to be more than just his ethnicity i but i don't know maybe i maybe i shouldn't assume that well first of all he's my best friend's son here is a 138 year old young man a graduate of oxford and colombia his teaching is finally fallen in love calls his parents to come and get him engaged and when they arrive the young couple he has a little osteogenic sarcoma so the thing that has forced that made me put umar into the book is the utter helplessness of oncologist because from day one when you have not resected that solid tumor completely you were a surgeon you were a surgical oncologist you are a surgeon you know this peter if you leave behind ten percent of the tumor or even your microscopic pathology shows that cancer cells have entered blood vessels as was the case with umar now you know that his chances of survival beyond a few couple of years at most are 0.00 what are you choices you are going to give to umar either you die of cancer or you die of the treatment we are going to give you because the problem is if we don't give treatment then death from cancer is horrendous in itself it's one of the most painful deaths so are we at least doing some palliation and umer's case was really it's a good question you asked it was emotionally soul-destroying to see this young man who's already just embarking on his career finally after years and years of hard work has met the woman he gets married a couple of months after the diagnosis actually and knowing that he's going to die and i had to live through every single day not just in the hospital but also at home because we are seeing him and by the way if i recall this was only about five years after your husband died yes no longer harvey died in 2002 umar dies in 2009. okay okay sorry but yeah yes yeah not that far so i think also in the book i tried to balance it out by presenting some elderly people like lady n kitty c are older harvey was older whereas jc andrew and umar the three are younger people so and different types of cancers i also wanted to show so brain tumor osteogenic sarcoma and a liquid tumor then harvey had a lymphoma many people ask me because i have been so brutal in my criticism of everybody and that's why i began telling you that please let's not just blame pharma companies the hospitals who are supposed to be non-profit hospitals are making so many hundreds of millions of dollars in profits what should they do they have no shareholders to distribute it to so they give large raises to their bureaucracy the executive business people running the hospital and then they start buying other hospitals and start investing in brick and mortar this is what's happening i in fact think about health care very much i was talking to perry marshall the other day who was talking about higher education that in the post covered world one of the things that will be completely redone is higher education because the two variables who have skin in the game in higher education are students and teachers and students are embroiled in horrible loans by the time they graduate and teachers are not even hired in permanent positions anymore there are adjunct professors that are hired so you don't have to give them any kinds of benefits and those two people who have skin in the game suffer whereas universities are developing endowments and billions of dollars these are academic institutions but i compare that same thing to healthcare the two people with skin and the game in healthcare are patients and doctors patients are fleeced for every last penny and doctors are overworked all the time so we have no time to spend and businessmen are running the whole show so i think the system has it's like that frog analogy over and over again no one is going to give up what they're doing willingly at all i believe exactly what thomas kuhn said if you want to change the paradigm you have to show a better one that's it so how do we show a better paradigm well at least i'm pointing to the only successful strategy in cancer is early detection why not use the latest technology to go for early detection we can financially incentivize it and with the one success the whole field can turn around because they will see that that's where it's a better thing to invest rather than in a venture that has a 95 percent rate of failure and mark my words the coming decade of 2020 to 2030 will see this shift from treating the disease to trying to detect early and prevent the disease from becoming established i agree with you i really do agree with you i don't know that i can speak convincingly to the time frame but i am actually very optimistic with the potential of liquid biopsies and it's something we have been very eager it's been a big part of our practice frankly inside of our practice and look forward to having a more rigorous discussion about this that's dedicated on the podcast once some of the technologies get through certain stages of fda ezra i want to close with a question about the loss of your husband at any point during that ordeal when he was struggling and you were right there with him and you had this young daughter was there any point of view that was thinking this is so unfair the disease that you've devoted your life to the disease that he has devoted his life to is ultimately the disease that's going to take him and not just take him but take him decades too soon or were you able to sort of come to this place of what some might call radical acceptance of just saying i accept what i can change i have the courage to fight the things that i can and i have the courage to know the distinction the so-called serenity prayer how did you go through that at such a young age it's very hard to describe what one goes through of course i kicked doors all the time and i had crying fits all the time and i remember calling my mother so often on weekends we used to talk she was in karachi of course and i would say so many of my friends hate their husbands and they're doing fine and look at me i'm one who's crazy about harvey and he's dying in front of my eyes i went through every human emotion that a wife would go through especially because our daughter was so little and harvey is the one who actually had reached the point of acceptance and when i would lose it every now and then in front of him he would very calmly tell me not to worry about it it's just the luck of the draw as don't worry and he would one time he said look when he was diagnosed he was initially told his diagnosis his reaction was so quintessential harvey he said well i'm glad it's me and not you or shahzad this i can handle that i couldn't and so when you're going through something like caring for someone who you love but who has made you responsible for every decision as well i'll also end by quoting my favorite dickinson again which is which is what one has to do i had no time to hate because the grave would hinder me and life was not so ample i could finish enmity nor had i time to love but since some industry must be this little toil of love i thought was large enough for me uh that's a treat i don't get often and the listeners i think will agree that it's not every day you tune into a podcast where you get treated to both the sort of the literary sprinklings of of greatness coupled with a you know a difficult but a very important discussion about a disease that is going to touch anybody listening to this because if we're fortunate enough to not be the ones who get it we are going to know somebody who does it is tragically that ubiquitous a disease i want to thank you for your time today and i want to thank you for the work you've put into this and finally your patience it has taken far too long to get this interview on the books and i hope that the listeners will at least agree it was worth the wait well before we end peter i do want to say that since 1984 as a result of my experience with the patient i started saving samples on them so blood and bone marrow biopsies and aspirates and two germ line controls t cells and buccal smears seven different types of cells like cd34 separation neutrophil separated mononuclear cell separated all kinds of elaborate things and today this tissue repository has over 60 000 samples from thousands of patients who have been serially followed for years some of them and not a single cell comes from a second oncologist to this day i do all the bone marrows with my own hands so this tissue repository which contains samples of all sorts following the natural history of diseases in patients as they progress from a pre-leukemia to acute leukemia is a national treasure it's a repository which can really unravel so much and trace back to the cell of origin be first cell find the biomarkers that are associated with a pre-leukemia that spiraled out of control into acute leukemia within months compared to one that took 15 years to become one i think that i want to end by saying in a very positive way that i am extremely optimistic about the future even though we spent most of our time in talking about very negative and very depressing pessimistic review of what the field has been the future looks extremely bright and i am so happy that i have collected all this tissue which can now be used in the service of our patients who went through severe pain and anguish while donating these samples we have now the technology has developed and hopefully the resources will be there to finally study the whole tissue repository properly and find that first cell thank you so much for the time you have given me today i wish you the best as you remain in
