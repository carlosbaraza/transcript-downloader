Sharon Parish is a prominent sexual medicine specialist who has been practicing for 30 years. In this episode, Sharon tackles the topic of women's sexual health, including the conditions associated with decreased sexual function and desire and available treatment options. She explores the influence of sexual health on overall well-being while also examining the potential effects of childbirth, birth control, metabolic health, and more on sexual function and desire. Through case studies, Sharon teases apart the differences between desire and arousal, explains the various factors that affect them, and walks through hypothetical treatment plans for the case study patients. In addition, she delves into the subject of menopause, addressing its impact on sexual health as well as the misguided fears around hormone replacement therapy.

The conversation emphasizes how underrecognized and undertreated women's sexual health issues are, despite available solutions.

**2. Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Testosterone is the most abundant sex hormone in women's bodies, more than estrogen [1:21:33]
- About 10% of women on hormonal contraception experience vestibular pain [1:08:22]
- SHBG increases with oral contraceptive use, potentially affecting free testosterone levels [1:07:12]
- Hot flashes can be reduced by 75-80% with hormone therapy [1:50:29]

**3. Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal recommendations:
- Regular sexual activity helps maintain tissue health [2:59:40]

- Total testosterone measurement preferred over free testosterone [1:43:55]
- LCMS testing recommended for hormone level accuracy [1:44:46]
- FSH levels over 35 indicate postmenopausal state [0:18:49]

**6. Notable Quotes**:
"Evolution didn't care about women's sexual function post-childbearing years" [0:39:12]

"We think of testosterone as the man's hormone, estrogen as the women's hormone - not entirely correct" [1:21:33]

**7. Follow-up Questions**:
1. What is the optimal timing for starting hormone therapy relative to menopause onset?
2. How do different delivery methods of hormone therapy compare in efficacy?
3. What is the relationship between metabolic health and sexual function in women?
