## Description

Original release date: 11/5/2018

In this episode, David A. Sinclair, Ph.D., a Professor in the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and co-Director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biological Mechanisms of Aging, provides insight into why we age and how to slow its effects based on his remarkable work on the role of sirtuins and NAD in health and diseases. He also presents the case that stabilizing the epigenetic landscape may be the linchpin in counteracting aging and disease.

We discuss:
-How and why David moved from Australia to Lenny Guarente’s lab at MIT [7:30];
-Sirtuins and aging [15:00];
-A series of experiments elucidating the mechanisms of sirtuins [20:45];
-How are sirtuins activated? [25:30];
-NAD and sirtuin activation [31:00];
-Nicotinamide, sirtuin inhibition, and PNC1 [39:00];
-Resveratrol [43:00];
-The NIH/ITP studies on resveratrol [55:45];
-Does David take any compounds for longevity? [1:00:15];
-NAD precursors (NR, NMN) and pterostilbene [1:02:45];
-Female fertility and NAD precursors [1:14:45];
-A unifying theory of aging [1:20:30];
-Waddington’s epigenetic landscape [1:23:00];
-If David had unlimited resources, what is the experiment he would do? [1:28:25];
-Testing combinations to extend lifespan [1:31:30];
-What made David aware of his mortality at such a young age? [01:33:45];
-What is David’s book going to cover? [01:37:15]; and
-More.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of the interview with David Sinclair:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Harvard genetics professor David Sinclair discussing his pioneering work on sirtuins, aging, and longevity. The conversation covers his early research at MIT, the discovery of resveratrol, NAD+ biology, and current developments in longevity science. Sinclair shares insights about his current research on fertility, epigenetics, and his unified theory of aging.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Sirtuins are NAD-dependent deacetylases that play crucial roles in DNA repair and gene silencing [22:00]
- NAD levels decline with age, affecting multiple cellular processes [1:33:18]
- Resveratrol extends lifespan in mice on high-fat diets by ~20-25% [51:43]
- NMN and NR are NAD precursors with different properties and stability [1:09:51]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Consider taking resveratrol with fatty foods for better absorption [1:00:52]
- Start with lower doses when combining multiple longevity compounds [1:00:31]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- Resveratrol: ~1g daily (Sinclair's personal protocol) [1:00:31]
- Metformin: 1-1.5g daily (Sinclair's protocol) [1:00:31]
- NMN: Discussed as NAD precursor [1:09:51]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"I've seen things you wouldn't believe... we've put all seven sirtuin genes into a mouse and fed them NMN... and interestingly there are additive effects." [1:32:53]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are the specific mechanisms by which sirtuins regulate fertility?
2. How do different tissues prioritize NAD utilization?
3. What is the optimal timing for starting longevity interventions?
