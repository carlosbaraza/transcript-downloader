## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast featuring Michael Rintala discussing Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization (DNS):

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode explores Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization (DNS), a rehabilitation and movement optimization approach developed at the Prague School of Rehabilitation. The discussion covers the historical development of DNS, its foundational principles, and its applications in both rehabilitation and athletic performance. Dr. Rintala explains how DNS is based on developmental kinesiology and the natural movement patterns that humans develop from infancy through early childhood.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- DNS was developed from three main pioneers at the Prague School: Vladimir Janda, Karl Levitt, and Vaclav Voita [00:04:30]
- The diaphragm has attachments on the lower six ribs, xiphoid process, and L1-L2 vertebrae [00:15:20]
- Around 70% of infants develop normal central nervous system maturation [00:45:30]
- Three-month developmental milestone marks the beginning of sagittal stabilization [00:25:15]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal recommendations:
- Focus on proper breathing mechanics and diaphragm function [00:15:00]
- Maintain proper alignment between pelvic floor and thoracic diaphragm [00:52:30]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Avoid premature positioning of infants in seated positions [00:48:00]
- Allow natural developmental progression in children [00:49:00]

4. **Exercise & Movement**:
- DNS exercises are based on developmental movement patterns [00:30:00]
- Emphasis on creating proper intra-abdominal pressure [00:55:00]
- Focus on eccentric loading versus concentric loading [00:56:30]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"DNS might be the single most efficacious thing I have ever come across as far as healing injury and preventing injury" - Peter Attia [00:58:30]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What specific DNS exercises are most effective for preventing lower back pain?
2. How can DNS principles be better integrated into conventional strength training?
3. What role does DNS play in injury prevention for specific sports?

The transcript provides extensive detail about DNS principles but would benefit from more specific exercise demonstrations and practical applications, which were mentioned to be covered in a subsequent video portion not included in this transcript.

Would you like me to expand on any particular section or provide more specific details from certain timestamps?

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia

[00:00:11] hey michael thanks for coming all the way out to austin to work on some dns for a few days with me and beth thanks for having me thank you um been wanting to sit down for quite a while um and obviously the events at 2020 kind of got in the way of that but um maybe just start for folks by giving a little bit of your background you grew up in northern california right yeah grew up in northern california and eventually went to school down in san diego at uc san diego what sports did you play growing up um my primary sport or the sport that i was most passionate about was tennis and uh interested in that from an early age and uh played other sports other organized sports but tennis was the one that i was drawn to and had the passion for so early on uh specialized in that played lots of junior tennis tournaments trained a lot eventually played in college and that obsession or passion kind of drove me to the way that i practiced today um i'm a chiropractor i'm based out of san diego california as you know i kind of specialize in rehabilitation sports medicine um i am also so i have the private practice there i'm fortunate enough to also be able to spend some time um on the pga tour and the world surf league tour as part of their sports medicine crew or team and also fortunate enough to be part of usa surfing performance committee um helping with uh assessing and training the the u.s athletes the surfing athletes for the upcoming olympics cool um today obviously the thing we want to talk about is the super kind of deep dive into something called dynamic neuromuscular stabilization now folks listening to this have probably heard me talk about this in the past uh you know if they follow me on social media they'll notice from time to time i'm doing movements that probably look a little silly sometimes working with you or working with beth or working with another colleague of ours michael stromsness is actually how we all met but i think for the purpose of this discussion let's assume a person has never heard of dns has never heard of the prague school or any of these things can you in a somewhat succinct but not terribly brief manner explain to people how all of this um school of rehabilitation coalesced around this idea of what we call dns so going back to the founding fathers of the prague school and what these various sort of insights were that each of them had and how that sort of came together okay so um dns or dynamic neuromuscular stabilization kind of built on some pioneers of functional rehabilitation there's many that have been part of the prague school of rehabilitation but i think talking about the influence on the development of dynamic neuromuscular stabilization by professor pablo collage who runs the rehabilitation department at prague school at this time i think we need to go back post world war ii cold war era 1950s is where um prague school of rehabilitation was was really founded and it was uh founded as part of the medical faculty of charles university in in in prague in the czech republic or formerly czechoslovakia and now czech republic and being post uh post-world war ii cold war era so they were in eastern europe behind the wall that may have been a factor for their not reliance but tendency towards the use of of observation in both diagnostic diagnosis um observation and palpation for diagnosis and treatment um all three of these pioneers were neurologists and then who who are the three so the three um vladimir yonda uh carl levitt and balclavita um professor yonda um he had a keen sense of observation and he formulated concepts and principles that tied into postural postural habituation specifically the tendency for specific musculature to tend towards tightness and other musculature to tend towards weakness and he he termed this upper cross and lower cross syndrome so for example with an upper cross syndrome meaning the neck and shoulder region with demands of of life and the tendency towards postural habituation such as with sustained seated postures there's a tendency towards the muscles in the back of the neck the occipital muscles the sternocleidomastoid muscle which is the muscle that also attaches to the skull and down to the sternoclavicular joint the pec muscles the upper traps that musculature would tend towards a tightening or an over activation other musc musculature in the upper extremity the serratus which attaches to the ribs and in the back of the the scapula um the deep neck flexors the middle and lower traps would have a tendency to tend towards a weakness and with that tendency towards over utilization or hypertonicity and underutilization inhibition weakness um that would also he also recognized that that would affect the quality of movement throughout the kinematic chain and subsequently would lead to overload in specific areas throughout that kinematic chain so that was um a big contribution on his part his colleague where would those places of overload be so if you if you have this tightness in the muscles you've described the weakness in the muscles you've described what is the consequence of that where does that load get distributed right so you with that imbalance and that postural tendency towards postural habituation you would see a tendency to overload in the transitional areas throughout the spine and throughout the extremity so i didn't go into the specifics for lower cross syndrome lower cross syndrome you have a tendency for the flexor hip flexor complex to be overactive tightened so the psoas iliopsoas rectus femoris the back extensor musculature will also tend towards tightness and then the weakness or the inhibition will tend to be towards the lower abdominal region in the gluteal region so looking at it globally you would see a tendency to overload again throughout the extremity throughout the extremities so that the hip joint the knee joint but also specifically dealing with the spine the lumbar sacral region thoracic lumbar region and the cervical thoracic region all the areas where you see the transition of the curvatures lordosis and kyphosis and with that tendency for overload you will get repetitive stresses on the passive structures within that kinematic chain so as a clinician we know that if you tend to image these areas or if you image the spine these are the areas that tend to have the most degenerative changes or the most disk pathology and those changes aren't aren't usually traumatic they're not acute they're accumulated over time so the the observation of these postural patterns or postural syndromes and then the recognition of the dysfunction uh with with movement efficiency that it caused led him to develop specific treatments um uh both uh exercise wise and manual wise to to address those those issues um his colleague carl levitt but yonda also had suffered polio as a as a youngster didn't he yeah so he had the suffered the residual effects the post-polio type syndrome and that was probably a motivation for his his passion for rehabilitation his his passion for the observation of movement um uh his his uh colleague carl levitt also a neurologist um he shared that that observation palpation um uh not technique but uh tendency to utilize that for diagnosis and and treatment he he specifically focused on joint dysfunction soft tissue dysfunction as it related to those those upper and lower cross syndromes so he developed specific mobilization techniques for both the the joint and the soft tissues addressing what they were seeing with those those postural postural habituation and movement dysfunction the third kind of pioneer also a neurologist but also a pediatric neurologist with volklav voita and he uh his his observations observing the ontogenesis or the development of motor function after birth during the first 12 months where the postural our postural foundations are established neurologically he developed a specific test called postural reactions where he could tell the the quality or the health of the maturation of the central nervous system during that period of time and by doing this he could assess whether there was pathology or a healthy developing central nervous system so he he developed seven specific postural reaction tests developed and modified some other ones utilized primitive reflexes and just observation observation of the infant during development to be able to recognize the biological age meaning the the maturation of that central nervous system as compared to the chronological age so for example if you had a six-month-old infant that was moving and reacting like a six-week-old infant that would be an indication that there was some central nervous system pathology he his focus was on treatment of the cerebral palsy infant and and patient and he was able to utilize that observation those uh observation of the postural reactions the assessment of the primitive reflexes to recognize early on before it would manifest clinically so that interventions could be taken earlier on to take advantage of the neuroplasticity the ability of the brain to form motor engrams more efficiently and work around those central lesions that you see with cerebral palsy so he um all three of these kind of founding members or founders of prague school of rehabilitation were professor collage collages colleagues mentors instructors they shared patients they discussed cases and pavel collage developed or evolved all that that knowledge and experience into what we call dynamic neuromuscular stabilization today now before powell came along what was the so so fast forward this started in the 50s but fast forward to the 90s uh so the prague school is well established you have these sort of founding fathers so to speak what were the applications of the prague school at that time how much of it was rehabilitation for kids with cerebral palsy or rehabilitation for people who were injured versus prehabilitation for athletes like what how what was the breadth of the echo applicability of the prague school right so prague school uh was it's a group of clinicians and probably more of the early 90s the application was primarily rehabilitation cerebral palsy general population um with pavel professor colas just to go in a little bit of his background you know again he he's the head of prague school of rehabilitation he's also head clinician for the czech olympic teams and czech national sports teams hockey soccer men's and women's tennis he himself was a high level olympic level gymnasts so um he uh his his work he's a pediatric physiotherapist as well his work with those three pioneers his experience as an athlete his experience treating cerebral palsy and infants he took that or started to apply that base of knowledge to the athletic population and the the focus of in the thinking of these these founders of prague school and and proc school today is it's uh the the influence of the central nervous system is huge and kind of king as far as the facilitating the efficiency of transfer of load throughout that kinematic chain so early on the focus was more rehabilitation over multiple populations but maybe late 90s early 2000s pablo started to apply those teachings to that athletic population and um there's meaning to an uninjured athletic population or to an injured athletic population probably at that time more of an injured population two kind of stone standout athletes that he was able to work with and integrate his concepts and principles of dynamic stability were uh jean-luc zelezny hopefully i say that right he's a he was a olympic uh javelin thrower three-time gold medal winner still holds the the record for uh uh javelin uh 98.48 meters i believe and um the other one is yamir yager who a hockey player check hockey player he he was able to help and work with them help them rehabilitate from injuries but then also integrate the concepts and principles of dynamic neuromuscular stabilization to one decrease the risk of re-injury but two also provide the potential for better performance and we can talk about specifics of those concepts and principles yeah let's let's so so we're into the early 2000s where now powell's basically taking some of the the fundamental principles from the prague school and creating this this new discipline let's use each of the words to explain to people what this is so dynamic of course is movement right it's not just static it applies to in in motion um neuromuscular um i think explains the connection between the nervous system both the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system but really as you said an emphasis on the central nervous system and how that connects to the muscular system so a lot of people i think assume that acts of strength are purely muscular and they don't realize the neurologic control of those things uh for me personally the hardest one to explain to an unsuspecting audience is stabilization now i have a way that i like to explain it but i want to hear you go first okay so i think it's important to talk about the utilization of developmental kinesiology as a way to explain posture and explain dynamic stabilization when we're first born functionally and structurally we are immature so our central nervous system is still maturing our bones are still forming the first weeks of life first four to six weeks of life the lower central nervous system structures the brain stem levels kind of dominant so primitive reflexes are dominant um but there's so examples of that suck reflexes grasping yeah you know obviously being able to blink i mean the most primitive reflexes that are species i mean we take these for granted so they help keep us alive during that that period of time so as that central nervous system matures and if it's maturing in a healthy way by a three-month period of time actually let me go back usually starting maybe eight weeks you we start to facilitate the the synergy coordination and timing of the deep stabilizing group of of musculature and that's diaphragm pelvic floor the entire abdominal wall the intersegmental spinal musculature that runs throughout the entire spine all right i'm going to stop you right here we are going to talk about these things so much that i want to make sure people understand them so let's go back to the first one everybody's heard of their diaphragm but let's put some actual um metrics to it it's a dome-shaped muscle it's a striated muscle but it has kind of a a non-muscular part as well but i think what most people don't appreciate is how big it is right yeah and how i can't even remember it's been you know back when i was you know in school i had to know every attachment of it but it um do you recall how far it attaches down and up on the on both the the ribs and the vertebral bodies yeah so the diaphragm just think of it like a big parachute or a big sheath of muscle that separates the abdominal cavity from the the heart and lungs the attachment it has attachments on the lower six ribs on the back of the xiphoid process which is a little bone at the end of the sternum and then also attachments on uh l1 l2 uh vertebra so that's right around the thoracic lumbar junction um so that's just an enormous expanse of attachment attachments being you know where the muscles attach an anchor and therefore that gives you a sense of what their lever capacity is what they can actually contract right so that there's those attachments and then there's a central tendon that when the the diaphragm activates so one of the primary functions is respiration so i go to take a breath in that diaphragm activates descends the central tendon drops the lungs expand that change in pressure you're able to draw air into the lungs and then there's a recoil of the diaphragm and the air comes out so there's a primary respiratory function during the first weeks of development or ontogenesis which is the study of motor development after birth there's primary respite it's primary respiratory function the central nervous system has not matured to the point to create the synergy with within the other deep stabilizing group of musculatures musculature to create that fixed point through the trunk and the pelvis so by by around three months period of time that central nervous system has matured to the point where now the hardwired genetic ingrained motor programs start to manifest themselves so we start to see this coordinated activity of that deep group of musculature so what are the other what are the what so we've now i mean for me and i think for many people a very helpful image is that of a cylinder um and as the strongest possible cylinder right would have a big top a big bottom and a beautifully symmetric you know side compartment to it right a lousy cylinder would have a tiny little bottom a big top and a dented middle so if the diaphragm formulates the top of that cylinder what makes up the bottom of that cylinder so the bottom of the cylinder we're looking at the pelvic floor which is an area of musculature basically where we the babies come out and that musculature will coordinate the regulation or management of intra-abdominal pressure that is created with the descending of the diaphragm so the diaphragm three three main functions respiration but there's also obviously this a huge postural function where it descends even more and creates an intranal pressure so that when that pressure is created that diet the pelvic floor will eccentrically load meaning it's active but musculature is active but stretches you can think of it like wind blowing into a sail where the wind blows into the sail it it opens and activates and then it holds and maintains the pressure but then at the same time we have the entire abdominal wall which consists of the the rectus muscles our six-pack muscles our oblique musculature which is musculature that crosses the body comes up and has attachments onto the thoracic cage of the rib cage and then a big one called transverse abdominis which wraps around um from the the back the thoracolumbar fascia around to the front so as that diaphragm descends to to facilitate a stabilizing function that intra-abdominal pressure is is created that musculature reacts to the pressure there's an eccentric load and then an isometric and then as we coordinate so we have respiratory function postural function but we have to now coordinate between both respiratory and postural functions so our central nervous system our brain needs to manage that pressure to provide enough stability but also allow the diaphragm to also allow the lungs to expand this coordination is usually where we see people kind of falling apart and if they fall apart they'll tend towards what yonda saw which is that overutilization so in the lower cross syndrome of the extensor musculature and the flexor musculature because we lose that synergy of that deep stabilization and if we lose that synergy and that ability to create that fixed point then our brains will do it do their jobs which is to find a way to still move and and do tasks that we need to do but in doing so we'll go to more of a high threshold or like i you know describe them more of a compensatory pattern so developmentally that three-month period of time is where we ideally will have that synergy coordination and timing of that deep group of musculature that will allow the infant to create a fixed point through the trunk and the pelvis and then also with that management of that intradonal pressure there's a loading on the front of the spine and with that loading we get a an uprighting effect throughout the spines and then the intersegmental spinal musculature are eccentrically loading and managing that pressure against the spine to help with that uprighting effect and that unloading effect let's again make sure people know exactly what we mean because we're going to use the terms a lot when you talk about eccentrically versus concentrically loading um i mean to me the easiest way to define it is just using the definitions right so a muscle is concentrically loaded when it's getting shorter as it's being loaded eccentrically is getting longer as it's being loaded so uh for example a bicep curl this is the concentric phase of loading this is the eccentric phase of loading yes and i think what's what a lot of people take for granted is both of those are important but most people when training tend to emphasize the concentric and don't realize the eccentric i heard a great story i think it was actually from michael stromsness that when a group of u.s weightlifters visited a group of eastern european weightlifters i don't maybe it was even you that told this story they realized that they were counting reps differently so the american lifters would consider a rep one is up and down so that was they were putting all their effort into the concentric but then you know more or less dropping the weight on the way down not really focusing on the effort to put the weight down and the eastern european lifters were doing the opposite right they were counting it as two reps a r it's up one down two so it was just as much effort into that e-centric um and you know it's not to say one is right or the or wrong because they serve different purposes obviously more emphasis on the eccentric will create more hypertrophy so there are times that you want both but again when you look at for example and we'll get to this i'm sure but when you look at hip abduction the importance of being able to eccentrically control that is such an important part of injury prevention and you can spend all the time in the world working on concentrically doing that so later today when we actually do some stuff on the mat you'll have some exercises to demonstrate that yeah yeah so what the the observation having knowledge of the developmental kinesiology or the ontogenesis and watching that maturation of the central nervous system and with that healthy maturation seeing the synergy of the deep stabilization providing that fixed point and then allowing efficient transfer of force and load throughout that that trunk and pelvis area what these pioneers voita yonda levitt collage noticed was the importance of the quality basically training that central nervous system because if you can facilitate that ideal stabilization stereotype and and synergy then you provide what professor collage calls centration throughout that that chain of movement throughout that kinematic chain and what he describes centration as is for example let's say you have the hip joint is the ability to maintain an ideal position of the femur and the acetabulum which is the hip joint throughout that full range of motion in order to do that you need a synergy or a nice interplay between agonist antagonists like you described the biceps curl so an interplay between concentric eccentric activity of the opposing musculature around the joint to help maintain that position and if that is compromised throughout any part of that kinematic chain it's going to affect the the quality of centration or transfer of force and load above and below that region the quality of that synergy coordination timing of that deep stabilization is what prague school is focusing on with assessment and with their their treatment methods and this is based out of that observation of developmental kinesiology which is the neurophysiological aspects of the maturing locomotor system so that's there they utilize that as their definition of dynamic movement dynamic posture ideals ideal posture let's go back to the the three-month-old infant and start talking about what normal developmental milestones are through the lens of dns and um like picking it up at three months so um what is what is a three-month-old infant starting to demonstrate and how is that progressing as they become six months nine months a year et cetera right so uh at three months with that ability to create that fixed point now the larger longer musculature and larger muscle groups have something to anchor off of so creating that fixed point for example allows the infant to now turn their head and fix their gaze prior to that during those first weeks of life you know there's the ability to to fix their their gaze is not there by three months providing that that stable point now they can turn fix their gaze and now they start to get more of the somatosensory input from the environment which is going to trigger an external cue or a drive to to start to explore the infant at that period of time can lift the their legs out of the base of support so they can you'll see a triple flexion so 90 degrees at the hip 90 degrees at the knee neutral position of the ankle joint or sub-taller joint they'll be able to bring their their hands together and bring their hands to their to their mouth along and let's explain what's actually required to do that because again most adults would take that for granted but what is it neuromuscularly that that is being hardwired in that three-month-old infant that is pretty impressive in in when you really stop to think about it that they're able to bring both legs up um coordinate that movement and by the way are they necessarily doing that the way you know uh a 50 year old person would do that if you laid them on their back like i having now watched a lot of infants they tend to all kind of do it in a very similar way whereas adults tend to not do it in a certain way right so um neurologically the coordination and timing of that deep stabilization group of musculature needs to be on point to be able to create an uh a fixed point so that the again the larger muscle groups can anchor off that to to bring the legs up now the infant has different you know there's a different thoracic cage size at that point their head in relation to their body is bigger their limb length is bigger they're still growing the mud the the bones are still forming so that's much different than a 50 year old our limb proportions are different our mobility is going to be different we may have different body proportions you know mobility but we we all went through these developmental milestones and most of us develop our central nervous system in a healthy way so we still have those same motor patterns that our central nervous system is going to want to kick into some of the efficiency of accessing those nice stereotypical motor patterns that we're born with can be compromised due to soft tissue dysfunction rigidity lack of range of motion throughout the throughout our joints um you know postural habituation that yonder described all that factors into our our can override the access to those ideal patterns what prague school tries to do is with the specific assessments assess that efficiency of that deep stabilization system uh whatever age that we're at and then utilize specific what we call active exercises which are based off of the developmental milestones which we'll get back to in a second to utilize specific points of support and positioning to help wake up or facilitate those patterns that we we still have as adults so uh three months of age is the start of that ability to to create a sagittal stabilization tell people what sagittal means versus um so sagittal is kind of like straight ahead frontal plane would be if you're on your side or to to the side and then there's transverse plane which is uh i think about rotating in the transverse plane so what happens now is they approach six months of age so three months you see the start four months that coordination is usually complete four four four and a half months once you've they've completed that that ideal uh facilitation of a fixed point now they start to be able to utilize the oblique slings and you'll start to see some differentiation uh in the pelvis and and the limbs and um as that synergy gets more and more efficient which means better better management of that intra-abdominal pressure you'll see the hips coming up into higher position the legs coming up into being able to come up into a higher position the infant's range of of reach will will improve as well at four months they're able to touch the groin area at five months they can reach their knees at six months they can reach their feet and then by seven months they're bringing the foot to the to the mouth the uh there's enough synthetic and just to be clear most people would say is that just a result of increasing flexibility but really the answer is not so much that they have more flexibility they were quite flexible at birth it's it's more that they now have the motor control and the stability to coordinate something that is everywhere from shoulder to foot or hand to foot basically right and do it in in in a an efficient manner so uh you know i'm a parent you're a parent and you remember when when the kids were developing and i i i get this all the time they're like oh my son was rolling all the way over at three months um that is possible they can normally well not normally but ideally at that six month period of time there's enough of that synergy and coordination and timing that the infant you'll see the infant at that time rolling onto its stomach now they could maybe do it at three months but they're not going to do it with that coordination and that efficiency of transfer of force and load you may see them turn and kind of revert back to more of that the newborn posture meaning uh they're finding a way to turn they're using more of a compensatory pattern to make that action happen kind of the same thing you see with movement with adults if the synergy coordination timing of deep stabilization is is not on point they find a way to move but when they move as with uh the first weeks of life the the newborn infant you'll see uh anterior pelvic tilt you see a flaring of the ribcage the shoulders you'll see elevation protraction and reclination or extension through the cervical spine the newborn when they look or when they move the whole body is moving they don't have that ability to create that fixed point but they're still able to to make movements as they're going through the developmental milestones with that motivation or that drive to move and explore their environment they may find ways to you know reach that toy but not be creating the ideal centration and stabilization with the central nervous system maturation it's not like at three months four months six months boom they wake up and automatically or they're in this perfect synergy coordination timing as that central nervous system is maturing there there's thousands of trials and errors they're forming the brain mapping and motor engrams finding the right points of support as the the coordination of the central nervous system is kicking in so you may see at the beginning of six months and they're turning you know maybe they're not able to keep the alignment of the diaphragms during the turning but they're still able to do it maybe by then three weeks into it now their coordination timing has become more efficient and better and they're able to make that turn with a better quality of of activation so how does it go from there what gets them to crawling and ultimately standing so what you see with the developmental milestones the start of at three months we talked about with the newborn you have more of the lower uh central nervous system structures are maturing at three months we see more maturation in the subcortical region of the central nervous system and that's where we get the manifestation of these postural foundations so as that central nervous system matures the certain milestones three months four months five six seven you'll see the infant starting to be able to attain higher more and stable positions and this this these developmental milestones are moving towards basically the verticalization process going from either supine on the back or prone and then working their way up trial and error uh learning with that healthy central nervous system maturation where at seven months they're able to come to their side eight months they come up into what we call a high oblique sit position nine months they're able to crawl 10-11 months you'll see them being able to attain like a kneeling position 12 months they're squatting 13 14 months they're standing and then 14 16 months and on average you see the start of of ambulation now this is is variable some kids my son was walking at 10 months there's maybe 15 months 16 months so there's variability within uh these milestones of of where where we see the infants but on average these specific points you'll see a specific uh competency in stability and reaching or moving towards that verticalization process now if you exclude you know cases of pathology like cp and things like that where there are injuries that are preventing the neuromuscular development and and the achievement of these milestones um is it more or less the case that you know all kids are who are you know given the fair chance to sort of explore and go about these things naturally will reach a certain age call it two or three and they'll be quite healthy from a from a dynamic uh you know and movement standpoint like is it you know for example like yesterday we spent a bunch of time looking at my three and a half year old and uh you know it's it's frankly it's a clinic and movement at that age right um is it safe to assume basically all three-year-olds move really really well like they haven't uh started to get into the habituated uh movement patterns that will begin to destroy them right yeah so uh voita and and others talk about usually what they see is around 70 of new you know infants are going to have that healthy central nervous system maturation uh go through the first weeks of life the postural foundations the three to 12 months the subcortical and then from two four to six six years of age you have more of the cortical maturation where you see fine motor dexterity and movement you know ability to write and you see the language develop and you see motor learning so sorry the subcortical phase goes till about two um three yeah three three to 12 months is where we see these the postural foundations uh after that you start to get that cortical integration saturation but the the um the motor learning and and the the process yeah i mean it's like two to six yeah but i mean and beyond no no i'm surprised to hear you say only 70 percent right and this is uh i don't know if i can't say the study maybe it's their observation um so they they talk about 70 normal maturation the other 30 percent it's a spectrum so you'll have on one one end uh the cp child or you know the the cns pathology but then there's this spectrum on the other end of the spectrum yonda called it minimal brain dysfunction i think it's also called central coordination disorder so there's maybe not that ideal development but uh again there's a spectrum to that so that that may manifest during that the when we see the the cortical uh time of central nervous system maturation maybe there is some learning disabilities or not as efficient movement patterns and this is something that uh prague school as far as a curriculum there's a whole pediatrics section during with their curriculum which they go deeper into that aspect of observation and specific utilization of of treatment options so um so in usually with a healthy central nervous system maturation and a good environment for the child to explore movement and the variability of movement and do the trial and error and find their ideal points of support you're going to see this nice healthy maturation things that may compromise that i mean we see in in modern society and culture a kid who a kid who's in their car seat you know six hours a day or um is maybe doesn't have that environment where they can explore um and i think another one that i remember michael sharing with me was when kids are sped up on milestones so for example right you know those those seats that prematurely prop kids into a seated position yeah well even before yeah you know that little bobby chair yeah where and again we're all guilty of this we stuck our i know we stuck our kids in these things at least the first two because when our third kid came along i was already interested in dns so then he became sort of uh you know the observation for dns but with our first two yeah you're going to stick them in those silly seated chairs and they're you they don't have the support or they're red before they're ready so they can't even support their own weight so they're in this slot position and then you put them in those things we called it the circle of neglect so it's like the thing where you know they're standing before they should be standing um so all of these things actually interfere with the normal uh neuromuscular development yeah put it putting kids in shoes too early probably does a tremendous disservice to them right so i ideally they're going to have an environment where they're going to kind of figure this out themselves verse you know that another one is the little walkers that they'll hold on to and walk you know ideally they're going to play with their environment and with that combination of healthy central nervous system maturation find those ideal points of support and be able to utilize that those motor patterns that are manifested with that healthy central nervous system so the environment that we we have children in is key and um this i mean you can take this and look at you know just our society just with a as adults well yeah let's let's let's go from okay so we we can put them in shoes too early put them in silly sit-up seats in the circle of neglect and give them walkers and then another huge set of insults come when they go to school right yes because now they're sitting in chairs for six or seven hours a day um and what does that do for uh you know a six or seven year old which is unfortunately by the time they're six they're sort of sitting in chairs six hours a day at least right so what is that doing to interfere with this process so this is where you you start to see the the start of that postural um those postural syndromes you know when we get into those sustained seated postures one of the main things that happens during those developmental milestones with healthy central nervous system maturation is we're able to line keep alignment or approximation of the pelvic floor in the thoracic diaphragm the more efficiently we do that the more efficiently we manage intra-abdominal pressure and uprighting throughout the spine and then again transfer a force and load if we fall into repetitive posturals or postural habituation which as a society is kind of a bit uh prevalent gravity is gonna win no matter how how nice the chair is we're gonna start to fall into that slumping posture and we when we get into that slumping posture the folder the shoulders coming forward that is actually going to create an inhibition of the the diaphragm's ability to descend and again we need that descending of the healthy and ideal descending of the diaphragm for both respiration and stabilization so if we start getting that descending becomes inhibited due to the the postural habituation our brain is going to find a way to get air to the lungs so it'll start to kick in the accessory breathing musculature which is that the sternocleidomastoid the upper traps muscles called the scalenes which attach to your cervical spine and the upper two ribs you'll see the pec minor also start to help to lift the thoracic cage to help get the expansion to get the air so again the brain just starts to do its job which we need air we're going to use these guys to get the air but and it's a good short term kind of survival strategy b but if we do it often enough that becomes the go-to pattern so you'll see a change in respiratory pattern meaning decreased utilization of full expansion of the diaphragm and more of a pattern of over utilizing the accessory breathing musculature which this can occur quite young i mean i think when we you know we were joking about it yesterday but you look at my youngest i mean his abdomen is huge and that's obviously an enormous asset to him you can you see it when he breathes it's his its abdominal expansion more than it is thoracic expansion right these you know a child that age if doing thing you know if developing normally is not using any of these accessory respiratory muscles and there's something about this anchor point being in the abdomen right i mean one of the first things i learned in dns was how to regain intra-abdominal pressure yeah through eccentric loading of that cylinder and i i don't think it had ever been presented to me how important that was because prior to that any amount of uh perceived inter-abdominal pressure had been acquired through concentric loading right so for example when trying to pick up something heavy you can you can take two strategies to that i think i think most people would agree if you wanted to pick up 300 pounds right now you must generate pressure in the abdomen i don't i don't think anybody would assume that you could pick up 300 pounds which is twice your body weight without generating pressure here but how you do it matters right so explain those differences and again either with or without the developmental lens but i but i think that the developmental lens is always a great way to think about how kids move right so if you think about developmentally and how that stabilizing stereotype evolves think of it as a an inside out strategy you're creating an intramural pressure to load the abdominal wall and then with the loading of the abdominal wall eccentric isometric and then there's this interplay of all that activity cone centric eccentric isometric to manage that pressure for whatever task that you need to to do so if i'm sitting here and i'm going to pick up that pen i don't i need some function of stabilization to then you know move this limb try to provide a fixed point for my anterior posterior slings to provide a nice position for the shoulder girdle to then again get that synergy throughout the kinematic chain and pick up the pen so there's a certain amount of management uh of that intramural pressure that i need if i go to like the chairs that we're sitting in that we moved earlier this is a lot more weight i'm going to need a lot more coordination and management and creation of intra-abdominal pressure to create the fixed point to transfer the ground reactive forces through my lower extremities through my trunk and pelvis to you know my arms holding holding the chair so there's uh more facilitation of that intradonal pressure so that's what we see developmentally that quality of stabilization and that stabilization it's not static it's it's it's dynamic we should be able to manage that intra abdominal pressure through full extension full rotation full flexion that's the the beauty of that dynamic neuromuscular stability and that's what we see with our that quality we see in the high high level athletes the we can also create stability by bracing and if you think about bracing if someone's going to punch me in the stomach i may go for a cone centric and where the abdominal wall shortens and tightens i'm still creating a a stabilizing function and i can still use that to you know move objects or prefer prepare for for impact when it comes to dynamic movement the the inside out strategy and the central nervous system management of that stabilization allows me to create the stability efficiently where i need it but then also be able to for example relaxed my extremity so with high level movers athletes you see they'll have nice postural foundations they also have very nice cortical function or body awareness so the fetterers the kelly slaters and surfing they have that ability to their movement looks fluid and and effortless so they have that ability to relax and efficiently stabilize where they need to stabilize sometimes you need to uh incorporate that bracing strategy on top of the facilitation of intramural pressure for excessive loads where we go beyond our threshold our functional threshold meaning our ability to keep that quality of stabilization when we go beyond that ability we go into what we call the the functional gap and when we go into the functional gap that's where we see more of that high threshold strategy maybe bracing strategy to get the job done to get that weight up to maybe kick that ball a little extra harder training wise in athletics that's where those athletes spend a lot of time because they're always they're kind of pushing that threshold all the time so you'll see with athletes um a tendency if they're spending all their time training competing in that functional gap beyond the ability to maintain the more more efficient transfer of force and load then that pattern that high threshold compensatory pattern becomes the starts to become the norm with everything picking up the pencil so one of the things that we try to do or i try to do as far as with training and rehabilitation not just with the athletes but with you know the general population is help them facilitate that that quality of stabilization so they can increase that threshold of being able to main you know stay within that that functional threshold or that functional capacity so that when they do have to go into the functional gap and go to those compensatory patterns it's not all the time um well let's let's talk about an elite athlete and again i think the thing with the really the most elite is they don't have to train in dns a lot of them are just doing this naturally i mean that's sort of what makes roger federer great and one of the hallmarks of that greatness is injury prevention it's not just the greatness at what they do it's the longevity with which they can do it yes so uh when i lecture i use federer as an example you know you look at his career just longevity and injury-wise um you know when he he has been injured but usually you see a quick recovery um going back to jager and zelezny um zolajini had a 20-year career in javelin which i don't think is very common jager he's 48 he's still playing um the with jager and zelezny pablo working with them the emphasis was on uh the awareness the facilitation of this ideal stabilizing pattern the timing of of movement the centration throughout the kinematic chain and then with that the ability to we call differentiate you know within for example the pelvis over that that femoral head so the focus was with with them was the quality over quantity i guess you can say like what percentage of his time do you think because obviously federer has just an unbelievable functional capacity how long how often do you think he is in excess of that in that gap zone where he is using compensatory movements that are putting long-term uh stability at risk so i think when you see you see those athletes that rise to the top they have that uh you watch alex federer for example you see the point the creating the point of support the positioning the alignment of everything he's creating naturally that centration and that transfer of force and load there is times maybe he gets out of position or a little extra hardware he's going to go into that functional gap he's naturally has a functional huge functional capacity where he can maintain that i think with him you also and this this goes to to training he has a good team he has trainers that you know are programming certain things in a way and giving him certain things so that he can still facilitate that quality of movement and build uh strength capacity on top of that when things one thing that i see for example out on the the pga tour i'll see you know players that have good programs good coaching you know they'll tend to stay within that functional capacity they're still pushing it and still you know with them it's just repetitive motion which postural habituation pet of motion injury are things that compromise that synergy and coordination of that dynamic stability so if you have good programming dosing loading timing recovery then and on top of that you have amazing body awareness and cortical function you're going to see longevity and you're going to see nice quality of movement what i see on the other end is players athletes poor training programs over training you know spending too much time in the the functional gap um you know falling into what my colleague rich richolm talks about the extensor compression syndrome which you see a lot with lifting with the power athletes which he works with a lot of then you see when you have that reliance on that higher threshold you see more incidents of injury longer recovery verse the opposite the the federers yeah they get injured but they recover fairly quickly and that's what you see again jager and and zelezny are nice examples of that both checks and pavel working with them you know over this 20-year period of time integrating and putting in his ideas and his uh experience with everything that we talked about with those you know rehabilitation pioneers into these athletes um kind of like a little you know test subject so to speak so now you in prague school and dns practitioners that's what we're trying to help integrate with our athletes with the general population so what what percentage of people that you work with are um coming with an injury and and therefore in need of rehabilitation where you're now applying dns to presumably go back to hey this is where the breakdown was let's go back to where that breakdown would have occurred developmentally and go back and rebuild those steps so we're gonna you're gonna learn how to stabilize your neck or stabilize your head using the stabilizing muscles appropriately you're going to learn how to generate concentric intra-abdominal pressure and you're going to learn how to centrate ipsilaterally and contralaterally in all of these things and then what percentage of your uh patients are not coming with an injury but are coming for performance enhancement and saying you know i just can't throw this fastball any faster than 89 miles per hour and the only way i'm going to get that faster is if i can create a better whip between my right hand and my left leg and hip you know so those are two ends of the spectrum and how do you spend your time on those right so a majority of people are coming to me because pain and injury what happens especially with the athletes once we address that once we calm down whether it's if it's an acute or chronic injury we can't we decrease pain and and utilize the the there's different manual methods within dns and then integrating the exercises that are based off of those developmental milestones once i get to a certain point ideally i'm going to work with a trainer or with the coach and hopefully they're on the same you know mindset so that they can then progress to the strength training to the the specific technique more and more these athletes are you know it's a combination of once they're out of pain we work with the quality of stabilization and movement and transfer of force and load um let's take a group of let's say a hundred athletes who come to you in pain again just looking for rough numbers what percentage of them will buy into the thesis of this very non-traditional way of rehabilitating is going to help what percentage of that what what of that hundred will stay with the program to get better right not enough so what's the number uh 10 20 maybe that's it yeah what i see happening you know for example uh major league baseball is integrating dns more and more so um in san diego with the padres i've started to consult with them a bit um there's a hitting coach for the dodgers that comes in and we kind of workshop ideas where you know he's integrating the dns concepts and principles so it's starting to get recognized more for that value as far as the performance enhancement aspects of it culturally within sport what i see um especially in the west there's you know they want numbers they want okay what's their p what's their lift you know what's their their strength capacity which is important but i think it's also important to again like integrate those two the quality of movement stability and then increasing that you know their their strength thresholds but even just with an injury so if you let's just say 100 athletes that are you know let's say gymnasts and hockey players and football players that come in with lower back pain you're saying only 20 of those would stick with the program until they got better 80 of them would abandon the program before they improved um a lot of times and just across the patient population a lot of times once once people are out of pain it's kind of out of sight out of mind they go back they go back into their that's what i'm trying to differentiate which is how many of them just stick with it long enough to get out of pain the next question i'm going to ask is once out of pain how many of them stick with the program and switch basically from rehab to prehab so going back to that one of my goals especially with the athlete once they're out of pain we develop a prehabilitation kind of program and we utilize those again the going back to the knowledge of developmental kinesiology and developmental milestones which uh later we'll we'll actually go through so based on what i'm seeing with their insufficiencies and with with the insufficiency of that coordination of stabilization i will give them certain things certain sequences of movements and exercises that they practice with awareness to facilitate better strategy for stability and then that's part of their movement preparation or prehabilitation before whether it's their strength training or their technique training or going out and and performing and so that's that's a larger percentage because that's part of what i kind of program into the the rehabilitation um so some athletes will get that and they're okay great this is this is good i'm gonna go do it and then occasionally they're coming back and getting uh maybe we're adding to it based on what how they're functioning now other athletes they want more and that's that that's that smaller percentage part of it too probably access you know and availability um as far as being able to be you know in san diego and working one-on-one with me so um you know there's there's different factors that will um tie into how much they're they're doing but within the whole treatment protocol rehabilitation protocol i'm giving them things that they should then integrate into their programs what is the most common chief complaint of a person that walks into your office is it lower back pain that would be my guess yeah majority is low back okay so what are the most common causes of lower back pain that you see across the board if if they're suffering from low back pain whether it's acute or chronic usually there's an underlying pattern of that lack of or the inefficient activation of the the deep stabilizing system and more of a tendency towards that extension compression you know activation that over activation of flexor extensor so you know what that means in a bit more detail given the ubiquity of this injury and the probability that uh 80 of the people listening to this have already experienced back pain or will experience back pain in their lives i want to make sure if people take nothing away from this podcast they understand the etiology of lower back pain yeah so unless you've had a let's say a car accident or a fall that's like an acute injury that can be a cause of of low back pain the majority that i see it's more of a chronic overload over time that if we have that strategy of flex too much flexure extensor activity which compromises the positioning of the intersegmental the joints and the transfer of force and load then with the compensatory pattern we'll see more of a hinging in through that lumbar cycle region and with that hinging over time it's like if you keep bending a spoon you know it's gonna it's gonna break you weaken the uh the structure so you know uh take a disk yeah let's let's let's talk about the actual anatomy and i yesterday i said i wished i'd brought a skeleton so the the sacrum is a is basically a single bone it's actually fused so it it at one point it was multiple bones right so so you have this sort of one fused sacrum and then you have these five lumbar discs numbered one through five now between each of those lumbar um vertebral bodies is a disc um and then there's one between the fifth lumbar vertebral body in the uh sacrum so uh we refer to them as you know l3 l4 is the disc between three and four and l5 s1 is the disc between there right behind each of these vertebral bodies so these these vertebral bodies are sort of held in place um by the discs but then also by the facet joints yes that run behind them and it's really difficult to show this we'll probably have to pull up some images to make this easier for people to see but the the facet joints and the and then sort of the lamina which are these those sort of longer bones hold it all together but they don't really provide this support i think the support is probably at the facet joints and at the disc interface is that probably fair yeah and then think of all the musculature as the scaffolding yeah and the you know the levers and you know that help with that stabilization and then the activation of of that deep stabilization as an uprighting effect and let's talk about which muscles are on the front of that so if you were to cut me open here and let's just say you pull everything out of the way so you pull my bowel out of the way you pull everything and you go right down onto my spine what are the muscles you're gonna see that are attached to the anterior or front portion of my vertebral bodies so two two main ones that we can talk about is the psoas which uh attaches to those transverse processes of the lumbar spine and then the quadratus lumborum which also attaches to those processes both of those they with those attachments they also come up and they attach right where the the diaphragm attaches the crura of the the diaphragm so you know if you and again maybe you can pull up those images and or put it on the show notes um so you see uh the all those kind of coalescing in that thoracic lumbar region if if i have that ideal activation of that descending of the diaphragm and the facilitation of that intra-abdominal pressure that pressure again loads the the abdominal wall and creates that fixed point that the psoas and the quadratus are anchoring off of if that's compromised they don't have anything to anchor off of and then you see that excessive extension and that overload of those facet joints and which exaggerate what the extension posture looks like so people can see it so uh you'll your hips will will move forward so you're if you picture your pelvis as a bowl you're tipping the bowl forward tipping the bowl forward and then if you think of your rib cage rib cage is coming forward as well um so your spine which normally has a bend in it gets more yeah and with that uh uh oblique position of the diaphragm and the pelvic floor now there's a mechanical uh disadvantage of the abdominal wall so we took a cylinder that's supposed to sit like this and we made it like this so now uh the tendency is going to be the extensor over activity and the flexor the psoas so now you're just getting this repetitive compression on those facet joints and the disc is getting this repetitive uh hinging flexion and then in the center of the disc we have the the fluid or the nucleus working its way through those annular fibers as they weaken and then that's where you get the disc uh protrusions or you know substance can leak out and the body will you know go into that that spat that protective spasm also so you'll see the disc injury but then you also see over time facet hypertrophy so the the degenerative changes and the accumulation of bony material trying to help stabilize so part of my story and kind of discovering uh or drove me into utilizing dns discovering prague school i developed what was called a spondylolysis which is a stress fracture in the spine part of the the pars which is you know kind of that that arch that attaches the vertebra and then the to the facet joints so for me with over training uh poor recovery uh poor postural foundations um i was premature and looking back knowing what i know now looking bad pictures or videos of myself i could see that that compensatory pattern it didn't catch up to me till till college you know especially as we're younger we have a huge ability to compensate and we can get away with stuff but in college it caught up to me with the um with that that stress fracture so um i was kind of like the poster boy of upper and lower cross syndrome and lack of efficient uh stabilizing strategy i had plenty of motivation and drive and practice you know hour upon hour but at a certain point you know structure overload of you know in that that for me l4l5 region that gave way when that gave way um then i went into this whole chronic pain cycle and it wasn't until uh you know i went orthopedists uh physical therapists chiropractic all of them helped in their own way but it was i was missing i knew there was something missing so probably for selfish reasons i went into this profession trying to figure out my own pain and try to figure out how to recover and uh you know in in medical school and same chiropractic school first year you're just getting bombarded with all anatomy physiology functional biomechanics all of it was amazing and interesting but i'm like this isn't helping me it wasn't until the second year where i was introduced to prague school yonda and levitt and what they were teaching it was like oh finally something made sense and just intuitively it made sense to to what i was dealing with so i started to you know learn more and more about that while i was in school incorporating some of the treatment methods and the exercises and that that got me you know further along of kind of pulling myself out of my own kind of chronic pain and then in uh once i was out of school uh 97 after a few years there was a clinician uh dr leebinson taking small groups over to prague to learn from those the you know those pioneers and those those prague therapists um so i was able to go over there it was like an eight day uh intensive kind of lectures and workshops got to see levitt but unfortunately the year before yonda had passed away and i believe voita had passed away i think early 2000 2000 2001 but that's that was my uh first introduction to uh professor pavel collage and that time it was his ideas talking about developmental kinesiology and then utilizing that that knowledge to develop the assessments and the the treatment strategies not only you know to the cerebral palsy population but then you know he's talking about the adults and then and then the sports population so once i saw that again that was like another light bulb and another piece of that puzzle for me to to work my way out of it out of my own uh situation and then from 2003 basically i've watched this this evolution of dns the concepts and principles turn into the actual name and then the curriculum of of where we're at now now you're you're quite senior within the the the sort of international community of dns uh you're one of only 18 international instructors isn't that about right yeah what what are the different levels of certification within dns the highest level being where you're at that's can anybody attain that level or do you have to you know be a chiropractor a physician or an osteopathic physician like what are they yeah so there's there's three tracks of the dynamic neuromuscular stabilization curriculum one is a clinical track it's a dns a b and c and then the fourth course is a d course which you actually go to prague and it's like an intensive uh with the with the prague therapist um there's a specific exercise sport uh sequence of courses there's three courses there the first one is focused in clinicians only type of thing the second one is designed for trainers as well as clinicians because ideally we we design that one because we want the two populations working together and on the same page but it's a little more focused towards you know less manual and more of what how you can integrate it into a training program the third is pediatrics where you're going to utilize the dns handling skills with with infants and that's a series of um i believe three courses with a you know the fourth culminating in in prague so that curriculum i believe started to come about 2009 and then off of that we have specialty courses where we integrate you know different things one of prague schools goals it's you know they don't want dns to be a this is a dns technique these are concepts and principles that professor collage you know building on those those founders and his experience and his his ideas it's meant to be integrated into everything else because it can that's one thing i love about it is you can easily integrate it into the good work that you're already doing whether you're a trainer whether you're a clinician and you do a specific technique you know for example the product through the school therapists they did they do visceral mobilization they have specific soft tissue and mobilization techniques and they're constantly exploring and trying to evolve you know the teaching and the and the integration so it's a a nice knowledge base and skill set to have again to enhance what you're already doing and and so i mean this afternoon we're gonna go down and actually demonstrate a lot of the stuff by video because i think that it's really challenging to talk about this stuff it's just not that amenable to a discussion um it really has to be shown um and frankly even showing it is challenging i think experiencing it is is the gold standard that's the that's the ultimate um it's not just movements it's not just specific exercises but it's facilitating the awareness of the um the ideal stabilization and the support and then with that you know with with my patients or whether it's training i want my patients or my athletes to feel the that synergy and feel that uh ability to stabilize where they need to but then also relax where they need to and it's a there's a little bit of a process it's not a cookie cutter thing like just do this this this um you have to put some work into it you have to practice it both as a patient and as a clinician or trainer and i guess that would be you know maybe uh one of the drawbacks for people is you know everything out there people are doing doing good work and trying to help people um and if you know they have something that's working for them and we introduce these concepts and principles and they're not easily integrated then um maybe they don't they don't adapt them or they'll adapt a portion of them which is you know fine as well but it's it's something that uh in the curriculum uh you know we try to emphasize the the need for um you know feeling and practicing the movements that we can show later i mean i can only speak for myself um but i wonder if my generalization is correct i think my guess would be that the people who come to dns late in life with an injury get better but then stick with it are probably people who like to really tinkle tinker with things and like to toil away and don't necessarily need quick results but can sort of anchor to a philosophy they sort of have faith in it and then they can sort of keep pursuing it because um it a you don't it it feels a lot of the time like you're not doing much you know and i think for someone who's used to you know being quite impatient with what they you know i want results today and you know hey i just started crossfit and two days later i'm doing power cleans like this is awesome um and and if if that's the if that's the dopamine surge that a person needs they're gonna i think they're gonna struggle with a system where you might spend a week you know daily practicing learning how to breathe again and you'll never stop practicing that by the way you'll never stop practicing you know a really great breathing pattern and a really great pattern of accessing these deep stabilizing muscles we've spoken about and practicing all of these infant-like movements and yes it gets more challenging over time and you do these flows that become quite enjoyable and can be very challenging i mean there most of these things i still can't even do actually especially with weight um but i don't know i guess i would say i always think of things in medicine through the lens of efficacy and effectiveness so efficacy is how well does something work if it's adhered to correctly effectiveness is if you just throw it out in the real world how well does it work right to me dns might be the single most efficacious thing i have ever come across as far as you know healing injury and preventing injury i'm not sure if it's the most effective thing which is not a knock on it but the point is to your point earlier a lot of people aren't going to do it you know especially once you get them out of pain they're not going to want to stay with it now i don't know why that is but that's the thing that i would hope that dns can improve upon in the next decade it's only a decade old but it's like how do we take this thing that is so efficacious again meaning if a person actually does it they're going to get better it's almost impossible not to fix back pain neck pain shoulder pain like all of these injuries they're going to get better where where we want to do it is make sure that hey people you know we want 90 of people to be able to stick to it once they start right um part of that is with the curriculum whether you're a clinician or a trainer the part of the process is with the assessment you're training your eye just like a good coach will recognize um you know something not right with the the runner or the tennis player or the the golf swing um you know you can uh dns will have the specific assessment and those specific exercises based off of development once you develop your eye and recognize where the insufficiencies are you can recognize that insufficiency of stability within the swing within the running within the the lift so you can in in my opinion um you can get to the point where you can utilize these concepts and principles communicate them in a way you know to the deadlift or to the runner where you can help them in that manner maybe they're not doing the specific developmental movement but you're giving them ideas as far as loading cueing that will facilitate that um that efficiency so that's the challenge you're dealing with in major league baseball is you know that there's a way to get an extra four miles an hour out of a pitch but you also know that that athlete probably doesn't want to or doesn't have the time to maybe i would argue they should have the time to but maybe doesn't want to go back and do all of the fundamental movements and master what a what an infant does so now your challenge is while you're on the pitching mound how do i put a principle in you that's going to create a little more whip-like stability right part of that is training up the staff that will be dealing with that athlete full full time the more uh skilled and you know movement towards mastery of that the better it's going to be for the the people that they work with so part of that is that process that education that that learning process and um that's what i see you know people starting to to ask for to to help with because a lot of people will will take the coursework and they're like oh man yeah that's awesome how do i integrate it and that's also um part of the curriculum we've created kind of specialty courses so for example there's certain expertise within prague school we have a prague therapist that focuses on the running athlete we have one of the instructors danced professionally so we have a you know a dance specific exercise sport course we've done golf we've done baseball dr ohm has a strength specific lifting specific course talking about that integration so we're trying to create uh kind of that curriculum to help with that integration because if we just have the standard courses you know more that's gonna tend to be clinical um and uh but if we show how to actually do the integration within the specialty course whoever's working with those athletes or an athlete themselves that's gonna be we're gonna be able to communicate it better because they understand that um you know that sport we've been done we've done uh you know a hockey specific um one of the czech therapists works with the national czech national hockey team so obviously huge you know experience and then we show the integration so that's part of that evolution of trying to communicate these concepts and principles better help people integrate them better so that we can again enhance what we're doing with our patients and and with our athletes or with our you know people that want to focus on performance well michael this has been this has been interesting and i think it's going to get a lot more interesting when we when we go and roll around on the mats a little bit and and um i think give a little bit more of a visual explanation of what a lot of this stuff looks like so thanks so much for sharing your insights and uh keeping up the fight thank you that went faster than i thought and i just feel like we scratched the surface so i don't know looking forward to to showing it to help people uh understand it a little bit better thank you yeah and and hopefully once people see it they'll want to take that next step which is feeling it and i i truly i truly think that only when you feel this do you do you understand it and i think that's true of not just dns i think that's true of pri and frc and all these other things that we've spoken about that in my mind all have a place in both the world of rehab and prehab yeah if you if you can feel it then you can start to integrate it and you know
