[00:00:00] one of the differences however is between health and say the safety element Etc is and one of the reasons I've really looked at safety and transportation from my sleep interests is death can be instantaneous right I mean it's like in milliseconds and and you don't go out in that day thinking it's going to happen and as you were saying yeah you don't get to say goodbye you don't get to say goodbye to your grandmother who's got cancer for two years yeah someone comes to your door they're not coming home you know I mean it's just sort of it's a different it's like just like that right um and so I think that's one thing that separates it in some ways from those chronic illnesses and you know many other kinds of things but I would also say there's some real significant parallels when I think about this because one of the big pushes that I've tried to to make happen in the automotive realm is trying to move from a more reactive safety culture to a more proactive one hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music]

[00:01:07] AA well Mark thank you so much for joining uh me here today this is uh this is certainly a topic that I don't think gets enough attention given the the consequences of it and it's um it's also a topic that I think maybe people don't necessarily appreciate the the frequency of of such interactions and and I guess one one of the things I'm hoping to understand today is how much of you know the nature of what we're going to discuss today is under our control um I know that as I think about you know the things that are a threat to our lifespan a number of these things are are kind of uh out of our control uh but many of them are actually in our control uh certain diseases for example like cardiovascular disease are almost entirely within our control and you know genes play a role but but your ability to sort of um go above and beyond the the genetic hand your dealt is is significant but here when it comes to

[00:02:06] Accidental deaths and and as a you know as a subset of that the the the role that fatigue plays in that I I want to really explore this but but I think before we do I think it's important that people really get a sense of you and your background when we decided we wanted to spend time on this topic uh it felt almost too good to be true that we discovered you and your work um the way the way things sort of work Mark is you know basically uh you know we sit around and brainstorm ideas that we want to cover and um and then we go out and look for an expert that's 99% of our podcasts work in that way um so anyway it was just great to I remember when Nick came to me and said okay you know this is what we found and I was like wow that that seems amazing we're going to really answer a lot of questions I've always had so um but but tell us a little bit about your background because the first thing that stood out to me was how at a very young age you lost your father yeah let's start there right um long time ago but it still is challenging to talk about actually let me just Begin by thanking you for making this topic part of your discussion in your podcast you already said it this is so prevalent in everybody's life just being on the road everyone's a pedestrian at some point we're all in vehicles moving around and that we have come to accept the Carnage in ways that should just be unacceptable in our society so without bringing more Focus including what you can control like what should I be doing to be safer um versus things that I can't uh just a critical conversation I really appreciate you taking the time to do this um and I paused for a moment because it actually was not until my Senate confirmation hearing to be administrator of Nitsa that I really talked publicly about this very much um but my father was a San

[00:03:59] Francisco motorcycle policeman uh he was chasing a traffic violator and somebody ran a red hit him and he was killed in the line of duty actually just over my shoulder that's a shadow box with his badge and purple heart um he was 30 years old my brother and I I was 3 and a half my brother was two raised by a single parent and

[00:04:19] I I'm okay talking about this to start with because it just points out this is personal for me um and I've told people it's like I don't wear that as a badge on my shoulder every time we have the conversation um but it is clearly foundational to sort of what has put me on a lifelong path of pursuing safety and how to make people's lives safer and one of the things I often talk about I'm sure we'll get to it is if you want to know how many lives were lost on our roads make sure you know the exact number because every one of those numbers is a father or mother or sister or brother or you know some relative or one of your neighbors etc those are real people and we cannot bring them back and

[00:05:01] I think that that too often when we start talking about all the statistics we walk right by the human part of this and that gets lost and really that's where we should always start yeah there's a quote that I'm not remembering exactly but it speaks to the idea that you know uh a million people is a statistic but you know a small number of people is a story and and um I

[00:05:26] I agree with that completely I mean I think we we can get very numb to what those numbers mean um I don't know if you've seen it but there's there's there's a a series on Netflix right now that takes a lot of old footage from World War II and um basically does some remarkable uh technology application where it puts it back into color and makes it really remarkable and so it's a six-part series on World War II that is um like I think anybody who's watched it has has shared my reaction to it which is it's stunning but what's hard to Fathom as you go through this is the loss of life and you you know you hear about well you know 60 million or 80 million I don't even remember people lost their lives globally obviously we're aware of 6 million people being exterminated in concentration camps um and yet I realized as I came to the end of that I don't even know what that means cuz I've never seen 6 million people with my eyes

[00:06:27] I've never seen 1 million people with my eyes so it's it's very difficult to explain those things and what I think this um series does very well is what you've done which is you get a few stories you get a few stories that are very representative of the horrific nature of what happened um and then at least you have some semblance of saying wow now imagine multiplying that by a thousand or a million and the numbers numb you yeah as you just said it's like I don't know what that really means so it numbs you very often in in talks I would actually start with kind of what we call in the business bent metal and so you know having been at the NTSB I'll literally take photos from investigations you know minus the humans but it's like this was you know Dawn at 20 years old you know and she not only lost her life but the people in this minivan you see you know four out of the five died and the only one who didn't was a child in a car I mean that makes it real for people and what you hope is people translate that to this could be you yeah or a partner or your kids or your neighbor you know people that matter um and there's this huge gap between those numbers you're talking about which most people have no concept and the fact that when somebody actually in your circle loses their life in some kind of Crash you know that makes it very personal and again you can't bring them back there's no coming back from that well I definitely want to get into these statistics both in terms of you know people in cars people as pedestrian cyclist Etc but but before we do I do want to kind of come back a little bit to your story um because um you know I want people to kind of understand your training and and you know how you found out how you you know what what took you to Yale you did your PhD there what you studied and how that ultimately kind of led to to what you're doing now so so tell us as much or as little as you think is is necessary for for listeners to to kind of get a sense of um the the trajectory you've taken to where you are today I'll give you the arc and it's more of a zigzag whatever you want to go in depth let me know because as always there are interesting stories along the way um I'm trained as a scientist I was actually a Premed at

[00:08:46] Stanford and had the incredibly Good Fortune to take a course called sleep in dreams when I was a sophomore and it was taught by William DeMent mdphd a professor in the medical school and Dr DeMent was part of the team that discovered REM sleep and some believe he was actually the guy who coined the term

[00:09:04] REM sleep and as you know even though we all as a human race have been you know sleeping since crawling out a portal slime uh we only knew about non-r and REM in the mid-50s um and so Dr DeMent came to Stanford and started really one of the first Sleep Centers and was teaching this undergraduate course um and it was just fascinating he was this passionate charismatic Professor who was engaging and here's this medical school

[00:09:29] Professor teaching an undergraduate course which by the way at the time the two most popular courses were sleeping dreams and human sex another Medical School Professor you know it's kind of like for undergraduates what else is there it was just fascinating but what was really brilliant about what Bill did is he actually offered a couple courses you could take a course and become a TA for sleeping dreams or you could take another course and learn where to put electrod and how to score sleep and actually get involved in research so the summer of my sophomore year Rising Jr I actually got signed up to be a research assistant staying up all night in a laboratory okay so think about it that as an undergraduate was an incredible experience um you'll decide if we talk about this later but everything got cancelled that summer except one project which was studying the effects of the water bed surface on sleep uh you know was the 70s and I actually met my wife during that study it's worked out quite nicely um but it was a way to get involved in research as an undergraduate that you don't usually get um the opportunity so that kind of changed everything um and frankly when I graduated Dr DeMent made an offer for me to stay and run research projects and the reason I bring that up is because if you knew where the electrod went and this is a k complex a sleep spindle here's how you score sleep you could run projects and so I did that for a few years and I tell people that was like doing a postdoc before going to graduate school my direct Supervisor was Dr

[00:10:52] DeMent okay so I did three years of doing and that's why when I was ready I actually applied to medical school but changed because at the time there was no sleep specialty there was no sleep medicine Fellowship there was no training in any of that Dr DeMent was pushing to make that real um and so I decided you know if I wanted to spend a career looking at sleep it was go get a

[00:11:14] PhD and so as you mentioned I ended up at Yale great academic research program but could also get clinical training so if I wanted to deal with humans and projects and stuff I could get my training in Clinical Psychology but still do research the interesting spin actually after that is and I appreciate the chance to talk a little more about this than just dates um but when I was finishing my PhD uh somebody I knew from Stanford Mary car scadden who had been at Stanford and she and Bill actually created what is now the gold standard for objectively measuring sleepiness called the multiple sleep latency test nobody ever thought

[00:11:51] Mary would leave Stanford and she was about to start a new position at the brown medical schools an assistant professor there um she had one technician ready to go and she called me up and said Mark would you like to come and do a postto so there were three of us getting her program started at Brown um it was an incredible experience the plan was to stay go on the faculty Etc and instead I end up going back and working for Bill running a human research program for a while so you know

[00:12:18] I'm hardcore academic sleep but part of my job was to get new projects going and so I got engaged with NASA ases Group which is one of the NASA facilities out here in Mountain View California um and they were doing fatigue jet lag research but didn't have many actual sleep people helping them do that some chronobiology circadian people but it was fascinating because they were doing a study that required recording EEG in a cockpit and they weren't really sure how to do that so part of my job was to actually help them problem solve that so we could record Pilots brain and eye movement activity in ongoing way during flights fascinating and I mentioned that cuz that was a transition really out of the very specific academic kind of environment to NASA and so I end up being recruited to work there and directed the program at the NASA ases fatigue countermeasures program for seven years and it was fantastic and I think it emphasizes what has become sort of for me you know again not just personal but a clear focus of my career and that is the application of the science into real world application and so that's really been a a force for me throughout my career hence the safety emphasis you know great sleep science

[00:13:29] Circ but how do you use that to help people every day whether that's driving a car or flying a space shuttle what do you do to make that better I did that for seven years actually ended up uh that was Commercial and Military Pilots astronauts controllers at Johnson Space Center Etc fantastic incredible work love to talk about that too I hope um and then I started my own company which Braden it from Aerospace to basically everybody so when I had my own company we work with folks in all modes of transportation uh basically all over the world in healthare energy uh military operations you name it was fantastic the next part that was so interesting part of the zag um was I had the opportunity to become a board member at the national

[00:14:15] Transportation safety board so there five members that are there these are the kind of positions where they call you you don't actually submit a resume uh I had done some work at Nasa helping them identify fatigue in a DCA crash in Guantanamo Bay before anybody knew that there's a naval air station there a DCA crash and the NASA group we helped them at the ntsp Define the methodology to investigate fatigue and they ended up identifying fatigue as the probable cause in that particular crash um and that has kind of become the methodology that they used so you know 10 years later it was amazing to basically get a phone call and say would you like to be considered for a board member position so I was a board member at the NTSB for 5 years uh launched on seven crashes and sat through about 50 investigations that we voted on and I was ready to stay for a second 5-year term when I got a call to become the head of Nitsa which is the national highway traffic safety administration um and that's the administrator of the organization within the department of transportation that is responsible for all car and vehicle safety regulation and enforcement um and I was there for just a couple of years because that one is tied to the president basically um unbelievable experience again if you think about what we just talked about which is how do you take you know the science and data and actually apply it to make things safer better was an incredible experience there and when I left Washington I actually came back and worked uh as the chief safety Innovation officer at an autonomous vehicle company which is like a way at the other end of the Continuum that's been fascinating as well yeah it's it's it's interesting because there's this marriage between two things that you're talking about right which is one could have stayed entirely within the world of sleep and done obviously very interesting work and you are fortunate to have been at

[00:16:03] Stanford which in many ways certainly was the epicenter of sleep research um at least in the US and potentially in the world um and then you've also got this you know interest in in safety and crashes right obviously the nstb um so um I I think you know we're going to talk about both of these things today I think I'd like to just start probably on the Automotive Safety side of things and

[00:16:32] I think what will come out of that is the role that fatigue plays and then we can certainly talk about that I said earlier we're going to kind of put some statistics out there can you give me a sense of what it means to be uh uh you know what is the risk for death or injury that somehow touches the road so that means again you're you're you're a passenger in a vehicle you're driving a vehicle you're a pedestrian struck by a vehicle you're a cyclist strike struck by a vehicle however you organize that

[00:17:07] Mark can you give me a sense of what that looked like in 19 50ish you know versus 1970 is versus 2000ish versus today or you know G give us a sense of what that looks like let's start with uh the final numbers from 2021 which is the last year we actually have complete data uh

[00:17:43] 42,900 and 18 people every single day and and good for you it's like give me that number again this is what I was telling you it's like you know you should know the exact number um because those are people individuals we can't bring them back that's 118 every day and a lot of times people often it's like so how come I don't hear more about this or why AR we F you like the pandemic meant it was all hands on deck let's go get this like how can we put up with this you know when you think about it these happen geographically separated so these are happening all over the country right and very often it could be an individual in one of those Vehicles so it may affect your family or your community but very often most of these go you know unreported in the General Media or visibility for our society 118 lives every single day just to put it in context along with that we have about two and a half million injuries which are everything from slight to very serious life-changing injuries and those are in the context of six plus million crashes every single year and I won't go into this in any depth but just to put it on global scale it's about 1.4 million people globally every year and and that's about 3,700 people every single day but we're going to focus just on the United States and I think your um question is really important because we know over the years things have come down you know very significantly with all kinds of different things I'm sure that we're going to talk about but it used to be like literally a 100 years ago in 1923 it used to be about 18.5 deaths per 100 million miles now we're down to about 1.5 so we often talk about vehicle miles traveled or VMT and that's important just because of uh the number of miles driven and the number of people that are out there doing there's a lot of different ways to to cut this and by the way I'm sure we'll go into some detail but at nsa.gov nhtsa.gov Nitsa keeps all kinds of data on this you can look up any year you want and it's segmented segmented by ages and geography States know I mean it's like the level of detail is unbel unbelievable what's out there um I will just comment that for a lot of people when they look at the data the reason I cite 21 it's the last year that we have actual final data so we can talk about what we know from 2023 but those are estimates just done on a quarterly basis yeah okay um and I'm sure we'll talk about it but we get those and they adjust up and down a bit but it's the big numbers that really matter there two things that just jump out at me when you rattle off the stats Mark the the first is I'm just doing really quick math in my head both on the global count and on the US count and this is approximately oneth the mortality for cancer uh in the

[00:20:41] US it's a little bit better than on10th but globally it's actually slightly worse than on10th um so a that's incredible it might also say that in the US we are probably safer on average than globally on a on a individual basis uh um so not not sure if that's true but that would be my first thought um the the second thing that just kind of jumps out at me when you talk about this is something I remember you know somebody saying once that I think is absolutely true um if you read about a death in the newspaper it's because the manner in which it happened was so unexpected or so is somehow so horrific to us and that's why you don't read about people having heart attacks I mean let's not lose sight of the fact that that's the leading cause of death um and that occurs 20 times more frequently than what we're talking about and I don't know the last time I read about somebody having a heart attack for the sake of having a heart attack and dying it's if it's somebody famous or whatever um but you know so common things just generally don't get reported on and and I think sadly that's probably why we are a little bit numb to what's going on here even though I would argue that there's a difference which is we see as those of us who are driving by and see this Carnage are kind of left a bit visibly shaken by it um and I find it difficult to get information I'll give you one example I live in uh I live in Texas and you know we have big roads out here that are big and fast and and I think a lot of them are not necessarily set up as the safest roads and there there's a particular Road near where we live where um I I believe there's probably a fatal accident on this road three or four times a year um and yet even after it happens I'll go and do a quick search to see if I can get more information and it's not readily available it's not entirely obvious what just happened um so if that's happening under my nose where I'm seeing the accident or you know seeing the aftermath of it within 25 minutes or something I I can completely appreciate why most of these deaths go unnoticed by all those all those except for the people directly impacted by the relationship that's the numbness you know they're they're off the radar they're not visible even locally to many people so that's why I often site NTSB statistics or experiences because those are usually you know not necessarily

[00:23:20] Mash casually but there's usually a lot of people involved there have to be fatalities um and they're very visible as you mentioned very often it's because they're visible to the entire country you know and they get invested takes a year 18 months to investigate those Etc but as you're pointing out if it's not in the local police blot that it happened there's almost never followup that actually say oh by the way you know what reported on last month here's what actually happened there okay and and I just mentioned that because I tell you from the NTSB when you investigate these it's always a chain of events you know it's never just one thing um and it takes a while to figure that out and and just to be clear a lot of that sometimes is just the local resources you know I mean I just to be clear you know in the last few years traffic enforcement resources in local police departments have gone down so as you were just saying that look you know they may go and run to the scene right when they've got to help people in that emergency situation but the ongoing investigation may be checking a box on a form you know and then so it stays below the radar for most people unless you're in the circle that that person touches your life yeah and I and I struggle with this a lot mark because I feel like there's this enormous missed opportunity so I I look at an intersection that's no more than three miles from our house we've only lived here for we haven't lived here for 4 years I have already seen three fatal accidents at that intersection in four years now I'm not and I can't find any really good information about the chain of events and what happen happened I have some sense a little bit but to me it's like why is that why aren't there 4minute videos being made that explain every one of these as a here's what not to do here are the warning signs at this time of day when the light is this way this is a very easy mistake to make and the other thing we don't really have a sense of

[00:25:21] Mark is the near misses right you you you know if three accidents have resulted in fatalities and by by the way I'm not saying three people have died I'm seeing three fatal accidents it's probably you know six or seven people have died there in 3 years but I mean you can tell me Mark but what would be your guess as to how many accidents have occurred there or near misses occurred there that could have resulted in fatalities do you have a sense of how you could even estimate that you could um and just two things about this one you're describing in what we call in human factors that sort of safety pyramid yeah crashes are at the top near misses are right underneath that but a bigger layer and the and the layer underneath that are errors and this is why a lot of people where you see proactive safety and

[00:26:09] Aviation they do a lot of work trying to capture those errors knowing that they lead to near misses and when near misses get more visible you see the panic in aviation right now because they're seeing more critical near Miss incidents because those are the precursors to the crashes that occur right yes and so I think you know to your point so you could calculate that and I got to tell you make a list because out of this conversation there's some concrete things that either you or I need to pursue and well the one you just mentioned is we got to make these more visible rather than just the family and

[00:26:42] Community feeling it it's your point which is even in a 4-minute video you could capture what happened and what was learned from that and that could be enough for people say okay I got to pay attention to that CU I go through that intersection every day twice yeah yeah exactly four four times a day I am driving through that place that is the

[00:27:01] Bermuda Triangle of death and if yeah once a year there's going to be a death or series of deaths uh probably five times a day there's a near Miss probably 60 times a day there's an error that could have even been a near miss and yet I don't actually know the predisposing factors I'm kind of extrapolating and making up from the sort of you know hom you know sort the data out there that I know Loosely that we'll talk about today but um but yes this is um this is very troubling so I think you know um we we've kind of I think hopefully made the case for why this matters just a couple of other questions before we get into some of the specifics um and I won't expect you to um rattle off with the same Precision but can you give some commentary on what these numbers would have looked like 20 years ago 40 years ago 60 years ago I mean I have to think that you know with with airbags and seat belts and better cars better car technology in terms of you know the collapsibility of cars um that things have gotten better like is it easier to just start in the 1950s and presumably it was just Mass

[00:28:14] Carnage what's interesting is as cars just became more prevalent that's when the numbers went up and yes in the 50s you saw huge numbers which were actually part of what initiated efforts to establish the national highway traffic safety Administration which was what had responsibility for creating Federal

[00:28:32] Motor Vehicle Safety standards like crash testing all of those so um if you go again a 100 years back we're probably over 90% reduced to where we are today um probably in the 50s and 60s are where you saw the peak of those numbers and they've been coming down uh I would just say because we're talking about this in the statistical sense what's interesting is we have really population level statistics we talk about 42,00 929 um what's interesting is we get these estimates every quarter and then it takes a while to finalize it again we don't need to get into it but literally nit a collects reports from every Police

[00:29:10] Department in the country to come up with these numbers so it takes a long time to collect all that data review it finalize it Etc but I say that because the estimates often prompt people to say oh we're down 3% this quarter from last quarter I think we should celebrate those lives right that have been that are still with us at the same time that 2% 3% 4% up or down within the context of the overall population numbers we haven't budged much and I'm sure we're going to talk about it but I got to give you one example you know a lot of people think you know we've Cur trunk driving right it's been around forever we know about it we've got all these things we can do when you look at the 42,900

[00:29:58] that has stayed about 30% for 20 years so 30% of the lives lost are due to that for about 20 years so the absolute number has come down but the percentage has stayed about the same for 20 years and then again on that list right below that is speeding and now we've got number three that's distraction and I'm sure we'll be talking about all of those but again I think you know to your point it's both the large population numbers 50s we started seeing that Peak now again it's down to about 1.5 you know per 100 million miles that we see um but I do warn people is again when you start looking at just the quarterly to quarterly estimate up or down by 1 or 2% that will Bell what is actually the larger population things that aren't changing dramatically enough if we're ever going to actually say get to zero deaths on our roadways and Mark you mentioned that alcohol contributed to about 30% of those fatalities what is the contribution of speed and distraction approximately so speeds over 20% uh I want to say somewhere between 20 and 25% um distraction is very difficult right I mean it's just like um but I I just actually uh called a friend of mine who's there's this guy Larry blinko who's a great statistician in Nitsa he's starting to think it could actually be up to 30% okay and part of it you got to realize these are not individual numbers right so somebody drinking could be on their phone they could be going too fast somebody who's on their phone could be going right it's like they all mix and match um but they're pretty big numbers um so it's at least a third uh which again takes you into like 33 35% range for the alcohol impaired region speeding's in the I again 20 to 25% probably and the distraction used to be considered somewhere in the 12% but I think Larry's new data is going to suggest it's probably much higher maybe close to a third with some of them and especially if we talk about it you know distraction is more than just your phone um that people do in their vehicle so when you look at all of just like impairment is more than alcohol now yeah that's a great great question so to be clear I said alcohol but really impairment is that broader category of which alcohol is probably still the most prevalent in fact at Nitsa um it's so appropriate for this conversation but impairment was always 3DS drunk drugged distracted and when I was there it's like and I credit my son actually it's like where's the fourth D dad drowsy because really any one of those would be enough to impair your driving ability so now impairment you do have to think broadly that it could be any one of those to your point alcohol is still the number one yeah boy there's so much

[00:32:44] I want to talk about I'm just trying to think about how to how to structure it so I don't miss miss anything um let's talk a little bit about um more let's let's go deeper into this contributing Factor thing okay so um the most obvious thing in the distraction realm is the Advent of the phone right so prior to I don't know early 2000s right phones were you know not readily used um can we appreciate or is there an appreciable signal in the data that suggests that the downward trajectory of mortality has been slowed or in any way altered with the uh introduction of mobile phones you know 20 to 25 years ago I I think the way we would be able to characterize it is that we stopped seeing the decrease that we had been seeing okay okay um and

[00:33:42] I say that because as you know two things one is it's really hard to measure the distraction numbers yeah right I mean it's just so difficult same thing with drowsy you know sleepiness and stuff um and and the other part is just the evolution of the phone where first it was just you know on a phone call if you will but now it's texting and looking up stuff on the I it's just so diverse the activities that you could be engaged in and so again I think um that maybe the way to think about it is more that we were making progress in a bunch of ways that flattened or maybe got a little bit worse and we may not be able to put all of our you know quote variants all of our right appropriate that to specifically just phones um but

[00:34:22] I would also say it took to a new level the distractions you could get in your car because some of them have been around for a long time playing with the radio we can talk about buttons versus you know touch screens Etc kids in the back seat um you know those kind of distractions been around forever but again I think as those were getting more controlled you saw the numbers come down phones I think again we could look at them more as a flattening out probably has there been any significant change in the past 40ish years with respect to the Dem Graphics of the drivers at fault in these crashes in other words are we seeing a shift to younger people to older people any anything that you can point to that um for which there's a there's a causal explanation so there are two groups that seem to be most at risk those are the 16 to 17 year olds and about the 65 to 70 plus and and the conjecture around those two clearly we're talking about people who are just learning to drive and who are at an age that you know don't have that frontal cortex fully developed um I have a friend of mine Greg balink you always talked about it's like there's a hole in their head right there so we're letting those people behind a couple tons of metal who don't have you know very little experience and just learning stuff and at the other end you've got people getting older who actually um some of it may be aging specific effects the other is more just how much they're actually driving and experience in that sort of thing but those are the two main age groups that we see um that are mostly affected more men than women die in these crashes um and again there's a lot so many questions with that some of it segmented some of it to your point the causal or contri parts of that would just be us with hypothesis about you know what's actually causing those differences and things what was the ration for letting people drive at the age of 16 when if you think about other things that are mandated by age you have uh an age at which you can join the military you have an age at which you can vote you have an age at which uh you can drink alcohol purchase firearms so there are various things that seem you know

[00:36:48] Tethered to age but driving is the youngest and I'm um I've always wondered you know I didn't get my driver's license till I was like almost 18 because I viewed it as a badge of honor to ride my bike and take the bus everywhere and I didn't want to be lazy like I was a weird kid in that way um so I personally can't I can't relate to what it's like to be a 15-year-old who's dying to get his license um but but tell me a little bit about that that process and how that came to be and and for example given the stats you just shared why that age hasn't been pushed up I don't know you so I'm like I don't blow smoke and so I don't mind Tanya nobody's asked me that question before and and

[00:37:33] I'm going to go look that up now because nobody's really had a discussion around that you know the discussion is all about our education system driver Zed um in so many other areas we've got recurrent training right I mean you have that in medicine you have that for professional drivers Pilots Etc how can we take these young people I you know how they actually came up with that age um and came up with what are we going to do around that age to actually prepare these people for lifelong Driving

[00:38:03] Experience I'm going to go look that one up I I really I don't know that's the first time somebody's actually asked me that but it's fascinating because I would also say part of your point is we've actually not gone back to question whether we need to change that or not right which as you know time maybe there was a reasonable I can give you an example I could pontificate and say look

[00:38:24] I mean kids were working you know jobs they needed to be able to get there and da D and it's like okay maybe all those things are true is that true today I don't I don't know um the other thing that has always struck me um and one thing you should know about me Mark I I do love driving um and I love driving race cars and I so I love all things

[00:38:43] Motorsport related and I love doing um you know I love drifting like doing all of these things and one of the things I've been trying to encourage my wife and daughter my daughter's 15 so she'll be you know she we're coming into this discussion and I've I've been trying to organize a course for my daughter and some of her friends where um we we get a group of really good driving instructors on a you know 20 acre skid pad to really teach them high-end driving skills um the stuff I certainly didn't learn when

[00:39:19] I was young but um the things that I've learned driving a race car which is everything not to do right like your natural inclination when this happens is going to be to do this and you will spin the car and if you're lucky nothing else will happen if you're unlucky you'll hit something else and if you do this you'll actually flip the car um and I don't believe that you can just academically out learn that you have to just do the

[00:39:49] Reps you have to be on the track in the car doing it over and over again um so again I'm guessing that there has been some calculation that has said we can't justify putting those resources into mandatory driver education right it's just people have decided that we just can't request that kids learn that I don't think so I think it's what we went the first part of your question which is

[00:40:15] I don't think people have questioned from the beginning why did we even start there are we preparing these people you know these kids well enough for this life experience of driving and how do we revisit that in our knowledgeable technology driven Society how do we actually go and upgrade that you know to something that could actually save their lives and the people around them better

[00:40:37] I don't think those questions have been asked okay and I'm with you I think the intellectual academic part of lessons great but unless you do the muscle memory part of the behavioral piece of actually experiencing it I I don't think there's any question I don't mind telling you um since you're familiar with F1 you know Jean Todd and um he actually I've got to know him over the years he's got this high level panel and what's been fascinating he is now the un's sort of Ambassador for Global Road

[00:41:05] Safety oh I didn't know that and he he's just taken that on from you know not only his F1 days but his Ferrari days Etc but he's taken this on with a passion you know to like how do we take what we've learned there and applied it and why am I mentioning that because you already have the one idea about the videos this is another one you should write down because this is one of those

[00:41:25] Investments right if we get these kids early it's a lifelong investment right of the ones who actually learn how to do this and be better at driving than the ones who took sit in the course or do it online and never get behind till they actually know where the you get behind the wheel to know where the signal is you know where your turn signal at that's not really much education and again I think it's more not that the analysis is done and we should write it off I think it's people haven't asked those questions or taking the time and I mentioned John just because you know what let's send him a letter let's come up with what you're doing formulate that and send a letter and say so somebody at the very least ought to do this and let's study it and see if you can't come up with a course that would make sense because what we just talked about is that investment now could be huge in saving lives and costs let's talk a little bit about the the locations I always tell my patients that there's there are three areas where you need to really have a heightened sense of awareness to protect yourself um and feel free to just correct anything I'm saying that is not 100% correct because again my data is a little bit old but the three things I say is one you have to be hypervigilant in intersections and that's both um the the standard four-way intersection but also a T intersection like when you're coming out of a mall or something and you know you're coming out of a gas station or something like that um the second place is the uh two-way traffic without a median uh de devastating especially as I said we have these roads here that are 60 M hour roads with no median um so you know personally those roads scare me but there's they're unavoidable where I live and then I think the third place you have to be aware is um on freeways and in particular around exits and on-ramps where people are acting sometimes irrationally you know merging trying to get off at the last second trying to get on you know doing silly things like that and and I basically say look if you can harness the power power of your attention only you know selectively well driving make it those three spots so what would you say to that Mark would you what would you add to that and can you comment on what fraction of fatalities are a result of crashes under those three scenarios yeah I think you've actually nailed it um I'm not sure I can give you the exact percentages for each one of those but in it's it's actually in the order you've got and I'll I would do is say you've got the intersection part which is any intersection as you pointed out right um the second is beyond just the median in the road it's any road separation so that's true not only of vehicles but also pedestrians and bicyclists okay so you know you were think about the median in the middle but it's also on the sides where you know unfortunately last 10 years we've seen literally a 50% increase in pedestrian deaths again I'm sure we'll talk more about that but again that has to do with what you're describing um not just the median in the road but it lets expand that to separation of the vehicles from again the sides where pedestrians and cyclists might be as well um so I think you know those those Garner it and and you're on and off ramp of uh you know any kind of system again with the issue there is the speed differential right uh and that that's the the challenge you have there is trying to figure out not just that I have to merge but you know the speed you need to merge with tr traffic going at whatever their flow is in that particular situation um and I I think the other part it's great for us to talk about the statistics you know we love to hit the bell curves and like these are the highest but I always point out we also got to do those edge cases because lives still get lost in those yeah you know and and I think one of my mantras is never again you know when those kinds of specialy educations happen you need to share that data hence that 4-minute video is so interesting where there's common or Edge case so it doesn't happen again you know you should need every intersection in the world or every you know to go through that kind of loss of life to decide we should change something we should do something different here in some way and unless you make it visible understanding the causal and contributory factors you can't make those changes and just so I understand Mark there I I've I've seen accidents where a driver makes a slight mistake um but it becomes catastrophic and and I'm always taken back to 199 uh 94 when uh my my hero aanna died uh May 1st at IMA and Max Mosley who was the head of the uh Fia at the time I knew oh you did WOW Max Max said something very very insightful at the press conference in the days following Sena crash because the Press understandably were completely fixated on why he crashed how did Senna crash how and

[00:46:32] Mosley said you're asking the wrong question he crashed because he is the best driver in the world driving a car at the physical mechanical limit of what it is capable of doing crashes are going to occur the question isn't why did he crash the question is why did he die and he really made sure that the sport took a turn at that moment in we will not tolerate drivers dying we might not be able to stop the crashes but there will be no more deaths and knock on wood there has only been one death in F1 in the 30 years since um and what I find troubling is I'm gathering from you that that analysis isn't being done for the 42 plus thousand people who died in 2021 where some one is saying what contributed to the death and what can be learned about making that the ultimate thing that we put a buffer between for example when um you know when a person makes a mistake you always want to have more of a buffer for that mistake to not result in the nature of force that could kill them so for example in a racetrack that's the difference between having a bigger runoff than a smaller runoff that's the difference between having more impact absorbing things in areas where we expect people to potentially go off and yet my guess is like that analysis on the individual basis isn't necessarily being done that is correct and I think what you do see are the level of analysis you know that we can site the segmentation

[00:48:19] Etc that again are at sort of more population level than into the specifics of a particular crash at that particular with those particular individuals so you know again I'll site the NTSB this is why you know it takes a year plus to do an investigation because you're going to look at all of the factors that are involved there um identify both the probable cause as well as contributing factors and then make recommendations so it doesn't happen again which again I hope we talk about this some more but um you know those investigations are reactive but they're intended to take information so you can prevent them from reoccurring again in the future um and I

[00:48:56] I think that again is what separates NTSB investigations are so thorough from again what we've been talking about at the local you know Police Department you know level they just don't have the resources or time and other kinds of things to go and do those kinds of analyses you know so there's a big gap does NTSB only investigate you know trains and airplanes and sort of huge things like what's the Mandate of the

[00:49:18] NTSB because it it says Transportation which you would think includes all forms of transportation but it obviously it can't do this type of analysis for exactly right and it ends up the NTSB is required to investigate every Aviation crash so that's the big commercial stuff but that's also the local general aviation stuff that happens in every

[00:49:37] Community all over the place but then it investigates um specific crashes that occur that have National importance and so it in every mode of transportation you see mostly for example on the roadway you see mostly buses and trucks because those are big when there are fatalities there's more involved usually okay um but they can do single individual crashes as well so when I was there at the ngsb we did several related to distraction with folks on their phones for example okay now when you go into it you don't know exactly what you're going to find but you get enough information to say we should go after and see this because it would allow us to make recommendations that would have National import importance to do that and how how did those come to you given the sheer volume of these crashes how would the NT

[00:50:27] SB make a decision or determination that this car accident is potentially you know one we're going to put resources towards I mean do you have some inkling of what the cause is before and you think this is basically the illustration case so let's pull the cover back on the NTSB a little bit to see how this process goes and it's it's very much what you're talking about so we got to do all Aviation what are the high opportunity investigations we could look for in

[00:50:59] Marine in roadway right in you know other areas in fact people don't realize it but Pipeline and hazardous material also fits under there so pipeline is a mode of transportation that gets investigated as well um but to your point uh what happens is is like so what are the hot issues that we think are going on in this industry and then you wait for calls and where do those call comes they come from everywhere a local

[00:51:24] PD might call about one that's going on you could get from official you know the FAA lets you know about a crash of something that's going on somewhere it could come there's an OP Center 247 op Center at the NTSB it gets all of those phone calls and again to your point you won't know ahead of time but if somebody says well you know we think this was involved we think that was involved you have to make a decision do we go after that and look and then maybe find out it wasn't you know the case um but if it is that's the one that you want to be able to go in depth on so you can make recommendations to the entire industry right or individuals or whatever you need to do to try and get changes now when we think of the NTSB or when I think of the NTSB I think of Aviation and we everybody thinks of the you know the black box right you guys have this amazing data recorder that almost without exception is recoverable and it contains not only what the pilots said up until the moment of impact um but also the Telemetry you you actually see this was the position of this Aeron this was the you know thrust on this engine this was the yaw in the St I mean you know every detail of it um what what do cars have in them that allow the NTSB to do that kind of thorough investigation I mean I mean I I'm a little embarrassed I don't know the answer to this but I assume the car still contains some sort of a black box for Telemetry um I mean I know my racing cars do but I assume street cars have some of that yes and just to start those black boxes are actually orange and that's partly you know so you can find them right besides all the other beeping that's going it's like sometimes you can just

[00:52:59] SP it that way and vehicles do have an EDR electronic data recorder and there's actually no reason you would even know that because you don't really have access to it okay um and and what's interesting is most States another conversation if you choose but there are some of these things that are controlled at the federal level through Nitsa

[00:53:20] Federal Motor Vehicle standards and other kinds of regulatory authorities that are there and many of these things though they're actually controlled at the state level okay so that that's kind of important about which things are so edrs are where there's a basic Federal sort of requirement but to your point in aviation there are hundreds sometimes now the newer ones thousands of variables that you can get from those recorders and the EDR in most Vehicles it's the basics um and there's always this tension between the industry about how much data they want to leave out versus those on the investigation side decid that no more is better if we understand so some of these very recently only recorded like 30 seconds or a minute worth of data maybe three minutes back uh and then and this is a debate even in the aviation ones in the old days they used to record over and so you know for those of us who want to say how long have they been breaking hard like that or how long have they been at that speed for whatever else in a vehicle on the road EDR you may not have a long period of data to track that kind of thing so it's both the the variables that are recorded and the amount of time that it records and that is available to you post crash to be able to look at all that and reconstruct what actually happened there and is that one of the more important uh data sources you would rely on when the ntsp did indeed come in for auto accidents absolutely that and of course um you talk to everybody so Witnesses not only in the scene but you talk to family and other people you know work all that kind of thing and and you know like within the fatigue when you look at that it's literally if this is a trucker who is on the road you're looking at literally where's their hotel motel key and can you actually see that they got in the room and then we have to look to see if they were on their cell phone or not were they're actually sleeping when they need you know it's like you go with the electronic pieces you can and then there's all the other human elements of that that you use to try and piece at a minimum the 3 days before the crash and again you extend that based on what you're finding to go back which is why

[00:55:23] I'll just make one thing I have a few soap boxes I'm sure we'll touch on one of the hardest things is people speculating in the first 24 48 Hours of what happened because I having launched on seven different investigations the first one was a Reno air show crash was Air Races in here huge but you know what happens is everybody the media in particular it's in the first 24 48 hours it's so like here's what caused that and then before you know it it's like already established and I used to go back you know to the DC and and say okay so how often do we actually see you know that first 2440 out speculation end up in the final report people couldn't really think of many you know maybe a little element of it shows up but you know the the thorough investigation uncovers things you would have never known if you stopped at that first 48 hours so my biggest thing from a safety standpoint is if you're not careful you take action based on the speculation now you spent a year doing a bunch of changes in things that may actually not have had any role in the crash that you were investigating so the speculation can really bite you if you're not careful hence the data sources like edrs are critical what can you glean about uh phone use in the car um I it's so it's so common now like I I I sort of have this innate anger when I pass somebody and they're on their phone and I don't mean like they're talking and the phone is wherever it is I mean cuz I mean like they're holding their phone and you can see it as you drive past them I I sort of feel like is this that much different than if you were drinking a beer and I could see the bottle like what what is your what is your view on that and um how difficult is it for an investig let's assume that a crash does not rise to the level of being one of the very very few that the NTSB looks at um but but yet it still becomes a a man of like you know a criminal prosecution or something like that I mean how much data are they able to infer um if a person wasn't actually speaking on the phone which I assume is the easiest thing to figure out from the cell signal so let's actually start with if you're going 55 miles per hour and you take 5 Seconds to look at your phone your eyes off the road you can travel the distance of a football field okay so just let that you know and that's playing with the radio on your phone whatever it is 5 Seconds at 55 is enough to take a football field right yeah and I'm sure we'll talk about this if we do more impairment stuff but they're kind of there's a very straightforward you know when you're driving three things you need to be taken care of your hands on the wheel your eyes on the road and your head in the game so when you talk about distraction anything that pulls you away from one of those is going to be a problem and we now know that talking on the phone can degrade your performance equivalent to 08 alcohol kind of performance decrements and again we don't have to get into all the data but there's really good data that even handsfree can do that because as you know there's no such thing as multitasking right it's switching Etc and so people like it's legal I'm like handsfree it's okay it's like no it's not because if you're engaged in that conversation then your head's not in this game whatever um and so again I think you know that's one of the challenges you have when you're looking all this is how diverse they are so to your point um the ntsp will go and get all the kinds of data locally they're probably never going to get that so what would you look for well and I often think about this when I do drive by those people usually because I'm going the speed limit here and they're going less than that in a faster Lane because they're sitting there staring at something right um is I'm always sitting there thinking I know enough to basically ask the police department get those phone records I want to know if that was you know if a signal was bouncing off a a hour somewhere locally was that going on and of course nowadays we have more cameras everywhere and so can I show that they actually were on that phone at a certain place whether it's their video or video from a vehicle you might be in ETC there are more sources for that kind of information but to your point if you didn't know about an EDR or you know video or that uh again you know an investigation at the NTSB you can get a subpoena if the phone company won't give it to you and literally get the records to know if they were on the phone during a certain time that stuff's available in most crashes insurance companies even aren't going to necessarily pursue all of that um but those things would be available depending on what happened for you to again like any other investigation at NTSB level you could go after that stuff to determine what was really there I got I just a couple weeks ago we're on El Camino here in

[01:00:15] California so it's three lanes 35 miles hour speed limit and we're stopped and there was we had seen a motorcycle officer who had stopped somebody a while back all of sudden now he's coming up on the left we're like in the middle so there's another vehicle on left but the guy's coming up splitting the lane cuz we're stopped and he's literally looking in the cars because I can see his helmet turning looking in the cars and the guy next to us who was on his phone I mean I was sitting there just watching him you know and the cop came up and looked in there and like starts shaking his head you know and the guy put it down and I'm thinking like that's the difference when you actually have you know someone looking at you whether it's video or something else that says you shouldn't be doing that and you and I know that as soon as the cop went by he's back on the phone again right he's got so you know Mark have there been any kind of technological solutions proposed to dramatically lessen the burden of phone use while driving and again to be clear I say this as someone who would um who would be inconvenienced by it myself right I'm constantly using long drives when I take them them as a chance to get caught up on phone calls and listen to podcasts and audiobooks and even though my hands are on the wheel and my eyes are on the road there's no doubt especially in a phone call uh it takes my head out of the game a little bit so so again you know phone companies and consumers alike would be uh I'm sure opposed to this but is there no technology solution proposed to make it much more difficult to be distracted while driving there are it's interesting because companies did oppose it quite a bit but there are now and you should look on your own phone but there is usually now a button that says don't call you know it's like don't and so you can literally and it has a message it'll send a text or a voicemail basically and says I literally I'm driving now call you later or leave a message or whatever so there are technological things yes but it still requires the user to take the action and and again you know the the question is like how how can you make this so that you don't have to opt into it right and those could exist as well they already do because vehic the phones can now tell when your vehicle's moving you're right right so accelerometers and other sorts of things do that um and I think what what you're getting to which is interesting is that's a whole another Choice issue about you know if you're moving above a certain speed so you're out of a parking lot or whatever else we jam it or we just don't let it happen right um that would be an interesting battle I bet for some and that's why it's so interesting about your hypothesis there because right now you could just make the decision I'm going to shut it off right or I'm going to put on airplane mode and

[01:03:22] I'm not going to get anything while I'm here so when I was at NTSB um Debbie hzman was the chairman and we were investigating a couple as I mentioned crashes where clearly cell phones were an issue and we made a recommendation that cell phones should not be used in cars except for emergency situations um and I remember exactly around that time because I used to call

[01:03:46] Debbie and we would you know be talking about stuff and she had a long commute and she used to use that to catch up with all kinds of stuff and then all of a sudden we were doing this inv investigations and I would keep getting her voicemail you know and then as we got closer to our recommendation Etc I said

[01:04:03] I know what's going on now she goes yeah I wanted to know what it would be like to shut the phone off or put it in you know a bag in the back and not and you know what it's really inconvenient but I'm a better driver when I'm doing this than when I'm doing it you know the convenient way right so to your point there's the technological that's sort of a societal back to our question like do we make that vote and say no we're not going to let you do that if you're moving but you always have the personal choice about if it's important enough to you you can decide and you know the personal choice in some cases could also mean you can differentiate right it's like I'm on a strange Road I'm a little faster I got more people in the call I'm not going to do that as opposed to open road speed limit there's nobody around music's not even an issue you take another you know again you could make more choices when you did that yeah or do I have the ability to override it and I mean this is how I perhaps erroneously justify it in my own mind which is I'm now steeped in the practice of identifying hot spots and whatever it is

[01:05:08] I'm doing if I'm listening to something or if I'm on the phone I you know I at least convince myself again this might not be true but I convince myself okay you're just going to pay more attention right now because this is that this is the intersection and you're looking both ways even when you have the right away or that kind of thing um but yeah the

[01:05:25] EXT the other example of this would be again it would be hideous to look at but you could easily install a breathalizer in every vehicle that allows it to not start without a blood alcohol below you know you know you might even make it a more egregious setting than 08 and make it 0.05 or something like that and again nobody would want those in their cars because they're so unsightly I think they do actually have devices like that for people who have been convicted of drinking and driving but when you when you just look at the numbers of you know people who are you know the number of um deaths due to intoxication um and distraction um it begs the question right like how much would we be willing to be inconvenienced to save call it 50 lives a day because that's about what you would do you you'd save about 50 lives a day if you took those two things off the table if people didn't have phones in their cars and they couldn't have alcohol in their system when they drove that's a pretty good estimate right about 50 about 50 people per day would be alive a third of 118 so maybe 40 yeah mhm so let's go back a moment realize you're different when you were talking about like being on the phone in certain places where you're going to pay more attention you're different in a good way because you're actually cognizant you're thinking about those things and what risk they would create for you and again in your you know framework is like what can I control what's out of my control well that's something you have control you're different than most people CU you're even thinking those things so that actually does make you safer in those situations than someone who isn't even thinking there's an issue with me talking on the phone and CH playing with my radio and by the way I'll do it's like that puts you in a different place than those folks but going to your other it's not hypothetical anymore Congress just passed a law that new cars will have to have a technology that can detect whether you're at the 08 level or higher and what's interesting is that technology has actually been in the work so take it as a model for what you're talking about with phones but that technology has been in the works for a long time uh nits and other it's called dads it's one of them and it has a free breath sort of analyzer in the and also stuff that's in the steering wheel that literally is looking at you know molecules in the air and it's what you said is it won't start if it hits and it it's for everybody now how will it differentiate between someone in the car who's incredibly inebriated and presumably putting particulate matter of ethanol or whatever metabolite is being searched but the driver let's assume is not right I mean the designated driver right I mean that's why you do that well right now it's specific enough with the and that's why I think the latest has both sensors the one that's in the wheel as well as the other more General one and they've done enough research to be able to differentiate those okay U what's well just the last thing I'll just say is what's interesting that's one form of it the legislation that just passed is that basically car companies are going to have to provide a technology without again it's more of a performance Target than it is the mechanism and so other people could come up with different ways to be able to do that but I mention this because I I think you're on to something here which is it took maybe decades to get this legislation from Congress to say we we should have this in every car because of the lives it could save and part of that was the ongoing debate sometimes about technical things more often about what we've started this conversation with the societal value if we think it's you know more important to inconvenience you if you're drunk um than it is to allow you to kill someone else on the roadway when did drunk driving fall out of you know favor like

[01:09:22] I I I get the sense that there was a day in which driving drunk was a normal thing to do like nobody cared that you had a drink and got in your car clearly that's not the case today um despite the fact that the numbers are still as high as they are was there a was there a particular moment in time in which an accident changed all of that or was it just a general sense of awareness and I will apologize to them but it really was about mad Mothers Against Drunk drivers um and you know the woman who started it lost a child in a drunk driving crash and this is what in the 80s and that's why I'm trying to kind of apolog because I think it was late 70s early 80s but they really are the first ones to have a quote victim group you know that said this is should not be allowable anymore and so I would say it wasn't so much an individual crash um but they faces to a set of crashes and a cause and took it like to the state house to Congress it's like we cannot let this happen anymore um and people don't know this but Matt actually provides counseling services and all kinds of other things that they do um but they really are the model of again a victim group that said we need this issue in front of our society it's not okay and so they you know they're the ones to get you know 0.08 and all again see that's one of the things every state has to vote for what the BAC you know blood alcohol level has to be and so everyone's different um but they're the ones you know who pushed it used to be higher and then finally got to 0.8 um they're the ones who basically are the ones who push especially hard others did as well but they were right out there in the front for this new legislation regarding the technology and they're the ones who will make sure that the pressure stays on to see the technology actually integrated within vehicles coming so I think that's an example of what you're talking about it could be a crash high visibility maybe a celebrity what do we about this or can be you know this new model that was created with mad which we see in other

[01:11:30] Arenas as well yeah I always find that that the individual cases do more you're probably familiar with the case of Libby Zion um just for folks listening so Libby Zion was a woman admitted to a hospital in New York I can't even remember if it was Presbyterian or I think it was M Zion was it Mount yeah you're right it was

[01:11:50] Mount Si and um she was um admitted to the um a resident who technically probably wasn't even qualified to make a decision that was being made about her care made a made a decision to give her a medic I don't even remember the details gave her a medication while she was already on an MAOI and it resulted in her death and even though I don't really think this was just about fatigue I think it was more about Resident supervision it became the the the Lynch pin case that her father basically took against the medical community about Resident work hours and

[01:12:31] I don't know it might have been might have taken 15 years from her death until the changes that were imposed on Resident work hours which was kind of at the end of my training period um but again it all came back to This Woman's death right it wasn't about the million other insane stories um that resulted from you know residents be medical residents being exhausted um so I guess

[01:12:58] I bring all this up to St Mark you know have we had that moment yet with distracted driving right do we have the equivalent of Mothers Against Drunk Driving or do we have the equivalent of Libby Zion's death where because I have my story right so my story is I used to work with a guy named Nick venudo um and um Nick and I sat opposite each other in in our offices um and Nick was um a really really amazing guy we always say this right but but truly an amazing guy um a a remarkable cyclist and uh but he was so committed to his family that he used his commute his long commute on his bike to do the bulk of his training so that he didn't have to do any cycling during the week and he could just do his main training on the weekends um he had just just won one of the most remarkable time trials in Austin which was the Mount Palomar climb which is a epic climb one of the hardest climbs in the United States anyway it was a Tuesday afternoon in um in in May of I want to say 2010 2011 we were both just leaving the office together and I was going to drive home to get on my bike to then ride to where

[01:14:21] I did my intervals that day and he was riding home um and I remember thinking there were two places I could go and ride that day one was up Tory Pines and the other was on the bike path of 56 which was a bike path that ran along a freeway um and that's that was the road that he always took home and I was like do I want to maybe I go ride that way and I'll ride out one way with him I ultimately ended up deciding to go up

[01:14:46] Tory Pines that day that day when he was driving home a woman in an SUV in the right hand lane which is is the lane adjacent to the bike path where there's a hill that you have to go up it's about a 12T Hill at about 40 degrees with a fence was on her phone and I think what happened is the car in front of her stopped and she drove up the hill through the fence hit and killed

[01:15:15] Nick um on a path that I rode on most days and I mean I spent the next 2 years so godamn angry that I wanted to start carrying a gun when I rode my bike to shoot any motorist that got anywhere near me I mean that's how pissed I was and I thought to myself how many times does this happen like this is again this is one guy that I just happened to know who died but this is happening constantly and why are people not more irate why is something not being done about this and and and so I guess my you know forgive my long story but like is there is there a movement around these victims of and it's not just the cyclists and pedestrians it's other drivers who are victims of the distracted driver and by the way I want to say one more thing I am a distracted driver sometimes I could easily have been that woman there are times when cars in front of me are stopping and I have haven't caught it until the last second and just because it hasn't resulted in an accident I don't know that it makes me morally any better than that woman well it's personal for you too then just as started yeah and uh again I paused at the beginning because

[01:16:40] I don't often talk about my father but it's personal for a lot of people but I think what's interesting is the stories actually aren't told enough that's what we're talking about mad they told the stories this should stop we have not reached the societal unacceptability the societal outrage that you just portrayed at the level of we just got to stop it okay and that's why I say mad help bring the visibility but the legislation for technology in the vehicle just got passed it's not even in the cars yet right I mean it's still got to figure out how to do that part so you asked it earlier we could do the same thing with distraction okay and and I think good and bad the good part is people are asking questions like what you just did you know how do we how do we take this the next step we have models you know alcohol impaired driving we have ways to go after this and even do better with technology and things Etc how do we do that in the realm of distraction and you've also identified why it's so hard the bad part is even us really people who are trying to be really good at what you know trying to save lives and do the right thing it's hard there's still some things where we make choices even knowing choices like that's not really the best thing to do here right um and and that's a challenge which is even you know really good folks who know what's going on I have friends of mine in the police department you know and it's kind of like I want to make sure I see every one of those police cars stop at the top sign no rolling no you know it's like we got because you're the model for others it's okay watching that motorcycle G you know not his head at the guy who's on his phone Etc it's like we need all the available all the available mechanisms strategies we have to change many of these things and what you're getting to is there are so many of them we can look at the top three right but that doesn't necessarily get rid of all of them okay but I think to your point and a lot of what you focus on you know in these conversations is so what are the things that are under your control though so for you you know if that means watching a little bit more about when you're on those calls and how you're paying attention to them hands on or hands off

[01:18:55] Etc and that's why part you're already different because you're already thinking about where those danger zones are okay someone who doesn't even think about that is at a higher risk okay and as we talked about it this is risk management that's the part you know what's under your control what's not it's risk management and what you choose to actually try and control and take care of others that will still put you at risk in certain situations yeah one of the things I've

[01:19:21] I've often wondered Mark is there any Research into the lives of those who kill other people on the road and how their lives are forever impacted because you know I have to be honest with you I think until right now as I'm telling the story I've never once given a thought to that woman who killed Nick um truthfully I've hated her guts but I don't know that that's fair and I don't know anything about her life today I don't know how often she thinks about

[01:19:51] Nick I don't know if I don't know what she lives with um but my impression is that there are two deaths at every death um and that a part of the person who who killed this person is at risk and this is a very different type of homicide right this is not like you know this is not first-degree murder right this is involuntary vehicular manslaughter and nobody wakes up thinking they want to kill someone today in their car um are you I know your training is in

[01:20:27] Psychology so I just wonder if there's any aspect of your um training that that that gives you a sense into what those people go through and and is that by the way is that something we should be tapping into to help create a more of a Zeitgeist around this it's not it's it's not just the lives of the of those who die it's those who live 25 to 33% of people in a crash are going to have PTSD within 30 days or longer so I that there is a literature on that and I would just say going from the statistics to the individual Matt is quite good at actually not only having victims families talk about what's going on but they have drivers you know who have killed someone that are also part of who speaks to folks about what this does to change their life and sometimes that's jail time sometimes even if they don't go to jail it just it changes their life forever CU they are waking up every morning survivor's guilt you know anybody who really cares about humanity is going to carry that with them for the rest of their lives and so yeah we see numbers actually again close to a third basically people are going to have PTSD some aspect of that and then telling those stories can be very powerful before we go into some other things I want to chat about I want to round out some of the other contributing factors um where does weather rank on this list um is it you know whether it be rain snow ice dark you know sudden

[01:21:53] Darkness or cloud like how much does that contribute so I'm going to just drop a small bomb here for a minute about something and then to answer the question then we'll come back to it whenever you're ready but Nitsa did a a study came out in 2015 um that showed in the chain of events the last event before crash at 94% of the time it's a human choice or error okay and that's my language human choice or error so then the question is what are the other 6% well 2% are vehicle defects 2% are the environment 2% other and so to your question the environment is both uh the physical environment potholes road conditions Etc and then things like weather and so again it's a change virtually nothing it's virtually nothing not a that's right so that does happen but it's going to be you know small compared to the other um and again we can talk a little more about the 4% because there's been some controversy about that number but that's a soapbox for me you got to be ready to get into that one well let's let's say more about that then so where's the controversy around that are there people who are arguing that it's much that that number is too high that's that that's overstating it what's interesting is nobody's actually addressed the number and so um and again you'll tell me where you want me to okay that's enough of that Mark let's go on to something else but let me just start this is why a crash is Not an

[01:23:26] Accident okay a crash is preventable an accident implies it's inevitable and most people don't know this but the word acent started getting usely used mostly in occupational environments like the work setting in the 20s and 30s when companies didn't want any responsibility of on the job injuries and deaths oh that was an accident I always say it's like it was an act of God it was unintentional nobody could do whatever and part of the reason I bring that up is because if you believe in safety that by investigating you can determine the causal and contribut contributory factors and then intervene in some way by changing right so you prevent it from reoccurring you prevent whatever then that's what safety is about it's a crash right and if you didn't believe in that and you really think it's an accident that's inevitable why are you you know trying to make changes investigating Etc no and that's the mission of the NTSB investigate those crashes to make recommendations so they don't reoccur okay so what's interesting is there's two elements to this one is um you know as a NASA scientist pretty much you could start any paper with 70 because it was so well established 70 to 80% of incidents you know that pyramid we were talking about 7 80% were human factors related it was just a given After All

[01:24:49] This research and things were going on you know the Institute of medicine report right to is human 100,000 medical errors every year due to human Etc um and so it always surprised me is like 94% shouldn't actually surprise anybody but there is something which I call safety misdirection and that's where two things are going on one denial like let's not deny what the causal or contributory

[01:25:17] Factor was and the other is blame and so the old version of safety misdirection is oh the car comp companies are just blaming the drivers for stuff okay and they want to sort of you know avoid it's kind of like the corporate accident language right it's like let's get away from that and so I always point out that what I learned at the NTSB is you can have safety or you can have blame you know if you want to blame people or that's not going to get you to the safety the safety part is identifying the causal and contributory factors and then intervene so those things don't happen again which by the way even if it's the human then very often as we've already discussed there's a different intervention like technology which our society happens to turn to a lot right when it's something about our human behavior that's hard to change well what's the technology we might be able to use that either supports helps or just eliminates the ability to do that okay so that's one of the things the controversial part that's been interesting is people saying well if you talk about 94% you're just trying to blame the drivers Etc now there are some car companies and some people in the autonomous vehicle space that love to do that so it's again how they use the data but scientifically a huge part of this is human choice or error then we still have the challenge of then how do we address those right to make sure those things don't reoccur again in another place so again it's a little bit of a soapbox for me when I you know hear about people like oh that 94% has been it's like no it's not nobody's actually argued about the number um I think it's more the blame and shame part uh which again doesn't get you safety no matter what right so you can't deny what the sources are and blaming people in fact nowadays it's like oh you're just blaming the driver then they point and they you know they start blaming the car they blame the software they blame the you know that's still not going to get things fixed for you so you're going to save lives so there you go I'm with the 94% and think that you know that other 6% shows that last chain of that last event in the chain is very small percents going be weather or potentially defects okay I don't know if you will have this statistic but while we're on the topic of of cause and fault we talk about nearly 50,000 people a year died last year do we know how many of those people were the people who were the cause of the mistake that led to the crash versus um people who were presumably not doing anything that would have led to a mistake we don't have that level of detail of those specific crashes that occurred to be able to tell that and the reason I'm asking by the way is to to sort of make the point that there are two elements to this there is what can I do as a driver to make sure I'm not the one who makes the mistake and then what can I do as a driver to make sure that when the other driver makes the mistake I'm in a position to react better or see their mistake before it's happening and I I think about this a lot as a dad who is starting to talk a lot about this to his daughter right if I'm driving her to school you know just ask her it's a

[01:28:38] Non-Stop lecture it's Hey Olivia did you see how I did that did you notice why I did that where did why did I look there did you see what that driver just did and I'm I and and and so I guess what I'm what I'm assuming is that we have to be vigilant on both fronts it's not enough to just say I'm going to drive at a responsible speed and I'm not going to hold my phone and I'm not going to drink

[01:29:05] I think that that's a great first step I don't think it's the complete step you have to assume this this is the this is the Mantra I I I use Mark um and my wife thinks this is a little grotesque but I don't care I say it to her all the time I say I want you to imagine that somebody woke up today with the stated purpose of killing you so they've been they've been handed an envelope the envelope contains your name and they're told to kill you today but here's the catch they're not allowed to use a gun they're not allowed to poison you they have to do it with their car so I said armed with that knowledge how would you drive different today it's one of it's only one car you're going to see thousands of cars today it's only one but there is someone out here who's trying to kill you they're being paid to kill you what will that knowledge do to your attention and how will you treat each intersection each on-ramp each offramp each T joint you know all of those things that we talk about and um and honestly I just I don't know that that's a great way to go living your life it's a bit morose but it's the only way it's the only heris I've come up with to help with the other half of the equation um that that's why I ask the question right I don't I don't know how to quantify the effect size of each of these things is it worth the baggage and the overhead the emotional overhead of playing that game could be your life so yeah it's worth it and and I said this at the beginning which is thank you for bringing this topic up because at the core like you say your

[01:30:54] Mantra of what's under your control what's out of your control that's what we're talking about here but even the things that are out of your control you can be more Vigilant to some of the risk factors or other things that you could do at the higher conceptual level I would say and maybe just a slight sort of reworking exactly what you said but part of this is situational awareness saay yeah which we know I mean you know this in racing it's a big thing in aviation um and I think it's what you just literally articulated with your daughter right did you see how I looked at that did you see that car over there doing whatever so I think that is huge and the second part is what we would typically frame as defensive driving and so it's it's a little different than what you portray but it is the same thing actually which is there are people that are out here that are not not making the good choices you are but who are on their phone or drunk or haven't had enough sleep you don't have any control over that but with your sit situation awareness and driving defensively there are things you can do right so besides scanning here looking there you can come back again you can look at those intersections where you know things are higher so that if that raises your vigilance that could be enough for you just to pause at that stop sign longer and it becomes not even an error let alone a near miss or Worse right and so I think you know that's what you're portraying you know the the situational awareness is includes following the rules doing the good and then the other is the Defensive Driving part is don't think everyone else is doing the same thing right they're not right and I would just say whether they're intending to get you or not those bad choices are going on those errors are going on and so yeah I think uh that's actually a great way to approach it um and I think you know unfortunately it's so easy to drive nowadays a lot of folks especially with even newer Technologies um some people have their game have their heads so far out of the game they've lost the situation awareness right it's all about the music the conversation Etc so all of that is lost so no I think that's actually when you're doing your other training with the muscle memory stuff on how to that needs to be in there too because part of this is the mental game of making the right choices and knowing that other people won't then what can you do let's now talk about some of these more these these contributing factors in a little bit more detail and

[01:33:17] I want to start with with substance abuse uh or substance use or whatever you want to call it um we've talked about alcohol of course uh give people a sense of what for what what does it take to reach 0.08 because I suspect it's a lot easier to get to 0.8 Than People realize yeah in fact uh most people in the safety arena with alcohol like to say that impairment starts with the first drink and I think that's a great like as soon as you pull up alcohol it's going to start changing your reaction time thinking everything's going to start changing by the way I've got I've got great I've got a great model to demonstrate this so I I drive a racing simulator um and uh I can and I've done this game right where I will have a glass of wine and get in the simulator and to be completely clear with a glass of wine I do not perceive anything in my own level of awareness I don't feel a buzz there's nothing like that however in the simulator there's a noticeable difference even at a glass of wine where

[01:34:23] I'm sure I am below 008 cuz I weigh a lot um and I don't feel buzzed in any way shape or form I don't drive as well I miss the Apex more I'm more likely to spin um it's it's a subtle difference but it's absolutely noticeable in that environment which is much much more demanding than just driving home from the restaurant so um but but as a general rule for someone you know my size what I I've never taken a breath lizer test so I don't actually even know what 0.08 is so for you that's going to be um two to three beers and one good shot of hard liquor over what period of time uh within one to two hours okay okay but you're bringing up a great point which is why I always hesitate to give too much information about that because you can go on the line you can go online with some pretty good BAC estimators um because your age your weight you know your heal pres exactly all of those things whether again it's um less alcohol content in beers and other wine you know versus again hard liquor stuff over the time course you were just about did you eat and what did you have in your stomach when you it's like there's so much there I think actually even more important is what you were telling in your story which is there's very often a disconnect between the subjective experience and the objective one which is it very often people think they're doing a lot better we see this parallel in alcohol and sleep loss I'm doing great I'm really fine when if you look at the objective performance measures they're just doing horribly right or they're off but don't realize how off they are so that disconnects really important that's why you say I'm good to go whether it's not having enough sleep or you know I had a couple glasses of wine but I'm okay had enough to eat and

[01:36:17] I'm good to go that disconnect I think is actually bigger risk than sometimes the exact amount of alcohol you have in your system yeah and and I and I would argue that the the Sleep one is just the same if I'm if I don't have a great night's sleep it it shows and again that's I think that's what's kind of cool about a simulator is you're you're simulating driving around at 200 miles an hour and at that speed things are happening three times faster than when you're in a car on the road even on a freeway and of course you're turning constantly right so the stakes are so much higher um and the forces and inputs are so much more subtle right any wrong input will lead to a significant change in output and it's it is remarkable how you can feel fine for the mundane task but not not for the drive add that to your add that to your course you're creating right so besides the muscle memory and whatever it's like you'd love to challenge especially those adolescents with even you know whatever is appropriate there sleep loss would be better than alcohol obviously yeah but you know think about that as a challenge just for them to say

[01:37:23] I feel fine give me the rating on the 1 to 10 scale and then show the objective measurements in driving like you say even the mundane ones yeah let's talk about other substances and I think the most relevant is cannabis right so um what what are the what do the data say about cannabis use and driving it's not good in that what's happened is in alcohol there's a really good established protocol with you know here's what impairment means at 0 and by the way we can use a breathalyzer we can use blood there are drug recognition experts Dres that can use behavioral measures on scene we have a lot of and we know they hold up in court you know I mean it's just a really good with cannabis there is still ongoing debate of what defines impairment and so if you can't even get that defined um and then you have no roadside kinds of measures and it's harder as you know whether you're using you know breath hair all these other things that people are trying to do and it ends up well you know it sticks around in your system longer or it can be in the follicles for this long it's like there is no good measurement so we don't have the impairment definition we don't have good measures to get us there to sort of figure out how we do that and the other thing which is really dangerous is you know the poly usage you know it's rarely one of these on their own you know so we can like with cannabis you see alcohol or other kinds of things that people are using at the same time so that makes it even more difficult to figure out especially in the roadside kind of environment of what people are actually using and so I know

[01:39:11] I mean this is now uh I was administrator eight years a come on I can do the math six seven years now um ago and we all this research was still going on to try and Define what I was just describing you know that as all these states now start making it more legal is going to put it out there on the I always tell people when you're voting for that in your state don't think about your you know the sport of drinking of cannabis you know but instead think about what that's going to mean if somebody next you on the roadway uh you know has been smoking and in some way you know is like the level of impairment of alcohol you know people just don't think of that part and unfortunately while the alcohol is pretty well defined the Cannabis part is very poorly defined and in in that time we still don't have it figured out yet well let's think about the is is there a manner in which we can at least extrapolate from the standpoint of understanding right so so alcohol is is a CNS depressant and um I I guess at the risk of just talking through something that seems self-evident what is the mechanism by which you think ethanol is contributing to mistakes and we're talking now about the subset of mistakes mes that lead to bad enough crashes and potential fatalities like is it that people end up driving too quickly when they're drunk is it that their reaction times are so slowed when they're drunk like what what is and not even drunk let's not even use that word right when they are under the influence of alcohol what are this Suite of mistakes that they're making that are leading to these catastrophic errors so I think the the two big categories are any performance related ones which are deg ated or impaired so that would be um sustained attention reaction time decision making um and the other is the one we talked about and that is the subjective perception part being disconnected where they have no sort of you know their their decision making like it's really okay so we know basically uh you know with alcohol all those CNS things that you were talking about are going to be again be degraded or impaired in some way um and and I again I talk about this the same way with fatigue you know it's sort of like and I'll just use that as the example for the moment but there's this like Continuum everyone it's like you're asleep here you're awake over here but the alertness in between is a

[01:41:36] Continuum right and so I think most people would absolutely agree you know being as asleep at the wheel not good but that Continuum beforehand we know that with sleep loss orcan disruption alcohol um that basically your performance will degrade way before you actually say fall asleep or drunk enough to go unconscious yeah and so it's that and that's why I call that degraded as opposed to the impairment where literally you can't perform at all but at least in the Sleep realm I mean we can see 50% reduction in your decision-making 30% reduction in your memory we can see 50 to 75% increase in your reaction time these very specific things when you're in the driving mode trying to deal with a situation are going to affect you and your ability and that's why I always tell people it's like way before you had that fall asleep or that drunk like go unconscious you've got these performance degradations that put you at risk but in that sense I mean to me sleep and cannabis seem very similar in that they're sedating and there's you know clearly a spectrum um from completely you know debilitated to you know Loosely less functional um and there's no real way to measure it directly in in the way you can use a um a breathalizer for for alcohol um so are there are there differences between how we view drowsiness due to sleep deprivation or sleep Interruption and cannabis use which again I'm just bringing up cannabis not because it's the only other substance out there besides alcohol but because as you said it's becoming more and more um ubiquitous um and I think it probably I think there's a belief on some level maybe somewhat warranted that you know it could be less toxic than alcohol I think a lot of people are turning to cannabis now over alcohol and I wonder if there are unintended consequences of that uh with regard to this domain well and I'm in complete agreement with you there which is that I think you know it remains hypothesis but with everything we know about how physiology and the brain and things work it's got to be right we just haven't I try and play it's like we may not be able to quantify it quite yet but we here's a comment I often make about sleep loss and circadian disruption when you lose sleep you disrupt the clock all aspects of human capability are degraded or impaired in some way so I mention that because a new study comes out and says oh we just linked this now to cancer in a new way or immune function in a new way and I'm kind of like okay so now we have more data and we can be more exact in certain areas good thing but the overall comment holds which is kind of what you're saying here too which is that everything we know about how cannabis works in the brain how it's going to affect us physiologically performance-wise we know that's not going to improve things it's going to degrade them and while we may get better at quantifying how bad that is let's be clear it's not a good thing for driving under the influence of one of that right so I think that's what's going to happen here is that we will get there there's some great people at um NIH and other places that are working on how to get that impairment level defined to think about what the test could be Etc we'll get there took you know a decade or two frankly to get the alcohol ones in the way they are now we'll get there but for the moment let's be you know clear everything we know is that's a negative it's not a positive and we may get better at it but it's still not going to improve things in some way so and again

[01:45:17] I agree with you I think the Sleep part and I I'll just make another General comment which is I think the Sleep part that's interesting everyone sleeps they think they're an expert and it's kind of interesting that everyone is like yeah I've lost I'm sleeping you know I'm still here I'm fine Etc whereas again people will think about alcohol and cannabis you know that's more of a choice and by the way I don't drink or I don't do this Etc no one's ever going to say yeah I think that sleep thing I just stopped it you know I just don't do it so I that's a requirement right for just our existence and so uh it's slightly different that way are there any other prescription drugs that play um a significant role in this I mean the obvious ones that come to my mind would be benzo aines but but is there any other class of drugs that frequently enough show up on the impairment side of the equation well and thank you for bringing this up because you know drunk drugged people always think of cannabis Etc but that includes prescription medication and over the- counters so any antihistamine that makes you drowsy any any so dating antidepressant trone gets used for right I mean use any one of those that you're taking um you know has the potential to affect your you know sleepiness alertness level when you're actually driving so I I'm glad you brought that up because everyone thinks of the big ones you know it's alcohol for sure cannabis we got to start talking about but these others you think about it prescription you know something you don't want to just read the label you want to talk to your healthcare provider about that and see how much could that affect me and the over the- counters as well those are all big issues and we again it's the poly Pharmacy you see that a lot that there's multiple things but trying to pull out exactly what they were that's often after the fact post

[01:47:03] Hawk you go interview people and say oh yeah I'm you know I'm it's allergy season and are you taking the one that's sedating or you taking the one that's The non-d Drowsy version of it right let's talk a little bit about speed which is um still makes up a pretty sizable uh fraction of the contributing forces is that changing is that less today than it was 30 years ago um it strikes me that maybe you know clearly cars are faster today than they used to be but are people necessarily driving them faster today um and is that not offset At All by the far greater impact of technology which we haven't come to talk about yet so we should certainly spend some time talking about seat belts and airbags but but just yeah what's the general throughput of speed in this equation it's a big factor Force equals mass times acceleration it's all about the energy so when you're going faster you're talking about when a crash happens you know there's just more literally impact of what's going to come out of that particular Collision um and so it's interesting speed has actually gone up and that has more to do with the capability of the vehicles roadways uh and the technologist think about I mean you're a racer you know how much there's always like how do we get better faster

[01:48:16] Etc although it seems that it seems that cars outside of SUVs probably cars are getting a lot lighter so when you think about mass times deceleration which I assume is a big part of what that force is that people are experiencing um does that not offset it on the car side of the equation not very much because generally cars are getting bigger and you know now that we've added SUVs and others um you know when we look at what's going on out there there's kind of people describe it as a weight bloat that's occurred y um you know and unfortunately they do protect you right

[01:48:53] I mean if you're in one of those energy related kinds of crashes the bigger the protective cage you have around you the better off people have a tendency to say I want to be in that vehicle not in the little small you know version where I could get killed doing that sort of thing um I think what's interesting is we do see this is why it's so complicated but we do see like during you know uh the last recession um during the pandemic um we actually see sort of the the um the deaths go down but sometimes other particular things like speeding goes up okay and we can have all kinds of hypotheses about are there fewer people on the road is just the density different Etc they're all hypotheses we think about those we don't really know but I bring it up because it's interesting that even the economic environment of our society can end up having effects beyond the usual causal or contributing factors for example that we're mostly focused on you know in this conversation so even those things can have that you know societal Ripple um and I would just say for the speed side two other things which is I'm sure we'll talk about the safe system approach and that has to do with safer roads and one of the things they look at is controlling speed through Road design so that's where roundabouts or what they call speed diets where you basically two become one lane and then instead we're going to have a more dedicated pedestrian or cycling Lane where you can use Etc and then the last thing I'll say on the technology is there's a huge debate it's not where the alcohol is where the Technologies pass legislation but there's a lot of discussion about speed limiters now and whether or not as we've been discussing and I said this earlier Society very often when we have human choices you know or things that we want to deal with we go to technology so all of a sudden now speed cameras and speed limiters in vehicles are in more discussion than they have been in a decade yeah no it makes sense again I all of these things are you know you you you'd pull them out of our dead lifeless hands if you don't let me drive quicker and don't let me um talk on the phone and and whatnot um I want to go back to another kind of deconstruct the accident question do you have a sense uh or or are these data knowable as to what fraction of those fatalities in the vehicle are a result of the the vehicle just being you know the Integrity the vehicle being lost due to the Collision itself versus a flip uh in other words you know how often is avoiding the flip of the vehicle you know with a lower center of gravity uh a relevant part of this equation yeah that's actually a big deal and when you look at the crash tests are done there are they it's interesting they don't actually crash vehicle to vehicle you crash the crash worthiness of your vehicle is tested against a big block of sub basically yes but now there are different versions of that so there's a side impact and now over the last years there's also a angled one as well and then rear end and then you can add all kinds of other variations of that as well um and I would say that's a kind of thing I don't keep in my head anymore um but there are some databases that gets at least into things like rollover um and that's where the side impact is critical right because that's mostly going to happen with the center of gravity when you actually have you're up on a curb or some other thing that's going to tip you potentially again the direction that you're hit Etc but there is some data on that um to show sort of which are the versions and that's why they added things like the angled

[01:52:33] Collision basically um recently just to figure out that you know what there's enough of that going on we should understand the crashworthiness of vehicles when they're hit in an angle like that is this an area where electric vehicles are well let me just ask the question more broadly are electric vehicles indeed significantly safer than non-el electric vehicles on the basis of a lower Center of mass and the on the basis of not having an engine typically in the front during a front Collision um that therefore can have much more Force absorptive capacity or is that more of a a marketing uh strategy yeah I I think um we don't have sufficient data yet to sort of make that um factual comment per se but I think you've identified all of the f a range of the factors that actually differentiate Electric vehicles from the standard right um and as you know right now one of the biggest things is just getting the myth separated from the fiction the the other fiction that is told right um you know there are still more fires in ice Vehicles than there are in EVS some of that's about battery some of that's about just the population that's out there of these different I mean it's like you got to get into that level of data analysis that's why I'm talking about the segmentation and stuff so some of these things again n.gov is one place um the

[01:53:51] Insurance Institute for Highway Safety they do a lot of great crash testing uh and I'm sure we'll get into some of that when we talk about some of the vehicle specific things but um you can get a little bit more of that data my caution is always that some of that is still in development as far as understanding the kind of differences hypothesis like on what you were just identifying but the level of segmentation to actually make factual statements I think we're still developing a lot of that so let let's talk about where um autonomous driving comes in um it you know look if if if you if you believe that north of 90% of these crashes have at their root cause Errors

[01:54:35] By humans then you would think that an autonomous vehicle provided the entire network of vehicles is autonomous that's always been the big if right it's not enough to just have some autonomous vehicles that could actually make things worse you have to kind of have every thing being autonomous uh would certainly have the potential to do better um I don't think it goes from 94 to zero but but you know it seems that there's a Glide path what what is your view of autonomous vehicles and the hope that they bring to this problem in many ways I wonder is that the solution as opposed to built-in speed limiters breathalyzers I mean I was also going to half jokingly suggest that if we can put all of those things in cars we can also probably put in light like eye flicker sensors and we can track micro sleep because I think back to when I was in residency how tired I would be driving home and I could barely hold my eyes open I mean clearly we could sense that so there are there are clear things you can build in to make humans less likely to hurt themselves but at some point you might just say let's just put all of our energy into autonomous vehicles so this is a fun part of a conversation which is the general comment we've already been discussing which is you know when when

[01:55:57] Society has issues that are around human behavior and choices and errors we make then you know do we often look to technology as a way to help us do better save lives improve situations so there's another study that Nitsa did where they actually looked at 14 different Technologies as straightforward as seat belts airbags electronic stability control 14 and over 5050 two years how many lives did those Technologies saved 61351 okay and those are just the 14 they looked at which were related to the

[01:56:32] Federal Motor Vehicle Safety standards and other things that are in vehicles so you can't do this but I point out at you know 40,000 lives a year we could have gone 15 years with no lives lost on our roadways right kind of our conversation not necessarily injuries or crashes but you know if we could have lumped all those together technology works right and and I'll say this as the caveat to start with is the potential is unbelievable but we still got to prove it's going to work fully acknowledging that these new systems will also introduce new risks okay I think again when I told you people like to point their blame and it's like still got to prove it and we also got to acknowledge that now we're going to have software risks and other kinds of you know machine learning and technological risks that are introduced we got to make sure we address those as well your point that we may get to zero in some areas should we even expect that in others having said that what you just described actually is the way I think we need to be using technology so those are really in two big areas the Advanced Driver assistance systems Adas are the things that are already in cars I'm sure you've got them in yours automatic emergency braking you know Lane keeping assist um you know cruise control rear camera we've just got all these different systems that are independent that you were talking right um and so when you think about it those are a part of again Advanced Driver assistance is how do we support the driving task by giving you these things that we know when you look this way you can't be looking that way but we could give you visibility to that situational awareness again that could actually help with that okay the higher level is a fully autonomous vehicle okay and let's just say you know what we're going to take out the steering wheel the pedals and everything else it's going to do the entire task okay and the way sometimes this is separated is at the lower levels SAE actually has these five levels and I'm not going to get into all of that but you can think about it basically as at the lower levels the human is responsible for monitoring the environment and the vehicle there's an inim level level three where the vehicle will do some of those things but if it needs you back in the loop it's going to let you know take the wheel and level four and higher is vehicle's going to do it for you it's going to monitor the environment and the vehicle and handle the driving task so just so I understand Mark if you look at the like I is is is um is Tesla the best example of is that the furthest along technology in the driver assist commercially thank you um and that's exactly I'm not sure it's further along but I would say it has the most

[01:59:24] Integrated Systems of pulling those separate systems in but what you just said that's so important is the label that often gets used autopilot gives a sense that it is autonomous driving when in fact it's what you just said it's actually a collection of driver assistance systems which actually even they publicly because of regulatory requirements that's level two I was just about to say is that level two or three but it's level two okay you got it you got it and probably that's one of the more Integrated Systems that uses all these different things but you're seeing you know even the traditional automakers basically offering all these different systems that are in there so one of the ways take a step back is to realize if we're going to take the 280 300 million cars that are on the road today it can take anywhere from 10 to 12 years to actually penetrate the fleet with new technology yeah that seems optimistic I

[02:00:23] I was going to say probably longer I mean it would seem to me at least 20 years to overturn that Fleet um and that would also include like this is going to be one of those moments where I imagine a real regulatory challenge right so if you so so I love internal combustion engines I am an internal combustion engine junkie and not only that I love naturally aspirated internal combustion engines and I'm not going to embarrass myself by saying how many of those I have but I have a belief that you know those things aren't going to be made for very long and that's why I love to have them

[02:00:59] I like the engineering I love the sound etc etc it's unlikely that you know a car so for example like a 1967 Corvette you can still drive it today even though it doesn't meet a single safety or emission standard that exists today it gets grandfathered in as you go along but when we start to think about autonomous vehicles and you you get to this point where you say well look for the system to really work every vehicle must be a level four or level five that is a totally different regulation that's no longer just saying to the car producer you can't make a car that doesn't meet these requirements it's saying to the consumer oh by the way you can't have that car anymore is that what's necessary here so I my one thing for you is horses when people say I'm never going to be able to buy my ice vehicle again or one in the future it's like you know what people still breed them raise them rise them own them you know there always going to be ice vehicles that internal combest you know that full you're going to still have it around and do what you need to do um but I think it also brings up the enormity of the problem yeah this is the biggest infrastructure problem I can imagine yes yep and that's why uh when I was administrator we actually put out the

[02:02:22] First Federal automated Vehicles policy and people were screaming well that's a nice policy but like what are you going to regulate and I used to say what are we going to regulate it's just a huge issue uh the autonomous vehicles aren't there yet there's some great programs going on demonstrating their potential but they're not there yet for full deployment you know throughout our entire society that they're just they're not there yet they're great demonstration pilot programs you know larger ones Etc but they're not and there are a lot of problems that are going on as well okay with some of the companies so that is still again to be proven and understanding where the risks are with that model we're still need to get there that's why I think one of the ways to conceptualize this is we're probably on a path there used to be a debate and I think we know what the answer is now do we just go along the levels 1 two 3 four you know till we get up to four and five fully autonomous or do we jump right to four and five and let's go for the full thing I think we're seeing it now just by what we're talking about Adas is that stepwise right get people familiar with the technology see where the advantages are see where it helps you see where it might actually save your life Etc that'll move us toward it to where eventually it's like I'd like to just get my hands off the wheel period you know at least for my commute or something else let the vehicle do it again if you want to race or do something else that's a different environment different right task you want to do but I think that's now that question's been answered that we're going to be going through these steps where technolog is introduced they help keep improve you know we we need to get enough data to show it's really going to make a difference and then when we have that I think people like okay it's built in It's Working Etc and then there'll be more Comfort at some point the the two examples I'll give you one is when I was administrator one of the things we did was actually challenge the Auto industry to make automatic emergency braking standard on every new vehicle by 2022 or at least 990 5 99% like of all the new vehicles we originally had 10 manufacturers and a couple months later when we launched this program to try and get this going we had 20 manufacturers um basically in covering about 95 to 99% of all new vehicles and the whole idea was they would get in the room and spend some time saying what are the criteria that we want to see everybody it's called democratizing

[02:04:45] Safety so it's not just if you buy a higher-end car or you know it's an option that I can it's like no democ means every new vehicle AE okay and the Insurance Institute highway safety says if everard had a we could probably reduce 50% of the rear end crashes with that okay wow big yeah and just to be clear mark this is not the warning that comes on when you're about to hit somebody but it actually will break if the distance and rate of speed between you and the car in front of you triggers an algorithm that says you're going to hit this thing so Peter this is it's so great to have some time to discuss this stuff a actually has multiple elements to it the warning is one another is if you don't break it'll break for you another one is if you break but you don't break hard enough because of the distance it will actually um add breaking power to what's going on and so that was what this working group was is let's figure out what the performance criteria will be for this

[02:05:48] AE um you know mandate that we want to see now why I'm bringing this up is because it was not a regulation and pretty much that's because every regulation that had come through recently like when I was there was 10 or 12 years in the regulatory Pipeline and so we said you know what let's just challenge them and see who would agree and like I say we end up having 20 manufacturers come together and I mention that because somebody just put a report out that basically they met that requirement now why is that relevant besides the fact that everybody's got AE and all those new vehicles again to our

[02:06:22] Point that's not retrofitting everything else right so there's still plenty of cars that don't have this yet it's going to take a while for all of that to change the other thing that most people it's not a secret but most people don't understand this but you know to get a regulation through you need to have an office of you know management budget basically do a cost benefit ratio right they got to do a calculation that says it's worth it it usually takes a penetration of at least 10 10% of the vehicle population to get enough data to do that kind of analysis and so technology OMB needs to budget yeah om needs to do an analysis of something because it's the government that's mandating it that's why so they they have be able to say yeah that that if we mandate this the cost to the industry to do this is X but then how do they assign a cost to life oh the numbers are there always debated but they've you but the yes but the number of the cost of life is is is is um doesn't include loss or pain and suffering it in like to the people who are left behind it's simply loss it's economic loss of life meaning you you you know you were you lost 10 years of your life working where you would have made this amount of money so it's my my point is it's it's probably an underestimate of the true value of Life by far absolutely absolutely and and part of what I'm bringing up is you typically need at least 10 % penetration in in the vehicle population col the most basic data to send it to them it's like if it doesn't even have the data for that cost benefit so they can do their straightforward lives versus we have this technology how many lives you think you're going to save and what data do you have to demonstrate it and substantiate it enough for the cost to the car the manufacturer the society right um so again I think that's one of the the the challenges you see going on to what we were saying before is that seeing these stepwise additions to these driver assist systems are getting added things like AE that are now standard allowed that so the agency just came out recently with um uh there's something called an advanced notice for proposed ruem and a notice for proposed rulemaking I don't know which one it is I forget but basically they're now going to regulate

[02:08:45] AE and I like to point out as part of the reason that they'll be able to do that at an even better level like maybe extending it to trucks and other are you know like heavier Vehicles Etc is because of this other work that was done you know that made democratized it as something that needs to be out there that everyone should be able to have in their vehicles so again I think we will see this stepwise going but I also point out that when we want to get to the full autonomous vehicle you said this earlier

[02:09:12] I want to bring us back to it the mixed Fleet is going to be a huge problem for everybody and if you think about it it's going to be at least three groups groups fully autonomous vehicles vehicles that have a lot of the Adas support systems and people that are just driving cars that don't have any of that stuff in it right they're just sort of like and they'll all be on those streets you won't know which is which necessarily

[02:09:36] Mercedes just came up with a a different color light for when it's in autonomy for some of the things that they're doing but just think about what a you know earlier our conversation about defensive driving is like which one is just think about how more challenging that kind of environment is going to be let's touch briefly on on drowsiness

[02:09:56] I I I realize this is kind of your life's work it's also the one that I think people who listen to my podcast regularly are very familiar with the implications of of sleep deprivation what what are the most important things you think you want people to understand with respect to how um compromised sleep impacts driving I'm going to repeat what

[02:10:18] I said earlier which is lose sleep to disrupt your clock the circadian clock in our brains um lose sleep disrupt the clock and you will pay for it by having human capabilities degraded or impaired that is across the board yep so I don't care what your job is or what task you're on um but if you're not getting you know the right sleep at the right time you're going to pay for it this is one of those you can't fool you know human nature just nature period you can't fool it there will be a price to pay and is there any regulation about when a truck driver can drive I understand there's clear regulations about how many hours he or she can drive but are there regulations that say we'd like you to stay within your circadian rhythm and do your driving we'd like you to see a sunrise and sunset and drive accordingly even though I know that that's not necessarily convenient and it might be far more convenient to drive through the night so what's really interesting is if you understand sleep in the clock some of what we would do as a society is exactly opposite the way the world actually runs and so there are regulations for uh in aviation and

[02:11:30] Trucking and rail um and a lot of other places as you already mentioned the resident training hours Etc but to your point they're usually mostly focused I always point out there's the two physiological elements you got to deal with the Sleep part and the clock usually it's easier to deal with the Sleep part and people still don't do that well but as you know just to be clear you know if if you don't have 10 hours off your job commuting getting eight hours of actual supine sleep opportunity doesn't mean you're going to get the sleep but at least eight hours opportunity you know maybe nine hours if what residents used to do is live in the hospital right I mean maybe but so yeah you can have a little bit better on the

[02:12:14] Sleep part but to your question the Circadian piece is a lot harder and keeping that stability a 24/7 Society military operations Air Traffic Control moving Goods you know it's just like operating airports it's like these are 247 um keeping energy going I mean just on and on 247 this this speaks to again

[02:12:35] I think the general theme here that I'm hearing Mark is we're we're going to quickly approach the limits of what humans are willing to do in terms of the sacrifices they're willing to make and therefore we have to come up with technology to work around that right like it's you know we're not going to be willing to live in a society where nothing happens at night so we're we have to automate those processes so that we don't have to rely on individuals functioning at fractional reserve and fractional capacity you got it I mean that's but we are so far away from that in our society now yeah it might not be in our lifetime it might not be you you and I probably won't appreciate the full extent of you know uh you know pick your favorite sci-fi movie where the the trucks are just you know autonomous vehicles that are transporting things on freeways at night but right but I I say that because start at the beginning which is the information even naivity and ignorance of society around the dangers not just the perform but that is still an emerging I me it's been going on for a while this I feel like you know Bill

[02:13:47] DeMent who wasn't just a professor of mine but became a friend in colleague and teacher and Mentor all those things he was probably one of the leading voices who said we got to pay attention to this because the price is too high and he always pointed out that if we don't get if we don't start with education so that people appreciate you know not just what the cost is but for me and Bill there's a lot of like if you appreciate what the benefits are of getting the sleep you need and keeping the schedule Etc that should outweigh you know putting yourself through this other stuff that's the individual piece but then it gets to what you just described is if we really accept that as a society then we have to move to what are the solutions going to be right and again it's not always intervening on the individual give them drugs do it's like no it doesn't have to be that it's going to have to be these other things like technology that helps us offset right those choices we make as a society that could still put us at risk let's close our discussion Mark with a couple of um things that people can take away as far as actions that they can take to avoid hurting others and being hurt and let's start with um that of being a pedestrian so what what can an individual do as a foot pedestrian um to minimize their risk uh let me start with a basic question how many times is a pedestrian killed when they have the right of way in a situation so they're not jay walking across a red that they shouldn't be they're they're they're doing the right thing they're either up on the sidewalk and a car comes up on them or they're they're Crossing when they should be

[02:15:27] Crossing and someone runs in like do you have a sense of that I don't it's a great question and I'm not sure we have that data okay because it just because the categories that these would be placed in um because again if they weren't doing something illegal I'm not sure that that kind of information would necessarily be collected so in other words it's easy I mean we could probably back into it if we I assume the data are tabulated for every time The Pedestrian is quote unquote at fault and I know we're trying to get out of the at fault mentality here and just solve the problem but but it you could say look you know of the 42,000 people who died you know 6,000 were pedestrians and we have a really clear example of a thousand of those pedestrians were were the ones at fault um and the driver tried to avoid them at the last second but couldn't and then we could maybe say well look in 5,000 of those cases The

[02:16:20] Pedestrian is not but but do you have a sense of what what a pedestrian can do specifically around their situational awareness what do they need to be on the lookout for to reduce those odds you bet and and I think it is worth noting again in the last decade that number's gone up 50% and this last year the estimates are like 7500 people have died as pedestrians you know of those numbers so uh that's significant so to the specific actions the choices that you have one is you know if there's a sidewalk be on it okay and again that's just separation right from the driving that's going on y um if there is no sidewalk you actually want to walk against the traffic yep okay so that's for visibility stuff of what's going on you already mentioned it it ends up um I mean we do know 64 67% of those fatalities occur outside of intersection so they're happening elsewhere okay um but it does mean that if you're Crossing you want to find an intersection that's got a crosswalk if you can and has some system of stop signs or you know counting for when you should go and you want to follow those rules as best you can okay the other one I think is you know visibility I can't tell you how you know again especially at night which is when the most of those occur over 50% or just you know simple straightforward visual things uh making sure people can see you and the other one I think in nowadays in particular we mentioned it for driving but situational awareness is critical and so it's amazing how many people you know could be either drinking or on their phone with head down um so distraction and the kind of things you think about as a driver you would apply to pedestrians and cyclists as well are cyclists included in that 7,500 deaths per year no I think those are just pedestrians I don't remember the cyclist number but it's it's there yeah as someone who rides his bike still outside though not nearly as much as I used to and frankly a lot of that is due to just my lack of faith in drivers um I certainly adhere to the principle of always assuming the car doesn't see me and always assuming that the driver is a um and those assumptions are surprisingly accurate more often than I would like to acknowledge I mean the amount of people that will pass you so they've presumably seen you only to then want to turn right directly in front of you is remarkable um but yeah uh you know I think I think

[02:19:03] I think all of those make sense the the The Walking on the other side of the road the the being completely aware and I just think as a general rule as a pedestrian also assuming drivers don't see you they're they're they're calibrated to look for bigger faster things than you uh so you just have to kind of assume they're not seeing you you know in California pedestrians have the right of way wherever they are but I always point out you know having a law yeah having a law sight means nothing if you're hit and dead or injured I always find that to be the dumbest argument ever which is assume you never have the right of way even when you do have the right of way when you have that big green light and the big you know walking sign still assume that a driver is going to make a mistake because the concept quences are much higher for you than them even though legally the Law's on your side um anything else Mark that that you you know I know I we we've sort of throughout this discussion infused as much kind of insight we can we we we you know we we have as as far as behaviors that you can take into your own hands and aside from the obvious I think the obvious ones are so clear um but I do again want to reiterate this thing of looking both way through the intersection I always tell people left then right then left because it's that left one that's going to kill you when you're driving um so left right left scan before the intersection when you have right of way uh the other thing for me Mark is um when I'm on a four-lane road two in each way I'm never in the left lane unless passing just because it takes one more especially with these non-m median roads out here it's that much harder for somebody to cross and weave into my lane so it's staying in the right hand lane and um you know it's really funny we've got these really fast we've got these 75 mph roads out here that have no median and there're typically three two or three lanes only in total two in One Direction one in the other and sometimes they're one in one and those are nerve-wracking you know a one-on-one 75 with no median yeah you know I think those are those are roads where I will not talk on the phone I will not listen to a podcast and all I'm doing is imagining how quickly could I

[02:21:29] Veer off to the right if a if a truck got into my lane um if I can just a slight Nuance to what you said is part of the defensive piece of that is um don't expect or assume that people are going to actually follow the rules and so you may be you know at that intersection and looking but it's like don't think because someone's got a stop sign there that they're actually you know you looked they've got a stop sign it's so don't assume they're going to follow the rules whatever they are right and that includes yellow lights red lights you know it's just like no if there's someone there and their potential risk your choice is whether you decide to proceed through slow down pause those are things that are under your control yeah yeah it's really funny uh two days ago I was driving uh somewhere and um I was going to make a I was in the right hand lane I was going to make a right hand turn into something and I didn't actually realize that there was a driveway before where I make my right so

[02:22:32] I had I put my right blinker on and this is a pretty quick Road it's about a 50 mph Road and I'm coming up to I'm now probably about I don't know 300 ft before where I'm about to make my right and a woman came to the edge of the road where where I I didn't even realize there was a road it's such a tiny little it's easy to miss Road and she looked saw me but saw that I had my right blinker on and just pulled out assuming

[02:23:01] I was going to turn right there now you could argue well technically I guess she's right I had my blinker on um but I had that blinker on long before she showed up thinking I'm turning you know whatever 3 400 feet up the road and again you know I had to really slam on the brakes not to hit her and she would have taken the brunt of that not me regardless again it's not about fault it's what is the consequence of this awful Collision um and I was amazed that she pulled out because it was she pulled out when my rate of speed hadn't even begun to slow and I wondered to myself how does she not see how fast I'm going like what did she think I was going to do somehow like I'm on a rail that's going to allow me to turn that quickly but see that's a perfect perfect example of what we just talked about don't assume people are going to follow the rules or that what you're seeing is what's going to happen and you know to what you just said is she wasn't thinking you know she just assumed that that right signal meant you were turning right into where she is right and and my point is even though maybe I was at fault like I If it's all when it's all said and done maybe it's my fault that I had the blinker on when I wasn't planning to turn right there but I think taking fault out of this is the right way to go and instead thinking root cause effect root cause effect because um the only accident I've ever been in my life Mark was a very bad accident where the other person was 100% at fault they ran a red light while I was going correct speed limit which was 50 m an hour through an intersection and luckily for this woman

[02:24:40] I hit the passenger side not the driver's side she was the only person in the car and I'm in a pickup truck she's in a sedan I hit her so hard that both vehicles were a write off MH it's the only vehicle I've been in where the airbags deployed and what struck me is how amazed I was at how quickly it happened because she wasn't I was driving this way and she was stationary to make a left so it wasn't like I was looking at her I saw her the whole time but never thought she would just jet out in front because it wasn't in my usual like going through the intersection somebody over there somebody over there it was the woman right in front who erroneously thought she had a green light to go even though she had a red arrow and she just pulled out slowly and you know I I did probably get the brakes on before I hit her but you know I think about that and I think had she had a passenger in that car could have been a very different situation yep um and it happens so quickly that it's uh yeah you don't have to make the mistake to suffer the consequence no and you know I really appreciate you telling these stories some people are good at it some people don't like to talk about them but this touches everybody right I mean you've lost someone in a roadway and it's like you know I mean there's the emotions you experiencing are so Justified and understood and and your approach to how you think about it now that are basic and all of that same thing here you know those two drivers you just talked about with different things it's like neither one of them thought again I'll go out today and see if I can get killed it's not just the other way right it's that one too it's like let me see if I can run into somebody do it it's like they're not doing that but it's a complex Dynamic environment with humans that are imperfect and make you know bad choices and also errors in what they do and how do we try and do that more safely um and I think again those encapsulate everything we've been talking about big societal changes how do we make this better for everyone but a lot of it comes down to your behavior what you can control the stuff that's out of control you can still do something about in some situations right and I I think it's also we didn't talk about this much and you made a just one quick comment in there there's a whole culture around cars that's part of what's going on here too right I mean it's our independence it's economics it's family it's just sort of the

[02:27:18] American way right don't tell me how so there's a lot going on here that also are at play which I think when we talk about you know we ever going to have fully autonomous so we can save lives like I'm not sure we know that yet maybe we work that way when the data can justify it but for the moment there's a huge car culture that's you know in operation here as well that clearly is affecting our choices and willingness to give certain things up you know for these other societal benefits that we know we could attain yeah are there any resources Mark that you would point people too who are kind of interested in the the what can I do right so we there again lots of things that hopefully will happen technologically and you know we can debate the policies all day long but at the end of the day everybody listening to this is going to get in their car today and um you know I I I hope we've given people a lot of strategies is there anything you would Point people to especially uh parents maybe who have teenage kids who are starting to drive where you can you know we can as you said I think get them started in the best way possible because you start to create patterns of behavior early so let's hold the kids for a moment and I think the place to start a few websites nit a.gov nhtsa.gov is a great website that you can go on it has a uh Vin vehicle identification number lookup so if you're wondering do you have a defect and recall that you should take care can do that cars seats you can literally go on there and put your kids birth date height weight and it'll actually give you recommendations of whether it's backwards forwards booster seat Etc really good with that and all the data we're talking about that I can't keep in my head is on that website and so it's a great source for things we haven't talked about it but Nitsa runs a new car

[02:29:10] Assessment program endcap it's the five stars stars for cars it's what's on the mononi label on your new car that's the is evaluating its crashworthiness and some other what's it called it's encap new car Assessment program okay so again when you're thinking about where should I start well just start with the ratings yep so nit has got all this different stuff that's a great resource there next would be um the Insurance Institute for

[02:29:40] Highway Safety iihs they do a lot of the crash testing but they also have a lot of research that they do so they will they're the ones who do the top safety pick and other kinds of things so that AE challenge I talked about that was actually collaboration between Nitsa and IHS doing that challenge for the industry to democratize aeb um and besides the crash information they also have other studies and things they do so really good there um national Safety Council NSC they have great data because they'll have car stuff they have pedestrian stuff they have cyclist information they're really good for General resources for safety including roadway pieces and then again sorry that one again was that's the national Safety Council NSC NC okay Y and the fourth one I would mention is is um Safe Kids worldwide and they actually certify car seat technicians because it ends up and

[02:30:39] I'm going to get this number wrong but 60 70% of car seats are installed incorrectly yeah I mean I know it's over 50% so you know it's great to do all that work to get the right one but then if it's not incorrectly so saf for Safe Kids worldwide actually does that too I think those four are great resources for different things when you get to the teenagers couple things triaa actually has different kind of driver contracts that you can use um so that's the insurance company also has a foundation so they have a lot of good Auto Safety information there as well but they actually have contracts that you can do with your kids and I would just say you should also look up because depending on the state they may have graduated licensing and that licensing for new drivers um actually includes like can you have other kids in the car no um can you drive after dark no you know and like this for 6 months this for a year Etc and so I was just talking to a friend it's like oh we did the AAA I'm like you should look at the graduated licensing along with the AAA and just see what the elements are and then come up with your own and I hate to say this cuz as a scientist you'll appreciate this too but you know feel free to experiment with her you know put put that training program you were talking about right that there's some simulator work there's also some actual driving work there's the intellectual part you know that would supplement any formal stuff she gets from another source but do that um and then do your own sort of I mean that's the intervention I would do your own assessment then to sort of could you measure some of that in the simulator for example to see if you know she's now you have an N of1 totally get but it's her life you're trying to save along with you know so whatever you could do there to try and you know bolster her with more education experience Etc that would make her again more situ situationally aware and defensive when she's driving along with the skill set I think would be great benefit the other thing I'll just tell you that's interesting is we've seen in the last 5 to 10 years young drivers are less and less interested in getting their driver's licenses right away so we're seeing kids in college that don't know how to drive you know or they're waiting till after college when they have a job or they're picking their location by public transit and this might be a great Trend given what you said about the maturation um of of kids anyway um so yeah you know one thing

[02:33:05] I'll just share with you with my daughter um she's not psyched about this but um she's going to be driving a manual transmission truck that's actually going to be her car and every time she sort of fusses about it and says oh you know I just say look I mean you could take the bus like that's cool too but if you want to drive you're going to be driving stick and um there's a big part of that is the connection to the drive and it reduces at least one of those variables in my mind which is the distractability um and she's nervous about rolling backwards on hills and I'm like good concentrate harder yep yep and learn the skill so that becomes a non-issue for you yeah yeah well Mark this has been um this has been really

[02:33:47] Illuminating um it's it's it's quite disturbing um as as as we've talked about and um I almost wish there was a way that we could convey you know every one of the

[02:34:18] 42,900 older people right your risk of death from cardiovascular disease stroke cancer and Alzheimer's disease this is disproportionately a disease of the elderly um whereas when I last looked at this which was 2020 and I can't imagine the data have changed that much the thing that stuck to me the most that that stuck out to me the most was that Automotive deaths uh were the most uniform cause of death by decade of any in the top 10 causes of death there was nothing more uniform than dying in a car yes equal opportunity killer which is why let me I know as we start wrapping just two things that I think would be good especially for you to be thinking about um one is that and these are where the parallels are there um one of the differences however is between health and say the safety element Etc is and one of the reasons I've really looked at safety and transportation from my sleep interests is death can be instantaneous right I mean it's like in milliseconds and and you don't go out in that day thinking it's going to happen and as you were saying yeah you don't get to say goodbye you don't get to say goodbye to your grandmother who's got cancer for two years yeah someone comes to your door they're not coming home you know I mean it's just sort of it's a different it's like just like that right um and so I think that's one thing that separates it in some ways from those chronic illnesses and you know many other kinds of things but I would also say there's some real significant parallels when I think about this because one of the big pushes that I've tried to to make happen in the automotive realm is trying to move from a more reactive safety culture to a more proactive one which again I think the par there of what you do for prevention and thinking about how do we eliminate or mitigate the things we know that can cause bad stuff promote the ones we know that will make good stuff happen how do we do that and I think that's been a challenge having worked at Nasa as a

[02:36:34] NASA scientist on the aviation side they're very proactive I mean in aviation they went 12 years with no in the US no person died in a commercial aircraft crash in like 12 years okay and then it was one right right and and I always tell people it's like it's so hard to get there it's even harder to stay there you know saving all those lives but that takes a proactive culture that says we're going to do what we can to eliminate or mitigate right diminish what those risks are and promote the good stuff we know that's going to make a difference you do that all the time this is why I said Thank you at the beginning because bringing this into that realm and not just Public Health this is like societal safety and what we get here there's a real parallel there that there's there's a chance to be more proactive now you think about it investigation is reactive bad thing happens we investigate but it's to make it proactive that what we learn from there has to be translated into some action that's going to prevent it from happening again and that's where frankly and always again I've already said thank you I'll do it again just having people discuss this and think about it tell their story to someone else those can save lives you know it's like I don't know your daughter at all I've known you for this period of time but it's like you're way better off both the fact you've talked about it you've thought about it and will basically provide those kinds of that context and skill set to your daughter you may not even be around when it saves her life or her kids's life or some other right person in her sphere because that's the societal change in a proactive way that's going to make the big difference and yeah I think we need to save them one at a time your friend my father the consequences are so significant but we can't bring those back how do we use those as opportunities though to make the future for you your daughter her family right my kids Etc what do we do to make that in a proactive way safer for the future you're doing that straight on with the health care the parallel is there in this realm as well because the costs are so high yeah I mean if there's one thing I could do based on this discussion mark because I now realize there's so many pieces that are changing with the technology that are going to move us in the right direction but if I could make a change today based on what we did discussed it would be that I wish that for every significant accident or fatality that occurred in a given city um the story was told in in two fronts this the story was told in the human sense of the story so that we understood the life or lives that were lost and the consequences and how that's going to Ripple through forever how you know Nick's wife lost her husband and

[02:39:16] Nick's kids lost their dad but also Al in a very clinical autopsy like manner of the accident I really think that every time a horrible accident or fatality occurred if each of us could see a 60-second video that would say this is what happened on this date and this time and these are the contributing factors that's it and everybody has to invest it's not a small price it's not it's not a big price to pay for those of us who are alive that for every time somebody dies you got to invest a minute in hearing how it happened like no other no other technology at this point in time just the explanation of what happened um is going to make us better drivers no question and and I think what's really this is why I was not kidding about write those down the 4minute video or like what you're talking about now and I would just slightly extend to say not just identifying the cause or contributing factors but if there's any action that people could actually take to do differently and think about about this with that local intersection you keep talking about without what you just described it's going to keep happening people aren't going to know what happened there or if there's anything different they could do to spare their life at somea it's not going to change without what you were just describing yeah yeah figure out how to do that Mark thank you very much really appreciate your your time and your

[02:40:40] Insight today thank you enjoy the conversation [Music] w
