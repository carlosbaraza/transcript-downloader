## Description

BJ Miller, a hospice and palliative care physician, and Bridget Sumser, a licensed social worker specializing in serious illness and end-of-life care, join Peter to share insights from their decades of work supporting people at the end of life. In this episode, they explore the emotional and physiological processes of dying, the cultural barriers that prevent meaningful conversations about death, and how early engagement with mortality can lead to greater clarity and connection. The conversation highlights the distinctions between hospice and palliative care, the nature of suffering beyond physical pain, and the transformative role of honesty, forgiveness, and relational awareness in the dying process. Through stories and reflections, BJ and Bridget reveal what truly matters in the end—and how the dying can teach the living not only how to face death but how to live more fully.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] I want to understand more about living and I have a an idea that we could learn a lot from people who are dying. One thing to get right out of the gates here is bodies die. Living things die. I think a lot of us absorb a notion of death that it's some foreign invader or something that comes out of the woods and grabs us and otherwise I was just fine and then not. I'm wondering if I should be in palative care right now. By the way, the reality is paliative care is just good healthcare. It is just One of the crazies a rebranding, but yes.

[00:00:32] Yes, it really does. Are there certain regrets that people have shared with you more often than others? What they all seem to have in common is they regret not letting themselves feel artificially or accidentally putting a wedge between you and anything. How much have either of you followed the the sort of psilocybin work, the Roland Griffith's work? I think it can be amazing. medical decisionmaking, power of attorney, things like that. So, one sort of public service announcement here is advanced directives is very important and you can download a form online like this is a free but you don't need a lawyer to do this. No, you do not need a lawyer to do this. What about the role of forgiveness? I would say more commonly what I see people needing to learn how to do is forgive themselves. You've obviously spent a lot of time with people in by definition the final stage of their life. What have you learned that changes the way you live your life or the way you want to live your life?

[00:01:30] Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Aia.

[00:01:38] BJ, amazing to have you back again and Bridget, great to meet you for the first time. Thank you guys both for um for coming out here. Um you know, BJ, you and I go way back. you're a previous guest on the podcast and and we've we've spoken a little bit about some of the topics we're going to get to today, but when when I reached out to you a few months ago to talk about this idea, um you immediately suggested bringing

[00:02:03] Bridget along. So, um let me just share with folks what I wanted to talk about and I would love for you to share why you felt that this would be a great three-person discussion as opposed to a twoperson. So I reached out to you and I said, "Look, um, BJ, I want to I want to understand more about living and I have a an idea that we could learn a lot from people who are dying." Um, and people who listen to this podcast know that I think that quality of life matters as much and potentially more than length of life. And a big part of that probably comes down to things that people think about during their life and during the end of their life. and maybe that there were maybe that there are regrets that people have that that only surface at the end of life. So anyway, I kind of ran this idea by you and uh actually I think I ran the idea by you as do you even know anybody that would have thoughts on this and you said I'd love to talk about it and so yeah. Well, first of all, thanks for having us

[00:03:01] Peter. It's good to see you buddy. Um and I just love the setup for this conversation. Um, I think we're very happy to be talking to you in general, but also to kind of continue to form the it's not quality of life versus quantity of life kind of false dichotomy that you've done so well to reapproximate. Um, so we're really happy to be here and talk about this stuff.

[00:03:27] So, but why Bridget? I mean, so for me, um, a couple of thoughts. I mean, one is I just love Bridget and her mind, and we get to work together in myriad ways over the years. And the subject, um, you'll you'll hear us again and again. We're going to thwart the idea that there's an objective and approach to death. That is the way to go. Um, you're not going to hear us citing much data because there it's not a very well, it's not an easily studied phase of life. and what data do exist tend to be qualitative.

[00:04:01] Um but this with all that subjectivity it feels really important to have other voices sharing their point of view on sort of a similar outlook. Um, so that's in part why Bridget and also too for both of us which is bridge I don't mean to speak for you but I think the uh one of the things we should get up front too is first of all I haven't been uh my work in the last four years has pulled me farther away from being at a bedside you know and but either both of us have spent many countless hours in hospital bedsides and other places that we'll be drawing from but I think to get to the questions that you're interested in answering ing so much of the work preparing for dying begins earlier in life or one way and another. So the idea that I think for your audience to imagine deathbed scenes that in the final moments there's this great epiphany or climax of some sort can happen, but that's really not the norm. A lot of the action is in the days, weeks, months, years preceding the death moment. I mean, death is a moment.

[00:05:12] Um, and so one thing I think we want to get across as you've brought quantity and quality of life, we need to bring dying and living together. They are part of a whole. They're not at odds. And so that so and so when do we begin dying, Peter? Like the second we're born. Exactly. So in some ways, all of us have some access to this subject already.

[00:05:33] Bridget and I are just a little bit closer to it on some level. So, Bridget, what drew you to this uh to this space? I I'm sure this is a question you get asked the moment people find out what you do. It's um it is an uncomfortable place to to stand. Yeah. What what's drawn you to it? You know, we all have our places in the world. Um, and while this is an uncomfortable place, maybe from the outside for me, it is a pretty comfortable place and that was sort of what got me there. I had many people in my life die. Um, and I was in pretty close proximity to those deaths and I wasn't freaking out. Um, and so there was something in me. I looked around and a lot of other people were freaking out and I was sort of like, "Oh, this is weird. Am I unaffected? Am I guarded in a way that makes it so I'm kind of numb?

[00:06:26] And no, actually, it was more just that there was something in me that was okay around dying and also really curious about it. Um, so that's how I got to this work. Can you say a bit more about that? What what if you're comfortable, what were some of the experiences you you had growing up? Yeah. Um, uh, my cousin Kristen died when she was 13 and I was 18.

[00:06:56] She had pulmonary primary hypertension. And um, I was with her the day she died. And as you can imagine, a 13-year-old dying is a pretty chaotic scene. Um, she was not in a like official dying process that anyone was recognizing. Um so it was um crisisy and traumatic and there was just a stillness in me. I mean I was very affected. I was there was a lot of emotion. I felt fear and um overwhelm but I also felt really able to be there for others. You know I was 18 and the adults around me were as you can imagine all over the place.

[00:07:43] Um, and so it was less about others, although I felt quite connected to her, it was more about um, being able to be like stay in my own body and be in my own experience um, and pay attention to what was happening, make contact with what was happening. So, it was a pretty internal kind of experience and awareness.

[00:08:07] Um it wasn't until later experiences um with one of my best friends moms a few years later that I felt sort of that capacity in relationship to others as like a main supporter. That first imprint was really like there's something in this experience for me. PJ, people who listen to our first um episode will be familiar with your story, but and invariably there are a few people here who who aren't. You want to give the Super Readers Digest version of of uh of your story and how it probably shaped a lot of what you do today? For sure it did. I mean, so I I went into medicine very simply because I had been a patient. I mean, I had no med, it's not like I was pre-ordained to head into medicine or I had never even considered it. Uh, but at age 19, sophomore in college, not around the time Bridget, you're having your experience at the bedside one way or another, my I was in the bed uh uh thanks to an electrical injury at

[00:09:13] Princeton. And I was screwing around on a commuter train and climbed up on top and I had a metal watch on my left wrist and the electricity arcked to the watch and that was that was that. So um came very close to death. Um lost and you know you could say part of my body died. I had lost both legs and one arm. Um part of them. Uh and so that was a really big wakeup call to me. And for for people who aren't familiar with that type of injury, I mean, I've I've seen you without a shirt on. I know what the the you know, it's it's it's not like, oh, we just cut these things off and you'll be we'll be home Friday and we'll see you at clinic next week. The burn the magnitude of these burns, the skin grafts that are required. How long were you in the hospital? I was in the burning it for about three months. So, and burning it are horrible. Just a special place. It's not I don't know what to compare earning it to um for the patients or the people providing the care. It is um careers very very special people in those units. Yes. And careers tend to not last very long for a lot of reasons. There's these are um houses of pain of a certain kind. So anyway, three months in that particular setting which was that says a fair amount to your point about the complexity of electrical injury. I mean, that means I was on the edge for about Did you lose kidney function? I don't recall that. Um, I don't recall that, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was dinged. I remember I remember looking over at the monitors many weeks in and my heart rate was, you know, 190 and, you know, just sitting there, you know. So, there's a lot of fallout um from an injury like that. And it takes a long time for the body to settle in and declare what's going to live and what's not. So, the amputations were sequential. They take a little bit to see what tissue is viable. All the while the risk of the way generally people die from burns is infection because you lose your you know immediate defenses your line of defense of your skin. Um so hyper sterile environment no windows nothing natural about it at all you know. Um anyway, so that went on for a long time until I was out of the woods and then it was clear I was going to survive and then becomes the sort of longer work of learning to cope with this new body. And that's a that was entailed a lot of mourning, a lot of grief, a lot of effort, um a lot of creativity on my behalf as well as a lot of people around me. Um so took many many months and very to get out of that that setting from the burn unit into a step down unit and then into a rehab unit and then outpatient. Um and then begins the work of re-entering the world. Um and that's its own challenge with a visible disability. And as you say, the skin grafts, I was, you know, I used to be so ashamed of that look. I used to cover it up. And then, you know, there was the work of kind of getting used to it and being comfortable in my own skin, literally again. And that took about two years before I was willing to show anybody this, you know, and then five years again hit another milestone for me just sort of being uh inhabiting my own life again on some level um and being anything other than an object to glare at. So anyway, there's a lot to say about, you know, a very slow process and it's ongoing. You know, I recently had a procedure uh we don't need to go into details, but it's fallout from a um um a central line that was being placed in my neck that got botched and clotted off and 35 years later I had fallout from that. So, it's an ongoing process all the time. I get new legs every two years or so and that's its own process. So it does not end. So a moment ago you alluded to the idea that um kind of movie deathbed scenes are probably the exception and not the rule.

[00:13:16] I want to kind of explore this idea a little bit more. But I also want to help people maybe understand uh at the population level what death really looks like. So on this podcast we talk a lot about causes of death, right? People who listen to me are very familiar with the four horsemen and we know about cardiovascular disease and we know about cancer and we know about neurodeenerative disease and we can talk forever about these things but we don't really talk about the very very end perhaps with the exception of a fatal myioardial inffection. Mhm. Um and about 50% of MIS are fatal. Um but about 50% are not and they're just setting you up for maybe heart failure or something else.

[00:14:04] So as difficult as it is, I'd love for you to sort of explain the mechanics of of death of and we can start with the more common cause of death, which is cardopulinary death. We could talk about brain death after, but I' I'd love for both of you to sort of describe what's happening both medically, socially, cognitively, like to the to the individual through that process. Peter, do you mean like the the the moments leading to the death, the as the body shutting down? Yeah. In those final hours, what is really happening? What does it mean to die of cancer? Right?

[00:14:40] Like, well, you know, I think for many people it's a very foreign idea that this woman had breast cancer. Okay, there were cells in her breast that all of a sudden acquired mutations. Those cells escaped from her breast and went to other parts of her body. But there's still a bit of a disconnect. Why did that why did the invasion of those cells to her bones and her lungs end her life? Well, bridge, you want me to talk a bit little about sort of the medical physiological stuff and you can talk about some of the social. Does that sound right? Yeah. Well, starting with the sort of more kind of cut and dry, more anatomical, physiological things happening as a body's trying to die. And

[00:15:23] I like that phrase trying to die because we often find ourselves intervening in a body that's trying to die. It is one thing to get right out of the gates here is bodies die, living things die. It's uh I think a lot of us absorb a notion of death that it's some foreign invader or something that comes out of the woods and grabs us and otherwise I was just fine and then not. Um no. Um, and as you know better than any uh of us that there are all sorts of things we can do to promote life and there are a lot of ways we're wired to to hang on to life and to run from anything that's a threat to us.

[00:16:00] Those are all true and all natural. Um, but included on the list of natural things that we do is die. So I I you know it is that's what a body is supposed to do. I just want to get that clear. There's nothing wrong with you for dying. This is the way it's supposed to go. So your body knows how to do this. So let's talk about what the body knows how to do. I mean in general uh depending on the cause of death whether the pathway might be cancer as you're mentioning or heart disease or neurodeenerative diseases there's a final common pathway of a body kind of shutting down and it tends to shut down by organ system you know and it doesn't follow a neat and tidy pathway. It can happen kind of spontaneously in a kind of a moment. They're here and then they're gone. But very often, especially these days, most of us, like 80 plus percent of us, will die of chronic illness. We will meet the thing that eventuates our death well in advance of the death. So, we'll get that diagnosis that someday will be the thing that ends our life. Um, that's so that's its own, we could talk about that. That's its own kind of ball of wax that comes with that fact. Whereas in the old days, many of us, most of us died more spontaneously.

[00:17:16] You're very alive, then you're very dead. Not a lot of in between. So in this in between thing to get to find your question, Peter, um is um this sort of shutting down phenomenon. So in oftenimes if we're trying to prognosticate, help a person or family get a sense of how much time is left, um we're looking at things like are they in and out of bed, you know, much? are they getting up and out of bed? So, if you're asleep on the couch or in the bed 50% of the day, you know, um and if that's sort of a progressive process, more and more fatigue, more and more tired, that usually in the context of chronic illness tells us we're heading towards the end. Um an interest in food and fluid is a big one. So, a body trying to die, a GI tract that's on its way to shutting down will stop sending hunger signals. And this is a big one for the audience to hear because a lot of us, you know, food equals nutrition equals nourishment equals life. So, if we see someone we love or ourselves not eating, the impulse would be, well, put some food into us. That's life. We don't want someone to starve to death is often what we do. And also love, right? That's how we show our care. And exactly symbolically the act of feeding another is you know the nourishment the love to your point bridge that comes with that there's so much around food but then before we cut over to bridge to explain more that's that good piece of the puzzle that you know the body again is sending you a signal don't put food in me because it will hurt if a gut is not able to process the food it sits in place and can cause pain. Same with fluids. If we're forcing fluid into a body that's trying to die, that fluid will pull and cause trouble. So the judgment of call when to push the food and fluid and when not is up to really a dialogue and a sort of a song and response with the patient. Once you know, you might try a little bit of fluid and if that ends up in their lung or ends up swelling, then we pull back.

[00:19:20] But back to your question, so as a body's trying to die, it will stop sending signals for that food and fluid. And that's to be generally respected, not pushed past. Um, mental status. So people often get really fuzzy in their thinking or all and delirium is very common. Um, so often times they'll they'll be disoriented. Think it's 1912 and they're in a forest somewhere when they're in a hospital bed. Um, so that's very common. And BJ, delirium is not uncommon in the hospital. A lot of times with otherwise very healthy patients who are in the hospital to get surgery. Uh the loss of circadian rhythm, the use of narcotics and other medications can easily induce delirium in a person who's otherwise not going to die. Y is this a different form of delirium? And and what is really underpinning it? I don't know that it's a different form of delirium per se. um you know ultimately it's a similar pathway in that it looks the same. So you can have a hyperactive delirium which are very easy to spot.

[00:20:22] Someone's jumping up and down bed and going kind of nuts and acting in a way that's not comporting with the context of their sitting in a hospital bed. So hyperactive delirium can be easier to spot. Very often it's hypoactive delirium which is we often miss especially in the hospital setting. Might just be a little tangential thinking or not quite clear on what day it is. something that's not so obvious.

[00:20:44] And very often the person's just silent. And that's more often the case, I'd say, at the end of life. It's more likely to be a hypoactive delirium. And so it may be hard to spot. And the person's been sleeping a lot anyway. So you might not you might miss it. But one reason to bring it up um is because if you if you don't know what to look for, I think a lot of family members and and loved ones will be at that at the bed, you know, trying to ek out every last moment with this person and looking for clues about what's going on for them and last relational moments and exchanges.

[00:21:21] And very often I've heard from a lot of people reports of well gosh I my husband never said a mean word to me in our 50 years of marriage and I've been traumatized for the last two years since he died because those last words to me were this vulgar something or other and or he told me that he to get out of his you some harsh comment and oh I I it's one of those big takeaways for your audience just please keep delirium in mind because what it als also means is a person who is delirious is not you cannot they are not themselves. So whatever they're saying you you really cannot take it literally. You really cannot take it literally. So that poor woman that was suffering for you know if someone had told her about delirium then she would have understood she took it very literally and was suffering immensely. Um so anyway that's a note about delirium. It does feel like an important moment to pause just to note a couple of things which is you know delirium at the end of life we take as seriously as we would in a more acute setting where someone's in the ICU with expectation to recover and we think about environmental factors that influence delirium like lighting and noise and interruptions right because if we can minimize delirium we want to we want to want to treat it and care for it I think the other thing about this space is that we enter into the like riched and nuanced and complicated space of interpretation and the meaning that's being made around what's happening. Right? So, in that story, someone's I was sitting at a bedside once with two daughters and their mom was dying and she had been mostly quiet um hadn't really talked in a couple of days and um we're sitting there talking about her and telling stories and the her kids are telling me about her and she opens one eye and she kind of sits up and she says to her daughter, "I love your jacket."

[00:23:21] And I look to the daughter and the daughter just bursts into tears. And you know, I'm sitting there thinking like, "Oh, this is so nice." Like, "Mom gives a like I'm expecting something positive." And the daughter's like, "She's never complimented my clothes before, if anything. She always looked at my at my dress in this um critical eye, like this is so off, you know?" And

[00:23:43] I think that could be one of those projections that we're going to get to the end and dad's going to say, Mom's going to say the thing that we never heard them say, and they may. and that might not feel good, right? So it's it's complicated and so interpersonal and personal and subjective and you know it's one of the reason why two of us being here together and why this work is done often in teams because we could both be in the room with the same person and have very different kind of hits or interpretations around what's happening, what's most important in the room, what needs to be tended to.

[00:24:26] God, but there's so much to say about this stuff and that delirium thing. I mean, there's a big on this point of altered consciousness and what people are saying and what's coming out of people. It's also true that deep dark secrets can sometimes get revealed. That's also true. So, but so much needs to be interpreted and it's therefore held lightly and because you don't there these are final moments you may never get the clarity of what mom or dad or that person actually meant in that comment which is another trick to holding death in our living is to hold it lightly because we keep we will find ourselves wanting to apply a story of meaning on all of this stuff as a humans what what we do but one of the great lessons around this work is just you know just to hold that carefully and lightly. It's not always what we think it is. Um and on that note of delirium to I I will say as a medical person I was taught that delirium is inherently a kind of suffering that it's uncomfortable that that to be confused to be disoriented is itself uncomfortable and it's certainly problematic for the loved ones. So we always medicated it with antiscychotics and others. we just thorazine just shut it down. I will say my own arc of my career and as I've gotten as I've sort of diluted the medical piece with other ways of thinking um I'm not so quick to shut that down. Um there may be something either vital happening for that person in the bed to express whatever's in there. Um it may be something that's helpful for the person to hear. I gave you the counterpoint that it's hurtful for a loved one to hear it in a decontextualized way. But I think one of the meta messages here is dying um it doesn't can't always be shouldn't perhaps maybe to use that hard word um be so tidy and um immaculate and clean and you know perfect. I think I want to disabuse I think we'd both like to disabuse that notion of uh that that's a good good death. Um so a quiet death a person. So I I increasingly would not medicate a delirium unless I had a conversation. If you were my patient I'd say Peter hey you know there might be moments where you can get a little confused etc. And if that happens would you rather you know maybe there's an opportunity for me to ask you. Would you like us to kind of air on the side of medicating that and help you sleep through it? you know, or talk to family about that. But the bottom line here is it's not such a onetoone thing. When we see this, that means suffering, that means medication. It's much more mysterious than that. One of the things

[00:27:08] I've been thinking a lot about lately is how people died hundreds of years ago and thousands of years ago. So, let's use thousands of years ago before before the advent of any medicine at all. So admittedly they weren't living that long and admittedly um you know life expectancy would have been into the mid to late 30s. Um but people always confuse that for meaning nobody lived beyond that. Of course that's not true. It just means so many people died young, right? Like infant mortality was through the roof. Tons of trauma and infection. But clearly there were people that were living into probably their 60s and

[00:27:54] I'm sure some of them were dying of cancer, right? So I wonder absent any medicalization of death what death looked like then. Do we know anything about this? I mean I don't from the books. I mean I can imagine but and I think we knew that people died more acutely but to your point that's probably because they just didn't they didn't know they were harboring a tumor or atheroscerosis whatever else. So it looked like they were and and I think suffering I think an average human had a different relationship to the dayto-day suffering and pains that went with being alive. And I think in modern life has been tempting has tempted us with the idea that we could always be comfortable and that pain is a problem to root out and fix quickly get back to the norm which is comfortable always which is just crazy talk. So I think part of it is we've induced people's pain by offering these fixes to them. Um by virtue of having something to offer your suffering we might be more primed to tune into our suffering and seek that fix for it. And we've kind of pulled this ourselves forward over time through modern life in such a way that back in the old day, I don't imagine that people were so distracted by their daily aches and pains. Um, so I'm kind of getting off your question. I don't think we know, at least among us, I don't think we know from an historical like I couldn't tell you factually what used to be the case. But watching patterns and knowing that human nature hasn't probably changed so much in the last couple hundred years per se. I think one is that people harbored a much they lived closer to death. Death what they didn't and lived closer to pain and so in some ways they suffered less because it didn't have wasn't tainted by a sense of injustice or why me? I'm projecting that's which is which is an irony because as I think about a person dying in their 80s today

[00:29:58] I think of that as kind of a remarkable privilege like that we could be alive in this period of time where we could make it into such an old age but yet at the same time it feels like a tragedy even though ironically the tragedy is those people that were dying thousands of years ago. I want to ask you a question,

[00:30:18] Bridget, unless you wanted to say something else about that, but I was going to ask you a question about pain, please. Okay. So, when you're talking to somebody who makes the decision to enter hospice care or paliotative care, and I I want to come back to making sure people understand the similarity and difference there. Two quite different things potentially. Um but let's let's um let's let's take an example of an individual who uh is is cognitively completely intact but is faced with a terminal illness. Um and let's maybe even talk through different examples. Somebody that's got something as debilitating as Lou Garri's disease where their mind is completely intact and they're suffering a neurologic disease that's going to kill them. uh versus an individual with an with a with a cancer that has metastasized and is just a matter of time.

[00:31:10] What are their greatest fears when they come to you? And where does where does physical pain and discomfort rank on that list? I mean, it's such a humbling question. The and it's it's a little bit hard to answer when you put something like Lou Garri's disease and cancer next to each other. Pick pick one and let's talk through it. Yeah. But I think the thing I want to say sort of before picking one is is right like the the path that gets you to the intersection where you are thinking about entering hospice or able to tolerate that idea is very different right as you know if you're facing neurologic illness or cancer or heart failure right like the experience that patients and the folks around them have had you know maybe quite short maybe a decade maybe with really success uccessful treatments, maybe this kind of downward feeling slope the whole time. And so you're really primed, I think, in different ways at that intersection depending on what this last chapter has been like.

[00:32:14] Have you been mostly healthy and felt pretty good and something happens quickly? Have you been in and out of the hospital sort of in this endless cycle, right? you're you're holding very different experiences and people have um honed their muscle of adjusting and adapting and adjusting and adapting very differently kind of depending on their experience of of the illness they've had.

[00:32:42] It's also really really colored developmentally depending on where that person is in their life. Are they 42 with two young kids? Are they 85 having lived a life they feel pretty good and full about? Um, and so that's all the layer, you know, that's not all th those are a few of the layers of context that really inform given how much there is to unpack there and now I realize I want to go into all of that. Let's take the step back and help people understand the difference between paliotative care and hospice care. Yeah. Great. Um, so, uh, I sort of think of it as like paliative medicine is the big umbrella. Paliative care is the big umbrella. Um, and hospice care is sort of like the very end or the the sort of, um, back side of the umbrella. Um, palative care is a medical specialty usually provided by a team for folks with a serious illness.

[00:33:40] Um serious illness can be defined lots of ways and is defined differently in different health systems uh kind of depending on how they're staffed and how their palative care programs are kind of created to function what what purposes they're serving but um some of the and BJ you jump in at any points but uh some of the big differences is that um with paliative care generally there's no limitation around um any disease directed that are modifying therapies you might be uh pursuing. Um, and you don't have to be dying inherently um or even clear that you're facing death. You could be diagnosed with a very serious cancer that actually has pretty robust treatments and you could live for quite a long time um meaning many many years.

[00:34:29] Many many years. So in that situation, what is the objective of the paliotative care team? Mhm. Um to think really holistically about who is this person? Um where are they in their lives? How do they make sense of what's going on? What do they understand about their illness? Who's supporting them? Um all really grounded in this. Are there ways that we can help this person feel sort of as well as possible? Um to treat the symptoms related to serious illness, to treat the symptoms related to the treatments of different serious illnesses. Um uh but in the context of a whole life, which means, you know, you could have on a clinic day, you could be seeing two people that seem on paper generally the same, right? Similar age, you know, demographic, backgrounds, diagnosis, and be dealing with really different things when you walk in the room.

[00:35:26] Um what would you either Yeah, I mean, no matter how you slice it, the goal is is the focus is quality of life. Yep. Period. Whether it's p of care or hospice and by the way for both Bridget. So it's inherently interdisiplinary as Bridget was saying that's why Bridget's social worker and I'm a medical doctor but we work with chaplain, nurses, music than theologists, potentially art therapists, volunteers. It's when the subject matter is suffering and quality of life, you know, there's no one discipline that has a lock on that stuff. So but whether it's p of care or hospice, the focus is really on helping someone feel as well as possible. And that is an inherently holistic question because it gets at their identity. It gets at their physiology. Possible as defined by them. Yeah. Right. And so for someone that could mean very aggressive pain management. And for someone else they could have a different relationship to the experience of pain and they wouldn't put that at the top of the priority list. They might put more concrete or relational kind of supports, you know, higher up on their list. So our, you know, the beauty of our jobs and our work is to meet this person in this moment in time and identify what's up for them, what's most important and sort of where where it is that we get to meet them to work towards quality of life as defined by them. So what is the transition then for an individual from being under the broad umbrella of paliotative care into a more narrow defined level of care is hospice. Yeah.

[00:37:02] I mean I think there's the there's some idea you know there's some like uh world of ideals in that and then there's what actually happens and the reality in this country is that um folks are admitted to hospice very very late you know the length of stay um on a hospice program in this country is something like a 3w weekek average and so it's actually quite little bit of time um and when I think about when hospice is a good fit for folks. I think about um wanting to stay out of the hospital.

[00:37:41] Mhm. being in a place where they are ready to or being forced to grapple with the reality that there is not um anything left to do to change what is happening in their body to change the cancer to delay the neurologic illness. um uh and or folks that are more explicitly ready to be supported in their end of life care or in their transition and and just done with chasing the treatment, you know, done with chemo. Yeah, maybe there's it may be you that chemo might have something more to offer them in terms of life spent, but they are just electing to be done with that.

[00:38:25] So whether the whether chemo and other things have run out of run their course and there's nothing left to try, which is often the case or they feel done with what's left to try, they're telling us that they're just they don't want to try anything else. Either way, they would much more likely to be hospice ready.

[00:38:42] Now you're saying the average length of stay in hospice and and really there are as as I'm aware of it and so correct me if this is not correct. There seem to be three paths to hospice. There's hospice in your home where you go back to your home and a hospice team comes there and cares for you in your home. Yeah. There is a paliotative care ward inside a physical hospital that provides hospice care but it's still within a hospital.

[00:39:08] And then there are outpatient hospice facilities, dedicated facilities for hospice that are not hospitals. Would those three encompass the the how hospice care is delivered or is there another one? Sort of in terms of sites of care. Okay, this is where it starts can get really wonky. It's complicated and you can shut us up. There's so many different there's so many tributaries, but to kind of back up a little bit that may be orienting for the audience here.

[00:39:35] So, as Bridget's totally correct, pallet of care is the larger umbrella. Um, hospice is this sort of subset of pal of care devoted to the final months of life. So to be real clear, same philosophy in a lot of ways, but by insurance and reimbursement lines and by policy designation, you can get pal of care alongside curative intended care.

[00:40:01] You cannot do so in hospice. When you go onto hospice, you have to give up that curative intended care like and not just that. I mean, you can't have an IV line generally speaking. Yeah, generally speaking. So there is it is a the way it's set up is a crossroads. We'll make the point that dying and living look a lot alike. But in the man-made world of policy and health care structure, there are some important forks in the road. So one of them to go on hospicees, you no longer have access to or don't want curative intended care and things that go with it. And also someone somewhere has to certify that should nature run its course, you likely have six months or less to live. So those are the two forks in the road to qualify for hospice. Pal of care those are neither of those applies for pal of care. So that's a really important distinction.

[00:40:51] So I'm trying to kind of and one other point to make there is while pal of care is the larger umbrella hospice is the older one. So we started in this country with hospice and since the 1982 when Medicare got in the business we had those restrictions and then people in the n 80s and 90s realized like why are we waiting till the final weeks and months of life to deliver this kind of loving care and so the p of care was born as a younger bigger sibling to encomp to get outside of those restrictions. So it's a wonky history. Well, what's interesting is you just said that hospice care was the original and it was 6 months of life expectancy and today we're at a point where median or mean is 3 weeks in hospice. Yeah. Well, if that's true, and we think about what we know about what an individual looks like when they have 3 weeks left of life, this is usually a person who's already in delirium, already in the early stages of organ failure. This is a person who probably is already spending more than 50% of their time sleeping. Um, and what I guess I'm hearing you say, or maybe I'm imputing, is should they have moved into hospice sooner? Have they have they been unnecessarily discomforted by pursuing therapeutic intent until that 3 week mark on average?

[00:42:18] Uh Brad, you want to jump in there? You go first. Yeah. I would say as a as in broad strokes unequivocally in general the answer is yes. I think we know that patients and families wait too long. they're suffering more than they need to and taking on treatments that are no longer helping them for a longer period of time that there's a what can feel like a charade portion of care. Um, and there's a lot of reasons like patients and families not wanting to look at that piece of the puzzle yet. Denial is a thing, you know, and also referring physicians perhaps is the the bigger reason that they are not seeing the writing on the wall or don't want to or whatever else. Um, so it's very often that the physicians don't bring up hospice until way late in the game. So for many reasons, I think it is a generally true statement that we wait too long to uh invoke hospice.

[00:43:13] We wait too long based based on our own stated goals of feeling at peace and having some comfort towards the end and not wasting our time doing things that don't help us. And and we also get into these situations where, you know, my wife tells a story about one of her very close friends who died uh in 2018 from um she had an abdominal cancer and her wish was to die at home. Mhm. She was readmitted I think for a bowel obstruction and she was never able to get out of the hospital. Yeah. Right. So she died in the hospital. And yeah, this is also probably not an uncommon situation where

[00:43:54] I think back to patients I took care of who heroic measures were done, right? So maybe someone had a an aortic dissection or a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. They're old. They already have organ failure. You go ahead and do it. But this is a person who was cognitively completely intact when they came in. 3 weeks later, they're intubated. they're on dialysis, you can't transfer that person to hospice, right? I mean, because the moment you turn off because you can't have the ventilator, you can't have the diialysis. The moment you turn those things off, the person expires.

[00:44:27] So, they're going to expire in an ICU. Never what they wanted probably. But there So, so how often do you in your experience are people in that no man's land where they now have missed the window to go into hospice? All I can say is not uncommonly. I don't have numbers to site, but that is not an uncommon story. Um, and that's why if the second

[00:44:47] I hear someone say, "I never want to die in a hospital." My ears go up as a potential referral, like then this person should really, we should really look to get this person to hospice as soon as possible. BJ, I've never met anybody who wants to die in a hospital. I mean, I'm going to I'm going to go on record right now and say I don't want to die in a hospital. Now, I hope that my death is 35 years away, 40 years away, if I'm lucky. I don't want to die in a hospital. Yeah. I I've I've watched too many people die in a hospital. It's never ever ever what you imagine it should be or could be. The godamn beeping, the smells, the noise, the chaos, it is awful. Yeah. So, if you were my patient, you were our patient, you know, it would be we' be interesting to to go down that road a little bit.

[00:45:35] And Bridge, you may have different things to say, but I hearing that and the stridency with which you say it versus like, I don't want to be in a hospital. hospitals suck. But to hear that kind of level of passion, which comes from having been there, right? Most people might not be as, you know, adamant about it as I am, but they haven't they haven't watched a thousand of these deaths. And I'm all the more reason for me to really take what you're saying very seriously. You know, where of you speaketh here. So, you know, so if you were under if I were in any way involved your care, I would just pull up a chair and say, "Peter, I heard you say that, buddy." And first of all, I might ask you like, "Is that a throwaway comment? Do you mean that today?" you know, like really kind of get behind with what's what you're saying there and to see how durable a choice that is. And then I might say to you very explicitly like in the even in the abstract, Peter, someday, as you know, there's going to be something that's going to come along is going to eventuate your death. So, let's you and I we're going to keep a real hawk's eye on this together. And there's going to be crossroads along the way around treatment decisions. And what your oncologist or cardiologist or whoever doctor may not share with you is what it means to take on this treatment and what might happen. And you know, we'll together you and I will interrogate all these decisions and really dig in to see what's going to what what might land you unexpectedly in a hospital in a ways that you're going to feel stuck. And I would also say to you, Peter, part of dying well is also letting go of all the things you can't control. And there's only going to be so many things that we can dictate. That's right. I could get into a car accident tomorrow that ends me up in an ICU where they struggle valiantly to save me, but

[00:47:13] I still die and and that means I'm dying in a hospital. Yeah. So, exactly. So, I would sort of disabuse you of some absolutism around this. But then we would we would you have just given us our marching orders as the thing to let out for you as Peter Aia to not suffer more than you need to. where you are when death comes is a huge point for you. So that's noted. So we'll we'll wrap that into our care together as we move through time and we'll make decisions with that in mind. But that is because you were explicit about it. And you say most people who wants that hospital that's true, but that conversation rarely actually happens to get that goal stated and into the kind of care plan.

[00:47:55] Yeah. Let's give a couple of examples of where that discussion has relevance. Right? So now let's go back to a couple of these examples. So you're you you've had that discussion when a person is still in paliotative care before transitioning to hospice. Are you sometimes waiting to have that discussion in hospice for the first time? Which conversation about where?

[00:48:20] Yeah. Where I think it depends. I mean, I think it depends on the kind of clarity or adamance a person comes into. So, it might be one of the first conversations you have, right? If somebody's had a really visceral experience in their own life, it could be the first thing they're thinking of with the diagnosis of a, you know, advanced cancer or something. Um, and it may be a conversation that's happening sort of weeks into hospice depending on how things have evolved with the family andor how they're changing. Um, so I think you know I do want to just step back which is like I have seen very beautiful hospital deaths. Yeah. And

[00:49:06] I've also been I think the reason I'm so jaded is when you come from where I came from, you're running codes on people who are dying, right? you're they're dying while you're doing chest compressions on them and you're shocking them and you're breaking ribs. Yeah. And and so yes, I I should really clarify. I'm coming at it from a very narrow point of view that has maybe maybe skewed my view too much.

[00:49:31] Maybe it's worth the conversation. We're all informed by those experiences, right? and the the the I haven't I'm you know I'm not a physician so I haven't had this experience but I think coding someone while they're dying is a incredibly painful experience for the team providing that care potentially. Um but I have seen beautiful hospital deaths and I have seen people very clear in their sense that not dying at home is the goal. Yeah. you know that to die in their living room with their kids watching is intolerable to them. To know that they're leaving their family with that imprint because it is an experience that we've plucked out of our living rooms and most people don't have a familiarity or comfort with it. Plenty of people I think maybe especially younger people who are dying are very clear like no no I'm not going to do that at home and if that means I'm in an acute care setting like okay that's that's sort of fine with me and preferred and by the way from an insurance perspective because that must factor into this if is there a fundamental difference in what an insurer either CMS or otherwise will provide based

[00:50:46] It's a great question. I kind of go back to your initial kind of laying out of the three trajectories into hospice. And I think we should be really clear like the lion's share of hospice is what they call and reimburse for as quote residential hospice, which means in a place someone's living, their home, their assisted living, um in a car sometimes. I mean, seriously, wherever they're calling, where people are. It also could include the sort of hospice facilities like the resident hospice residences which are uncommon in this country very rare. Um yeah so 80% of hospice happens where people live. Okay.

[00:51:29] And the remaining 20 is either in a hospital hospice unit or a dedicated hospice facility or nursing home or nursing home. Why why is that rare? Is it I I don't I would have assumed that the most economical and desirable place to provide hospice care would be in a dedicated facility. And it's for sure it's the assumption. So, you know, I've had hundreds of conversations being the social worker to go in and describe hospice and give hospice education. And so many pe what what the assumption is is hospice is a place that you go to die and overwhelmingly that is not true.

[00:52:08] Right. Hospice is a service that comes to you where you are. Um, and it's very I mean there's a lot of people that feel like I'm you're suggesting hospice, you're going to send me away to die, and that is um, uh, a barrier because people don't want to be sent away. But then there's also disappointment of, oh, there aren't like a plethora of choices of places for me to go. we actually have to like figure out how to hunker down and make this happen at home or find off in terms of resources. What is provided?

[00:52:41] So if an elderly couple who live alone um one of them becomes terminally ill elects hospice. Let's just assume that the if it's the husband who is sick that the that the wife is not physically going to be able to do much. she was able to care for him before he had one critical last event because these things work typically as a step, right? You know, he's sick, but then he falls and that's the sort of straw that breaks the camel's back. Um, does the home provision cover full-time support for this? Nothing nothing even remotely close. Which uh so how would she care for him if he is now bedridden?

[00:53:25] Mhm. requiring pain medication, requiring medication for sedation. Yeah. And any other form of comfort care. Yeah. I mean, how we should clean him. Yeah. You're pointing to, I think, one of the biggest systemic issues we have in this space, which is little to no reimbursement for caregiving and for the provision of of So, what does home hospice mean then if you're not giving that? It means an expert team that's available 24 hours a day and comes to you basically as needed. And that that could be once a week, that could be once a day. Certainly, I think the goal is often like a couple of times a week. And and this is a this is a huge I mean, this is part of why hospice is underutilized is because it doesn't always have the resources that people need to manage care at home. And the reality is is that when somebody goes home, it's usually a communal effort.

[00:54:24] You know, folks are coming in and out when they're not working. They're taking off time working. They're pulling in friends if there's the resources. There's they're hiring caregivers, which um is quite expensive thing to do. Um so it's a it's a huge lift on on caregivers, care partners, and families to have someone die at home. So I didn't realize that. So, you're saying that if a person elects home hospice care and they need full-time support, they're paying for that out of their own pocket.

[00:54:56] Yes. Yes. In a word, which is very c that can't be cheap. No. No. I mean, there's multiple ways to hire caregivers. Um, but you know, in the Bay Area, for example, the range, the hourly range would be something like 20 to $55 an hour kind of depending on if you're hiring your community or agency. No, that's just like a home healthy. Yep. Yeah.

[00:55:21] God, there's so much to say in this stuff here, Peter. I mean, I mean, one, you're as you're talking, you're reminding me about this home point just to make this case like a lot of us in the abstract would say, I want to be at home when I die. Yeah. But then when it comes down to it, you know, when a few weeks turn into months and the family is burning out because it's at least 23 hours of the day is family and friends doing the work. So um you know so a lot of us say I want to be at home but when it comes down to it that is not always necessarily the easiest place or possible or even possible for all these reasons. And then to your question about why are there not more hospice houses just from a Yeah. No one's gonna if they are not willing to pay to have someone come to your own house, they're certainly not going to pay for you to have a facility. So exactly. So right and so the medical system separates a social services from medical services.

[00:56:13] So the room and board of a facility, the infrastructure of the house, those would not be considered medical issues. So therefore are exempted from coverage. So to uh I worked at a one of the very few hospice houses in the country and it had to close as famous as it was the world over. This sweet little six bed hospice was known all over the world and it couldn't make it because there was it there was just no financial um pathway.

[00:56:42] So it's complicated. there should be more of these places and your to to note around your your very reasoned incredility there because that's much less expensive when the alternative is to go back to an acute care hospital but as you know this is not a rational system per se. Um so it's what you know it's why you see of that couple that you mentioned where he's dying and she's home and she can't bathe him, she can't deal with his bed pan. Um it's why you see in those stories people go into the hospital, go to subacute rehab, max the Medicare days, go home, go back into the hospital because there is this sort of um not always explicitly uh called out or intended sort of like how do we maximize the benefits that are here, the things that will be paid for.

[00:57:31] It's one of those examples and unfortunately medicine is full of these especially in the United States and I'm very I have a lot of great things to say about the healthare system here. I I really there's probably nowhere I'd rather live with respect to health care, but there are so many examples ex just like this where both the payer so actually I would say all three the payer experience the provider experience and the patient experience would all be better with a different system. Totally.

[00:58:02] It's more expensive. It's worse for the patient. It's worse for the care team to have the patient do what they have to do now to gain the system. Um it's a real shame. Yeah. That that um that e even if you didn't care about the quality of an individual's life, if you just acted economically, yeah, you could just the bean count if you're just following the beans. Yeah.

[00:58:28] That's part of the joy and craziness of working in this part of the health care system because there's such an there's a you get a line of sight as you say. There could be this alignment where it's better care for everybody involved and costs less money. The whole pal of care and hospice world has done a really good job over the last 40 years of gathering data. We save the health system lots of money. We improve care. All this this stuff works, but it's still not routinized in the system for all sorts of reasons. you know, the the sixmonth um prognosis component of the hospice benefit was really an arbitrary choice in some ways that was about getting it funded. Yeah. You know, the sort of original thinkers were like, "Yeah, this should be a year." And that's probably more right. You know, it should be you should be eligible if you're But the fact that it's 3 weeks on average tells you how many resources are being of course Yeah. drawn out of the highest price provider. Yes, it it's it's you know, if we're thinking about the last weeks and months and the swirl that's happening because you're getting sicker, all of these things are changing in your life. You're, you know, so much is changing. you're probably your your touch with the health care system is really high that in that time to also get really sober maybe for the first time about what's important to you, where do you want to be, can you see this thing clearly, like it's almost an impossible time to do. So, let's let's focus on that for a second because this strikes me as a cultural issue, right? It uh and you you two live in this world. Um I would say I'm adjacent to the world, but I don't live in it. and most people aren't even adjacent to it. So death is a really foreign thing.

[01:00:19] The reason I suspect that this can gets kicked down the road so much, so much in fact that after all the can kicking, people get to the end of their life, there's no road and there's just a pile of cans. So, what is it culturally that prevents us from talking about this when we're 50, when we're 60, when we're 70? When we're 30. Yeah. Like, why why is it?

[01:00:47] Because it's it's become such a I don't I don't know if I want to say it's a black box. I don't want to say it's a mystery, but but it's just something that we don't want to talk about. And as such, I I really believe that that's why we get to that three week. Okay, fine. We're pulling the plug. It's three weeks and you fall off a cliff kind of thing. Um, do we know anything about other cultures? You know, do we know how is it in Japan? How is it in Europe? How is it in in other parts of the world? Do we know anything about how how end of life functions there? A little bit. Culturally, there's a lot to study. I mean often it'd be so fun to take a couple years and really study the anthropology around dying and which cultures how cultures do this differently. We've been dying a long time. Um you know so but one thing I think it's our greatest skill. Yeah. I mean we're really good at it. Um you will not do it. Yeah. Thing you will not fail. You I promise you. So um and I think what you're calling attention to there's the the culture. So Scandinavian cultures. Um, Japan, a place that venerates its elders, you know, and aging and dying are different. Um, but they bump bump into each other a lot. So

[01:02:00] I my armchair read on say life in Japan where you the the comfort of being in old skin might be a different experience but that you're still left with the sort of natural phenomenon and cultural phenomenon of aging bumping into this health care system idea and that is the cognitive dissonance. We have these systems that are engineered and wired in such a way that are so at odds with mother nature on some level and so blind to cultural issues in the name of science in so many sort of reductive ways that I think you'd still if you were in Japan I think you'd still find a a health care system that struggles with this question even as the culture uh maybe doesn't as much similar probably in Scandinavia but I think in those places and in the Scandinavian model you will one of the things that comes up for people the end of life is you know other living issues like housing like you know your relationships they're still there.

[01:03:02] So we one of the things that makes dying harder in this country is the social determinance of health in society are not cared for. So you still have your housing issues when you're trying to die. You still got bill paying things that are you know that's the stuff that makes dying extra extraordinarily hard in some cases or in many cases. So you're saying that the the the lower the the wider net of the social safety net here compared to a country like Canada or Scandinavia or Japan presumably just adds one more stressor to an already stressful situation largely and it I any one sense doesn't do it justice because as you said the health care systems these places they can also do amazing work and so I don't want to just blindly categorically denigrate a health care system in any country there's some good

[01:03:50] But it is such a mixed bag. Um, and as many problems as it solves, it creates some other ones, especially around issues that people are struggled to look at. To your point, still holds like that. We do have a problem and why Bridget and I came this far besides to see your smiling face, but to talk about this in such a way that allows an audience as large as yours to begin to think about this before it's sort of too late. This is, I think, all of our work as citizens to begin to rope this part of reality into our views so that we can prepare ourselves for it and we can live with these realities and not be so surprised by the fact that we die someday. In part is so that we learn how to advocate for ourselves versus yeah,

[01:04:33] I'd love to see our health system mature around these issues and we'll continue to work on that or towards that. But I think the bigger note for your audience is what can each of us do to prepare ourselves in ways that the health system is not. In some ways you're going to have to say no to healthare like to die well in this country at some point you kind of have to say no thanks to medicine. One thing your audience needs to appreciate and why advanced directives are so helpful for example is the system is what is it is by def the default modes of our health care system would be just do more stuff. prop your body up anything to give you a pulse unless you've written or stated otherwise. We're going to just try to protect you having a pulse. Most of us don't equate having a pulse with actually really being alive and that becomes a problem at some point. We in this sort of carnival where we can really prop up a body almost in indefinitely. So it becomes a you have to find a way to say no to that and unwind what that hospital can do. have to get out of the way of that to die peacefully in this country. Does that make some sense? No. No. I mean, BJ, it makes so much sense. And as you're saying it, I'm just reflecting on the internal struggle that I think most nurses and doctors experience. And I we don't talk about it much, but I remember during residency the pride that I took in how heroic we could be, what we could do for a patient in the ICU, like how many central lines I could put in you and how I could look at all the different cultures and figure out the five antibiotics you need and how good I was at managing your dialysis and getting that CVBHD to manage pressure and this and that and how I could alter the aortic intraaortic balloon pump to just keep your heart like we were we there was such a sense of awesomeness in like this technology. It is awesome. But then you take a step back and you're thinking what am I doing? What am I doing? This is a physiologic experiment.

[01:06:38] It's not a life anymore. And and and and you would say well is there a chance that this person's going to recover? Well, of course there's always a chance, but how big does that chance need to be for the expected outcome to justify what you're doing? And there's two ways to answer this question. The first is economically. That's an easier way to answer it because expected outcomes are probabilities. It's what is the expected outcome of this survival multiplied by the cost of this intervention. You take the dotproduct of those, you add them all up, there's the cost of your health care system with respect to end of life care. Let's put that aside. There's the human one, right? There's the how many people are spending their last weeks or months in an ICU where they are for all intents and purposes no longer there right because you the amount of sedation you have to put on a person to keep them in that state is extreme they're now swelling into a Michelin man and is this what we want their family's final memories to be of something I you know something I I as you're talking I just like feel I have such visceral memories of you know sitting in those family meetings in the

[01:07:45] ICU where the person in the bed is unrecognizable and you know the expectation that physicians and nurses and social workers and spiritual you know that the healthcare teams are a should be able to have all of that expertise knowledge you know not all of it just some of the expertise knowledge that you just outlined and then also the very nuanced interpersonal capacity to with a relative stranger ask some of the biggest philosophical questions in a moment of crisis. I mean that is like in some ways a a a beyond human expectation of physicians which is where the and and many do it I mean just like with profound grace and beauty. um even when it really doesn't feel like it to them.

[01:08:45] But that's where sort of like the consumer side or the patient side is like, you know, come in having wrestled with it, not because you were given a diagnosis of a serious illness, but because we all do die. And that and that kind of gets back to your original question like this is hard because it's kind of impossible to imagine not existing anymore to actually psychologically, spiritually, philosophically grapple with like I'm here and I won't be and my children are here and they won't be and my spouse is here and they won't be and maybe I can kind of wrap my head around that being true for my grandparents maybe and then my you know it's it like this is a fundamental sort of contemplation of being human and you know it's a good muscle good it's a it's a lifegiving muscle I think to start to flex when you are healthy when you feel good when you're like it is actually true that I don't know when I'm going to die it could be because I'm hit by a bus it could be from some unexpected instantaneous physiologic or it could be some process when I'm 85.

[01:10:01] Like we don't know and collectively we have a hard time talking about and being in spaces together when when fundamentally we don't know. So let me ask you a question. Let's assume um we put you in a role where you're you're a you're a you're an adviser that walks through the oncology ward. Okay. Outpatient oncology. So they bring you in for a consultation with and maybe you tell me this is actually not a bad idea but they just say look we're going to bring you into the outpatient enc ward on Tuesdays and we just want you to meet the patients. Okay now these are patients that are in all stages of oncology. So let's assume that this is a breast uh cancer ward or not ward uh clinic and that means you are dealing with women who have just been diagnosed with precancer ductal carcinoma and sichu DCIS all the way up to women who have progressed through every intervention and are now facing completely unresponsive stage four cancer. Okay.

[01:11:07] You are introduced to uh Jodie Smith. She's 42 years old. She's a mother of two and she has uh she was recently diagnosed with what is turning out to be a stage three breast cancer. So she has a mass in her breast that they have removed and at surgery they also found lymph nodes under her arm. But the workup of the rest of her body found no evidence of cancer. So she is now going to undergo uh chemotherapy plus or minus radiation. And by the way, I'm not entirely familiar with the odds on this, but let's just say it's a 50% chance cure rate. So, there's a 50% chance that this is never going to come back.

[01:11:48] There's a 50% chance it will come back. And by the way, if it comes back, she will die from this. Um, it will go on for years, but but it will come back in a distant organ. What would you say to her when you introduce yourself? And let's just assume she understands why you're there and what you do. So, if she says to you,

[01:12:08] Do I really need to meet you? Shouldn't I be meeting my cancer doc? Yeah. What would you say? I mean, the do you need to meet me question is interesting. Um, you know, I think what I would want to know is what has this meant like what has this experience meant to her so far, right? like what is so let's say she says this has been the most jarring terrifying thing I have gone through in my life I'm 42 I have a 7-year-old and a 5-year-old that are my world it has never crossed my mind that

[01:12:45] I wouldn't be a grandmother and I'm now being told there's a 50% chance I won't be a grandmother but I'm a fighter and I have faith that these are amazing doctors and it's a coin flip I'm going to get heads. Yeah. I mean, I would join her in that. I think I would also want to normalize the fact that she has never imagined anything other than being a grandmother. I mean, I think so much about those initial, you know, encounters or meeting of somebody is about rapport building, right? you have to get into a back and forth so that they feel you as another person there that's curious about their experience.

[01:13:30] And you know, you were quick to kind of like add context for me, but you know, actually the process of someone feeling comfortable to say like I've always imagined being a grandma and I'm going to be a grandma, right? Yeah, that's probably three discussions, right? at least there's at least I probably maybe know her kids names or she's told me some like you know she

[01:13:53] Yeah, but it's a it's a okay skipping ahead but it's also skips over into like the relational component that people I think are sometimes caught off guard by and also really welcome because they have been having this experience and you know nobody's had the time to say how are you what does this mean to you? are you know oh you're waking up at night what are you thinking about when you wake up at night what what is the biggest worry that this brings up for you you know has it has it crystallized something into greater clarity I mean it seems to me that first of all based on the definition of paliotative care she would be a great candidate for paliotative care because she is still 100% fullcore press treatment but paliotative care would bring in see she doesn't seem to me that she needs someone to manage her pain, she probably needs someone to talk to and talk about what she thinks about when she wakes up at 4 in the morning scared to death.

[01:14:54] Yeah. Right. Oncologist, but she may need somebody to to learn about other impacts of the treatment and how that's affecting her life and is there anything to do to mediate that? Right. So maybe her her interest in sex or her sexual function has changed and nobody's asked her about that. Nobody's thought with her about like how do we you know what can you do to adjust and adapt to still have access to that part of your life even though you have stage three breast cancer or with with stage three breast cancer? How many of the theoretical patients that I just described of which there are tens of thousands in this country if not hundreds of thousands. How many of those patients are in paliative care right now? In very fraction. Yeah. Fra people couple reasons come to mind. One is that people conflate hospice and pal of care. And so people say I'm not ready for pal of care. What they're saying I'm not ready to think about dying yet. Yep.

[01:15:57] Because it's the idea is once I'm in pali of care, we're not fighting. We're not we're not treating which is untrue. And once you get into the room and you you know you say what paliative care is and people meet you and they feel you they're like well why wouldn't who wouldn't want this and there is that kind I'm wondering if I should be in palative care right now by the way the reality is paliative care is just good healthcare one of the things are rebranding but yes it really does I mean often times we're doing these very basic things what feel very elemental like sitting down and saying hi Peter I'm BJ you know Yeah, introducing yourself as some of the magic of p ofive care. I mean, that's a little um it's extreme, but that's true.

[01:16:41] Often what Bridget is doing or people, our colleagues are doing is just some very elemental work that gets skipped over at everyone's expense. Yeah. So, that's true. Um but I also don't want to land there. The work of pad of care while often is very rhetorical, not just the prescription pad for the MD, often gets um we don't value the psychological elements as much, the relational elements, the existential elements. So I don't want to say pal the work of p of care is easy. It does tend to the fundamentals of care in ways the rest of healthcare doesn't. But it doesn't stop there. There is a real skill set that

[01:17:18] Bridget has for meeting you, timing her questions, how she hears you, when she calls this conversation and saves it for the next time, when she decides to bring up the potentials for suffering, when she introduces mortality. Those are all that's a real felt experiential thing that doesn't just happen haphazardly.

[01:17:38] So, I guess I'm saying two things. There's a real skill set to this work that often gets shortsighted which is another reason why pal of care doesn't get invoked very often is you'll hear physicians especially in other people health systems oh I don't need pout of care I do that or they're not ready or they're not ready or I you know

[01:17:56] I'll do that I care because they're saying like I care about my patient I treat their pain um that may be true to a point um but very often why people don't get pouted care back to your important question there is in in one um a misunderstanding of what p of care is. Two, an underestimating the work that goes into this relational stuff. And so therefore, a lot of people pretend or think they're delivering p of care when they're not. Um and third would be capacity. You know, we don't have enough of people who are trained in this big enough. So those are big three reasons why people don't get into p of care. So let's say you get to know her better. how often. And and let's just say she says, you know,

[01:18:38] I I really love being able to talk with you about this stuff because I'm scared. And by the way, this treatment's hard. Like my hair is falling out. I'm sick. Um I don't have the energy to like play with my kids right now. Like there's there's a lot of stuff in life that is really difficult even as I am hopefully um going through this journey to come out on the other side healed. How often would she get to interact with the pali of care team?

[01:19:04] Um it's a the is this an insurance based question again? A health system. It's a health system staffing question and also you know a question about in any given system sort of what are the named priorities of paliative care in that system um which can be quite different. Um, so there isn't a great way to answer that question. I think it depends on um, it depends on staffing. It depends on if she has other supports, if there's a way to connect her to other supports. And I think, you know, this is this is where our work at mental health, I think, folds in because the health system is not staffed or primed or any other number of adjectives. you know, to support people in the ongoing way that most would benefit from. That's really like a community-based resource issue or intervention. It's like where people are actually living their lives with this illness is where that support kind of is going to come from. And you know, I think most people find that in their lives from their spiritual community or church community or friend group. Um, but I would still would benefit from having somebody outside of their lives, right? You know, her telling me her, you know, sharing your fears with me is very different than sharing your f your fears with your friend who's having their own very personal like you can't die. How would I live without you? You're supposed to be a grandma with me. Like, don't talk about that. Right? they're bringing all of their own yeah, you know, myriad protections and guards from this subject into their caring for that person. And I think so often when we meet people um in this counseling space, right, we might be the first person who hasn't kind of, you know, with all of the love and all of the the the good intent minimized what the person is sharing because it's hard to tolerate our our people's fears. You know, we want them to feel better. We want that to stop for them. And so we say things like, "Oh, but you're going to be fine."

[01:21:23] Like, "Look how well you've done so far. It's going to be okay." So, how would your interaction change if I put you into a neurology clinic and you were meeting people who were all newly diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. So, now we have people who show up with cognitive impairment. Yeah. But they're still pretty they're still good. they're actually still okay, but they've now had that amaloid PET scan that demonstrates the buildup of amaloid in their brain and certainly to the eye of a skilled neurologist, the diagnosis is unambiguously clear. It's a clinical diagnosis, of course. Yeah. And they've now been given the diagnosis, you are in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.

[01:22:12] Um, we don't know the speed at which this is going to progress. Mhm. Um, but we know that it's more or less monotonically going to get worse. Yeah. What are you asking that person? I mean, this is a very uh beloved space of mine that I've gotten to spend more time in in the last few years. And I I um

[01:22:33] I think for a lot of people, one of my first questions is, you know, what do you understand about what's h like what have the doctors told you? What do you understand? Right? because um a person may have had many visits with their neurologist and the neurologist has given very clear information but their retention let's say that this person for the sake of this case study watched their parent die of Alzheimer's disease and there's a strong hereditary component here and they now understand they were let's just say they've been in denial for the last year while they were in the throws of exact They were like, you know, I'm probably just a little tired. It's probably just, you know, a little distracted. But now they've been confronted with there's the amaloid PET scan. There's the C2N blood test. And here are the results of the cognitive test. And you know, you are on the same path as your your mom or your dad. And they remember they remember what it was like for the last four years of that person's life. Mhm. So, let's assume that there's um not a lot of ambiguity in their mind about what what's what's going to happen. Yeah. I mean, I'd want to know more about their experience with their parent. I'd want to know um the things that they're most worried about.

[01:23:56] So, I'm I'm going to just say I am most worried that I'm not going to be able to care for myself, that the people I care about are going to need to take care of me and it's going to inconvenience them. And I'm not ready to to to to lose my mind. Like, I'm young. I'm this person, let's say this person is 68 years old. Like, this is on the verge of being early onset, right? and they're realizing that they that in another couple of years they might not be sentient. Mhm. And they're basically saying like this is a high functioning individual. This is a person who is still working, who is contributing, who loves their life, and they're basically mourning the loss of that. Yeah. I would not interrupt their mourning, right? like of course like of like sort of of course to their feelings and it's sometimes that's hard for me to like pluck questions that I would ask out because it is such of a such a like in the- moment thing but it's like tell me more about how much you don't want this to happen why what's the worst case like what happens between now and there like you know there's a certain amount of like creating and allowing for space for people to say the things that they're catastrophizing in their minds that they're so scared of that they don't want to have happen to lay that land in order to come back to in a trajectory of so you know yes you've laid out like a path but also so much uncertainty actually for like when how the pro progression will happen and when and what the changes will be um and the impossibility you know just how hard it is to to not know what that will actually really look like what are the considerations because again they're just in paliotative care. They're going to go and try all sorts of therapies.

[01:25:54] Deep down they know that the therapies in this space are far less efficacious than the woman you met earlier with breast cancer where she's really got a shot. Yeah. This the most these therapies are going to do is slow things down. But look, if you slow them down enough, maybe something experimental comes along. So they're going down the path of I'm going to do this paliative care thing because you seem like a nice person and I like talking with you.

[01:26:16] Yeah. But I'm I'm going to do everything I can to slow this down. Yep. So now let's fast forward a year or two. Mhm. Things are getting worse. What are the things you want to understand before you're so far gone that they can't even like walk me through the things you need to do to help them and their family prepare for what is effectively inevitable. I mean

[01:26:41] BJ jump jump in if there's things bouncing around for you. Well maybe I could say real quick to kind of kind of just double click as they say on what you are saying. I mean, the early work, whether it's a cancer patient or someone dealing with Alzheimer's, the early work is so much of relational, getting to know the person, laying out a sort of a safe place for them to fall apart, share their fears without being shushed, all that stuff. So, Bridget's saying that I just really that's really key. And that might take all of the first visit. You may ask no questions about the diagnosis. It may take five visits before you get to anything that for the reason you're supposedly there. All that is to getting to know a person because we know there's some magic in a person being seen, bearing witness, them getting to express themselves is its own therapeutic value. But then as the provider, you are you are learning about what makes this person tick, what inspires them, what turns them off, what where their fears lie, etc. So, you're gathering all this knowledge that that'll help you as you go down the road with them over time to be able to spot to look around the bend a little bit for this person and see what's coming up for that might be coming up for them. And then you can cidle up to them and say, "Hey, remember last time we talked about this or that thing or I know remember you told me how much this or that thing is a source of fear. I just want you to know I'm not going to I'm going to be here with you or you know it just lends a much more specific ability for you to accommodate and accompany this person.

[01:28:13] That's so much of the work is really is an accompaniment and looking around the corner with someone. So I just want to kind of before we move off that into other things that's what I I just want that to get really clear what Bridget's points are not casual kind of you're not just stalling for time. That is the early lattice. That's the foundation.

[01:28:31] That's the foundation. And then the person gets to feel seen, heard, and held. And then when that trust is in place, a lot of other things become possible. So, so just to back up, I think it's also right. It's not inherent that because somebody saw their parent die of Alzheimer's and they've been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and it's the worst thing that they could imagine.

[01:28:54] It doesn't it's not inherently true that it ends up being the worst thing that they could imagine, right? They actually we don't tend to I'm going to speak in a massive generalization but we don't tend to anticipate our ability to adapt very well especially when like the worst case thing is happening and you know sometimes having had familiar you know been intimately involved in this worst case thing you kind of surprise yourself or your kids surprise you know there's there's these things that unfold that you wouldn't have guessed would be a part of the experience. And I think I really try to hold space for that, right? To stay curious about like, okay, you're very sure that this experience is going to look like this and together we'll see what it actually looks like and feels like.

[01:29:47] I do, you know, in this instance, like let's say that this person was also married or partnered. I I'm I'm just so acutely aware of that spousal or care partner experience because potentially and are they partly I mean sorry to interrupt you but are they also a patient like or is there a patient confidentiality thing where you can't really be there to support them because your patient is the spouse foundational documents of p of care the unit of care is the patient and family. Oh okay. So this is a very unique part of medicine then. Yes. In a number of ways we still bump into and you know the western autonomy individualistic like the patient is the patient that is not we are not documenting in the chart about their spouse or if we are we're doing it very carefully. Um uh but really you have more latitude because you can think of the entire unit of support of that that that patient would define as their experience of

[01:30:54] Alzheimer's like the person whose body that's happening in like the experience of if we don't and if we don't start to get better at this in a major way right like her often experience right uh is central to their well-being, is central to how they are you how far into this relationship are you broaching um you know medical decisionm power of attorney things like that I mean these are these are and and are those are those difficult discussions in that they they require sort of a cognitive acceptance like I'm actually now putting medical decisionm into someone's hands who are not my own because in the future I'm going to lose the capacity to make those decisions. I mean how difficult a discussion is that? I think it really depends on the person, right? And how how you know have they really truly managed all of those decisions by themselves or they're used to some back and forth or they have a different model that's quite intertwined. So um for some people that's really hard to imagine.

[01:32:07] I think in my experience like in the neurologic illness space so often if a patient has someone which not all do that person's coming to visits right because they've been showing signs where they're not remembering or you know they couldn't get to the doctor's office on their own or get the zoom up by themselves etc. So they're often presenting with somebody else and there's immediately another person to engage with their experience. I mean, the number of times spouses, adult children just are immediately brought to tears with the question, how has this been for you? Because no one has asked them, not because they didn't want to, but usually because they don't have time. Right. The neurologist is mostly there to think about the patient. Yeah.

[01:32:55] Yes. Yeah. And this gets complicated. All these things are such tips of icebergs. I mean and that unit of care thing even in pad of care and why one of the reasons why we started metal outside of healthcare is to make good on that promise. Yes, the unit of care is patient family but we always when I was working in the medical system in the cancer center or anywhere in the medical like you can't bill there's no way to bill for the spouse. So we'd sneak that family into the side door sometimes have an appointment with them or we would dovetail it in the appointment with the patient. So it's yes there is space at least intellectual and emotional space preserved for the family members but very often it's still short shrift with because of the billing issues. So there's a lot to say about that and that's another reason why metal I mean probably 60% of our clients are the the family members because there's just no place no one's asking about their experience to Bridget's point. So what are some questions you're going to ask that patient as their cognition is declining and things that you need clarity on from them their wishes. What do you want to understand? Well, you brought up advanced directives and advanced care planning and so let's just spend a moment on that. That's we should all if you're 18 in this country, you should have an advanced directive. Yeah.

[01:34:15] And my guess is virtually nobody who's young and healthy has one. That's true. I mean, virtually anyone who's older and isn't healthy has one. Exactly. I mean, you know, we ask these questions in studies and also just casually if you give a talk, say, how many people have an advanced directive? You know, maybe 20% of people raise their hand. How many people think an advanced directive is really important? Like most people raise their hand. So there's a none of us, many of us are not doing the thing we know we're supposed to do. We just it's this deferable thing like life insurance, you know. Anyway, so one sort of public service announcement here is advanced directives is very important.

[01:34:48] You can download a form online like this is a free you don't need a lawyer to do this. No, you do not need a lawyer to do this. So, um, and the most important thing to come out of an advanced directive, if you had to pick sort of one of the questions that gets asked, it's probably the proxy. If, god forbid, you all of a sudden you're in an accident or something happens and we can't ask you, Peter, what kind of care is important to you? Who do you want speaking on your behalf in such a moment as that? And that's probably the the most important question to get clear on.

[01:35:19] And you know, why would a young a young healthy person think about that? So my first advanced directive, I was in my late 20s when I actually finally did it, even though I've been in these conversations for a long time. And I I one day was imagining, you know, something unexpected happening, not being able to participate in a conversation, lying in a hospital bed. I was imagining my parents who do not speak to each other, trying to make decisions over their child and my, you know, casual partner at the time, you know, mostly casual partner at the time, kind of sitting there trying to figure out how they belonged in the scene. And I was like, I don't want that for them regardless of what happens to me and my body or you know what they actually choose. Like to actually put myself in the position of the people that those choices would default to. Yeah. Like I didn't want that for them. I didn't I didn't you know if I was at all sentient

[01:36:17] I definitely didn't want to hear it. But I I didn't want them in throws of totally unexpected grief to be trying to negotiate that relationally. Right. It's an awesome responsibility. I um I'm very honored to say the the number of people that have asked me to be the decision maker for them. I can't imagine how many have asked you this, BJ, but I mean there are more than a dozen friends who have asked me this. And I say the same thing to all of them, which is it's an honor to do it, but we have to sit and talk. Like it's not you can't hand me that stick and just sign my name on there cuz I like we're going to have dinner. We're going to have a bottle of wine. We are going to talk this through.

[01:36:59] I really need to understand what you want and don't want. Yeah. Good on you because a lot of people don't do that. And again, the job is not for you to insert. It's not my will. Yeah. Exactly. The job is for you to honor the other person's wishes. Speak on their behalf. So to do that well, you have to know the person's wishes and that's not a couple of questions. That's a big old conversation. And just as you do with the balan at a dinner, like that's what we're doing with patients. You're setting a table that's comfortable.

[01:37:27] Often you're sitting, you're asking intimate questions. As providers, you may be sharing intimate details, too, as part of a relational sort of set a table for in, you know, in intimate things to happen. So I just want to borrow your table setting there. That's what we do, too. It's a important piece of getting to this level of detail. So, um, and it's also true like you don't have those conversations once. I want to Bridget's saying a lot of really important things.

[01:37:55] I want to double click on another thing like that the advanced directive the the conceit is problematic right out of the shoots. You're asking someone to prom putting themselves in this future oriented position where they're in a situation that they can't imagine where they can't speak and so what will they want then? So, it's a problem. It's but it's as best it's as it's as best as we have, you know, but it's a problematic tool. And as people move through life with illness or disability, their realization of what they can or might like to live with shifts. You know, we have data around this, right?

[01:38:31] You ask a bunch of health care providers, if you were brought into your own emergency department quadriplegic from an accident, would you want your colleagues to save your life? You know, most providers say, hell no. I could never live like that. You know, go ask most quad people who live with quadriplegia if they're happy to be alive and say, "Yeah, I couldn't have imagined this." But you know, same with me. I Hey, you're going to lop three limbs off. Are you cool with that? I'm like, "No, no." But then you, you know, as it goes in this life, we are adapt adaptive. We have capacities that we don't know until something comes along to pull them out of us. So part of this, you know, mindbender of an advanced directive is to allow room for that for a person's sense of themselves and their capacity to change in any direction. So all that is a preamble to say you have these conversations over time, multiple times, and let the person change over time. I think it's also like this is one of those places where you want to focus on the things that are important to you, the experiences that are central to to good days, to meaningful time. Because you know, having counseledled a lot of people actually in the acute moments of having to make these decisions, being able to reorient them towards like, you know, what I've heard you say is that your dad was like always in his garden.

[01:39:50] He wanted to be at home. like if he could hear your voice, that's what was important to you. Blah blah blah blah. Like the ventilator doesn't get us there, right? That the what are we moving towards is um uh is much more motivating than not doing X Y and Z, not intubating, not resuscitating because those things for most people like exist from scenes from TV shows and are still pretty far away. But we can really but it is easier for people to choose like the scene that we're going towards that they can square against how they knew their person. Um so I I sort of I mean there's there are people who are very clear about AB and C interventions being something that they would never want. Um and and I certainly honor that. Maybe I hold it with a little bit of grain of salt, but I honor it. But I I'm more interested in when I have been asked to be in that role to understand you know what what makes this person's life not cuz it's going to perfectly translate like if I can't dance under the full moon in Bali like my life is not enough and you're like okay but what if you could like see the full moon from your bed like is that you know like we we that's a really important point Bridget

[01:41:09] I've never thought of it that way. Um I I probably have just always had a bias towards okay what are the things we don't want to do what are the things we don't want to do right the we talk like think about medical lingo DNR DNI no chest pounding no intubation blah blah blah blah blah but I like this framing better of okay like what are the minimum set of requirements you need to have to be really to to still hold some delight in life and you know what do we need to get you there that those are the those are the steps we'll There's some language around that

[01:41:41] Peter by there's a movement to change DNR to A and D allow natural death to get away from the things we're not doing and the things that we're are doing just to to make that point and it interesting has that has that taken hold yet I don't know that it's taken hold but there is a there is an effort to try I like that too and I think you go to your point it's a really if we have a sense of what we're moving towards even if we have to be very flexible and allow our mind to change on route that's just a much more viable. It's it's much more uh it's a much more deliberate path and it's also very helpful for those around us to know what to do versus just not to do.

[01:42:20] What are the differences that you have both experienced in um dealing with dying cancer patients between those that are quote unquote old and those that are young? I mean, of all the chronic diseases, cancer obviously disproportionately strikes the young. um you know, people in their 40s and 50s don't really have to worry about heart disease and neurologic disease for the most part, but they're far from clear of cancer. And um you know, there's actually an article out recently that even suggests that the incidence of cancer is rising in young people. Um, so

[01:42:54] I'm curious as to what you've learned about about living and dying from through the lens of cancer in the tragic cases, which I'm just using this term sort of loosely, where everybody agrees the 40, 50-year-old dying of cancer is tragic, versus the part of life when someone is in their 80s and 90s and dies of cancer. Mhm.

[01:43:19] Well, one thing that leaps to mind in my experience with younger people, um, I mean, you can get very philosophical and say, "What is an old? What is old?" You know, you know, and I've seen some kids die. Oh, which I mean, that's a whole new level of whole new level of sorrow and senses of tragedy on some level for the parents very often. Very different level of engagement or awareness. Yes, potentially. Yes, I have. But I have and right and actually the child the kid the young person I have seen some we want to be very careful to not be judging and grading deaths. This is why the problem of good death is a really problematic construct but and in terms of something instructive to learn from.

[01:44:03] I've seen some younger people die so beautifully and adapt so remarkably to the reality that they're living. It's just stunning. Why why do you think that is? I mean my sense is because you you could say because they haven't yet been around on this planet long enough to develop such concrete notions of identity. I am BJ. I am this. I am not that. Expectations expectations sense. When do you think that kicks in BJ? I think it's a spectrum develop late teens, early 20s.

[01:44:35] I I would say something like that is our sense of as we individuate and our identity sort of set up as something relatively independent compared to our earlier years. But you know I certainly feel different about myself now than I did when I was 19. But but to your point I think these sort of these these the as we said earlier dying is a natural thing. we all do it, you know, hey, you know, what's the problem in a sense? But well, the problem is a that it's really hard and the if there's a problem around dying, it's the social pressures or the expectations from ourselves or others that make us feel that this is somehow that we're doing it wrong or that there's something wrong with me for dying, etc. This is where a lot of the problem comes. So, a kid, you know, may just have a much more fluid sense of themselves in the world. Um, I think that's a big one. um they may not have developed they haven't seen enough of the planet to attach so firmly to it you know perhaps but those are just those are guess guesses but there is a there is a theme and we have a colleague Chris

[01:45:41] Adrian who's a pediatric pal of care doc at metal you know it would be interesting to talk to him but that's my experience with younger people it's now it's a very different conversation with their parents um so so that's one thing to I mean they give space just to pause and note like how complicated it is because the grief the sort of anticipatory grief of a dying person is very different than the anticipatory grief of the people that will go on to live without them and that's the space that we're trying to negotiate these decisions and make plans right it's like kind of two very different developmental tasks overlaid right and I think in the experience of children of course this is not universal but in those experiences of children who are sort of clear like I think I'm dying. Nobody's willing to talk to me about that. Kind of like looking around for another kind of sober person to engage with them there. That's just kind of an amazing thought. Just to pause on that for a moment. I've never really spent much time thinking about it because I actually didn't spend that much time, you know, in pediatric surgery you saw some children who died, but you usually weren't they were usually on a medical or pediatric service by that point. So I don't

[01:46:54] I don't really understand what the what the what the metacognition is of a dying child. But so so a 10year-old child is is who's got cancer, let's pick something like that. They're they're they're they're aware that something's happening. I suppose some certainly are deeply. Yeah. More than often or sometimes a more direct shoot to kind of the truthiness of what's happening than than adults. around them including the physicians and clinicians. Yeah.

[01:47:27] Yeah. You know, I think there's an arc for our development where we know a lot as kids we go out in the world and as adults and we take on we try on all these other outfits for size and do the things we're supposed to do and shoulds and stuff. And then there's this can be this return to a sort of a playfulness and a lightness within old age. Um that would have you thinking that our wisdom was never higher than when we were kids.

[01:47:50] We just didn't get seduced into thinking that someone else outside of ourselves knew more than we did and started externalizing. You know, there's we could draw lots of fanciful narratives around that fluidity with which my three-year-old and six-year-old will, you know, sometimes they'll wake up and be like, "Do you think Nana died last night? When are you going to die?" Like they just there is a kind of curiosity that they have without the attachment actually to like the the deep meaning that that we may as adults kind of get into anticipating and then because we're anticipating feeling it right they can kind of just like ask the questions like will you be alive when I die mom will you be old right like they're just trying to figure it they don't get in their own way in the same way maybe as a way of putting them

[01:48:39] Yeah. No, totally. It's not comfortable. So, I want to go back to something you said a second ago. You brought up kind of anticipation of loss and death and then the actual event and the loss once that person is gone. And obviously those two states exist for the surviving. Only one of those states exists for the dying. they don't really have. So, um tell me about the experience for the uh person who's going to die. What what are the things that they express to you as their greatest fears? How often is it again pain, physical pain? How often is it um not existing? How is how often is it leaving someone behind and they're suffering? Um and then similarly I I'm curious as to what the anticipated versus realized experience is of the uh of the loved ones. I mean I think for for many people there's real fear about the physiologic experience of dying of pain and other symptoms right and I think one of the beautiful parts of our work is in in the nature of people being linked to paliative care hospice care there's some ability to comfort that right that we are here we are watching those symptoms we're working with you so could we say that nobody in the year 2025 needs to actually suffer uffer during death. I mean, is that is that too an extreme a statement? For example, is there a pain that is so deep that it can't be reached by the most potent narcotic? Is there is there a shortness of breath that is so significant that it can't be offset and paliated by probably a narcotic as well? Like if you and sorry, what were you going to say? Well, just from a sort of medication medication physiology at that end of the uh argument or conversation, yes to your question, I think we can say that no one in 2025 needs to die suffering. As long as you include the potential for sedation to be part of that, it may take so much narcotic to quell your pain or your shortness of breath. Yes. That we are actively putting you to sleep. So if you include uh what's called palative sedation um then I think that is a true statement.

[01:51:00] Yep. I think I just want to make a quick note on the use of narcotics in this setting. Like narcotic is a police term, right? It's a it's a term of law enforcement and the medicines that are being used in this time are opioids. It's only an important I mean not only it's an important distinguishment because opioids are often one of the central medicines in managing the symptoms related to dying and related to serious illness at a certain point and people for good reason in 2025 in the setting of um how opioids exist in our culture are scared right and so you know yeah so it's an interest I I recently did a with

[01:51:42] Shawn Mackey who's a pain specialist and and we talked a lot about opioids because on the one hand they are a very important part of the toolkit of a pain specialist. They would be an even more important part of your toolkit and they have been the most widely abused class of drugs in the history of modern medicine. Those two statements can be simultaneously true. Absolutely. But it doesn't detract from the former. Yes.

[01:52:07] Right. Yes. And there's a there is a fair amount of work, you know, if if opioids are being used to manage people's symptoms um with serious illness, like we we need to pause and ask the questions of like how do you feel about this medication being prescribed? Do you have experience with it? Right? Because everyone comes with some imprint around the meaning of these medicines. And if we want to help people use the medicines correctly to get to that place where they might be as comfortable as we're able to get them, like we got to peel back the layers on the relationship to the medicines being used. Is that a common phenomenon where people show up with a belief about this? And is the belief that it's I mean it sounds like a silly thing to say. Do people think it's cheating? Do people think there's some nobility in suffering through death? And certainly some people do and and not only like some people feel that pain is redemptive, right? That they don't want their experience blunted or muted or you know that they have such a commitment to a a quote natural experience or they have been a person that never took pharmaceutical medicines um or drugs anyway. that this could be a real diversion from how they've understood or been comfortable in relationship to medicines and and I would say often there's there's a need for conversation in this space. Um and at this point like unless you're living with no access to media, everybody has some touch point reaction and bias about these medicines.

[01:53:48] And so maybe it's not a long conversation, but it's a really important conversation. And a lot, you know, people are worried about addiction. People who are sober are wondering how this impacts their sobriety. Right. Super interesting thing I'd never thought about. So you take an individual who's been sober. Yeah. And they're wondering, wait, can you really give me a benzo if you give me Yeah. If you give me fentanyl and morphine, is that violating my sobriety? How do you answer that question? I answer that question usually with more questions around their sobriety, what that experience has been like, where they are with it now, has it been important that there has been sort of absolute abstinence like you know that it exists differently from different people. questions that sort of their I you might put in the camp of identity like do they are they telling you I mean I might say there is no from where I sit Peter there's no nobility and you suffering unnecessarily or being pained unnecessarily you as a sober person allowing me to prescribe you an opiate at this stage your life to me personally as your physician poses no moral quandry to me at all but what about you know you're you're a person who's living in these shoes and and if you tell us absolutely no opiates or absolutely no benzo, okay, we will listen to you. That may mean more pain than than otherwise, but that's your call. So to Bridget's point, it would be back to more questions and not putting it on the patient and even going and even saying and by the way, Bob, you can change your mind anytime. Let's live with this decision today. And if you wake up tomorrow, you want to change your mind, nothing's changed. Exactly. Yeah. And but and making it but also I'm I'm not you bridge. I'm always knowing sort of the social clouds around some of these issues. I will go out of my way to say um we don't you're not going to get addicted to these medicines. We're going to be using them judiciously. A lot of people when they hear get the morphine, it's a there's a phrase like hang the morphine sometimes is a euphemism for essentially euthanizing a patient. And I it's not legal to do that anywhere. we're not going to kill you. You know, we're going to use only as much medicine as this helps your symptoms. Okay? So, there's a lot of room to clarify how we would use these medicines, what they mean, and what they don't mean. So, even if someone doesn't ask me those things,

[01:56:10] I usually find an excuse to say those kinds of things. Yeah. I think we have to step back to for a second because we're using suffering and pain. Yeah. We're using suffering in a little bit of like a uh I would say not correct way because someone can have all of their symptoms pretty well managed and feel pretty comfortable physiologically and have an extraordinary amount of suffering. So to say in 2025 nobody needs to suffer at the end of life like I think that's impossible pain. Yeah. I think that we can for the most part we can say we will do everything we can to help you be as comfortable as possible. Like can we say we can do that perfectly? No. Tell me about some outside of the

[01:56:58] No, I think you're drawing one of the things you're saying bridge and I think it's really important is there's a difference between pain and suffering and we need mean those words and we're kind of casually Yeah. So help me with that a little bit more. So pain we understand um I think we understand um shortness of breath and things of that nature. Yep. Exactly. So so let's let's bracket that those can all be managed physiologically and we have done so pharmacologically.

[01:57:25] Now talk about the residual of suffering. How much of this is sadness? How much of this is grief? How much of this is some Yeah. Tell me more about what the suffering is once you've addressed those receptor-bound physiologic things. Yeah, I mean it's one of the reasons why, you know, precise nuance symptom management is so important because it's when the noise and the volume of the pain often is turned down that we get to learn about the stories someone is telling or the things that are replaying in their heads about not getting to see their kids grow up or not getting to finish that piece of work that felt so important to them or the ways in wish which they wish they hadn't taken something for granted. Right? When when symptoms are loud, it is really hard to get into the places of suffering that are about incompleteness. They're about um what you what we won't get to do or what we won't get to do with our person or our people. Um there there's a whole sort of pot spiritually, existentially around faith and relationship to God potentially or what that is for you and if that has stayed whole in this experience of illness, right? So there's just so there's so much and like turning the the volume down on some of the physical stuff really, you know, can open up the space to if you're nauseous, you're not going to tell me how you're feeling other than the nausea, you know, it's the only thing going. I mean, in some ways, like a lot of misconceptions around our work, as we've said time and again, one of them is that it's just about symptom management, that we're symptomatologists essentially. And I that's really importantly wrong. It's sort of hyper reductive and as as Bridget's saying in some ways the first thing to do is turn down the symptoms the degree possible so that the rest of you is present and that we can get to sort of like that's the starting line is once we kind of get you comfortable enough so you can think about anything but your pain or your nausea. That's when the real work begins of getting to know you and advancing your fears and your hopes and your dreams. And that's the stuff that's really the meaty stuff that we want to get to end. And so comfort is a starting point in in a in a way. And just maybe to back up a little bit further. So just what do we mean when we say the word suffering? I mean I don't you know for me so pain is a sort of a stimulus. You know there's safety to it. It tells us to stop doing what we're doing. There's you know it's a it's a sensation. It's complicated. The pain pathway is not a simple one. There's not a pain pathway.

[02:00:18] It always involves emotion, always involves cognitive stuff. It's just a matter of degree. But that degree is so when we tip into something where your pain or other symptoms are causing a sort of a threat to your identity, a threat to your sense of self, a threat to what you see as real in the world, that's when we get into suffering. So suffering has um is a mosaic of physical, emotional, spiritual, existential, the whole the whole paniply of the human experience goes into suffering. So someone may have inordinate pain, but if they believe that that pain is redemptive, it's going to bring them closer to God or is burning off some bad karma, they're not suffering that they're they might be very uncomfortable, extremely uncomfortable, but they're not suffering. It's not threatening their sense of self in the world. And someone might have a very what looks to be a mild cause of pain, but be suffering extraordinarily because that has undone their sense of being. So that's it's a really different notion. Um it's not just the sort of physiological signaling cue. Does that make sense as we talk that out? Yeah. So let's not mix those terms. Yeah. I want to pivot a little bit to talk about how to pull all of this together. Right. you you guys have had good luck decades of uh being at the bedside for um experiences that I'm sure you look back upon and think that was that was really a wonderful experience, right? That was that that that patient passed out of this world and their family escorted them out in the best way I can imagine. And I'm sure you have seen the opposite. I'm sure you have seen things that made you cry and made you think

[02:02:08] I I I I I weep for all parties involved. What are some lessons we can take away from that? What are I hate to call it dos and don'ts because that's such a stupid but you know what I mean. What are what are some of the things that have in the process? We'll come back and we'll talk about insights that you've learned from the dying because that's where I want to end it today. But just from the process of the dying and their loved ones, tell me tell me things you've learned that that people should know that that that that increase the probability of it being as positive as it can be versus the opposite. Well, it's a toughy. It's a toughy. As we said, this subject just really thwarts any sort of or, you know, much objectivity or anything that smells reductive. Um and in some ways that's the death that we are as practitioners are heading for is something that it uh allows for while we talk about a body or a person in decline. That's our medical bias towards a physiology in the bodily it it's also very possible that people can have be having this incredible emotional and social and spiritual growth even as their body is in decline.

[02:03:27] So part of it is our sort of naming and overcoming the the biases we're born into in this particular culture in this particular world. Um so and I think but what one answer to your question is it's so hard to answer but for me for me it these days the word honesty comes up for me a lot. So the that we tell ourselves, the partial truths that we tell ourselves, the pieces of ourselves that we don't look at, that we don't allow in because we're either ashamed of or whatever it is or blind spots or we've bitten the sort of autonomy independence thing so much that we don't let any sort of social reflection in. Um, you know, dying can be is this sort of great accounting. It all has it's all coming out in the wash there. So one thing that I see make a difference and head towards the do's and don'ts if if each of us can take into our perhaps our responsibility but also our privilege to know ourselves over time and to dare to look and to see and to be true to ourselves to my way of thinking. If you asked me this question five years ago, I probably would have said something different. But that's the big that's my big takeaway these days is if you want to be ready to die, well, get real with yourself. The sooner the better. And because one of the things you'll allow in is a a richer life, right? And a one of the reasons why we would encourage people to think about death earlier in life is not just sort of to avoid the um defaults of a medical system that doesn't think about these things. But you also allow in the idea that both your bigness and your smallness like I'm one of a zillion people who's ever lived. You know, I'm a drop in the ocean. But also allow in that the ocean would be different without my drop in it. Like that work of placing yourself in the world and feeling in right size to it all requires a lot of dynamic honesty and that takes effort. You need to dare to look at yourself and that to me is sort of a big do. If you do that well, then the the risk like so much of what we've talked about today is it's not the problem of dying so much, but the difficulties of uncertainty is so much of what we're kind of guarding against or working with. Not so much death, but living with uncertainty. And that's a that's something that we all do all the time.

[02:06:01] So, my answer to all that is is, you know, get real with yourself and be as honest as you can one moment to the next and allow yourself to move and change with reality. That's a mouthful, but that's as close as I can come to a do. Yeah. Sorry. Does that light up anything? That's actually really quite a profound one because on the one hand, it seems so um easy is maybe not the right word, so self-evident, but on the other hand, it's so difficult and it's something that any anybody with a modicum of introspection struggles with.

[02:06:37] Yeah. And even when you think you got it, oh, I now I know who I am. Well, no. As relational beings, whatever's coming tomorrow might yank all sorts of other things out of you that you didn't know were there. So, this this sense of self, this identity thing is a biggie. I guess this feels connected, but the word for me when I think about those like beautiful experiences are the ones where I walk away just feeling like not bad, like I'd be okay with that. Um is about connection, right? So, and what does that mean? Like whether you are the person who's dying, like your ability to connect to self, to the environment, to the people around you, if there are other people there, if you're a person around supporting, like can you be connected and in contact with what's happening, right? It it when there's a lot of connection or connectivity in this time, like the circumstances matter, but a lot of different circumstances, a lot of different story lines can actually feel quite um aliveening or even nourishing or um validating because it is, you know, it's being in touch with what is real. How many patients are permitted that medically? In other words, isn't that in part um constraint by their symptoms and the medications that are needed to again either sedate or control pain. And then we talked earlier about delirium. Like I what fraction of of of patients that you experience in the final days and weeks of life have the ability to be in that state? It's a tricky question, but I think many if the state is sort of any level of connection to what's happening, right? So maybe I'm not talking about like moving towards like totally conscious death or something. I'm saying like even in delirious states there can be moments where there's just like real connectivity. We maybe we don't understand cognitively totally what's happening but your kid is sitting there telling you stories about the things that were important to them in their experience of you or there's some sensation in your hand that's receiving input from your spouse or the light you know like we just don't know what that experience is. So if we work towards environments and um a focus on promoting the idea of connection, I guess I just really believe that that that translates regardless of mental status or like mental clarity. And I think you know you said something earlier that like most people 3 weeks there's probably delirium. I don't know that I think that's true. Oh yeah. I don't and you're the expert not me.

[02:09:45] Yeah. I don't think it's most. I think days before you maybe days so obviously so common um but I think I think there's option opportunity for connection the whole time. Wow. Um yeah, especially if you include to yourself. Yes. To other parts of yourself, then you're then for sure. And especially if also once you include inanimate objects and non-human things. I mean, I have some of the most connected experience of my life have been with dogs, you know, for so once you broaden the scope of what you can connect to. I think Bridget's points are really well placed. Um you may also allow surprise and to feel connection to a perfect stranger has happened to me. I felt like my life has been saved by strangers many times. one way or another. Say more just you know I'm just despondent about especially earlier days in these shoes and you know and just feeling so alone and so in pain or whatever it is or just tired but but just a kindness of a person walking by just a little bit of eye contact little wink just a hey I see you see me just that infinite connect you just nothing maybe they hold the door open but just just a little connectivity and just the realization that it is an illusion to say you're alone. Um it's a really it can feel very real but none of us is actually alone. So as you head towards the cosmos you know you are there's room this comes up with psychedelic work there's room to feel connected to all sorts of things you can't name but you feel that connection you know. So, how much have either of you followed the the sort of psilocybin work, the Roland Griffith's work, the end of life stuff and and and what what is your what is your take on um again notwithstanding the regulatory challenges of that? Um what what is your take on that literature and its its efficacy?

[02:11:38] I think I think anecdotally I have seen psychedelic experiences be incredibly helpful to folks that have kind of run into a place in themselves where they don't have, you know, they've kind of just hit a wall in their own imagination, in their own mind as to what this experience is or what it can be. that there's just this kind of opening that can happen um sometimes incredibly subtly that allows for just some you know slightly different insight not generated by the brain that you know so well or the parts of your brain that know so well and I I think it can be amazing super helpful I mean I'm really in my own experience and those are people I've worked with you know it's easy to start feeling evangel angical like just we should just be putting psilocybin and other psychedelics in the water, you know, and let's be careful. I mean, I think we're going to want to learn from reality as we begin to do more of this work and study and let's be true to what we learn. But on the whole, these substances, these medicines have been able to achieve, you know, in a in a session with a a patient what, you know, months or years of talk therapy, other things haven't accomplished. And you know it's not necessarily about learning something in those experiences can be but in my in from my time with it it's more that I I get past my thoughts and I get into this embodied felt thing. It's not a new it's not an epiphany. It's just I feel the power of that epiphany of that idea in my bones in my flesh.

[02:13:25] It's a kind of different kind of knowing which then allows for a a super sense of connectivity. You can't be disconnected. That's just, you know, you are connected and you feel that and the therapy of that. Also, you get to see what a what how silly our minds can be and you just learn that very simple bumper sticker truth of don't believe everything you think and you then you come out of there with a new relationship to how you hold your thoughts. And people get to that by other means right through meditation, through prayer, through deep transcendent communal experiences, right? So it's it's accessible by way of other avenues.

[02:14:07] You've obviously spent a lot of time with people in um by definition the final stage of their life. What what have you learned? What have you learned that changes the way you live your life or the way you want to live your life? Well, I can say something, you know, there's again huge beautiful questions to ask Peter. I mean, but one is and maybe this is some relief for your audience. Um, I think we all would love to, you know, I think many of us would say we'd love to be fearless and live to go into our death unafraid or um live a life so conscious that we have no regrets.

[02:14:51] I would like to kind of just my patients have taught me to kind of undo those strangle holds a little bit. It's more the truth that I've learned from folks at the end is is is more like have have a change your relationship to fear, your relationship to regret. The mark of living with no regrets. Yeah, that might be an there may be something for you in that, but I I'm not sure how if you're being really honest with yourself how possible that is. So it's not necessarily it's it the lesson has something to do with coming around to accepting everything that's in you including the gnarly stuff like regret and fear and even suffering. Are there certain regrets that people have shared with you more more often than others?

[02:15:37] Well, invariably or a little but invariably but they all the common thread depending sort of whether it's I regret working too much or I regret you know didn't spend this I didn't tell tell my kids I love them that sort of the standard uh regret menu what they all seem to have in common is they regret not letting themselves feel or not letting themselves be true to the what they actually felt something got in there shame or something else wedged in themselves and separated themselves from themselves or separated themselves from other people they love. And the regret has something to do about artificially or accidentally putting a wedge between you and anything. Um, you know, like you could be spend a lifetime running from fear. But if I've watched a lot of people come around to when they finally got the cue that fear was just a natural part of being in a body like they became okay with fear they took away that sort of secondary shaming of fear and then then fear became this it was sort of rightsized to them and it was defanged you I've seen that play out a lot and the same with regret you know so it's it's I just think that the commonality back to your question has something to do with not being quite true to themselves or not allowing a trying to keep something out of their experience and all the work they did. And when they come to realize that it's all got to go anyway, you kind of welcome even pain.

[02:17:03] So to get to feel anything is kind of wild and magical. Do people need to be really close to the end to typically come to that near inevitable realization? Or is that something people are realizing 6 months out where they can do something about it where they still have all their faculties and they can still you know mend a bridge or um mend a relationship. Yeah, absolutely. It can happen anytime. Kids back to kids are doing you know they're not gumming their own works up. They can do that pretty and to so yes we can do this. We can learn to do this. This is another reason why we would invite this subject into our daily lives.

[02:17:46] If you look out your window, death and life are happening all the time. You see it on your windshield. You see it's like this is it's all over the place. If you can sort of really be aware, let let these messages in, then you can let the lessons in toowards reconciliation or why hold a grudge? Why be on any why would you ever cause suffering in another person knowingly and yourself included etc. So yeah and

[02:18:11] Buddhism was lot sort of founded around this question and to give you a life of practice around meditation to how do you hold your mind so that you don't suffer unnecessarily so that you can be okay with the fact of your death. So yeah there are body there's scholarship bodies of thought and just your own personal experience of living daily life if you let it in you can gain these lessons any time along the way of life.

[02:18:35] Yeah, I mean I I don't you know if I think about my own learning like you it you can't I don't think really hang out in this space a lot and not really wrestle with the reality that we don't know when we're going to die which means that this is my life. I mean, I think that's I've got two young kids, so regular I'm kind of like, okay, this is my life. This is my life. Just as like a management strategy, but I think there's also like a a tether to the reality that like this moment is what I have, right?

[02:19:07] It it is not it may start to sound trait, but it is not. Tomorrow is not promised to me, 10 years is not promised to me. And if that is true, can I use that as this reminder that like this moment, the way that I speak to you, being tender when I do things out of my value system, right? Staying really connected to now, right? Is the invitation that comes from or comes next to or has come for me in being so aware of mortality, right? And that you do not have to be sick. You do not have to be facing the end of your life. No one in your life has to be dying right now to be really to just take pause and be like this is my life this moment and then the next. Do I remember that all the time?

[02:19:56] Absolutely not. But it is a very available reminder and practice. Yeah. I stay I intentionally stay connected to it. I intentionally make it something my kids can be connected to because it's inarguable, right? We can we can have three different takes on everything that we've said today, but it is inarguable that we are always living in the reality that we don't know when we're going to die. I just want Yeah.

[02:20:25] Amen, sister. And I think there that's gets back to sort of the dos and don'ts. Do have a relationship with all with mystery with not knowing. You know, do have a relationship with the present moment. You know, those are some pretty good dues. I don't want to what I'm saying is not like light or easy. It doesn't make me not afraid.

[02:20:46] It doesn't make me, you know, not I feel very aware of how much I want to be alive and how long I hope my life is. and also humbled by the fact that like what I have influence over and control over really inarguably is right now and I hear you not being ashamed of your fear and that's the difference. I think a lot of people would be afraid and then what they're really experiencing is the shame of being fearful. I'm very terrified every time I get on a plane.

[02:21:17] Yeah. So, and I think and I think also sort of dubtailing to is this word control comes up a lot. It's a it's a big one. And I think in terms of if we're going to remotely dispense any advice, uh, you know, it would be, you know, the serenity prayer, it comes up a lot one way or another. I think a lot of your listeners will know this. you know, essentially sort of the the ability to discern what you can control and focus some efforts there and let go of all the things you can't control. And maybe in the middle identify that even though there are some huge things we can't control, there is a lot we can influence, right? And that those are distin those are different and that there's like kind of that that spectrum between control, influence and like you know surrender.

[02:22:12] Um, and how do we build our flexibility? Well, and how do you learn to sit with I think that message of the serenity prayer. Often I hear people, myself included, in the past, some friends take that me that wisdom of that message and say, "Okay, I'm just going to focus my attention on what I can control." Sorry, send mic.

[02:22:33] And then they have a lifetime of sort of focusing their uh line of sight in one direction. I think what we let go of is the other half of that message which is not oh don't give a about it because you can't control it like learn sit with all that you can't control practice not being in control that will serve you very well as you head to your death what what about the role of forgiveness how often do you encounter the dying who are wrestling with needing the forgiveness of someone or needing to forgive someone. It's a big theme. It's written about a fair amount. The I love, you know, the things to kind of focus on. I saying out loud, I love you. I forgive you. Please forgive me. These are these are thank you. These are and there's, you know, these are tried andrude messages that seem to cut across culture and stand up pretty well.

[02:23:34] Um, but so back to your specific question about forgiveness, I don't know how often. I guess I would say my I would say more commonly what I see people needing to learn how to do is forgive themselves is probably if you know picking something sort of common that one comes I see that a lot and so how does it present and how do you encounter it being at odds with themselves you know when there is no boogeyman there's no they're just not comfortable with themselves they're at odds with themselves of self-loathing, self-critical even in the final weeks of life. Some if they've had enough, you know, we have a bias. There's a bias that all the people we've seen have had the benefit of hospice and ballet of care involved. So, they've been loved on, they've been heard, they've been, you know, so there's an inborn bias to our experiences. Um, I don't know if I have like a good answer about the forgiveness piece. I think, um, I think it comes up. I don't know that I think it comes up a lot a lot. I don't know. Yeah. Again,

[02:24:48] I think that might be the bias of people that you've spent time with over time. Those things have gotten to. They're not a death there's no need for a deathbed. I mean, there's not a lot of truisms in this space that I generally um vibe with and I'm pretty allergic to most of them. But I will say that I do think there's kind of something to like people die the way that they live. Yeah. Right. Like for most people, those who lived in love die surrounded by love kind of thing.

[02:25:18] Yeah. Doesn't matter like if you had a lot of people around you, maybe there's going to be more people around you. if you're a person that dug into your life and really investigated your mind and you did that relationally and you shared your reflections and like that's also more likely to happen when you're dying, right? So, if there's an experience you would like to happen, if you're imagining into the future, you're like,

[02:25:40] I think dying in this way would be okay or more tolerable or nice or beautiful, start doing it now. Like you want to forgive, like you're worried about forgiveness, like investigate that now, right? You want to feel more connected. How do you do that? You want to be in your body more. How do you do that?

[02:25:57] Right? Like that's the best way to get there at the end is that you're building those muscles. Now, I mean, some people do 180s with with a big diagnosis or the awareness that they're dying, but mostly we lean on the places that we have hyperdeveloped. Mhm. Right. Because they're comforting, because they're familiar in the face of this kind of vast thing. I mean that might be the single most important insight of them all which is we die how we lived and we will what's the expression we we we rise to the level of our training something to that effect right in in sports we talk about that um right at fatigue you rise to the level of your training and so we will we will default to our regular strategies the strategies that got us through life are probably the strategies that will get us through death. And so what we should all be doing is imagining the death we want and begin practicing that at life and make that our scaffolding today and things are about as good as advice as I can imagine is especially if you throw in the caveat that along the way learn to deal with things when they don't go as planned, you know, again. So like so that you don't have this sense of failure at the end. I mean, one of the saddest things I think we see is people who feel like they're failing at dying. So, I don't want to set it up as an accomplishment per se or an achievement per se, but your advice sounds really good to me, right? Like, we can't control for the outcome with certainty. But we can build the muscles and the capacities that that are most likely going or are going to help us land in that place. You know, if you're a person who builds new coping skills or new ways of being in like high stress adversity, like you'll probably do that then, right? Yeah. Done. Sorry. Just keep going. But like you said, it's such it's not it feels like a throwaway line. When do we begin dying? I mean, you don't become a different person when you're dying. You're still going to be Peter.

[02:28:12] You're going to still be bridge. I'm still BJ. And that you know so it has already begun that active dying we never finish answering that question what goes into that like the the final day or two when the body is really shutting down. So active dying has its own kind of frame and we can revisit that any old time but everything up to that is some form of living. So you can begin practicing this dying thing the today.

[02:28:41] Well let's talk about that that final thing. What is what is that what does that last 24 to 48 hours look like? So the phrase we use is active dying to to distinguish it from the rest of living dying and the body is you know is actively shutting down. So system by system uh you know you'll stop your kidneys will shut down. You're not making as much urine in part because you stopped drinking probably a few days ago because your body couldn't handle the fluids.

[02:29:10] So, and thanks to kidney shutting down, you get a buildup of toxic metabolites and and get a little intoxicated, a little dreamy, a little that may be the course of that may be the the mechanism of your delirium. Um, so you're not eating, you're not drinking as a general rule, you're probably a little fuzzy if and or entirely asleep. Um, breathing.

[02:29:33] So, the sort of the two biggies, those can happen anywhere along the way, but the ones that tell you you're really close are when you have modeling of the skin, a sort of lacy bluish experience where your body's just not moving blood effectively and you'll see skin changes, especially at the extremities and breathing patterns um change. Um often times you get apnneic, so long periods of no breath at all. um you often hear something that's so it's like a frightful phrase, but the death rattle um so which often is sort of a a um a gurgling sound with breathing. That's just because your your oral ferings is no longer the reflexes are dying out. So you're no longer moving fluids as they pull in the back of your throat, which is an important note there. If your if your reflexes are no longer functioning, you're not likely feeling it. So a death rattle sounds pretty gnarly. It's but it's generally probably harder for the audience than the person dying. But those are the things that you that are typically experienced in a body that's actively dying and that's only going to last a matter of days at most hours to to a day or two. I think the other thing that's happening is the experience for the people around that person, right?

[02:30:47] And um there's so much to say in that space. But I do think having you know counseledled a lot of people there is there's a feeling of preciousness right we don't know when that last breath is going to come. We we you know maybe we really want to be there. Maybe we feel like we can't. But um often for someone watching and waiting um it can be really hard to stay connected to our own experience. So like people won't get up and go to the bathroom because they don't want to miss that moment.

[02:31:19] They won't eat, they don't eat, maybe their appetite is low anyways, which you know is fine, but it is a time to be thinking about really basic needs and basic comforts for everyone in the space. Um because that influences the space and the environment for for all. And most people feel like this is the dying person's experience. This is like all of the focus is there. We're watching every respiration. We're even matching their breathing. We're creating anxiety in our own bodies because of that. And if we can invite attention to everyone's experience and give permission to like, you need to take a walk, go take a walk.

[02:31:56] It may mean that they die when you're not in the room. And maybe that's okay. Um maybe they die in the one minute you're going to the bathroom for the first time in 6 hours. Like it may just be that way. That's a really really important point sort of like once you understand delirium and so you can contextualize what you're hearing from a loved one that point

[02:32:21] Bridget so is pointing to is such an important one a lot of loving families keep these vigils and don't sleep don't do anything so that they can be there for the death thinking that that's the most that's the highest that's what it means to be there when someone dies is in that exact moment when they take their last breath and so to Bridget's point this is a lived experience for everyone so you got to keep doing you have to sleep, you know. Yes. And um it just I I don't think any of us could tell you why this is, but it is just a thing. You talk to anyone who worked in hospice for a while, it seems to be that a lot of people need to be alone for the final their final moments on the planet to really let go. And so it's almost it's I I can't tell you why, but it is a thing. So you going to the bathroom or taking a walk or stepping in the room may be exactly the thing that that person needs to finally let go. So the message is don't leave and therefore the person will never let go. You just potentially can make it harder and harder for that person to actually finally let go. So go to the bathroom, take a walk, kiss the person goodbye, drink some water, and know that not only they may they may be gone when you come back, but that may be exactly what they needed to finally let go.

[02:33:41] It's a hard one for families to take in, but it's a it's just a thing. Well guys, thank you very much um for this discussion today. very um very important very very difficult discussion u not one we want to have I I I imagine for you guys that's pretty common you go to parties nobody wants to ask you what you guys do or they have got a great story that they feel is relevant yeah yeah it's uh yeah so but um given how much of our time on this planet we spend heading towards the inevitability the one thing we will all be 100% successful at It certainly warrants a discussion. Yeah. Amen, brother. And more. Yeah. And multiple discussions as we pointed out today. You just It's slippery. It's huge. And it's just I'm sorry to not It's It's It's a windy inherently messy conversation. Um so it's not just us struggling to articulate something as much as we articulating the messy this an inherent complexity of something. Yeah. Well, thank you guys. Thank you. Thank you,
