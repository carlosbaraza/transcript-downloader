## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this segment from The Drive podcast with Dr. Sean Mackey:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This segment focuses on the complex nature of the opioid crisis, with Dr. Sean Mackey providing expert insight into the multifaceted factors that contributed to what he calls "the perfect storm." He discusses the balance between necessary medical use of opioids and their potential for abuse, while sharing personal experiences with addiction in his family. The discussion emphasizes that the opioid crisis wasn't simply due to pharmaceutical companies' actions but resulted from multiple systemic pressures in healthcare.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Medical schools provide approximately 7 hours of pain management training, compared to 40 hours in veterinary schools [00:05:12]
- Three categories of physicians in opioid prescribing:
  * Majority doing right thing for right reasons
  * Smaller group doing wrong thing for right reasons
  * Tiny group doing wrong thing for wrong reasons [00:06:33]
- Shift from hospital-based to home-based post-surgical care created prescribing challenges [00:04:14]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Opioids should not be used as first-line treatment for pain (except in specific cases like end-of-life cancer care) [00:07:06]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Post-surgical pain management should be carefully monitored and titrated [00:04:14]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Medications mentioned:

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"I am not anti-opioid. I am pro-patient. I view them as a tool." [00:01:19]

"It is true prescription opioids were overprescribed. They were over marketed... but it's not that simple a story." [00:02:34]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are the specific criteria for appropriate opioid prescription in outpatient settings?
2. What alternative pain management strategies have proven most effective?
3. How has the evolution of patient satisfaction metrics influenced pain management practices?
4. What specific changes in medical education could help address the gaps in pain management training?
5. What role do patient satisfaction scores currently play in pain management decisions?

This segment provides valuable context for understanding the opioid crisis while highlighting the complexity of pain management in modern medicine. Dr. Mackey's balanced perspective, informed by both professional expertise and personal experience, offers important insights into this challenging medical issue.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] There's no question that um opioids have been overused and abused and there's no question that um illicit use of these things has had a devastating uh impact on our society. Um but it would be difficult to say that the field of medicine would be better off having never had an opioid to you know we just talked about surgery for example very challenging to deliver medical care in a hospital without opioids. So the question becomes, what is the most responsible case for oral opioids, which by definition are meant to be used outside of a hospital, not inside a hospital.

[00:00:51] Um, and as a pain specialist, I I would imagine few people are better equipped to navigate the nuance of that question. Yeah, it is a very nuanced question. Um, I think a little preamble first. I don't take money from either the opioid companies. I don't take money from the litigation that's ongoing because there are tens and tens of billions of dollars at play right now.

[00:01:19] Yep. Uh I don't take money. And of pro opioid, I am not anti-opioid. I am propatient. I view them as a tool. I view them as a tool much like the other medications, interventions, mind, body, physical, rehabilitative, complimentary tools that we use. They have a particular place. I have a personal deep appreciation for the destruction that these agents can cause. I come from a family very deep in addiction, very deep. I've lost close family members to opioid overdose. I've lost close family members to alcoholism. I am personally petrified of these drugs and I have gone through surgeries that the surgeon said you can't get through this without an opioid. And I'm like I'll be fine cuz my approach is avoidance. With that said, I have learned a long time ago not to project my personal experiences onto my patients. that had to come through age, wisdom, whatever.

[00:02:34] Um, it is true prescription opioids were overprescribed. They were over marketed. They were, you know, there were bad actors doing bad things. It came at a time, but it's it's not that simple a story. I I sometimes get frustrated because I feel like you can make really simple sound bites out of this complex societal issue when it was a perfect storm that hit. Yes. Um you had a letter to the editor of New England Journal saying that nobody got addicted to on a like 38 patients or some nonsense and Purdue and others ran with this. I and I get that and they did bad things. You also have to put things in the context of what was going on in society. There was growing awareness of pain, as there should be. Um there was growing pressures to do something about it. Uh people have brought up the pain as a fifth vital sign as an example and people have different opinions about that. Uh, did it have bad consequences?

[00:03:49] Yes. Did it have good consequences? Hell yes. Run the counterfactual. Do you want to go back to a time when we're not asking patients after surgery their pain? Do you want your mother, your daughter back in that time? And I think the answer is clearly no. But also there was other pressures. And Peter, you were you witnessed those firsthand. What was going on back in the 90s and the 2000s?

[00:04:14] And after surgery, there was this massive push to get people out of the hospital and put them in their home. We were replacing care in a hospital with care in the home. In the hospital, we had time to see their trajectory. We could titrate their opioids or whatever, get them tuned up, dialed in, and then send them home. Now, surgery overnight, you're home. Let's give you a a bucket of whatever. And the reason for that was surgeons and docs don't like getting called at 3:00 a.m. for pain control. So pressure to put people out in the uh in the home environment. On top of it, docs get lousy training for pain. Like what is the average seven hours I think uh in medical school? Vets by the way 40 hours of pain. So great if you've got a dog, not so great for patient.

[00:05:12] So you got this pressure and by the way not only that on top of that but now you've got the introduction of patient satisfaction scores. I have to imagine in your private practice you don't have to measure press gaining and patient satisfaction scores but in hospitals everybody does or at least they did. I think they're coming to their senses.

[00:05:32] And so one way of addressing the satisfaction give more opioids. So there's and there's more there's many many many pressures that came to bear that helped create this problem of which there were bad actors out there. By the way, the perfect analogy to this is the uh mortgage crisis uh in 2006 to 2008 where if you took a zeroth order view, it would be really easy to blame one of the entities. Yeah, but it is actually a perfect storm, right? I have a slide.

[00:06:08] Yeah, on the opioid I call it the perfect storm. Yeah. Uh you're absolutely right. And in the end, and here I'm going to be a little bit reductive when it comes to the doc's roles in this. I'm going to borrow from my friend uh Professor Keith Humphre. There are three kinds of physicians in the out there. There are the majority of the physicians doing the right thing for the right reasons.

[00:06:33] There are the next group which is a much smaller group physicians doing the wrong thing for the right reasons. And at the very top of that pyramid, a little group, you got physicians doing the wrong thing for the wrong reasons. Bad. Those people at the top, take away their license, put them in jail. But you had a group of people here in the middle that were doing the wrong thing for the right reasons that they either didn't have the right education. They thought they were helping people.

[00:07:06] Um they did they contribute to the problem? Yes. Uh have they gotten educated? Have we? Um yes. I didn't answer your question though. And let me now circle back and and I hope you'll forgive that little bit of saliloquy uh on my perspective of that 20 years. Um I don't use opioids as a first-line agent ever. Almost never uh end of life cancer, but usually by then they've tried other things before they're getting to us. [Music]
