[00:00:03] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia this podcast my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness full stop and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level at the end of this episode i'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to peteratiamd.com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode [Music] my guest this week is dr paul offit paul's a pediatrician specializing in infectious diseases and he's an expert on vaccines immunology and virology he's the director of the vaccine education center and a professor of pediatrics in the division of infectious diseases at chop the children's hospital of philadelphia he's also a professor of vaccinology at the pearlman school of medicine at the university of pennsylvania and he's on the fda committee for biologics evaluation and research vaccines and related biological products advisory committee in other words he's on the fda committee that is overseeing the basically unprecedented scale with which vaccines are being put into a pipeline to be evaluated for kovid he's also the co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine as if all of the above were not enough i wanted to talk with paul for a couple of months but i wanted to wait until the time was right and i kind of defined that as a moment when we had enough certainty in terms of what was going on with covid vaccines that we could speak about it in less abstractions and more straightforward terms with respect to likely releases and approvals of various vaccines and so i'm really glad that i should wait until this time because i do think we're at that point where we have a pretty clear line of sight into the pipeline of a number of companies and also a number of strategies that are being employed and that's that's basically what we go into i mean we certainly talk about paul's background which is fascinating and why he's sort of the perfect guy to have this discussion but the meat of this discussion really focuses on delineating the four strategies with which one can pursue a vaccination against the virus that causes covid and then we talk about basically who the major companies are in each of those categories where they are in their life cycle what that actually means and what it implies as far as vaccination approval we talk a lot about what the potential risks are in each of the categories and more broadly and ultimately we talk about what 2021 could look like and what the unknowns are so i learned a lot in this episode actually more than i expected i was just completely riveted by paul's insights and i think we all have a little bit of covid fatigue at this point that's understandable but i think anybody who's got questions about will a vaccine change my life what should i expect next year i think and i hope at least most of your questions are going to be answered here and i don't suspect this is the last time that paul and i will speak so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with paul [Music] paul thank you so much for making time to sit down with me today i know that you are someone who a lot of people want to talk with especially now that people are really starting to come to grips with the fact that a vaccine for the coronavirus is going to be a very important part of the story i guess before we get that though i think it's important for people to understand why your thoughts on the subject are important in other words you're not just someone like me who's been thinking about the coronavirus for less than a year you're someone who has spent essentially a lifetime thinking about this type of a problem there's a story about how you were a very young boy you were hospitalized and that experience at such a young age kind of shaped the way you thought about going into medicine and ultimately even being a pediatrician can you share a bit of that sure so i was born with club feet which means that my feet turn sort of inward and down typically that's treated with casting so i was casted in the first few hours of life really and then so for months i was casting but it seemed to work i mean my feet seem to straighten out but at the age of five my father decided that he didn't like the way that my heel didn't oh my right foot didn't hit the ground as well as he would have liked so he was able to find a surgeon to do a surgery frankly that was perfected about 40 years later we should have never done that surgery there was no club foot surgery he was able to find a guy who was a son of a friend of his who had just finished his residency in orthopedics and thought great i get to do the surgery which went badly my father was a shirt manufacturer medicine wasn't really his strength but he didn't like the way the heel hit interesting as a side part of the story is that my great uncle my grandfather's brother was a bookie he was really baltimore's bookie he didn't print books he made book my mother initially had trouble getting me into the club foot clinic at johns hopkins hospital but she just called my great uncle who called the guy who was head of the foot clinic who was a gambler apparently so we got in within a week and when the guy this physician saw me he said i if you do nothing don't operate on this foot nonetheless my father insisted to put be straighter and so i had an operation that was a complete failure and as a consequence i ended up in a chronic care facility called kernan's children's hospital although i think then it may have been called conan's hospital for crippled children when you could use words like crippled and feeble-minded i was there for about six weeks and this was the 1950s the polio was king and i remember just a lot of children in that ward with polio it was probably about 20 kids in the words some in our lungs some in traction and there was one visiting hour week that was it sundays from two to three my mother had a complication with pregnancy with my brother so she never came my father had tried to sneak in once to see me thus was prohibited from seeing me again so he traveled a lot so he couldn't do the hours that they had wanted him to do so i just remember sort of seeing those children as vulnerable and helpless and longer finally seeing myself the same way and i remember looking there was my bed was next to a window this was when you had one visiting hour a week polio day so people were scared to death of having anybody else come into that hospital sundays from two to three it wasn't like they had like therapy dogs or you know ipads or televisions or anything you just pretty much laid there and in my case looked out the window that was right next to my bed which looked down to the front door and i kept waiting for my parents to come rescue me to walk through that front door of the hospital never happened when i was a medical student at the university of maryland we rotated through kernan's children's hospital and that room was still there it wasn't a polio award anymore it was a group of secretaries but that window was still there that facility is still there isn't it yeah since phil's house was still there i did my residency at johns hopkins and i remember we would sometimes get transfers i was in surgery so kids that would get infections that would need to be transferred to hopkins for surgical care that's funny i didn't think i'd hear that name again so i remember as a student then walk i was at maryland medical school but i remember walking up to uh that window and looking out of it and seeing that front door and you know i cried so i think that's it i mean i think that we are motivated by the scars of our youth for me a choice to go into pediatrics a choice to go into pediatric infectious diseases a choice to write a book about polio specifically about a sort of a tragic event associated with the making of the polio vaccine a choice to make vaccines i think enter the world of science and stuff probably all is motivated by this course pretty much every book i've written at its heart child advocacy at its heart sort of standing up for children who are vulnerable who can't stand up for themselves we're going to talk about vaccines today and i don't think a discussion of vaccines would be complete without saying something about just the unbelievable disservice that has been done to so many people so many vulnerable people specifically parents who are looking for answers when maybe there are no answers by sort of a fraud that was catapulted upon them in the late 90s in the form of that lancet article that has been so thoroughly debunked as not just incorrect but outright fraud of course i'm referring to that wakefield paper of 12 completely fabricated case studies that really on some level is kind of a big part of the anti-vaccine rhetoric and the vaccines cause gastrointestinal disease which causes autism story that started at that time and frankly on some levels there's a solid number of people who continue to believe this despite the efforts of people like brian deere yourself peter hotez people who have so thoroughly debunked that type of nonsense how do you process that do you process it or there are some people who are very angry about the anti-vaccine movement there are others who i think speak to it more from a place of empathy how do you manage your own emotions around that especially when you see the children themselves are often the victims of parents who are themselves the victims etc yeah i guess i thought come out on the angry side i think andrew was a fraud i think at some level he was a knowing fraud i mean he misrepresented clinical data he misrepresented biological data that paper should have never been published it was basically a story of 12 children eight of whom had autism presumably within a month of receiving mmr vaccine when in fact at least a couple of the children had developed signs and symptoms of autism before ever having received that vaccine which he knew he also he had biopsies on all those children and presumably measles vaccine virus was supposed to be destroying intestinal epithelial cells he had biopsies on those children he never did studies looking at or at least never reported studies looking at whether there was measles virus genome or measles virus vaccine proteins in those cells which is to say he probably did do those studies and they didn't come out the way that he wanted them to actually we'll go one step further i think brian deere has actually done a very good job on covering those biopsies were done and processed and the amount of virus that was found in them was identical to that which was found in basically the formal in itself demonstrating that it was a pure contaminant so actually there was no measles virus whatsoever in any of the colons of or distal ileums of any of those children and i talked to a person who did some of the serology with andrew wakefield for a meeting i had in england and he refused to be on the paper because he felt that andrew wakefield had basically misrepresented sort of igm igg response immunoglobulin responses to measles that was andrew brinder just wrote a book called the doctor who fooled the world which goes through all this i'll be interviewing brian because i think it's such an important discussion clearly there's no shortage of anger towards wakefield because i agree with you and by the way fraud unknowingly is a bit of a tautology by definition if it's fraud in my opinion he was knowingly acting in bad behavior and where are we today maybe just talk about it through the geography that you understand best which i assume is the united states where are we at mmr vaccination levels are we above 95 percent we were i mean i think what happened with the covet 19 pandemic is that we had a dramatic drop in the instance of vaccines in general including mmr vaccine but i would say this i think that this is going to probably surprise you i think in some way andrew wakefield was good for science here's why when he put that out there he became a darling of the anti-vaccine movement he was attractive he was well-spoken he had a british accent which we all love i think we're ready to give ourselves back to the queen at this point and he made the rounds in the united states he was on everything morning evening shows he was on 60 minutes with ed bradley he was a darling of the anti-vaccine he was a physician a scientist who now said all the right things and i think the anti-vaccine folks attached themselves to his star when it was found out that he was not only wrong but fraudulent and wrong that he not only had misrepresented clinical and biological data but in fact had basically laundered money under legal claims through a medical journal his star fell and i think the mainstream media rejected him his last i think appearance on mainstream media was on anderson cooper where cooper just destroyed him yeah yeah it was great so at some level he helped us marginalize to some extent the voices that were the anti-vaccine voices barbara fisher jeff schwartz jb hanley etc had a much bigger voice i think 20 years ago 15 years ago than they do now because i think mainstream media anyway has chosen to set them aside now they see their platform of social media but so i think wakefield in some ways helped us i mean we did the studies to answer the question whether you were more likely to develop autism if you've got the mmr vaccine or not that's been done 18 times in seven different countries on three different continents the question has been asked and answered i do think according to a study done by the autism science foundation about 85 percent of parents who of children with autism no longer believe that vaccines were the cause so i do think that that good science did went out to some extent and i think andrew wakefield has lost that he's now you know he goes on alex jones show we're all good conspiracy theorists go yeah it's interesting there aren't many things in medicine we can say with a higher degree of certainty actually then the mmr vaccine does not cause autism if you really stop to think about it paul do statins cause alzheimer's disease i think the data is overwhelmingly convincing that it does not but i think the data are more convincing than mmr does not cause autism based on the extent to which it's been studied and maybe to some extent the negative attention that wakefield has brought to this has actually forced so much scrutiny of those data not just the 18 studies you refer to but also going back and really exposing the biological plausibility of the argument itself and frankly exposing another issue that i think is very easy to understand so i say this with a lot of empathy but is nevertheless an issue which is any of us are capable of misremembering facts and so much of what i think gave wakefield and his associate bar the lawyer with whom you referred to earlier that he was basically in cahoots siphoning funds through his research organization the ability to carry on for so long was effectively parents misremembering things i actually believe most of those parents were not nefarious i think there are some that who clearly were i think there were some who consciously chose to sort of pursue legal action to get money knowing that what they were saying was false but i don't think that that's the majority of them because remember all of those parents in that case said little susie got the vaccine on tuesday had a nosebleed on wednesday had a fever on thursday and started banging their head against the wall and the rest is history i actually think they believed that although the medical records showed no actually little susie stopped talking six months before they ever got the vaccine and here are the medical records to demonstrate it i mean it was unambiguous what had happened but i just think that people ourselves included sometimes struggle when we go back to remember things especially things that are painful i think we look for reasons for why things happen that gives us some level of control even though the reason may not be the correct one at least now we feel like we have some handle on it what andrew wakefield offered at some level is hope if you don't want your next child to get autism separate the mmr into its three component vaccines if you want to treat this child here's a variety of intestinal treatments that will work that will be magical i mean he he was a charlatan of the first order because he took advantage of parents desperate desire to do something for their children and not to get too far into wakefield's psyche but i actually believe there was probably a day when he was honest i believe there was a day when he like any scientist had a hypothesis set out to test it the difference is he crossed a line the difference between a good scientist and a bad scientist and a charlatan is that a good scientist can look at the data when they disagree with hypothesis and modify hypothesis he had done some early work on sort of vasculitis associated with inflammatory bowel diseases yeah he tried to really make the case that measles continued vaccine also was a cause of inflammatory bowels it was wrong and he admitted he was wrong and then he went on to the next thing where he was wrong but didn't admit he was wrong yeah and doubled down and that's where really the fraud got out of control let's take a step back to give people a bit of a sense of your work what were you doing what was a day in the life of paul off hit a year ago basically before sars co v2 was a known entity what were you working on i spent 26 years of my life working on creating the strains of virus that became the bovine human resort and vaccine road attack that was my 26-year effort before that was done about 2000 we created the vaccine education center children's hospital philadelphia which sort of creates and distributes educational materials to educate the press educate the public educate doctors about vaccines so we can sort of meet this anti-vaccine movement or at least the anti-vaccine sentiment that people have so that we can answer their questions what we're trying to avoid is are those children who suffer needlessly by not getting vaccines that would protect them so that's been the passion i mean i think the passion for me came because i think i saw how hard it was to make a vaccine how hard it was to prove that a vaccine was safe and effective and how easy it was to damn them that paper was was awful should have never been published and yet it created a movement or at least supported a movement so i think that was it seeing how hard vaccines were to make how easy it was to damn them got me interested in trying to fight with facts let's talk a little bit about rotavirus can you tell folks a little bit about what that is and how often it afflicts children rotavirus is a virus that affects the small intestine it causes fever vomiting and diarrhea primarily in children between 6 and 24 months of age in the united states before there was a vaccine everybody would be infected by age five all children would be infected by age five it would cause about 75 000 children to be hospitalized in this country every year with severe dehydration or water loss it would also cause about 60 children to die every year in the developing world or in the rest of the world it was a killer i mean it was really the biggest killer of infants and young children killing about 500 000 babies a year typically children less than two years of age about as many as 2 000 a day so there was always a lot of interest in trying to make a vaccine to prevent it that's where i come in and obviously the difference between why so few kids would die in the united states versus the rest of the world presumably had to do with supportive care and these children in the developing world were going to die of dehydration and or electrolyte imbalance whereas in the united states despite how many were hospitalized at least they could receive intravenous fluids and some form and perhaps even parental nutrition if necessary is that the fundamental distinction the story that i tell is that there's a friend of mine who was a phd in chemistry she actually worked for a pharmaceutical company her baby got protovirus infections so she took the baby to the doctor and the child was severely dehydrated the doctor said let me call an ambulance and take this child to a local hospital the mother said no i can take her i'll put her in the car and take her so she gets her in the car and then she's in a major traffic jam which is why you get an ambulance and so she was stuck and she was much longer to get to the hospital than she would of others by the time she got to the house the child was out of it so they whisked the child back into the treatment room they were able to do a cut down a session in the child's neck to thread a catheter down because that was the only vein they could find that child dies in the developing world because you don't have the kind of equipment to do that cut down because you're walking 20 miles to get to a clinic or hospital so the difference between this country and other countries where children die is not severity of disease it's as severe here it's just that we have the resources here to keep children from dying so what type of a virus is a rotavirus is it an rna or a dna virus it's double-stranded segmented rna virus does that pose any challenges for creating a vaccine against it the good news is when you're trying to make a vaccine you want to see clear evidence that natural infection can induce protection against the least moderate to severe disease then you know that you should be able to mimic that part of the immune responses associated with that protection those studies were done in the 70s actually ruth bishop published a paper showing that if you got a rotavirus infection in your first year of life when you were then subsequently challenged with the virus again just naturally you could get mild infection or you could get asymptomatic infections but you wouldn't get moderate to severe infection the minute that paper was published we thought okay we can make a vaccine we just have to mimic that part of the immune response that's associated with and was that protection lifelong paul no no like many mucosal viruses rotavirus influenza virus paraflow respiratory sensational virus those viruses which have generally short incubation periods meaning time from your focus infected to when you get sick which generally don't have viremi as part of pathogenesis their immune or natural infection and immunization induces a protection that is short-lived and incomplete meaning decades and meaning protection against moderate to severe diseases without mild disease these are the mucosal viruses which i think brings us to star scoby too i think that's going to be the same story here did that paper in the 1970s offer an insight into whether the immunity was provided more by the b cells or the t cells the thinking was that it was going to be an antibody response at the intestinal mucosal surface we had to induce an antibody response that was active in the intestinal mucosal surface which made us think it was going to have to be an oral vaccine which stimulated then immunity at the intestine and not a parental vaccine which would stimulate systemic immunity so what was the approach you took then to do that in the spirit of that at the time what were the options available i mean beginning with say a live attenuated virus is that generally the first thought an individual has when pursuing a vaccine or how did you guys problem solve around the different ways in which you could induce immunity the way we saw it was that rotaviruses are ubiquitous every mammal that walks the face of this earth has its own unique strain as a rotavirus and species barriers are pretty high meaning that a cow rotavirus or calf rotavirus would cause disease in calves but not people and vice versa human rotaviruses would cause disease in babies but not calves so we basically took advantage of that it was a generian approach if you will an edward gender-like approach i mean edward jenner basically used the cal virus to protect against human smallpox stars so calp smallpox essentially cowpox would protect against human smallpox because they were energetically related enough that immunization with one could protect you from a disease caused by another that was our approach so and that was our initial approach was just to take a cal virus a calf virus that would cause diarrhea adapt it to growth in cell culture and then use that as our vaccine and it did work but it was inconsistent so then we had to modify that calf virus so that it included the genes that coded for the proteins that evoke what we found were neutralizing antibodies there were two surface proteins of the virus and we thought both independently evoked neutralizing antibodies that's what we proved so then it was a matter of just constructing these combination virus so called reassorted viruses between calf and animal strains that became the vaccine thus summarizing 10 years worth of work in about 35 seconds it's a little depressing that you can do that but that's what we did what were the risks associated with the vaccine you don't know whenever you're dealing with something that's unknown this is your calf viruses will they behave differently in people will they cause something that's on tour that you hadn't thought about what we learned from other researchers was that surprisingly actually there was a vaccine that was introduced in the late 1990s it was made by national institutes of health in collaboration with wyeth called rotoshield which was a simian rotavirus that was also a recombinant virus simian human resort rotavirus that was found to be a rare cause of intussusception which is intestinal blockage it occurred and depending on who you read between one and ten thousand one and thirty thousand recipes wasn't picked up pre-licensed because the studies wouldn't have been big enough to pick it up pre-licensure it was only picked up months after licensure and then it was off the market within ten months so that was a sobering experience just to relate it to today if you don't mind that virus had rotavirus had been studied for 50 years by that time i mean it was known to be an animal pathogen in the 40s veterinarian study that we knew was a human pathogen by the 70s when that vaccine came out in the late 1990s we had 50 years worth of study nonetheless it caused a side effect in its deception that would have never been predicted by all those studies yeah let me tell people what that is so an innocence is when usually a lymph node in the small intestine acts as a foci and allows the small bowel to telescope on itself so it gets tugged probably through some sort of peristalsis action and that can cause an obstruction so if the piece of the bowel telescopes into another and comes back out easy peasy but if it telescopes and gets stuck you now have a bowel obstruction and i took care of many kids as i'm sure you have who had initiation from lymphoid hyperplasia or various other things but obviously in this case it was a side effect of a vaccine and an understandable side effect meaning there's a biological plausibility of why giving a vaccine that has a gi mucosal effect could lead to lymphoid hyperplasia that could act as the tugging point but you're right you would never in a million years say i think intussusception could be a side effect here and if it only occurs 1 in 10 000 cases you're gonna easily miss that in phase one two and phase three again it speaks to after-market surveillance and the absolute imperative of it and it also speaks to the fact that as we start to talk about coronavirus which we're going to get to very shortly one has to be thoughtful about risk versus reward trade-off with small n right yeah i think the surprise was that vaccine which was sort of a simian rotavirus basically that virus reproduced itself far less efficiently at the intestinal mucosal surface than did wild type virus natural virus there was no evidence that natural rotavirus caused any deception so why would this be true and the reason is is that interception really appeared to be around phenomenon it wasn't a winter phenomenon in the united states which was what rotavirus was you would expect to see a bump in the winter which you never saw so why would a vaccine do something that natural infection didn't do i think what we know now is that natural infection probably was a very rare cause of interception as was this vaccine and i guess the covet analogy is that here's a virus covet for which we had at least the gene structure in early january of this year which has already had a number of sort of clinical and pathological surprises which we are now about to counter with a series of vaccine strategies with which we have no commercial experience i think it's fair to say there's going to be a learning curve here so there has to be real humility i think as we move forward let's help folks understand a little bit about these different phases because you can't turn on the news without hearing company x is in phase one or two or three and i just want people to understand what those mean specific to vaccines because they have slightly different meanings than say in drugs that treat blood pressure so can you explain to people what a phase one vaccine trial aims to accomplish and what a typical size of that trial might look like if you're trying to make a vaccine you're starting so-called pre-clinical studies meaning studies done before you get to humans and hopefully you'll have an animal model to study the disease in the case of rotavirus it was mice if we inoculated babies mice with rotavirus they got sick okay great so now we have a way to study this infection then you have your idea for how you want to make your vaccine you give your vaccine you then challenge the animal with the virus and hopefully you can protect the animal from disease and more importantly you can frankly literally dissect out that part of the immune response that's associated with protection against child so those pre-clinical studies are called proof of concept studies so now you have your way of making a vaccine then you go to phase one which are usually about 20 to 100 people now you have your idea for how you want to make it but you don't really know the dose so you give a variety of different doses to these 20 to 100 people to see whether or not you can safely induce an immune response that you think is going to be protective based on your animal model work now you have a dose and a strategy what's the typical length of time to go from that pre-clinical where you've now filed an ind and you now would be applying to an institutional review board to do a phase one in the normal world that takes how long usually i think probably it's fair to say 10 years 15 years okay we'll make sure everybody keeps that in mind when we pivot to coronavirus the other thing i want to highlight that you just said there is 20 to 40 people ish yeah 20-100 we're not talking about 10 000 people and these are often done with a little bit of a dose escalation built in so maybe the first 10 people are going to get a really really small dose we make sure nothing catastrophic happens we then escalate the next 10 etc right they're dose ranging trials exactly right you go slow and you work your way up to see what seems to consistently induce an immune response that is and that is safe the third thing i want to highlight there is we are not actually able to assess whether or not the people have legitimate immunity we're using a proxy presumably which is some form of serology in other words we're not actually testing their ability to resist an infection we're measuring an antibody is that correct that's right you have a prediction based on your animal model studies that one aspect of the immune response is going to be associated with protection against channels as it was true in your animal models you won't know that till you get to phase three so now let's go to phase two you've established a dose potentially a frequency what do you do in phase two and roughly how many people do you do this with so phase two is typically hundreds of people now you've got your vaccine you've got your dose and you just wanna make sure that it's consistently induces an immune response that you think is protective and that it's at least safe and that it doesn't cause a relatively common serious side effect that's phase two and again the two points worth making sure people understand still a relatively small clinical trial hundreds of people and you're still using surrogate markers we don't actually know if this vaccine is providing immunity in the real world it's efficacy we don't know if it's effective and we don't really have any way of knowing what very minor or i shouldn't say minor infrequent negative consequences could look like because we're still dealing with a very small sample size that's exactly right so now we go to phase three and what does that look like this is the definitive trial this is the trial that you're going to use to submit information to the fda food and drug administration hopefully for licensure these are tens of thousands of people in the case of our rotavirus vaccine it was 70 000 babies 35 000 got the vaccine 35 000 got placebo which is just essentially the vaccine except no active ingredient just the frankly sugar solution in which the vaccine virus was suspended and then you just send people out into the real world i mean rotavirus is a common infection it's the rare child who gets stage five without being infected and then you just see whether or not children who got the vaccine were less likely to get rotavirus or if they got it that they were less likely to get it severely and hopefully you'll have we had zero on all those children meaning we looked at the antibodies on all those children hopefully that would provide a clear immunological correlated protection which it didn't we knew that the vaccine worked we knew that it was safe and so we could submit it for licensure to the fda but as you go along things are much more expensive you go from sort of millions to tens of millions to hundreds and hundreds of millions and then you mass produce the vaccine after you've found out that it works and as a general rule the process we just described going from a preclinical model in animals to the completion of a phase three trial with the fda approval of an agent here's the rule of thumb i use please correct me on the vaccine side i generally say that's 20 years and 1 billion dollars and that's usually on the drug side is it about the same on the vaccine side yes 15 to 20 years with at least a billion dollars that's right so let's now talk about coronavirus and just understand that in january of 2020 when the sequence of the rna identifying this as a novel pathogen a coronavirus named now sarsko v2 shows up and by march i guess it becomes pretty clear this is not going to be contained which means any strategy towards containment is going to fail it became readily apparent that a vaccine was going to be a very important piece of the strategy basically at that point it was going to be herd immunity without vaccine or herd immunity aided by vaccine if you're staring down the barrel of it's going to take 20 years and a billion dollars that's not a very appealing strategy because it basically says it has to be heard immunity without a vaccine meaning this virus has to sort of rip through a population without it if i could ask you to put yourself back in your mindset in february or march of last year what would you have said if i asked you at the time paul how likely is it that a vaccine will be developed to at least thwart in some way this virus and two how long will it take what would you have said then i would have said it would take years you do have to give credit to the administration for one thing operation warp speed what they did was they basically took the risk out of it for pharmaceutical companies what the government said is with both varda which is part of health and human services the world health organization the gates foundation and others but in this country the government said here's what we'll do we'll pay for phase three troubles we'll pay for mass production at risk meaning we'll mass produce this vaccine we'll make millions of doses of vaccine without knowing whether the vaccine works without knowing whether it's safe and showing a willingness to if it neither works or isn't safe we'll throw out those tens of millions of doses no pharmaceutical company would ever do that so now you basically had phase one trials you pretty much went right to phase three trials which the company would never do went right to mass producing which a company would never do and that's what meant having a vaccine in hand in january it is in all likelihood that we will have a vaccine that is rolling off the assembly line into the arms of americans by early next year i mean so a year and a quarter to make a vaccine with only having the virus in hand in january that's remarkably fast it's unimaginably fast but it's the government that did that so give credit to them let's talk a little bit about some of the different ways in which vaccines are made again there's so many different ways to skin this but one way is you actually deliver the rna of the coronavirus in a vehicle that then gets taken up by our dna and it creates enough of an immune response that we create an immune response to it how do you think of that overall strategy so if there's any good news about this virus it's that we know the part of the virus the protein in the virus that attaches the virus to cells if you can prevent the virus from attaching to cells in theory you should be able to prevent the virus from infecting cells or set it another way infecting you that protein is the spike protein it's the protein that emanates from the surface of the virus it gives its crown-like appearance hence coronavirus you also know the gene that codes for that protein it's an mrna virus meaning messenger rna virus single-stranded messenger rna virus like rubella or german measles so the initial strategies to make this vaccine are all based on that knowledge we know the gene that codes for that protein take the mrna strategy which is the most naked and obvious which is that you basically take the messenger rna which codes for that protein you inject it into people it's taken up by the cell in the cell cytoplasm outside the nucleus it enters the so-called ribosomal system and it's translated to a protein which is excreted so that's so your body makes the pro despite the chronovirus spike protein then your body makes antibodies to the spike protein that's very similar strategies the so-called dna vaccines and then these so-called replication defectives simian or human adenovirus vaccines or replication competent vectored vaccines all have the same strategy in mind which is introduce the gene that codes for the coronavirus spike protein induce your body to make that spike protein and then your body will make antibodies these are so-called genetic plug and play vaccines the reason that they're the first ones to come out is because they're the easiest to construct and the easiest to mass produce it doesn't mean they're going to be the last best vaccines but that's why they're going to be the first vaccines one question i have for you on that paul is given the instability of rna i've always been kind of surprised that they work i can understand why dna could work but given how unstable rna could be when you take a single strand of messenger rna and deliver it what allows it i mean this might sound like a silly sort of technical question what allows it to make its way into our cells into the cytoplasm head over to the ribosome and then get translated ultimately into protein so anybody who works with messenger rna laboratory stores messenger rna at minus 70 degrees centigrade or in liquid nitrogen because as you say it's an incredibly labile molecule it breaks down within moments frankly i've burned myself on said vats of liquid nitrogen many a time in the lab yeah so to get around that problem these vaccines the messenger rna vaccines have to be encapsulated in a complex lipid delivering system which stabilizes them to some extent the moderna has been able to figure out a way to both store and ship and store at minus 20 degrees which is just freezer temperature but pfizer no they're going to ship and store at minus 70 minus 80 this ultra cold chain which we've never done in this country which i think will be a challenge so you have to constantly maintain that product on dry ice once you thaw it out and put in the refrigerator it can't be there for more than a day before you give it you're right i think the lability of messenger rna will be uh challenging and just one sort of nerdy virologist thing that i'd like to say as a nerdy virologist is that when you're infected with this virus you'll shed infectious virus for a week roughly you'll shed infectious viruses a week you'll be pcr positive polymerase chain reacts positive you can be pcr positive for three months what you're detecting in the back of the throat is not infectious virus it's messenger rna that's what you're detecting which means because it's so quickly degraded why would it be around so much longer and the answer is the virus is continuing to make messenger rna but not making whole virus particles why would it do that i mean this virus continues to surprise i think let me make sure i understand what you just said because i never actually thought about it that way you're saying that let's say i take the modern vaccine i'm getting a bolus of mrna my body is gonna just take that and incorporate it and start kicking off protein but it does two things it doesn't just take it like one single transcribed piece of mrna and translate into protein and be done with it it actually incorporates it back into the dna and that cell of mine continues to transcribe and translate is that what you're saying for months the mrna will amplify itself in the cell true which cell epithelial cells like which of my cells muscle cells you'll be inoculated in your arm it'll be the muscle cells and then to some extent also antigen presenting cells like macrophages dendritic cells okay that's kind of interesting to think about because why would it show up in a throat swab how is it making it all the way to the epithelial cells in my throat or in my nose or wherever i guess i'm saying two different things when you're naturally infected with sores kovy2 that virus then reproduces itself over and over again part in the back of your throat and it makes infectious virus particles it enters your cells it re it's transcribed it's translated and then it makes new virus particles but what happens is it's only making new virus particles for about a week and then it stops making infectious particles anymore but you still have messenger rna in the back of your throat you can for months which means the virus is still there it's still in the cell it's still making messenger rna but it's not making a whole virus particle anymore that's weird i don't know of any virus that does that i'm not sure it says anything about the messenger rna approach i mean messenger rna does amplify itself in your body but then it's quickly broken down as it's all messenger rna in your body it'll be curious to see what happens with this i mean we're going to learn a lot with this strategy we'll see whether it applies to other vaccines possibilities and we'll see whether or not we run into a problem moderna that you mentioned is obviously one of the front runners in this and i think that's in no small part to the fact that one of their partners is nih that's you know national institutes of health here in the united states has bankrolled to the tune of about a billion dollars as you said has nih partnered with anyone else besides moderna no just begun it's their construct that modernity uses the nucleoside analogues that are used in that vaccine that was all developed by a couple researchers at the national institutes of health actually national enthusiast as far as i know holds the patent on that vaccine and they basically entered phase three this summer correct i mean i think they're fully enrolled aren't they they enter the end of july as far as i know they're fully involved it's hard to know i mean it's always trying to read the tea leaves on this these trials okay well anyone else on the mrna strategy that you think is i mean modern is probably the leader correct modern n5 both let's talk a little bit about the pfizer platform how does it differ whereas modernity gives 100 micrograms per dose in a two-dose series pfizer gives 30 micrograms so it's not the same nucleoside analogues and i'm curious to know i'd love to hear a scientific presentation on why pfizer needs to ship and store at minus 70 which is going to be a challenge as compared to modernist shipping and storing and minus just minus 20. they are different constructs so they are given at different amounts and we'll see to what extent any of them work for safe now pfizer is doing a phase two phase three combined is that correct they sort of all are i mean you sort of went right sort of skip through phase two right to phase three really they all did that do you think that that distinction paul from a logistics standpoint is going to matter in other words when we start to think let's just assume for a moment that the modern vaccine and the pfizer vaccine have equal efficacy in the real world so in a phase three trial we see call it a 70 reduction severity of infection in those receiving the vaccine over the placebo would we agree that that's a win yes okay all other things being equal is the need to transport tens of millions of doses of something basically in liquid nitrogen going to pose a challenge so it won't be in liquid nitrogen but it will be on dry ice is that going to pose a challenge yes i think what worries me in this a little bit is that when you do the studies which pfizer is doing and modernists doing you can be comfortable that the companies are very good at overseeing the shipment and storage of that product and they're making sure that the investigators they've got the special package in which this vaccine is stored they're constantly maintaining dry ice that doesn't work and when it's thought out and put in the refrigerator it can only be there for a day when the vaccine then gets distributed to the the world under natural conditions with the united states under natural conditions how is it going to be distributed probably at least in part in like large chain pharmacies are the pharmacists going to be as good at doing what was done during the trial because certainly as you said at the beginning i mean these are mrna is labile and if it degrades and it certainly has the capacity to degrade will we get less efficacy effectiveness of the vaccine in a real world situation than we did in a experimental situation yeah i guess tbd your best guess of how those companies are signaling when we're going to see data i mean it depends in large part on how active the third wave of this is because this is one of those things where the more people that get exposed the more quickly we see the difference between the placebo and the vaccine the company technically doesn't know what's going on in the trial i mean technically the company meaning the ceo for example doesn't know who's gotten vaccine who's gotten placebo doesn't know who's gotten sick and who hasn't gotten sick doesn't know how many cases of disease have occurred placebo group or vaccine group doesn't know that the data safety monitoring board does knows that which is composed of a group of academics and researchers who are not affiliated with the company and not affiliated with the government these are being run through large crows i assume yes depends on who's doing it but yes for listener clinical research organizations when large companies or even academics do clinical trials they usually contract out with companies that are exceptional at all the stuff that paul's talking about which is the logistics of how do you actually ship this thing from a to b and make sure it goes perfectly how do you get the blood draw on this person and measure this and all these things and so that's not an expertise that a company wants to build in-house they typically outsource that and it's those companies that are it's a part of that is the monitoring but presumably there's a power analysis that's gone into this that said look we're going to enroll 30 000 people we know half of them are going to get a placebo half of them are going to get an active agent we've stratified on some level by age the inclusion criteria probably says we want people between ages x and y of a certain this many of them to be of this health this many of them to not be of that health we think the exposure risk at this stage of the virus is meaning at this life cycle the virus we think there's this many more people that can be exposed the r naught is something do you think that they can at least back into an answer which says hey by february we should know this good or bad or is that simply something that just can't be known a priori my hope is that these companies do what was recommended actually by the nih active group that was put together by francis collins which is it depends on whether it's a one to one or two to one trial meaning two vaccines recipients for everyone placebo or subscribing or one to one but if that's true you need at least around between 147 and 160 people to get sick in the trial in order to be able to say you can so-called reject the null hypothesis the null hypothesis is this vaccine doesn't work to reject the null hypothesis is to say i have statistically significant robust evidence that says it does you need 90 percent confidence interval to be able to say that you need about 150 people now the data safety mining board they're looking all the time in real time so they know when they feel you've met a safety or efficacy standard and then they call the company and they say okay now you can submit this vaccine what would be for a typical vaccine which is not this vaccine you can submit it for licensure with a biologic license application that's not these vaccines these vaccines are all going to be permitted for use under emergency use authorization it's different and that i think is what scares people at some level because they saw what happened with for example hydroxychloroquine which didn't work now has been shown clearly not to work to treat or prevent disease yet it was approved under eua or convalescent plasma which is to say antibodies taken from people who survived the infection which again was heartily approved by the fda through this emergency use authorization also with the no evidence that it worked what's weird about this is that people are doing the same kinds of trials they would do for any vaccine large placebo-controlled trials yet it's still not going to go through a biological license application mechanism it's going through eua just because of time i think it's because the fda would not typically license a product that was studied for this short period of time so yeah because of time can you just explain to people what the eu a is i guess by now most people have heard the term emergency use authorization it's been granted to not just medications but frankly to even testing modalities oh this serology test just got a ua this pcr test just got a ua what does it actually mean it's a permission to use something which is to say that even though there aren't clear data showing that something is safe or effective or that it's a diagnostic it clearly works well we're going to allow it under this condition because we're under duress with this covet 19 pandemic so we're going to put it out there with the hopes that it works i actually wrote an op-ed piece that i submitted to the philadelphia inquirer yesterday that i just heard before this show that is going to be published i think it's sunday on the philadelphia choir but the point i'm trying to make in that piece is that how big of a risk are we taking if we're going to be studying these vaccines for four months five months six months and we're going to be putting them out there into millions and arguably tens of millions and hundreds of millions of people are we taking a risk and i think in terms of effectiveness you're only going to know that a vaccine is affected for a few months you don't know whether it's effective for nine months or a year or two years you don't know that i don't think that's a huge risk i think it's likely that it's effective in the short term it's probably effective in the somewhat longer term i don't think it's going to be effective for decades but i think it's likely to be effective at least for a year or two or three i think i mean we'll see and worst case scenario you could give a booster dose that would be the worst case scenario but then safety which is what everybody worries about i mean have you really studied it enough to say whether it's a i'm on the fda's vaccine advisory committee we had our meeting on october 22nd and that dominated the meeting that nine hour meeting was dominated by the fda is basically asking us are you comfortable as a committee allowing you through eua knowing we're not going to have a certain amount of data what you'll have basically is you'll have two-month follow-up after the last dose for safety issues is that enough time personally i think the answer is yes i do i mean if you look at the serious side effects that vaccines occasionally cause like polio caused by the oral polio vaccine which occurred in one in 2.4 million doses or narcolepsy a disorder of wakefulness that was caused by the squatting adjuvanted flu vaccine that was given in europe not in the united states which occurred in roughly one in fifty five thousand doses thrombocytopenia lowering the platelet count that occurs with measles containing vaccine which occurs in one in twenty five thousand doses or something called viscerotropic disease which is basically a sort of multi-system disease caused by the yellow fever vaccines basically yellow fever caused by the yellow fever vaccine which occurs in about one in a million doses or guillain-barre syndrome which is this ascending paralysis which can affect your ability to breathe that occurs in about one in a million doses of the influenza vaccine how soon did you know that i mean how soon did you know about those serious problems did you know about them within two months and the answer yes i was on a cdc conference call yesterday with a group of folks that are associated with the advisory committee for immunization practices and we collectively could not think of a serious side effect that was not picked up after two months so i'm optimistic that that would happen here as well when you think of all of the different types of vaccines we just talked about the mrna vaccine we'll get to sort of the viral vectors the inactivated or attenuated variants and then obviously just the proteins that are delivered i want to go through these in some detail and use it as an exam to talk about the companies are there any of those classes you worry about more than others from a risk standpoint for example some of the live attenuated viruses have been the ones that go on to cause isn't polio's life attenuated correct your polar vaccine was a live attenuated viral vaccine yes right and so that's presumably why you had even though it was a minuscule risk you still had some risk of getting polio so do you look at those four categories of vaccines equally from a safety question i'm not sure we know enough about mrna dna replication defective human or simian adenoviruses to say here are the things that i worry about though i worried that you've had three clinical holds for these vaccines you have one clinical hole with johnson johnson's product which was is a replication defective adenovirus 26. so adenovirus is a virus human virus that causes a variety of clinical diseases type 26 just means it's one of the many types of adenovirus human antiviruses that cause disease replication defective means that the virus has been genetically engineered so it can't reproduce itself but it has also been genetically engineered so it contains the gene that codes for the coronavirus spike protein so that when you're inoculated with that vaccine the cell takes up that particle which does not amplify itself it enters the nucleus it then is transcribed it's transcribed to messenger rna the messenger rna is translated to a protein and that protein is excreted so it's good news bad news the good news is it's replication defective therefore it can't cause disease because the virus is reproducing itself the bad news is it's replication effective meaning you have to give a lot of virus to get enough of those virus particles into the cell to make the protein you're interested in about 10 billion virus particles per dose that's a lot of virus that's why it is that side effect profile can be a little rough meaning fever including high fever and then symptoms associated with fever chills headache muscle ache and that was seen fairly commonly especially after the second dose with these vaccines which is also part of the issue with some of the genetic engineering stuff this is a little off topic but the use of adenovirus is for genetic engineering even 20 years ago at chop right i mean that's a big part of what kind of got into some of the trouble there isn't it yes that's it i mean i'm at penn so we're all thinking the same thing which is jesse gelsinger gelsinger yeah god i still remember that story like it was yesterday it's got to be at least 20 years he was inoculated with a replication defective adenovirus type 5 that included the gene that coded for one of the liver enzymes that he was missing he was missing a gene it allowed him to take the ammonia that is a consequence of protein metabolism and excrete it from his body so the ammonia would build up in his body and then he would get very sick and go into a coma occasionally so but he died i mean he died because he had a massive so-called cytokine response with something called interleukin-6 at a time before we had antibodies directed against interleukin-6 that would have saved his life and we all lived through that and it really set gene therapy back if it's any consolation the amount of replication effect of adenovirus that he got was logarithmically greater exponentially greater than the amount that we're currently giving here even though 10 billion sounds like a lot it's still about 1 300th of what he got but again you're going into an outbred population with when you put something into millions of people you may find something out that's untoward so yeah that worries me the clinical holds worried me a little bit the two clinical holds that were for the replication of active simian adenovirus which was the uk astrazeneca vaccine were both because of neurological issues the first was so-called undiagnosed multiple sclerosis the second was transverse myelitis which is an inflammation of a segment of the spinal cord the mechanism by which both of those diseases happen is the same which is that you make an immune response really to the sheathing of your nerves and particularly one protein on this evening of your nervous modeling basic protein multiple sclerosis is relatively common but transverse myelitism that occurs maybe one in two hundred thousand in the general population that trial was about eighteen thousand people big at the time which is to say nine thousand people got vaccine and they saw that case it was adjudicated to be likely to be coincidental and not causal but it does worry you a little bit that because it certainly was a statistical missouri and you'd like to know what the problem was with johnson johnson's vaccine which you don't this is the problem with these things and they're both in the same class right they're both replication effective adenovirus yeah exactly while we're on that topic aren't these the same classes that were actually approved in russia and china doesn't russia and china each have something that they've approved for limited use already in this category yeah so china had a replication defective ad 5 adenovirus type 5 which they actually had approved for use in the military i'm not sure what extent they've done it because it seems they've gone in the other direction now and they're looking just at a inactivated viral vaccine that seems to be their focus now yeah i was going to say do we have any data i mean not that we would have any data from china necessarily but we don't know how many people received that outside of in an actual clinical use and if there's been any other safety defects noted i mean i have heard they have given it to tens of thousands of people but what i haven't heard is the results of the phase 3 trial so i'd like to see whether or not it actually works would be nice to see and then the russian the gamalia research institute in moscow has also replication defective adenovirus factors and also as a two-dose vaccine but the first dose is replication defective ad five the second dose is replication defective ad 26 that's their vaccine vladimir putin came out in the end of august and said we are going to now start giving this to our public the russian public we have checked all the boxes which knew as i could tell at the time was doing a small phase one trial they hadn't even started doing phase three trials yet so i'm not sure what's going on in russia it's hard to know what's going on i know that i got a call from a venezuelan reporter who said that that russian vaccine had been shipped to venezuela for use so i don't know what's going on out there but you really would like to wait for phase free trials to at least prove safety and efficacy at some level before you start giving it to the general population the other big player here is merck although they're a step behind right they're mostly phase one at this point they have a candidate that has made it through phase one yet i've heard of two candidates one is the replication competent vesicular stomatitis virus which although reproduces itself in your body doesn't really cause disease that's what they use for their ebola vaccine that was mark's ebola vaccine but they also apparently are interested in using their measles vaccine virus as a vector for this as well so i haven't seen any data yet but again just summarizing where we are we've got moderna and pfizer as the big guns on the mrna front we've got johnson johnson and then astrazeneca with oxford as the big guns on the adenovirus slash viral vector front is that fair yes as the leaders okay so then the next sort of category is let's just give you the protein off the virus itself let's just rip off a spike protein give you a whole bunch of them and when your body sees those it's not going to be threatened by them i mean it's going to be threatened appropriately to make an immune response but obviously the protein by itself can't hurt you because it has no genetic material with which to take over your cells as a general rule how does that strategy work when you think of other non-coronavirus applications right so it's the strategy we use to make the hepatitis b vaccine with which we have had experience since the 90s early 90s it's the strategy we used to make the human papilloma virus vaccine which has been on the market since mid 2000s around 2006 it's a strategy we used to make one of the influenza vaccines so called flu block which has also been around for years you have the comfort at least of having a lot of commercial experience with that strategy they're made using recombinant dna technology so in the case for example of the hepatitis b vaccine or the human papillomavirus vaccine you take a yeast plasmid which is just a small circular piece of dna you clone into that the gene you're interested in which as we've said now a million times on the show the coronavir gene that codes for the chronovirus spike protein you then sort of transfect that into yeast cells actually just common baker's yeast and as the baker juice reproduces itself it also makes that protein which you purify in the case of flu block which looks like it's closer to the strategy that's being used by sanofi gsk collaboration there what you do is you take a basically an insect virus so-called bachelor virus you clone into it again the gene that you're interested in the chronograph spike protein gene and then you infect insect cells and then that protein actually forms rosettes as is excreted from the cell that's where you make flu block which i actually got this year as my influenza vaccine and i'm still alive that's quadrivalent it's quite a value so you mentioned obviously sanofi gsk that's one of the big guns they're not in phase three yet are they they're going to start that next month novovax is the other one that does purify protein approach those two and novovax is in phase three that's what i heard yeah yeah but gsk sanofi is next month for phase three novavax was enrolling in november they started and sanofi was starting to roll in december so should be soon is there anything about this approach that tends to go really wrong me not being a virologist and not knowing much about vaccines of the three approaches we've discussed so far i guess the four because we've already alluded to what the fourth strategy is which is a live attenuated virus the protein-based delivery seems the most benign is that necessarily true i think that's fair it's just a purified protein certainly we have a lot of history decades worth of history doing that approach successfully if you look at shingrix which is again a purified protein it's just one of the proteins from varicella's astrovirus that vaccine actually works better than the live attenuated viral vaccine zostavax and essentially it's replaceable we basically two years ago said we're done it's a hundred percent switched to shingrovax now shingrix rather yeah which is amazing i mean you know typically historically live attenuated viral vaccines always work better than a single protein the difference was the adjuvant shingrix has two powerful adjuvants which we sort of separate i think by like six months or something no no they're all part of that vaccine so one is monophospholipid a the other is the so-called qs21 that's all part of the varicella zaster of virus glycoprotein e has these two adjuvants that are all part of the vaccine oh i see but we give shingrix in two is the second one just a booster you give two dose right it's the same thing it's both contain the same underside okay the adjuvant that's being used in the nova bax product is actually similar to the adjuvant in the shingrix product so you wonder if you had to take a guess maybe this would be the vaccine that would be best for older people because that vaccine works remarkably well in older shingrix stones so this brings us to our fourth category then which again we've talked about which is these attenuated or live attenuated vaccines or inactivated vaccines now this is something where i think china has a number of products in the pipeline i don't believe that there is there a european or american counterpart in this space not that i know it looks like all the inactivated vaccines are coming out of china and they've done a lot with it you could argue that could be the first vaccine that is commercially available if you will the first one to have a clear phase free trial at least you should for my understanding for how much many people have been immunized in china already so let's talk a little bit about some of the other things that are going on here we i think i have to be honest i'm very surprised i think in march of this year i did not think it was plausible that there would be a vaccine on the market within a year in fact i probably would have used the words impossible if you said to me in march can there be a vaccine in a year and by the way that wasn't just based on the financial thing i mean when i asked you that question earlier paul you alluded to how the government financially completely de-risked the operation and i won't diminish that in any way shape or form i just didn't think it was going to be from a manufacturing standpoint possible enough to make enough gmp stuff at volume and actually put it into clinical trials i was like there's no way like there's no way in 12 months we can get there well it turns out i was wrong we're probably going to have vaccines on the market by january so let's start with a question about genetic drift what do we know about how much the genome of this thing is moving so it's a single-stranded rna virus and like all single-stranded rna viruses its replication isn't terribly faithful or said another way it probably mutates to some extent every time it reproduces its own the critical question is does it mutate in a manner that causes a functional trend and by functional change i mean more or less contagious or more or less virulent or from the standpoint of the vaccine does it mutate away from the vaccine so that immunization or natural infection one year doesn't protect you the following year which is the influenza story influenza is also a single stranded rna virus segmented rna virus but measles is a single stranded rna virus too so is mumps and they have different genotypes meaning that there is drift as you say to cause there to be different strains but never has measles really changed its serotype so the vaccine that worked in 1963 still works today and so the question is which of those is it going to be this fire is going to be influenza-like or is it going to be measles-like i'm going to predict i'm happy to make a series of predictions as long as you don't hold me to them i would say that i'd be surprised although the virus continues to surprise it is going to be more than a single serotype disease in other words that a vaccine that works now could well work next year in the year after that let's just make sure everyone understands what you said because you said a lot of interesting and important stuff there single stranded rna is to put it mildly a little sloppy that means every time this guy reproduces itself it makes a little bit of a mistake sometimes those mistakes don't mean anything sometimes they do it's yet to be determined there's two things at least that matter with respect to the fidelity with which it can reproduce one is does it change the properties of how the virus responds either making it less toxic to us as humans or more toxic or pathogenic to us as humans i think it's definitely too early to say if that's happening one way or the other but the second property about its ability or inability to replicate itself perfectly is if it makes so many changes in its replication cycle it might look so different year after year after year that our immune system even if able to maintain robust immune cells that recognize the virus may functionally be duped by it because it looks so different each year that's why we get flu shots every year and we get mmr once even though they're both single-stranded mrna viruses you're basically saying if you had to guess this is going to be between them so it's not going to be changing so dramatically every year that we would need to go through this exercise annually is that what you're saying yeah i'm going to predict actually it's going to be more measles-like that it's not going to drift and in a manner that is means that the vaccine no longer works that'll be my prediction but i have been wrong about this virus before us the good news is i mean i think we're getting to about a year on this thing and i think the virus we're seeing today does not look meaningfully different from that which was identified in january so hopefully that speaks in your favor do we have a sense of how these vaccines are working at the real molecular level obviously we love to look at immunoglobulins as a proxy for immune response so hey this generated igg and igm but there's been a lot of talk about the solubility of those things and are those immunoglobulins actually active just because they're present do they actually have the binding capacity to the virus to actually eradicate it of course there's been a lot of talk about t cells and how some people might be getting a less aggressive version of covid because perhaps they had some t cells that recognized a separate virus a separate coronavirus that they may have had six months sooner what's your thinking or what's the latest thinking on those hypotheses and ideas this virus stars kobe 2 is essentially a bat coronavirus that just reared its head in wuhan in the middle of november of last year and now has swept across the world and made its debut in the human population we are infected with human coronaviruses all the time i mean there are four strains of human coronaviruses that circulate they were first identified in the early 1960s there no doubt circulating well before that they cause respiratory infections meaning congestion cough runny nose occasionally more severe disease pneumonia they account for probably about 15 to 20 percent of the diseases that we see in our emergency department or in our hospital every year and that's pretty much invariant the question is because the human coronaviruses do share some similarity to this bad coronavirus which is recognized by so called helper t cells does your previous experience with human coronary virus which we pretty much all had it mean something to us in terms of protecting us against this virus i don't think so is my sense of it in terms of what works i mean i guess i'm very simplistic on this based on my experiences with rotavirus i think the trick is keeping the virus from binding to cells it's really the way the measles vaccine works whether most vaccine works whether the bell vaccine works where the varicella trick impacts vaccine works if you can prevent the virus from binding your cells you can prevent the virus from entering cells so when you make antibodies or those antibodies directed against the so-called part of the spike protein the receptor binding domain of the spike protein that is neutralizing the virus we want to neutralize the virus you don't want to just bind to the virus you want to neutralize it so it can't attach to cells and that's the business end of the sars cov2 spike protein is that so-called receptor binding domain so that's the question and the other question i think that people are worried about is that antibodies can fade over time even after a natural infection so what does that mean for a vaccine if antibodies fade and this is a little complicated but when you're inoculated with a vaccine or when you're naturally infected with a virus it's not just that you make antibodies you induce immunological memory so you have memory b cells the kind of cells that make antibodies or memory t cells and so they're sort of like the base of the iceberg with the antibodies being the tip of the iceberg do they matter they do matter especially for longer incubation period diseases so for really short incubation period diseases like rotavirus meaning the time from when you're infected to when you get sick rotavirus influenza respiratory systems of virus those have short incubation bureaus this is sort of a medium length incubation it's about six seven days measles is much longer sort of 10 to 14 days for longer incubation period diseases there's enough time then for activation and differentiation of memory cells to become in the case of b cells antibody secreting cells so it still would work i think that's where we're going to be here so i think memory is important so when people talk to me about how nervous they are that antibodies are fading i'm not sure you should be nervous about it yet let's wait to see what happens as we move forward with these vaccines yeah i think that's a great point paul and i think there's really two points you made there that speak to that the first is it's not antibodies that probably matter it's neutralizing antibodies and frankly we don't have commercial tests for that so i don't know how much it matters that your serology test that's measuring igg and igm levels over time is changing when that's not actually or certainly not necessarily the thing that we care about we care about neutralizing antibodies not antibodies your second point is just spot on which is unless somebody is sampling bone marrow looking for b cells that have memory again maybe this doesn't matter and we at least if there's one upside to having the long incubation period which has allowed this silly virus to replicate like crazy and spread around the world at least it's that the immune system gets some chance to rev up against it i guess i always think of it that way like biology usually takes something and gives something right it's like if this thing had no time between when you were infected and when you got sick you'd probably get sicker because you wouldn't have any of that memory response but at least it would have been contained or sort of have the opposite problem that's a glass half-full way to look at this i suppose let me go for one thing just as hopeful because as you get older you get sort of grimmer but i'm trying to offer some hopeful thing but it appears that especially in men there were two papers in science that showed that when you're infected with this virus cov2 that you can actually make antibodies directed against interferon which is a protein that your body the immune system makes to help fight viruses that's where the name comes from it interferes with the ability of virus to infect cells and the thinking is that that may be one reason why men are more likely to suffer and die from this disease than others this offers hope for the fact that a vaccine may be better than natural infection because it's unlikely that the vaccine would do that there certainly are examples of vaccines that are better than natural infection this may be one of them there's some reasons for hope here do you see any differences in male versus female on vaccine or do you think no i mean there's nothing that has been published to date that has suggested a gender disparity between this no as a general men tend to die and boys tend to die at a greater frequency than girls for most infectious disease we are the weaker sex or as murphy brown used to say that silly little y chromosome do you think that's a response to a greater cytokine response or what do you think accounts for that difference i'm not sure even when we age match and we match for morbidity we don't know why we're the weaker sex let's admit it bit off topic blood type there was a lot of talk earlier about anti-a antibodies potentially being a little bit protective do we have more data on that i hadn't seen it so you know that having typo blood would be some level protective because you can make antibodies a or b types i think i would still put that in the hypothesis unproven category okay do we have any data on the robustness of the immunologic response at least based on phase two metrics in different demographics starting with young versus old obese versus non-obese or some other metric where it's going to matter because at some level there's going to need to be some rationing of this right it's not like vaccine gets approved on wednesday and on thursday 300 million copies of the vaccine show up to everybody's doctor so whether we like it or not there's a slow roll and a partition to how this happens what do we know about it in that sense in terms of how people are responding to it and who's most vulnerable and who should be getting it both the national academy of medicine and the advisory committee for immunization practices at the cdc have come up with their first tier group but it's huge the first year group includes healthcare workers it also includes other essential personnel like people who work in mass transportation or grocery stores or pharmacies or work in law enforcement or water purification that includes people over 65 who when they get infected are more likely to die and includes people with certain high risk medical conditions like obesity which is probably 30 percent of the american population and diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease etc if you add that all up it adds up to about 150 million adults which is half the adult population in the united states which are going to require a two dose vaccine which is already 300 million doses and that's not going to happen immediately so how do you partition that i don't know i mean i'm on this commonwealth of pennsylvania group that tries to make decisions like that i'm on our hospital group to try and make decisions like that i think it's going to be a real learning curve that's associated with how this rolls out what are we prepared to do about that is this going to produce social unrest it sounds crazy but have we ever experienced something like this from a healthcare delivery standpoint no i mean this is a virus that's killed 230 000 people so this may be sort of like the end of the movie contagion where people are like breaking down doors trying to get a vaccine where vaccines were the hero of that story i think there is going to have to at some level be a rationing in terms of who gets what and how it's going to be done and i don't know it's really complicated right so moderna is basically the nih pfizer j j astrazeneca and oxford i mean these companies have presumably never been in a situation to have to say here's where this shipment goes to this pharmacy versus that pharmacy or this city versus that city i mean not to dwell too long on a seemingly strange question but we're not that far from when this is going to happen we're only a couple months away from that potentially so it's a department of defense that's going to take the lead at operation warp speed for determining where these vaccines get distributed but they'll be distributed to the states and then the states i think will decide how to sort of apportion that it's my sense of it the cdc initially had sort of four states in one city which was philadelphia actually to try and do kind of this test program for how it would be distributed now pfizer is not an operation warp speed vaccine so they may have a different distribution strategy but i think you're right it's going to be a real challenge plus it's a two dose vaccine plus you it means you have to get people back for the second dose and it's going to some of these vaccines are going to be stored at -70 it's going to be really a challenge to see how we get it out there i mean we had one issue in our house which was easily resolved which was should we mandate the vaccine for hospital workers no one for the practical reason we probably won't have a lot of vaccine and two i think that with the novel vaccine strategy like messenger rna or these replication defective viruses i don't think you really can fairly mandate that i think you really should wait till it's out there a little more there's going to be plenty of people who are going to be perfectly willing to take these vaccines and then we'll have a few million doses out there and we'll have a better sense of things but maurice hilleman who i consider the father of modern vaccines having either done the primary research or development on nine of the 14 that we use said it best he said quote i never breathe a sign of relief until the first three million doses are out there so we'll see personal question would you take the vaccine right now not till i see the data the good news i'm on the fcc vaccine advisory board so i will see the data and if i feel confident that the safety issues look good the issues look good for people my age i mean i'm over 65 i want to feel i'm adequately represented in these trials at a sample size of 30 000 of which let's say a third of them are over 65 with 10 000 people over 65 having no adverse effects in three months make you feel comfortable enough to take it i think it would yes okay and i'm gonna point something else out to the listener who can't see you you at least look to my eye as a very healthy 65 year old you look like you're about 55 you're not overweight i assume you don't have diabetes you look like a model of health so are you really that high risk aside from your age and if so why are you taking it just my age okay so do you still believe that age by itself is enough of a predictor of morbidity beyond the obvious comorbidities that tend to track with age that presumably at least let's just assume you don't have them you're not that i'm asking you to disclose any medical things but you're about as healthy as 65 year old as there's going to be out there i would take it not because i necessarily think i'm going to die from this virus it's because i think that way i feel between taking a vaccine and wearing a mask in social distancing i dramatically decrease having to suffer this virus i mean the virus yes it's a killer and yes it can cause pneumonia which can kill you what scares me the most about this virus is that it can cause vasculitis i mean who would have predicted that it causes this multi-system inflammatory disease of children and it can affect can cause heart attacks it can cause strokes it can cause liver or kidney disease because it causes vasculitis so why does it cause vasculitis it doesn't really enter the bloodstream fewer than one percent of people infected with this virus have so-called virenia so it induces your immune response to damage endothelial cells that line blood vessels and because every organ in your body has a blood supply every organ can be affected i mean the so-called long-haulers at least in part are probably determined by a vasculitis maybe even at low level that's what scares me about this this is not a virus that just gets in kills you and gets out or gets in makes you sick and gets out there are longer-term effects with this virus and it should be taken seriously i mean i think when the administration's occasionally says things like you need to embrace this virus or live with kind of you know this kind of notion that the virus would eliminate itself by population-induced immunity which has never happened for a virus before i think they sort of ignore the fact about the long-term measures of this particular virus this isn't flu i think of all the sort of lingering tail events of this virus the one that probably concerns me the most is some of the cardiomyopathy that we're seeing persist in especially in young people on a personal level i've just had to strike a balance between living my life but still trying not to be reckless and to me that's a really bad outcome right is is the probability that i'm going to die from this low yeah it's staggeringly low but there's some risk that i can't quantify of cardiomyopathy or some lingering respiratory thing that never fully resolves that impairs quality of life i guess the real question is just the trade-off between how efficacious in the real world and therefore i guess effective is the better word do i think this vaccine is relative to what other risks i think what i'm hearing from you that i actually find heartening is at least using history as a guide within a few months of this vaccine coming out and entering the real world which we can think of as phase four we'll think of that as post-market surveillance phase four we're going to have a pretty good sense of it and most of us listening to this podcast are not going to be the guys getting it on day one just due to the simple logistics of it like i'm not going to be in the first million doses of this vaccine you aren't going to be in the first million doses of this vaccine there are people frankly who are at much higher risk that deserve to be there and i guess we'll have a better sense of it but i think that this discussion for me paul is also interesting because it really frames that four different types of strategies that one can go about doing this who the players are and what the risks are potentially in each of them and why maybe a sanofi product ultimately might end up being safer than say a j j product the devils in the details the only thing that's going to matter is hey how do these things look six months after they've been on the market the other thing i wanted to ask you about is is there ever going to be a time when we're going to be immunizing children against this virus i mean what do we know today about kids getting infected by this we know that children are less likely to be infected and when they're infected or less severely infected i mean of the people less than 21 years of age in the united states make up about 26 percent of the population yet they account for 0.08 percent of the deaths that said about 120 at least the last morbidity mortality weekly report showed that about 120 children had died from covet 19. that's not very different than the number of children that died from influenza last year which was around 140 and that's what it usually is around anywhere 140 150 160 in that area so it's no more or less fatal than influenza for children two can cause long-term problems in children with a so-called misc disease of children so i think there is a compelling desire to make a vaccine for children so how to do that now all the trials initially were done in people over 18. so we weren't studying children initially now recently fives have sort of dropped the age to 16 and they've dropped the age to 12 so they're starting to look at younger people so the question is then what happens and this applies broadly what happens if a vaccine is approved through eua pfizer's already said if that happens for them they're going to start to immunize their control group which means now you lose information about safety and efficacy moving forward why is that paul is that basically as a thank you to the control group and basically a crossover look at what that does from a scientific standpoint you just lost your test case but what is the rationale for doing that i think it's a thank you for being and that may have been part of the deal when they signed up for the trial i don't know yeah got it okay to get to the children this could be done in one of two ways it could be done as a placebo-controlled trial it's the same way we do adults work can be done as immunobridging studies meaning that you actually find out there is an immunological correlated protection in adults that it is a certain level of neutralizing antibodies that's evoked and then if you give to children a certain dose that you find that you get that level of neutralizing antibodies and so then you just move forward and then you look retrospectively because not all children will be inoculated at the moment that you start inaugurating children you can see whether or not it's basically the same way that it worked with the ebola vaccine i mean that wasn't a prospective placebo-controlled trial must have people just started getting vaccine and because not everybody got it at once you could get a sense of effectiveness by knowing who got the vaccine and who didn't so that may be it when we had the fda vaccine advisory committee meeting october 22nd the fda was very clear about this that when you approve something under emergency use authorization which is the same sort of permission you would give to an investigational new drug you were really under no ethical obligation to vaccinate a placebo group you aren't and nor are you under ethical obligation to no longer do placebo-controlled trials now i'm not sure how that's going to play out i mean you can see for example if somebody's 70 years old they see that this vaccine works and they win the placebo group they can say i want this vaccine so what the fda has argued for is why not just make it an expanded access issue or extended access which is what used to be called compassionate use access but do it that way and i think that may be the way this plays out i don't think i'm making a bold prediction by saying i think the first vaccines may not be the last best vaccines but you have to know that you have the last best vaccines you have to know that down the line there may be a vaccine that's 90 effective and you can't know that unless you do it as a placebo trial and again if you're going to do it with the other vaccine as a trial the thing that would require a huge trial i mean really oh you'd be hard to prove it you actually wrote an interesting paper this summer about the role of fever in fighting infection in children i was really surprised at the results and i gotta tell you it's kind of changing the way i think about how much tylenol i kick around the house you want to talk a little bit about what that paper showed while we're on the topic of kids right you actually wrote a book called overkill when modern medicine goes too far and that's the first chapter in defense of fever that treating fever can prolong or worsen illnesses and the reason is is that pretty much everything that walks crawls flies or swims on the planet can make fever why do we do that we do it because our immune system actually works better at a higher temperature it's not because viruses or bacteria die more quickly at a higher temperature it's because your immune system works better b cells make antibodies more efficiently neutrophils or white blood cells that form pus can travel to areas where bacteria are and kill bacteria more efficiently so if that's true if your immune system works better at a higher temperature then are there studies done showing that people who are given anti-fever medicines like tylenol or ibuprofen do they do worse and the answer is redundantly yes and in the world of vaccines when people choose to treat fever with anti-fever medicines when they've gotten a vaccine you have a lesser immune response i mean over and over again this has been shown yet we just can't help ourselves because we want people to feel better or we want ourselves to feel better but know this that you are hurting one part of your immune system when you do that is there a danger at some point paul of kids having fevers when the temperatures get too high i mean i always feel like that's the one thing that scared the hell out of medical students or residents was you'd see those kids with febrile seizures and so you have that image in the back of your mind of that kid in the er that's seizing and then god forbid they go on to have some neurologic consequence and so you're sort of hardwired to think well god forbid i'm ever gonna let a child have a fever again what's the risk of that and at what temperature is that something that a parent needs to be aware of so so-called febrile seizures are benign i mean my daughter actually had a febrile seizure they're generally short-lived they don't have long lists of sequelae and it's not the height of the temperature it's the rapid rise in temperature that causes that so it's not heightened but for the most part i'm gonna say most i think physiological fevers don't cause harm your body is not interested in hurting you in that way now environmental fevers can heat stroke i mean labor or the athlete or the soldier who's out there in heavy gear and on a hot day and is not able to dissipate heat through sweating they can suffer strokes i mean it's you know you can die from heat strokes in fact so about 600 people die from heat strokes every year so environmental fevers can do that but not physiological fevers so again i think you jump in notes it's very hard to watch this a case action or hospital the boy the soccer player was hit on the hip he had a clot in a vein so-called thrombosis and then had that got infected so-called thrombophlebitis would staff the sort of hard to treat staff travel to his brain and cause absences that travel to his lungs and cause absoluties he grabbed his bone and joined cause opposites we were treating with an antibiotic bank of mice that should have treated that but he was continually positive had pot blood cultures that continued to sow he was shedding bacteria and every day every two hours we were rotating you know either tylenol or ibuprofen finally i met with the boy i met with the parents i met with the nurse and i said stop treating his fever just give his body a chance to have every part of his immune system working for him and then within really about a day and a half there's no longer shedding bacteria that may have been complete coincidence it's not a proof in any sense but you couldn't convince the parents of that they thought we were geniuses by doing that that way give this immune system a chance to work as good as it can why his neutrophil's ability to ingest and kill bacteria by giving him anti-fever medicines we think we're helping is there any scenario then paul in which i mean that's a pretty compelling case is there any scenario under which you would recommend taking something like tylenol i think if somebody cannot handle the metabolic strain of increase of that i mean because you increase your basal metabolic rate a certain percentage for every degree centigrade increase in your fever it's like 12 increase in bmi for every degree centigrade but so if you have chronic lung disease chronic heart disease a metabolic disease that makes you unable to handle that rise in temperature sure i think that's a reason but otherwise no wow so suffer it out huh yeah that's that boy i love this boy he was a teenager a young teenager and he he was just brave he was okay fine everybody was in we were going to do this thing and nurses were in we were going to ride it out and then he did better all right last thing i want to say on vaccines just to kind of close the loop on this are there viruses besides the obvious like hiv and even hep c i guess where just vaccinating them is either impossible or outright dangerous i mean there was something about rsv which we've talked a little bit about that i mean rsv is really common but there's no vaccine to rsv is that just that it's not cost effective or was there sort of a more technical issue with it or a risk associated with creating vaccine towards it the more technical issue of creating a vaccine there were two events that occurred in the 1960s one was with rsv where bob channick head of the laboratory of infectious diseases at nih wanted to make an rsv vaccine this is a virus that causes pneumonia it causes about 5000 deaths every year in the united states primarily in young children especially premature children babies so let's make an rsvp vaccine he took the virus screw it up and activated it with formaldehyde to the same way that jonathan made his polio vaccine and then gave it to babies and what he found was the children who got that vaccine did worse they were more likely when they were then exposed to the natural virus they were more likely to develop pneumonia more likely to be hospitalized in the case of two children more likely to die than children who never got that vaccine same thing happened with the measles vaccine in 1963. take the virus grow it up kill it with purify kill with formaldehyde that too caused children to have an aberrant immune response directed against that measles virus that caused this atypical pneumonia so they were more likely to get pneumonia than children who were never vaccinated that was ultimately taken off the market the reason that may be relevant to today to source cov2 today is that both of those virus viruses respiratory synthetic virus and measles have a fusion protein that's how it attaches to cells it fuses the cells so dosar scoby2 that's a fusion protein so people are always a little nervous about an inactivated vaccine and it's because you sort of changed the confirmation of that protein that saurus cov2 protein so it didn't really look like it looked on the natural virus so that's always in the back of people's minds with fusion proteins so you asked me earlier what sort of safety things i'm worried about that actually is one of the safety things and that would be more of a concern i'm guessing with the life attenuated virus as opposed to the other three classes or would you still worry about that in the mrna and the viral vector viruses i worry about it with all of them you're worried that the confirmation as made in under these conditions mrna or dna or replication defective or whole kill virus or recombinant dna generated proteins that it's different it's critically different than the way it sits on the virus surface paul this is a unbelievably fascinating discussion i'm glad i waited on this you and i were going to speak a couple of months ago obviously for so long i've wanted to have a deep dive on the vaccine stuff but i feel like this was the right time to do it at least to be able to speak about it with more clarity and to really be able to say look by the time someone's hearing this we're really on the cusp of these vaccines being out there in early 21 but it's not a switch it's not a binary thing it's not like we're going from no vaccines to everybody gets vaccines and there's perfect information and there's no risk this is analog in delivery analog in risk i mean it's analog in pretty much everything other than approval yeah i think we're going to learn a lot thanks for asking me i enjoy this really i don't think i've ever done a podcast this long but it was definitely fine and in fact i thought you said two hours i thought oh my god two hours i'm going to live through this it really flew i you know just
