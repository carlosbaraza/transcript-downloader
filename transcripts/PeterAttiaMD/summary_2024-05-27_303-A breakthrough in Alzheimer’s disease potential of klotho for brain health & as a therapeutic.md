Dena Dubal is a physician-scientist and professor of neurology at UCSF whose work focuses on mechanisms of longevity and brain resilience. In this episode, Dena delves into the intricacies of the longevity factor klotho: its formation and distribution in the body, the factors such as stress and exercise that impact its levels, and its profound impact on cognitive function and overall brain health. Dena shares insights from exciting research in animal models showing the potential of klotho in treating neurodegenerative diseases as well as its broader implications for organ health and disease prevention. She concludes with an optimistic outlook for future research in humans and the potential of klotho for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.

Disclosure: Peter is an investor in Jocasta Neuroscience, a company working to develop klotho as a therapy for people with Alzheimer’s disease.

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the episode:

**1. Executive Summary**:
This episode features a groundbreaking discussion with Dr. Dena Dubal about Klotho, a protein that shows remarkable potential for enhancing cognitive function and protecting against neurodegenerative diseases. The conversation covers the discovery of Klotho, its mechanisms of action, and its potential therapeutic applications, particularly in Alzheimer's disease. The research spans from mouse models to non-human primates, with compelling human genetic data suggesting Klotho's protective effects against cognitive decline.

**2. Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Klotho was discovered accidentally in 1997 by Makoto Kuro-o during hypertension research [00:07:19]
- Overexpression of Klotho extends lifespan by 30% in mice [00:09:08]
- Klotho levels decline with age, with people having about 1/6th the levels in adulthood compared to birth [00:14:40]
- KL-VS variant (heterozygous) increases Klotho levels by 15-20% and is associated with better cognition [00:48:20]
- Klotho doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier but works through peripheral mechanisms [00:41:09]

**3. Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Exercise increases Klotho levels by approximately 30% [00:20:56]
- Morning fasting blood draws are optimal for measuring Klotho levels [02:16:57]

**4. Supplements & Medications**:
- No specific supplements were discussed
- Potential future Klotho-based therapeutics mentioned [01:09:53]

**5. Exercise & Movement**:
- Regular exercise increases Klotho levels by about 30% after 12 weeks [00:20:56]
- Acute exercise can temporarily double Klotho levels in mice [00:22:50]

**6. Nutrition & Diet**:
- Fasting may affect Klotho levels, though specific recommendations weren't made [02:16:57]

**7. Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Klotho levels show circadian variation, highest in morning [00:14:40]
- Normal Klotho levels around 800 pg/mL in adults [01:49:17]
- Levels below 666 pg/mL associated with 30% higher mortality over 5 years [02:06:03]

**8. References & Resources**:
- ENHANCE study (2022) showing Klotho's correlation with mortality [02:06:03]
- Multiple studies on KL-VS variant and cognitive protection [01:54:22]

**9. Notable Quotes**:
"Wouldn't it be amazing if we had a cocktail for Alzheimer's disease... adding something like Klotho that can really help shore up the functions of the cells?" [00:00:00]

**10. Follow-up Questions**:
- How does Klotho interact with other longevity pathways?
- What is the optimal therapeutic window for Klotho administration?
- How can Klotho testing be standardized across laboratories?
- What role might Klotho play in other age-related diseases?
