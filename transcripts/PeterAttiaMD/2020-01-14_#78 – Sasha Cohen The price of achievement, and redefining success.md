## Description

Original release date: 11/4/19

In this episode, Sasha Cohen, former US Olympic figure skater, discusses the most challenging things about life as an Olympian—the unfathomable pressures, enormous expectations, years of sacrifice, and your entire life’s work culminating in just a few minutes on the world stage which, once over, leads to a loss of identity resulting in many former Olympians suffering with depression. We begin by talking about everything that led up to her unforgettable moment from the 2006 Olympics, and how she handled herself so beautifully in the face of disaster. Most importantly, we talk about post-skating life when she shares many insights such as the downside of constantly striving for a moment, the hollowness of achievement, and the importance of redefining our definition of success.

We discuss:
-Sasha’s mindset going into the 2006 Olympics as the favorite [6:30];
-Figure skating basics, scoring, short program vs. long program, etc. [13:40];
-Sasha’s unforgettable performance at the 2006 Olympics [18:10];
-Win, lose, or draw, why many Olympians suffer from a loss of identity [32:30];

-The tiny window of opportunity for Olympians, and the overwhelming pressure to meet expectations [49:30];
-Sasha’s unique childhood, finding figure skating, and channeling her hyperactive personality into becoming an amazing skater [1:01:30];
-The consequences of extreme training at a young age, and trying to control the uncontrollable [1:10:00];
-What is driving extreme athletes and Olympians to be the best? [1:18:30];
-Why many former Olympians and athletes struggle with depression [1:25:00];
-Refining success—How Sasha overcame her own loss of identity [1:32:30];

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic

[00:01:04] I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming

[00:01:23] I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our show's members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:28] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription

[00:04:11] I guess this week is sasha Cohen for those of you who may not recognize her name she's an American figure skating legend in fact the last female I believe to win a medal in figure skating she was a silver medalist in the 2006 Olympics and I don't waste any time in this episode going straight to that moment because on some levels it is one of the most remarkable parts of her story frankly and I don't want to sort of spoil the story but needless to say if you only watch one video from all of the videos or anything we talked about in this talk that's the one you want to see and and I actually frankly this might be one of those times where I recommend you before you even listen to the podcast you go to the video of the Final Four the long program in the 2006 Olympics and you watch this six minute video seven minute video whatever it is obviously it's linked to in the show notes but for those of you who aren't subscribers and don't get the show notes I still want you to be able to go see this video because that's exactly where I go to at the outset of this discussion we then work our way a little bit backwards and talk about her life growing up and how she was able to channel and focus all of her insecurities into becoming such a great skater but much more importantly we talk about this life post skating for her and

[00:05:29] I think in many ways sasha is kind of a remarkable example of how a person can remake themselves from being completely focused on one thing and having their entire identity tied up in one thing and moving past it and and again I think what comes across here is the just maturity and wisdom of a person who is remarkably adept at understanding the hollowness the shallowness of achievements for me certainly this is something that just really resonated to be to be able to hear her talk about this so even though again we're talking to you know a former world champion

[00:06:04] Olympian superstar there's a lot in this episode for normal people like us who aren't that way and again we explore the depths of depression you know we talk about the statistics of how many Olympians don't want to suffer a depression and I talked about her involvement in a project that's meant to bring a lot of awareness to this we talked about a lot of other things as well so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with sasha Cohen sascha thanks so much for coming over thank you for having me I'm really excited for this there's so much I want to talk with you about and this as I was saying even before interviewing somebody you get to know a lot more about them than you may have known before it sort of accelerates your learning about a person in the weeks leading up to the interview and if you're sort of doing your homework which you obviously want to be doing you're learning so much more and I think I forgot you know 2006 is a long time ago on some levels it doesn't seem like that's that well it's like guys 2006 like that but but you realize well that's 13 years ago and to go back and watch the footage of the Olympics I sort of forgot a few things because I sort of remember watching that at the time I mean as every Olympic athlete knows that's the time when the rest of the country completely stops what they're doing to focus on sports that aren't football basketball baseball hockey but I was really blown away by what has to be one of the more challenging and yet remarkable achievements of your athletic career and

[00:07:38] I say that because it's a small footnote to what I think will be the broader arc of your life which we'll talk about but I want to for a moment go right there and then back up and give people some context about the sport of figure skating but take us to the 2006 Olympics you were favored what was the expectation for you after being a 17 year old almost making the podium I think you were fourth in 2002 correct okay it was my second games and I was one of the favorites going in there was strong competitors also from Japan and from Russia and it's a moment in your life where it's rare as a figure skater gymnast or in certain sports to to go to one Olympics let alone two and so you know that most likely this will be your last games and figure skating the ladies competition is at the very very end of the Olympics and so the whole two weeks before I mean almost everyone is gone the Olympic Village is turned into just a party scene and so sodom and gomorrah exactly so generally the the figure skaters are not staying in the village we're isolated perhaps we're missing opening ceremonies to really focus in and hone on this one moment that we've spent our whole life basically since since we were toddlers training for it was difficult because six months before I was flying high I was in the best physical shape mental shape I was very very strong and then over that winter I had a series of injuries equipment problems and it was really tough because I was going into the Olympics not feeling prepared and

[00:09:20] I've said that it feels like you have to walk a pirates plank and you know that you kind of have to just jump into the sharks and you don't feel prepared or equipped to handle it but but the show must go on and you have to keep putting one foot in front of the other so that was kind of the mental state that I was in even if you're in the best shape of your life it's still the enormity of the games and this these few minutes you have to fulfill a lifelong dream is just immense pressure now is that different from the pressure you feel in 2002 when nobody knows you and it's amazing that you're there I mean how much of what you just said is not just the fact that you're going to the Olympics but that you're going to UM because as a favorite

[00:10:03] I think definitely going in as a favorite you just so a seventeen year old brain and a twenty-one year old brain are a little bit different and my first Olympics was actually my first huge international competition I'd never been to a World Championship so I was thrilled to make the team I was competing on my home soil in in Utah in

[00:10:24] Salt Lake City and I went to opening ceremonies and I was just like a kid in a candy shop and it was just incredible how Salt Lake was transformed so it was pretty magical and of course I was nervous in these moments but the spotlight was really on on these favorites and that we're duking it out and I was disappointed that I you know was close to a medal but didn't medal in

[00:10:47] Salt Lake but really when it came to Italy I felt in 2006 I felt all eyes were on me and this is this is the moment that I've been waiting for to redeem myself from four years back and I'm not at my best I'm not ready as an athlete you're generally home-schooled and you're analyzing videos and you're training and you're spending your whole life planning like four years out and so you're always analyzing every little thing you might have done wrong or how you could do something better and I couldn't help thinking like how am I here about to compete in the Olympics and I'm not prepared what did I do wrong and I think it's something that I've learned a lot about myself since then is that we can't control everything and as athletes we think we can that we can control and prevent any injury that might arise or any equipment problems and and it's very hard to admit to yourself that you can't control everything because that's what you've spent your whole life trying to do that's what's up to you does anybody else in your really inner circle and I'm guessing at this point your mom and your coach are probably the two closest people to you when it comes to what you could be feeling is that a fair statement yes mainly my mom you know she was the one that that came with me all my competitions took me to the rink and physical therapy and off ice since I was 7 years old so we really bonded and she was she was probably the only one I was super vulnerable to to the outside world it was I'm fine

[00:12:15] I've been training I'm prepared you don't want to admit weakness it's like everyone's a shark and they can smell blood and so you're always putting on this brave face and and it's kind of a fake it till you make it because if you show fear you give others confidence and you undermine yourself when did the Olympic Trials take place for Figure Skating they're usually in mid early to mid January and then the

[00:12:37] Olympics are kind of the middle like kind of early to the end of its very close to the Olympic Games about a month so how did you do in the trials I mean I don't mean how did you do in terms of what was your position obviously we know you made it the Olympic team but how did you feel at the trials and what did that do to your confidence I was going in with the flu and I had a high fever so I had missed a week of training going in and so I was pretty weak and frail but I managed to to skate well I won that national championship but it wasn't this really strong at my height showing and and then after that it proceeded not to get better but to get worse in my training at home with other injuries going into into the games where I was in physical therapy every day and had iontophoresis on my my inner thighs and and it was just is a tough place to be because you want to train harder but then you push yourself and you become more injured and you set yourself back and so it's just this this delicate balance of trying to navigate so let's explain to folks how this program works most people sort of know there were a couple of different skates there's a short and a long the long as sometimes referred to as the free skate as well what are the parameters involved the short program is usually 2 minutes and 50 seconds there's three jumping passes there's a footwork sequence a spiral sequence and three spins and and the long program is a little over four minutes for ten and it the rules keep changing but at the time that I was competing I think you're allowed eight jumping passes and you could do jumps in combination as well as requirements of three to four spins and then a footwork sequence and a spiral sequence as well but there's more flexibility in terms of if you do a combination or you don't do a combination and and it's all about trying at the time that I was competing to aggregate more and more points at the end of a short program so there are how many judges you're testing my memory now so different competitions vary but I believe it's usually nine and there's a backup judge got it and it's like some it's it up to six points is that the most it used to be a 6.0 system that shifted in the early early 2000s and by the time that I was competing no one really knew what their score meant until they compared it to someone else's score because every competition would have new highs and and it was it was all relative but it was there was no cap to how high you could go and so you didn't know if your score was the best score until you compared it to others got it at the end of the short program which I assume is sort of done in reverse order of favorites such that the which we don't get a sense of when you're watching this on TV because you're not actually watching every single person there but how many women would have skated in the short program for example they eliminate after the short program so I believe it could have been up to 30 people in the short program but it's a random draw for the short program only the long program is done based on results in the short program and in groups of six so it's not a complete reverse of order but it's in six and you draw and then after the short program I think the people like the last six places are eliminated so then when you go into the long program like 24 skaters and this is this is rough approximation so it is still amazing we'll come back to this in more detail but it's sort of hard for mere mortals like me to even understand what it means to make an Olympic team or in a time sport to even make an Olympic standard you know there are some countries in the u.s. we take this for granted but there are many countries where you don't even have to you just have to make the Olympic standard and you get to go like there are so few athletes that could even do that in a given event like you know a running event for example it is sort of hard to believe that all of the athletes in the world are winnowed down to 2024 30 whatever it is and then away you go so going into this would you say your strength was more on the short program in the long program or how did these differ I mean the difference in duration must obviously pose a different physiologic stress what are the other differences between them from the standpoint of the athlete either be mentally or physiological II I think the short program the margin for error is is zero there's fewer elements and so if you make one mistake you really drop in the ranks and if you make two it's just you're you can put yourself out of the running for a medal and the long program it's definitely more for some people it can be more mental it's longer there's more elements but there's more of an opportunity to take risk to try harder elements and different athletes tend to favor different formats I tended to like the short program format more it was more condensed more fiery and I think it's just very different depending on what kind of athlete you are like you're saying there's more endurance and play in the long program mentally and physically and there's also a finality to it whereas in gymnastics events are usually standalone in figure skating the short and long program are combined so you're setting the stage with a short program but it's by no means final and it's not weighted as heavily as the long program is weighted for some people they see it as more pressure because you can't make a mistake and in some ways it's less pressure because it doesn't count for as much as the long and it's just it's everyone kind of getting initiated and seeing where you rank you were first coming out of the short program in 2006 how did you feel I mean you're probably your own harshest critic how did you judge your performance in that short program it certainly wasn't my strongest short program that I had done but considering the level of preparation that I had going in and and meant in my mental confidence I was I was thrilled with it because I hadn't done a clean and clean means making no mistakes I hadn't done a clean short program in weeks I had struggled to even do full run-throughs because I was nursing injuries and just really struggling so I think I skated towards the end if not last after my competitors had skated good programs and there's this immensity that you feel in the air and and knowing that this moment has arrived and you're not ready and so when I went out there and ended up landing my three different jumping passes and making it to the end

[00:19:17] I was just exude Hrant and thrilled and relieved and then when I saw my name on the leaderboard and I was in the first place I couldn't believe it it was a thrill and it's a temporary victory right so you have one day off and then you're back to a long program but in that moment I was I was triumphant so how did you spend that day between the short and long program I had actually strained my my leg during my performance and so I had decided to take the day in between off in order to be fresher and to not continue to exasperate the injury in between the short and long programs which really confuse everyone because no one skips to practice you get 40 minutes a day and people are used to training for hours at home so people just jump all over that time oh I never even thought of that so of course you now have whatever the 2024 skaters that now have one day to get ready for the long program and you're not going to put them all on the ice at the same time so everybody gets their forty minute block yeah and you're not showing up for yours I'm not showing up for mine and that certainly confused people the idea was that your decision or your coach's decision I think it was a joint decision the physical therapist was coming to see me a few times a day it seemed like a good decision again I think you always second-guess everything in hindsight but considering where I was and how injured I was at the time it did seem like the best decision because at a certain point you've done everything so many times that it's how you feel physically which really informs how you feel mentally in the moment that you step out to perform you stepped onto the ice now for the long program you know

[00:21:04] I've watched that video many times it's hard because when you're watching it now on video knowing the outcome it's different than watching it live and truthfully I can't tell you that I see in your face any reduction in confidence I can say I do because that's the narrative I'd place over it what do you see when you go and watch yourself first of all do you go back and watch that it took me a very long time to watch it I believe I believe it took me a few years before I ever watched it I was in an acting program and one of my classmates found out that I was a skater and watched my performance and it was so dramatic and it's so great and and like we should watch it together I'm like I'm not watching it with you so he finally convinced me to watch it with him but even though I didn't do the the warm-up the longer 40 minute warm-up there's a five or six minute warm up before you skate and during that warm-up I fell on jumps that I usually don't fall in and I fell on a triple flip in the war and I fell on a triple lutz and it just

[00:22:07] I think it really shook me figure skating is a sport where you're jumping and if you hesitate for a millisecond you throw off the whole timing of a jump and going into that program I knew wow I just fell on things I don't normally fall on in my warmup and now I'm going out and this is it everything that I've prepared for this is my second chance this is my this is my moment and I don't know what's gonna happen and

[00:22:35] I'm not as prepared as I want to be but again you can't admit any of this to yourself it's all gets buried and compacted deep within you and so you go out and you you just try to stay in the moment so it getting ready it'd be just all you need to do right now is put on makeup all you need to do is put on your pants all I need to do is get on the bus you know all you need to do is jog around the arena and and keep it simple because the the enormity of the expectation and everything you need to do and the crowds sharing can really unravel you and so I think that's a training and a skill set that you develop over years of competing and and when I went out and when I started it was a surprise to me when I fell on my first my first jump and you partially register it and I partially register just this kind of hush from the arena this was the first one the triple lutz the first one was the triple lutz combination that I think explained for folks who haven't bought figures getting much I don't know that I could I know I could recognize the lots I don't know how like this would describe it so you're skating usually taking most of the rink to prepare and gaining speed skating backwards and people jump both ways but for me I would be skating on backwards on my left foot on my outside edge and with my right foot in the air and then my right foot would reach behind me and tap kind of like a pole vault and then I would begin I would jump and begin to rotate counterclockwise it's considered one of the harder triple jumps and the triple axel is the hardest we'll come back to the triple axel because I don't think a woman has ever landed a quad axel has has that ever been done yet I don't think a man is ever like I thought has landed a quad so maybe I'm thinking a man's done a triple but a woman's not done a triple

[00:24:22] Midori Ito done a triple axel and then I think in the team competition mariah Naga su has done a triple axel but I believe that was not in this lady on the single okay got it but you're saying it's possible a man has never landed a quad axel either then I don't know why I thought not that I know of they they do all the other Elvis

[00:24:40] Stojko had done a quad but maybe he's done a quad but not a quad axel that would be four and a half yeah turns want to come back do all of that because you know growing up in Canada figure skating is you know along with hockey it is a sport we paid a lot of attention to growing up and there were some great

[00:24:56] Canadian figure skaters icons just to put this in context like I'm still struggling to understand how one trains for this because I can't imagine like you go to a practice and you would do that whole four-minute 10-second rule by itself right I mean wouldn't you practice by breaking that down into short segments and doing those and working on the transitions as opposed to just going through the whole thing you would do both there would be a lot of emphasis placed on the whole run-through and then mocking competition conditions so that might mean you go and do if I have a normal you get off the ice at home and you wait and then you go out and no one else on the ice and you have to go someone's presses play for you versus getting to restart or skating with everyone else and taking 30 minutes to warm up and then you'll also just repeatedly train segments and sometimes it could be the beginning in the end or maybe just at the beginning three times in a row to work on cardio and stamina and so you're you're trying to train yourself mentally you're trying to train physically so that stamina isn't an issue when you're at the end and everyone's a little different and that's

[00:26:04] I think the thing that was always so tough for me is there's no there was no formula and with some people more was better and for for other people more means you break and then you ultimately set yourself back and so it it was always this tough push-pull of am I being lazy or am I being smart and sometimes that you know the person and something inside it was just like I'm not sure but I have to do this again and again again and then you end up injured and then you feel like an idiot cuz now you have to take a week off but that was that was a very hard balance for me because I I did get injured easily one of the things that has always amazed me about figure skating and again your fall in that triple lutz at the outset of the long program was yet another remarkable example of it to me is the ability that the skater has to immediately resume the choreography as though nothing happened and that amazes me for two reasons the first is physically anthropometric lee meaning where you are in space can't be predicted by a fall so it's one thing to go through a series of movements and do them perfectly every time and therefore know exactly where you're going to be that next moment it's quite another thing when you fall and you're never gonna fall exactly the same way twice so every time you fall you're gonna land in a different position slightly or roll into a different position and yet you have to be able to go from a first time being in a given position to right back into it so that has always amazed me the second thing that's amazed me amazes me actually a lot more which is the sort of courage to be able to stand up when at that level of fall of that nature almost guarantees you can't win right I mean sure you know as we'll see in your case you didn't miss by much a gold despite that fall but who has the processing speed internally to do the math and go well technically I could still you know be perfect the rest of this I mean in the end it's just so crushing to your confidence in that moment and yet it's that ability to to stand up and go again that I I find more moving I think frankly than any aspect of the sport and it's different from other sports even individual sports where it's crushed like tennis you know you're out there all alone you're you know there's no one to hide behind but you make the worst play in the world the most your damage is capped it is finite loss it is it is not finite loss in a sport like figure skating when you make a mistake it can be catastrophic and you can lose the entire company especially if you can't get up and get back into the zone so is there anything going on in your head consciously as all that's happening or is it that in practice every time you fall the practice is getting up and going right back into it as opposed to falling thinking about why you fell reflecting on it and reap RAC tusen it if that makes sense practice is certainly a component of it and my coach always taught me you don't fall you bounce so as soon as you hit the ice you're up not only do you have to find physically where you go in space but musically it has to match and a lot of times when you fall especially if you're sliding or you hit the board all of a sudden you're late and you're trying to make up time because you know on the next musical indication you're supposed to be halfway across the ice and you're still trying to get yourself up so so there's certainly that element but I think it's a combination of things first of all there's so much going on that you don't have time to sulk in it to to let it hit you the what the implications of that fall you you have to block that as fast as you can because like the firing is continuing for me it was like I felt myself hit the ice

[00:30:02] I heard the audience just go and and that it's not always your own disappointment and something I've always struggled with is not wanting to disappoint others and so now I have a stadium full of people that are just audibly groaning and disappointed and and you have to keep going on and it's it's kind of being in this embarrassing catastrophic nightmare where you can't hide it's like it's like someone's ripped off your clothes but you can't run off and hide you have to hold your chin up and keep going and pretend like you're fine and then I go into the next jump the triple flip I didn't quite fall but I had a very severe step out and then I came in both your hands hit the yes yeah it was pretty much as close to the fall as you watching the video again

[00:30:49] I've watched it now so much in the proceeding you know a few weeks but I forgot I mean it's like amazing you don't break your wrist sometimes the way you would put your arms down and you're not the only skater I've seen do that but that's that's a hard hit I don't even know I don't know what to ascribe it to other than you know I generally have loose ligaments I've fall all the time and people look like how did you not tear your ACL and everything I would break my wrists if I fell into the position you did but again for the person who's anybody at this point who's listening to this is gonna go back and watch this video and it will do more justice to what I'm trying to do articulate but again that it hadn't even started I mean the music you chose for that piece which

[00:31:31] I'd like to talk about all elements of this we're focusing on sort of the most challenging parts of this but in terms of like the music and the actual choreography and the the performance is I don't think I'm alone in saying it's certainly one of the more beautiful performances in all of women's figure skating and yet it hadn't even really started your sort of one-two punch and if I was amazed the first time that you got up that says nothing about what it felt like to watch you get up the second time it's like how is she doing this I think you get very good at denial as an athlete and at blocking things out because they would be too much to take so if you actually process what's happening and where you are in space and time because you don't understand going into this I saw the Olympics as this just huge looming like the Sun like the horizon it had any but I couldn't imagine anything beyond it and it's the same way that we know that we one day will die but we can't imagine that actually taking place and what's beyond it and that's the same way I couldn't imagine March of 2006 yeah I know it's gonna come but I don't understand that let me pause for a moment then and ask you a question which I'm gonna ask you to try to answer through the lens of

[00:32:44] February 2006 because you've heard all these surveys and questions where you know you walk into the Olympic Village and you ask all of the Olympians they're like would you be willing to be dead in ten years if it could guarantee you a gold medal at these games and I don't remember the numbers but the the numbers suggest that the answer that question is yes in a staggeringly high amount which

[00:33:04] I think speaks to look if you can't even picture March 2006 what the hell would March 2016 even mean do you understand her can you relate to that ethos of like you would die in ten years to have been the best in the world undisputed on that day it was never posed to me as as making that type of trade I think now I can't imagine it but you know who knows at the time but it just it was everything it was an identity it was your chance to prove yourself to the world it was everything that you were and so everything was riding on it it was just so absolute and failing was the worst thing and the sad thing is and a sport like like figure skating if you're a metal contender failing is getting second very few people will say Oh congratulations you you have an Olympic medal it's more that you lost the gold you just don't know what to do with yourself you have your own disappointment you have the disappointment of everyone around you

[00:34:06] Team USA fans your family and the people that flew out and it's it is kind of sad in hindsight to see just the the nature of the interviews that you know I had a string of interviews right after I competed and it was just like you know your dreams are kind of dashed and and you you felt why it's like how could you do this like how devastated are you and that that's what it's all about and reinforcing and I think when you grow up in this bubble and your whole identity is as an athlete and as a figure skater and all you want to do is prove to yourself and the world that you're good enough but good enough means first and that's a very hard game to play and I think it's not something that you can fully realize at the time you know as a teenager or as a 21 year old and I think it's something that takes years to take deconstruct after and something that

[00:35:01] I've always found so interesting is I've I'm an overly analytical person and I thought oh if I had just skated perfectly on that day and if I had if I had won then there would be nothing to resolve there would be no searching and what I found is even fellow athletes like Apollo know or Michael Phelps who have won multiple Olympic gold medals and are heroes and icon still struggle because I think so much of what we hear our lives and performance for is for a moment and even if you win in that moment that moment passes and then you still need something new to define you to prove that you're still good enough because now you're just last year's or last Olympics and then you constantly need a vehicle to prove yourself that's such a great example I mean as you know I'm really close friends with Apollo I should be seeing him next week when I play patty cakes together but you know swimming is a sport I love right and it's a sport that from the standpoint of following it and knowing the metrics there are a few people who could rattle off more swimming statistics than me so I followed Michael Phelps from 2000 actually you know even before most people knew who he was when he was just a kid who made the Olympic team and managed to get fifth in the 200 fly which was a huge deal in Sydney and I was kind of amazed last month when his world records in the 200 fly and the 100 fly fell so at the World Championships this year in 2019 I was amazed at how people were writing about him as though it weren't that impressive what he had done and I mean I'm reading these things and I'm like these people have lost their mind like they have no idea what he has accomplished in the water and yeah these two incredible swimmers have come along and broken world records in one case he's held for 18 years and it might even be the case now I haven't checked in a while it might be the case that the only world record Phelps still holds is in the 400 I am from Beijing but the point is as someone who doesn't know Michael but just has always been a fan and knows I can tell you his place and time in every race he's ever done

[00:37:05] I'm amazed at how quickly he his greatness is also fading in the memory of the average person right like we will likely never see an Olympian like that again ever ever ever ever in another hundred years and yet only three years after his last Olympics yeah he's sort of yesterday's news which I think speaks to this point you're making which is maybe the brighter that star is the longer it takes to fade but every one of these things fades it's interesting what you're saying it's it's almost like you're suggesting that you went through a period of time thinking if only I had one things would have been different but it seems that you don't really buy that rhetoric regardless you lose an identity so win lose or draw so much is signified and held within a gold medal and being number one this absolute this peak it symbolizes that you didn't leave anything on the table it symbolizes no regrets it symbolizes that you accomplished what you set out for and and the world recognizes you as the victor and all of a sudden silver just brings up all these questions like what went wrong was it you was someone better than you how are you gonna live with that it just there's another element to it but but regardless when you decide to retire or if an injury forces you to retire you still lose the identity and I think that is what they're so challenging for so many

[00:38:39] Olympians because you have sacrificed everything homeschooled you have no balance you generally don't have many other outside interests and if you do they're certainly not developed few friendships and and it's just this one thing and so even if you win and then all of a sudden that identity is taken from you it's like I'm a figure skater that's who I am that's how everyone sees me but once you stop figure skating then who are you and as you know someone in my mid-twenties trying to figure out who that was was very difficult because I didn't develop other interests or hobbies in in middle school in high school I didn't develop close friendships I didn't go to college at the age of eighteen so you're kind of left on your own somewhat isolated and Olympians aren't really sharing this when they retired because I think they're kind of with their their in their own heads they're in their own sports and they're dealing with this with their families or maybe with some of their close friends and so you don't really realize this is normal and everything about being an athlete is about projecting confidence and power and that you're fine and you're always fine you just kind of get in the habit of not portraying we

[00:39:52] I'm not asking for help and it's always you it's always your fault I think athletes are some of the most accountable people for generally not saying oh it was it was the ice or it was that or these outside influences it's all you my training wasn't good enough or I mentally got distracted or the pressure was too much so we feel like we have to fix everything you know because it's we've been told that it's all up to us and it's our moment and we're either gonna make it or we're not so I think that's something I'm trying to find a balance with life now is this balance of making life happen and allowing it to happen allowing for serendipity and opportunity and these all these things that happen in life that as an athlete you think you can control everything but you can't when you finish that long program which again is beautiful right Emma if you take these first 30 seconds out of that program I don't think I'm alone in saying this I think many people have written and certainly have read many accounts of it describing it as one of the greatest programs in all of women's figure skating were you proud of how you finished

[00:41:00] I was certainly proud of how I finished and I think of that moment after I had missed my second jump and I was heading 15 seconds later into my third jump a difficult jump for me you just gonna like what's gonna happen on the other side of this but you have to go in and just remind yourself okay like set the shoulders like pull back snap and just get back into the word-by-word guidance that you give yourself through the program and I landed that jump and it was kind of a relief it's like okay now I have a second and I had a spin in a few moments and the the music shifted but at that moment you're still kind of realizing like there went the gold but you're just trying to keep your head back cause your head wants to go all these places but as an athlete you've taught yourself to suppress emotions feelings and doubts and especially in when you still are on the line and you have to perform and so as I ended up landing each consecutive jump there was a sense of relief and the music was very emotional it was Romeo and Juliet from the movie and and I just loved it and so I allowed myself to really kind of get into some of the pain and the expressiveness of the music and you know I was relieved when I was done but I was also crestfallen and it was it was still trying to process everything at once and and in some ways it was kind of a messy night a lot of girls were falling and that usually doesn't happen at an Olympics you know at another games

[00:42:29] I would have been eighth or tenth and and I ended up second because the top three girls all made mistakes so I can see that silver medal is just wow I was so lucky to medal considering how I skated but I think at the same time you just know that this wasn't the state of preparation I wanted to be going in this wasn't the performance that I wanted to give and I don't know what I could have done differently and I think that's the biggest thing for me is I'm I'm a perfectionist I want to understand everything things should be rational and

[00:42:59] I want to fix everything and so when you don't really understand sometimes it's hard to have closure and figure out what it means and what you could have done if you could have done anything at all when you accept the medal when you go back with your family that night in your coach are you already in your mind starting to think about the next thing are you already thinking about the next

[00:43:24] World Championships or the next Olympics god forbid four years down the line or are you able to in this particular moment I'm referring to specifically able to take some comfort in what you've just achieved I would say usually if it's a national championship or a Grand Prix you're thinking about the next thing because those are events gearing up to bigger events but the Olympics is just well this one in particular yeah this is just one as soon as I was done competing it was press conference drug testing and then media circuit hitting all the I believe it was hitting all the morning shows and and then every time they put a microphone in my face I could get through 30 or 40 seconds with before

[00:44:04] I started to cry and have a hard time talking and that was eight interviews so you don't really have much time to process then and then we have a show the next day so all of a sudden it's okay now what's your show program block it out with lights and it's just go go go and and trying to keep everything together you're kind of a porcelain doll that's shattered and glued yourself together to try to keep going for the next two days of the

[00:44:34] Olympics which is basically doing this exhibition closing ceremonies and leaving and so you don't really have the time to process you know I was saying with my mom in we'd rented an apartment and you kind of just come home to silence at the end of it it's too much to process at the time and I think the most the biggest concern is to keep yourself together in front of Team USA officials in front of the media in front of even family it's like it's fine I'm all right like it's okay but certainly not thinking about the next competition because after that world's is kind of like a throw away I ended up going but different athletes handle it differently but I think I tried to create a wide vacuum between skating and myself and a persona just to get away from the pain of it again I didn't watch the performance I fully embrace all the fun opportunities I had post games which were the Oscars and you know all these different events and skating unlike other sports you have a chance to tour so you know you're busy doing shows and live TV events so I kind of lost myself there and then put skating aside I went to acting school I just but did you formally retire in 2006 no and I actually ended up competing in March at

[00:45:59] Worlds and then I ended up touring for a few years while taking time away from competing and ultimately decided to come back and train in 2009-10 season so it's interesting you sort of delayed that I remember Apollo talking about how post 2010 I forget what he said it's only the effect of like two weeks after the

[00:46:20] Olympics it all sort of hit him that that was it on the one hand that seems like a very short period of time like oh my god like two weeks after you know the Olympics it all sort of crushes down on you like a ton of like you're no longer a professional athlete and on the other hand that seems like a really short period of time it seems like in your case it was different it seems like in your case you were able to stretch that out more partly because of the nature of your sport I think and when you mentioned that you were taking acting classes was that in the spirit of making you a better skater or was that really in this in the spirit of thinking about your next career I think it was about exploring other opportunities I guest-starred on CSI New York and on Las

[00:47:04] Vegas and I did a small indie film I wanted to move to LA and take acting classes and it was it was a wonderful diversion from this intense world of pain and disappointment which I think I didn't really want to process or look at it was like oh here's all these fun sparkly things for you because right now you're cool and sexy because you just competed in the Olympics and and then this is kind of something that all

[00:47:30] Olympians go through is you work really hard you have tunnel vision you spend your day between the gym your home and a training facility and then all of a sudden the whole world cares about you and everyone wants to meet the Olympian right after the Olympics until the next games and then just like oh who are you so it's it's a very fun amazing opportunity that some Olympians are fortunate enough to have and I think for me it was just a wonderful relief of the disappointment and pain of my games and then it was I was just busy working so it was you know I I went on tour for a few months and you're doing shows every every other night and when you go and see a figure skating show how much are you guys dialing back you're athletic sort of movements to guarantee that you're not falling like in other words at the Olympics you're at the limit obviously and that's why you will see someone fall at the Olympics because they're the best in the world doing the hardest thing in the world but when you're doing like disney on ice or whatever other show they're obviously still amazing skaters but is that such a step below are you skating at 25 percent of your capacity in those situations so first of all it's not disney on ice that would be a cat you'd be a character if you

[00:48:46] Disney on ICE's generally stars on ice or champions on ice at the time but the Disney oh nice people I mean they're obviously very good skaters too I'm using that as an example but yeah yeah just clarifying but no it's certainly a much lower level of difficulty in terms of your technical elements and a lot of times you you may not have practice or time to prepare you might be on a small ice nearest game with light bulbs around and no boards and you've got spotlights on you and you might be taking a red-eye so people are definitely dialed down the level of performance but it's more about entertaining so at this point the fans are there they've watched you compete over the years they're there to see you and so people are skating two songs with words and it's about entertaining and connecting with the audience and you're still doing difficult triples but it's not like you're packing your program every 15 seconds with a very difficult combination you mentioned already something that I think is lost on a lot of people which is the relatively small window in which you can be at your best and again people like Apollo and Michael create I think a false sense of what the true longevity of an athlete looks like it's very rare for someone to be the best in the world over three or four

[00:49:58] Olympics in many ways I think it's a lot more like horse racing and if you look at thoroughbreds have one season in which they can be the best and it's very early in their life right there usually three-year-olds when they're at their absolute best the horse might live 20 years but it's gonna race from ages two to four and it peaks at age three I don't know if you know these statistics so I don't mean to put you on the spot but I know how involved you are in helping Olympians as they think about this transition I mean do we even have a sense of how many people go to the

[00:50:28] Olympics and what percentage of people get to only go to one Olympics and what percentage of people even get to win a medal and it might just be even in the United States where you probably would have better access to those stats I don't have the stats but I know that most people only go to one Olympics and very very few people medal I was surprised just thinking about it because

[00:50:48] I think the last Winter Olympics Shaun White won the hundred gold medal Olympic gold medal I believe for the US and using the Olympics when going back to the 20s and there brakes in there but yours like whoa there's very few people have actually won medals and very few people get to go to an Olympic twice and certain sports I think like like swimming or speed skating tend to allow for someone to go perhaps twice but you know three times four times is very very rare and in a sport like gymnastics or figure skating especially as as a woman your body changes and then it's this complicated window where you have to be fifteen but some girls were peeking like a lot of these Russian girls were peeking at 12 and 13 and 14 but then they couldn't go and compete and by the time they were old enough to go they were off their peak it's unbelievable to see that it again it's sort of like if you could really only peek for one to two years it's like imagine the Kentucky Derby is only every four years and yet those three out of four horses wouldn't even get to peek in their thing and and again it does create this and it really breaks my heart there's it there's a there's an amazing American female swimmer Missy

[00:51:59] Franklin who was an absolute phenom in 2012 I mean just sort of knocked the socks off of people you just couldn't believe how well she swam in 2012 well in 2016 she was obviously not the same swimmer I just found it so heartbreaking to watch their reaction to this as though somehow she had failed as though somehow like she had let us as fans of us swimming down which I actually found infuriating truthfully because I was able to sort of in a moment recognize that weight like it's okay to be sad for her like I wish Missy was doing better here in Brazil because she strikes me I don't know her but it's respect me as a beautiful human being and obviously a beautiful swimmer but to think that I could be disappointed like she was somehow not living up to her potential it's it's it's ridiculous when you imagine here's a girl who's already got World Records and gold medal and

[00:52:54] Olympic titles to her name it's almost like we as the fans create this awful expectation in this sort of toxic environment of expectation around it's never enough you're only as good as your last Olympics right you're only you know as you pointed out by 2010 it doesn't really matter anymore what you did in 2006 it's can you make this 2010 team and the media is a big part of it - its it's a story you know will they live up to expectations and how will they do and it's you build people up and you tear them down and I don't know why people do this people are busy living their own lives and then I think they just project everything project failures and and they don't know these people but there are somewhat public figures and so it seems easy to kind of slash them at the ankles and just like how could you disappoint your country and like why weren't you prepared and and there's really no sensitivity to this person being a human being we see athletes as resources and you need to perform you need to meet expectations and there's there's not a lot of compassion for them as a human being just struggling on this global platform and and just having their their heart ripped out well you're absolutely right we just can't we as fans I'm saying now we sometimes have a hard time believing you guys aren't machines for example like you watch

[00:54:26] Djokovic win Wimbledon and then a month later have to pull out of the US Open and people are booing him I mean I just I just can't believe it when I watch it I really it embarrasses me to be a member of the public when you realize like a guy whose shoulder is obviously in tremendous pain has to pull out of a tennis match and people are pissed about it and look maybe if I'm gonna take the other side of that I would say well maybe they paid a lot of money to come and see the Wimbledon champion at the US

[00:54:55] Open it's funny when I was growing up I was a I guess I still am sort of a football fan and I had this poster on my wall of Jerry Rice I don't you know who that is but a very famous wide receiver arguably the greatest wide receiver to ever play the position it's just a very famous I think it's like a Nike poster and he's in the end zone and he's holding the football up he's just scored a touchdown and there's a player I think it's like a Cincinnati Bengal you know player you don't even know who the player is cuz he's he's on the ground with his feet trying to grab rice his ankles obviously he has failed to stop

[00:55:25] Jerry Rice from entering the zone and I remember one of my best friends in high school Jeff Mahoney made the most astute observation ever we were like sitting in my room one day you know we're like seniors in high school and he looks at that and he goes isn't it amazing that that dude and he points to the guy on the ground is a better athlete than anyone we ever know and I think people don't realize like we're so used to looking at Jerry Rice or Michael

[00:55:52] Phelps or whatever that one exception is that comes along and truly bends the arc of a sport that you forget even the people seven rungs beneath them are still doing something that most of us can't fathom but it's almost like we've get we get numb to it I think like we just we get so used to seeing you guys be perfect that you make a mistake and it's maybe there's a part of us that likes seeing it because we know you're not perfect and maybe there's a you know a sense of well you failed therefore I'm not so mediocre in my existence I don't know maybe that maybe that's sort of an overly skeptical view of it but human nature's is complex

[00:56:29] I think a lot of it is invisible meaning the athlete especially the Olympians journey we see him pop out of just nowhere for a month around the games and then he kind of goes back into obscurity whereas you know you're kind of seeing half the season if you're you know watching an NBA or NFL you're kind of constantly getting updates and what's going on and there's multiple games so you're you're part of the process a lot more aware is someone that is a skier or a swimmer all of a sudden they pop out of nowhere at the age of 14 or 15 and you see them for a month and then they disappear again for four years unless you're following the World Championships but I think most people would really just tune in for the Olympics so we don't really know what their lives are like and I think that's what these fluff pieces going into the games try to do is track this person training in their run-down facility the fact that they're home schooled you see them physical therapy icing everything taking you know 30 vitamins a day trying to optimize their performance and then also having to take painkillers because there performing with a broken foot and humanizing the pain and the struggle behind it and the sacrifice and I think when all those things are taken into account all of a sudden this person becomes more human and someone that has overcome versus someone in kind of a shiny USA outfit kind of going across your TV screen for 20 seconds and then and then they're just a racehorse to you and there are time but I think once you know the human and you know the story and what it takes then and that the four years in between there's really kind of this nothingness for them and there's there's no glory for most Olympians and there's no money for most Olympians and they're working second jobs and they're in debt to pay for their training and the sacrifice that they go through I think when you understand all those elements it really really humanizes the athlete is the

[00:58:29] United States I can't tell is it a good or a bad country to be an Olympian from because I've seen for example like in other countries where if you're even in the top five top certainly the top three in the world as a swimmer you could make an amazing living because it's so great you know there's so few athletes in that country that could do it whereas you know in the United States if you want a bronze medal in the 200 I am in one

[00:58:55] Olympic year like you're not going to make that much off that but at the same time the US seems to have a lot of great resources to help Olympians but but just unbalanced you get the sense that it's great to be an American Olympian relative to other countries well it's certainly incredible to see the US flag and the sense of camaraderie and you know America still is this icon for for so much of the world and so there's this immense sense of pride representing the US but I think the difference is is the US Olympic and

[00:59:26] Paralympic Committee is solely responsible for funding the athletes the government is not any part of it and in a lot of other countries I believe Russia and in China the government is putting a lot of money into the athletes and paying for their training and so they just have the resources that they have to work with are at another level you know in Russia if you you reach a certain level of success like you get an apartment and you get car and you type and wear that that doesn't happen because the purpose of the Olympic Committee is really to find young talent and support them leading up to their Olympic journey but they don't have the resources that these other countries do and for other countries especially during the Soviet Union it was all about how do we beat the US and everything and no expense is spared and look at five-year-olds and do they have the right bone structure like okay take them away take these fifty five year olds away put them in camp and maybe one of them will make it and we don't care if we work them all to the bone because it's it's about winning and it's it's an

[01:00:30] Olympic machine your mom's from Russia right she came to the US when she was what teenager 16 and it was the Soviet Union at the time but she was from Odessa she's from Odessa okay did Russian fans have a negative view of you did they want you to be competing as a Russian or were they just opposed to you they seem to booed you disproportionately was it just because you were American or was there something more going on there I think it's because there was another

[01:00:55] Russian Irina Slutskaya that was a favorite as well and so there was really no association with me being I see it had nothing to do with you not competing as a Russian though it was in your bloodline it was purely just the fact that you were the competition to a Russian yes and I think in other competitions where there was no Russian favourite than the Russians were supportive of me because I was closer to to who they were but but I competed in

[01:01:22] Moscow against Irina and I was thoroughly booed so it was really that I it was kind of when I was ever up against one of their own that I certainly you know they were not rooting for me let's go back a little bit because I still I don't understand how a 7 year old girl decides I'm gonna subject myself to this much practice and this much deliberate effort I mean you've talked about this before in other interviews I've heard where like many athletes your parents are told you probably have attention deficit disorder and was it framed as she should either probably take this pill or she needs to find something to do for three hours a day I mean was it sort of like that or I was a hyperactive kid I was constantly climbing trees on rooftops wild and I would race the boys I would cartwheels I would just kind of I would wear these same neon stretch two-piece suits I you know I no sense or care about fashion I just wanted to be running jumping climbing at all times and I went through three different elementary schools because I didn't know how to sit still in class or stand still during roll call I would be offering cartwheels or if if art was over I wouldn't put my art project away because I wasn't done so I had a very difficult time being in a group setting and in listening to Direction one teacher thought I was deaf another teacher gave my mom a book on juvenile delinquents and it was just kind of clear that I couldn't conform to a system and you know my mom finally found a school that was like mixed grades no desks mainly art that seemed to to jive with me this was in California mm-hmm in

[01:03:03] Pasadena then I was put into gymnastics at the age of five because I just I was bouncing all the time it's so much energy so I went to gymnastics for four hours a day and we were literally 100v ups you know three hundred jumping jacks hundred push-ups and this is a five-year-old I look like a little cut sumo wrestler there are other five-year-olds they were were you with older kids no I was with other five-year-olds it was a very intense training center and yes you know I was diagnosed with ADHD and my mom didn't want to medicate her five-year-old and so she thought okay well we'll just get it rid of her energy in gymnastics through that a friend through a skating birthday party and I found skating and this feeling of gliding and freedom and

[01:03:44] I could channel all this energy I had into something I loved and could focus on and so then for me it was very easy it didn't feel like a sacrifice because all I wanted to do was be on the rink and to be skating and learning new jumps so I never really saw it as a sacrifice early on in my life it was it was something that gave me clarity and purpose whereas I didn't really fit in at school

[01:04:08] I was a lot smaller than everyone else and I just had a very different I think I didn't know how to socialize I was climbing trees or I was painting pictures sixth grade when everyone's get anybody for dances and figuring out what they're wearing and figuring out what boys they should spend time with at the mall I just complete completely over my head and skating gave me this channel to express myself to work hard to become something and it just clicked even by the standards of a figure skater you would still be considered kind of an outlier in terms of your artistic ability again the way you know your your movement exceeds even that of your peers you've now even just in the time we've spoken discussed this constantly as this sort of creative expression do all I think it's hard to me to ask you that question but do you think that that's common as the the thread towards getting somebody in to figure skating or do are there different pads that get people there so in other words you don't have to know much about physics to understand the strength and power that is required to jump the way you guys jump I mean that's it it's a very explosive sport so there's probably a very athletic component that's required to it in terms of those raw athletic inputs but there's also this huge artistic component where

[01:05:29] I could imagine you take the most powerful female athlete on the planet but if she doesn't have the ability to create lines and flow and spin in a certain way and dance in a certain way or choreograph in a certain way it wouldn't be the same I think it's it's the same is true for men and women I'm just using women as an example because we're talking about you did you start to figure out which of those was your leading edge it's interesting because on the spectrum of sports I think figure skating is at the very end of sport and then the next is ballet and ballet is an art and I think the physicality channeled my energy but I think I've always been very expressive and creative and and I felt that the music was a way for me to channel my feelings so I think

[01:06:18] I was always much more of the artistic skater and while I definitely had physical talent and capabilities that was by no means my strength like some people were jumping machines they were they were robots and they could do it the same jump over 20 times just boom boom boom and for me I always struggle with that it took me longer to learn my jumps I would lose my jumps and for me I excelled at the expression and the line and the flexibility which I'll thank my mom for because she wouldn't let me watch TV unless I was sitting in the splits so growing up I was either in the splits or practicing holding spirals but everyone I think is is very different in a sport like figure skating and in even ballet because you have the range of the more athletic and then the more emotive artistic and you really need to be a mix of both although the way that the system is evolving is it with a heavy emphasis on the technical abilities because that racks up points and so you don't need to have as much personality or artistry because the points are really not captured there certainly it's part of it but but you can rack up so many points with technical capabilities and that become in some ways a criticism hasn't it of women's figure skating which is okay I get it we're gonna add more and more points to these greater and greater degrees of staggeringly powerful jumps but the critic would say well shouldn't we be subtracting points for the lack of beauty in this for the lack of grace for the lack of spin for the lack of line for the lack of choreographing as well so that we do try to preserve that balance I mean I guess ultimately that's just so subjective though right it's very difficult to enforce that the way you can say look you have to do a triple lutz and it's very clear what is and what is not that jump right figure skating is very complicated as is gymnastics because it's not a race what you know did you beat this other person what was your time it's really an art that's also a sport and and so it's it's a philosophical argument do you want to treat figure skating purely as a sport and a sport is about technical ability and progressing and pushing the body to more rotations faster and treat it purely as a as a sport because then what happens is you you peak at 14 you get injured quickly you can't sustain and evolve and have the kind of skaters you had in the 90s and early 2000s like surya bonaly and Kurt Browning and

[01:08:48] Michelle Kwan where there were personalities that developed and people matured and became more like well-rounded athletes and performers because we're now choosing to treat it just as a sport we're not valuing the artistry but but who's to say that we should that's subjective obviously I appreciate the artistry I couldn't my skills that wouldn't have been conducive to competing in today's environment and

[01:09:14] I think a lot of what the audience loves is the personality and the artistry of figure skating but is that what makes it a sport and I think that's a very philosophical subjective debate I don't feel qualified enough to weigh in does the fact that I always have a very strong opinion in swimming for example you know the most dominant male swimmer before Phelps was a guy named Tom Dolan and I mean not a beautiful swimmer to watch swim I mean he looked like he was beating the crap out of the water the whole time and yet the fastest swim I mean back-to-back gold medals in the 400 IM in 96 and 2000 so amazing swimmer but you know you gotta say look in swimming it just matters how quickly you get to the wall it shouldn't you know it's pretty clear and swimming or running to your point it doesn't matter if you look ugly doing it who cares if you're there first but at what point in your figure skating career was it clear to you that you wanted to do this as your life's mission at least for the foreseeable future when do you make that decision where it which is okay it's time to start hole homeschooling and living on the road and training six hours a day I was 12 I was going into seventh grade my first day of school and I just felt that it was such a waste I was at a public high school and California room was focused on shopping and surfing and it wasn't a very rigorous academic environment and I just I would often get heckled it's like oh what are you doing here do you lose your way the elementary schools down the street because I because you're sure yeah I was I was sure I was little I looked a few years younger than I was like I looked like I was in 3rd or 4th grade I was tiny when I was competing the age of 15 I think I was four nine and seventy pounds so I was I was I was really limited women you were four foot nine and seventy pounds at fifteen I was tiny you had you I mean if you don't mind me asking him and had you even had your period yet no not too much much much later Wow yeah which is not uncommon obviously for for female skaters ballerina I don't remember but I had the tests where you're kind of submerged dunked underwater yeah I think you know it was like 5% body fat just just tiny it's kind of amazing to reflect on that for a moment I mean I think again maybe even for you it's hard to appreciate now this is me getting to talk with some

[01:11:35] Authority right on what the implications are of totally arresting your endocrine system for six seven years literally a third of your life being fully stopped to prevent your body from developing I mean that speaks to what a physiologic stress it is for a young boy or a young girl it's just the the I think there's a fundamental difference right which is for boys the training effect can actually sort of help puberty but for women it can be really suppressive as it obviously was in your case in the case of many others that that's and for me it was pretty easy until I was 17 and then when I was 17 everything changed with it with diet and with training meaning you got more dialed in at 17 when I was 15 I could eat whatever I wanted right and I was just tiny I had a kids metabolism and I was also working out hours and hours a day but when I was 17 16 17 you know things started to change you started to get a little more pudgy and and all of a sudden there's this focus and your coach and everyone's just like

[01:12:41] I you know I seve you know they would pinch your stomach and it's like we that's not just skin there there's fat and then as you get to know your body better and and every because it fluctuates you to get down to a pretty low weight but you can't really sustain that during the year and so you'd gain 10 pounds after the end of the season and then you'd try to get back on the ice and do a jump again and just you really feel the difference in terms of your spring and being able to rotational inertia for sure

[01:13:11] Hunter eating disorders amongst figure skaters they must be quite prevalent I'm sure they are but it's something that everyone keeps pretty private and even the met and have their own versions of them it's it's yeah I don't eat breakfast or lunch I just have coffee and then then I have dinner but I don't have an eating disorder I think everyone has found their own method for what works for them and it's very difficult because it's not so much about the energy to train it's it can be very much about what your body looks like and how you can propel it into the air and every body type is very different and has its own kind of physics where you'll see a lot of the North American or European skaters been very very very muscular to develop themselves up into the air and and some of the Japanese skaters like the Japanese men you don't really see a lot of muscles on them but they're just the most incredible light springy jumpers and so everyone has to find their own dynamic and I think that's why you see a lot of girls kind of get sidelined when they go through puberty is because their body really changes their bones change and no matter how they try to control what they eat or how they train it that time has passed them by it is a little bit of you talk to the outside about one of the challenges is you don't you think you're in control of everything but you're not well this must be one of the greatest example right because a 15 year old girl who has yet to go through puberty has very little control over what her body is going to turn into I mean you don't know if your hips are going to do this your breasts are going to do that and that can be all the difference in the world so our coaches at that age also sort of hedging I mean how are they communicating to the parent because I'm trying to put myself in the shoes of a parent whose child is 12 or 13 who's being told your child has the potential to be an Olympian but oh by the way when she goes through puberty all bets could be off like you know her body could change in a way that's simply not conducive to the movements of the sport is that ever explicitly discussed or is that just always sort of we just keep our fingers crossed and we just go for it every model is different if you're you're in in Russia or in a different training environment you know you might the coach will only take on a few students it's much more intense whereas in the u.s. it's like every skater has to pay for lessons so which will teach someone that might never make the Olympics because they're getting paid and it fills this hour later on there's you know as someone proceeds through the ranks and their senior and they're close to making a world team the coach gets more involved and there's more at stake but it but ultimately it's on the athlete can you control your body and it's again this everything that we think we have to be able to control everything and and I think it is very dangerous because you get the validation from your coach and from the world like if you have a longer line and you look more by let ik and at the same time it's easier to jump and you're also controlling something in your life which are kind of all these things that are tied into having an eating disorder but then it's like is that what's necessary for this sport when you look back at your entire career in Figure Skating so from age call it five or seven until what 2025 when you stopped when was it the absolute most fun it was the most fun when I first started and then probably when I was 14 15 years old I was just beginning to get really good to get national attention go to my first international Grand Prix's bursts on the onto the national stage and get second at nationals and then be invited to do tours as this young kid this whole world this carpet unfolds before you and now you're touring with your your idols with Kristi Yamaguchi and and Brian Boitano and people you've watched on TV and you're just this little kid and all of a sudden the

[01:17:06] Olympics are two years away and and it's just it's all at once and it was this inundation so I think that was probably the most exciting I was still super motivated it was all ahead of me and I was young enough that I think the pressure the immensity and the enormity of the where the level of pressure would go had not yet sunk in that is a response that I've heard from a number of athletes which is the best time in their life with respect to the sport was actually before they became the best do you think that's common I mean I you probably have a much larger sampling of that than I do I think later on it just becomes about expectations I think it's a matter of appreciation so before you have it it's just you idolize these these athletes at the Olympics and it's a dream just maybe one day I could get to go there and then all of a sudden when you're going there if I don't win I am the biggest failure in my life is ruined and so I think it's all about framing and lenses and when you're young it's it's all ahead of you and you see things with rose-colored glasses and you're doing something you love because you love it and then later on it can change and I had a very difficult time between 2002 and 2006 I moved across the country I had different coaches it was dealing with like gaining weight and you know my body not cooperating with me and losing all my jumps and just being super super delicate wait did you gain between Oh - and I was six seven oh two year seventeen mm-hmm and I was you know six years twenty-one it would fluctuate a lot between off season and on season but I had very low estrogen and low bone density and so doctors wanted me to be on birth control to strengthen my bones and that just completely put my body out of whack and completely didn't work for training and so it's like all these things that your body is like this finely finely tuned instrument and you do you switch blades you you try birth control and it just completely put your body out of whack let alone all the emotional repercussions and it was really tough but I knew the Olympics for two years away and I had to be there and

[01:19:17] I had to redeem myself and I had to win because this was everything my life was for so despite how difficult it was and how hard it was failure and quitting wasn't was never an option there's just you know something inside that's propelling you and I don't know if it's there's so many different factors going in but it's it's something that there it's not pure joy and like the love of what you're doing that's driving you it's the need to fulfill a quest at points it can be a lot more painful and difficult than it is exciting and motivation is serving as your source in some athletes case it's it's usually obvious at least if you're playing armchair psychologist it's obvious what what void is trying to be filled you know it's an athlete that's trying to you know win the approval of someone you know a parent that's not there or a person that rejected them do you feel like or do you see or sense looking back any sort of motivation that could make you feel like you had you know everything you just said I'm not going to repeat it because I can't I won't do it justice everything you just said was that in service of some things some void you think or is that just the inevitable fuel that one needs to turn to if they're going to compete at that level in other words can you win an

[01:20:38] Olympic gold pure Li purely from the place of bliss pure joy and love for the moment that you're there being a part of every bit of the training win lose or draw have the same list is that even possible at that level I think it's certainly possible I think you see it with kids just coming up so they might be 15 go to their first games and they're so excited to be there and wow they won I think it also happens towards the end of a career when people have had dealt with hardship and maybe it's their fourth Olympic Games and they realize that this is the last one and how incredible it is and that they're performing and they're competing with the appreciation of their legacy and that this kind of final punctuation on their career but I think it's difficult especially when you're it's your second games and you feel like there's so much pressure riding on this performance because it's no longer about your

[01:21:37] Olympic experience it's about will you deliver in these few minutes and that's what everyone's been been talking about and waiting for so I think it is complicated but I think it's possible and it's not to say that even if you are using this kind of not negative motivation but just this you know a certain DRI that doesn't come from pure joy not to say that you don't have the most exhilarating moments when you you find this piece of music and you choreograph a new program or you land and you jump combination for the first time it's you realize that the great things in life take hit in your head against the wall over and over and over and over and over for years and you just don't give up because giving up isn't an option I think this sense of obstinacy is it it makes you great as an athlete but then when you apply it to life it's it's kind of you have to like the Zumba in the room it's like no that's a corner we actually just move the zoom button like start banging against something else but that's what it takes to be a great athlete is not accepting failure you keep showing up again and again and again and I can tell you that two years out when you're out from the 2006

[01:22:44] Olympics I didn't even know if I was going to make it because I was struggling so much the one season before the Olympic season I had to withdraw no four or five yeah I lost all my jumps that year I pulled out of every Grand Prix and I thought I've stuck around this long and I'm not gonna make it to 2006 like how is this happening but but you don't give up you just keep showing up every day you keep showing up every day and then things get better and it kind of teaches you that that if you don't give up if you show up that that has a lot of weight to it one other question I don't ask you about the actual Olympics cuz it just blows my mind how long does it take you to to choreograph say that the long program of oh six right so you do you pick the music first you say this everything is gonna be built around this song and then we're gonna build it in or do you largely sketch out what you want to do movement wise and then pair music to it I mean especially for an Olympic season you're listening and then you're taking music to the eyes and you're seeing how you move to it does it inspire you and then you might work for a few weeks with a choreographer not only cutting the music but trying different series of spiral sequences and jumping combinations and figuring out what really suits you and you're really choosing music to suit your style if you're more lyrical or if you're more of a power skater you really want the music to serve you and your style of artistry or how you skate was Romeo and Juliet do you think your best work in that sense it certainly was one of the pieces of music that I resonated with the most and I always felt that I just melted into the music and it's it's funny because I get nervous with public speaking and and for some reason it's when I'm in front of a microphone and I'm nervous and I speak it's very different than getting out into the middle of the ice being incredibly nervous and nauseous but hearing music and then somehow you can melt into the music and moving your body and I think Romeo and Juliet was a piece of music that I felt really at one with it was a love story and had so much drama and especially this that the movie version I think it was the pre-coffee of that in Spanish music I intended to say skates in malaguena and Carmen and these kind of fiery character pieces which you know also suited another side of my personality you've described the feeling I'm sort of paraphrasing but profound nausea and the feeling of thousands of pounds crushing your chest or something to that effect that's what it feels like when you go out there and yet it's sort of amazing as I you know I think that's partly why as maybe as we get older we find something different in watching the

[01:25:31] Olympics you know when you're young you're watching it because it might just be all about the achievement but I think as we age a little bit and we experience our own setbacks and we start to sort of understand what our demons are all about part of what I think is amazing about it is trying to imagine how they feel you know trying to imagine whether it's you know the start of the hundred meter free it's like there's eight people lined up on a starting block one of them is gonna win one of them is gonna finish last right one of them will finish last there's no denying it he or she will still be the eighth fastest runner in the world for that day but what is the anxiety like in that moment I don't know there are a few sports like figure skating where the margin for error is so small because one you're out there for so long so the duration is long the technical complexity is very high and three the aesthetic component matters meaning how you present yourself matters again you can be scowling when you jump in the pool or get on the bike it doesn't really matter you can't be scowling when you're standing there on the ice it's always amazing to listen to the announcers as though they know what the person's thinking try to project that but presumably that's been a skill as well right I mean is there anything in your current life that puts a fraction of that pressure on you in a moment certainly not and I think it's it's something I was able to really describe because I stepped away for a few years and then came back to compete again at the age of 24 or 25 and and I could finally articulate what it felt like and it was like battery acid running through your chest with a thousand pounds of weight crushing you you're like how do I even move and and again this is what really taps back into denial is you can't really identify with your feelings you have to shut them down and I think that's why I found acting so appealing when I was done skating was because there's there's a spectrum of humanity and actors are on the far left and athletes are on the far right and normal humans are in the middle where when as an athlete if you are have fear any feeling you have to shut it down you have to be impervious you're always fine you're a robot you're projecting confidence and as an actor you have to take in every emotion from the outside every vulnerability you cultivate feeling because that's that's your paintbrush that's how you live and as a human in the middle you have places you feel safe to be vulnerable and open but you certainly aren't at work you don't cry when you see every homeless person and and you learn in the middle but athletes are on the far far end of the spectrum where you just learn to shut everything down because you're dealing with so much all the time and just disses pressure and I think it's hard to learn to be a normal functioning human being after you're an athlete it's I think it's almost in the same way you you're a soldier and and I you know I hesitate that some ways to make that comparison because obviously we're not putting our lives on the line and this is sport but the element of the human is shut down for the task and it's all about the task and and that's something it takes time to learn how to be a human again after it's so interesting you the way you explain that which I guess I now see it's after 2006 when you go and you take acting classes as you say that's a big part of I think what enabled you to maybe come back in 2010 with a different perspective perhaps I mean yeah I think it was the break from it because I think a lot of it is habituation so if you start competing from the age of 5 years old you you're nervous but your tiny little competitions and you know kids are really nervous even when they're seven years old you see them running to the bathroom to throw up before they skate and they're pacing and they're crying you've got butterflies and they're just seven year olds at tiny little local competitions and so you're kind of habituated at a young age and then your competitions get slowly bigger and then their national and there's more people by the time you get to the Olympics even though this is the biggest stage you've ever been on it's been this steady ramp up to that and then I took three years away from it and then I came back and so

[01:29:51] I and I was just doing shows and so I think I wasn't constantly stressing my nervous system with these kind of nerves and feelings and so when I think when I took a break and came back it's just like part of you is like I'm never doing this again this is how could I ever subject myself to this but then once you go out and you're performing it's this most incredible high and so as an athlete I think you get used to these high highs and these low lows of these lonely difficult moments where you're injured and you're dealing with so much psychological stress to these moments where you're out doing what you ultimately love to do and the crowd is cheering for you and you feel like you know you're paused in this most unique moment in time doing what you love and after I retired you know life was just nice and that was wonderful for a year and then life just felt slack because everything had evened out the high highs were gone the low lows were gone and then you're kind of learning how to live without that paradigm I've read that 80% of Olympians or former Olympian suffer or have at least experienced in some transient form a form of depression does that I mean does that sound believable to you having been on the inside certainly and I'm sure that the number might even be higher because again we don't as athletes were taught not to admit weakness and it's not only to the outside world it's to yourself because if you admit weakness to yourself and you're undermining what you're capable of and the biggest tragedy there's a you know there's a multiple factors one mental health issues can be a stigma and so people generally don't talk about them and they should and then on top of that as an athlete if you admit that you're struggling it's going to undermine your own performance and and you don't want to admit that to yourself or let your competitors know and then once you retire you lose your identity and you lose your purpose and something you've spent a decade or two decades your whole team of support and everything you do and everything you wake up for which is like this moment four years down the line you like imagine yourself on a podium and and you've charted out this whole path to get there and then all of a sudden you don't have the goal anymore you don't have the identity anymore you're watching other people do what you did but they're doing it better because they're the next generation and and you don't have a skill set that everyone else your age does who was actively pursuing an academic education and went to college and interned and really setting themselves up for the next 40 years of your life it's all been this rug has been pulled from underneath you and so not only are you mourning your identity and have lost your sense of purpose but now you see yourself as ten years behind normal people and you don't even know what you want to do but there's this interesting thing I've observed which is there's there are a subset of people and you and Apollo would be great examples of it where you seem to have made the transition so easily now you've made it look easy I'm not suggesting it's easy of course but you were basically able to take the roomba mentality of I can go harder I can go faster I can go longer I can go deeper than anybody just give me a new skill set and you know you emerge at one of the best colleges in the country and you kick ass and you know today you've got a great job in finance there are a handful of athletes who just make this transition and if you're saying it's hard I mean what's happening for most athletes I mean I mean I'm not asking that rhetorically like what does the graveyard look like for especially

[01:33:32] Olympic athletes it's different if you've at least played five years in the NFL and you've managed to stash away seven figures but most Olympians don't come close to scraping together that kind of money so what are they they do they go on to become coaches and like how many of them are able to resume where they would have been or get back on that same path if they had chosen something else because they're obviously very capable but they're gonna need new you know they're gonna need to be retrained there's so many variables I think the mindset of an individual athlete versus someone that was on a team sport yeah that's a good point and then is this something where they went to their first Olympics at 27 or 30 and they've kind of developed this identity and this group of friends where they actually in where they do they actually go to college and where they plan a collegiate sport because then you develop very differently than if you're a gymnast or skater or speed skater and you've been homeschooled since seven and this is your world and it's it's myopic and then your personality type like how neurotic are you and what do you see as success and what's your appetite for the unknown I think some you know across all sports some people continue to coach they judge they they want to be in their sport and they want to be the big fish in the small pond and they continue to hold on to that identity as this greatest moment of their life and what I want to find them and then I think there's others that that prefer to be the tadpole in the ocean and you have to deal with this sense of insignificance and feeling lost and realizing the more you learn about the world the bigger you realize it is and then the more confused you are at the more options and and I think I definitely chose the

[01:35:23] Paul in the ocean route and I moved to New York and I went to Columbia and and I'm still learning who I am and what it is I want to do and and redefining success because I think at the age you know when I when I was competing I'm gonna have 21 it's like oh well what's the next thing that seems really competitive and athletic and I can define winning and to me that seemed like finance you know I went out of liberal arts education and you start to realize what's out there you realize that success is what you define it to be and that actually happiness starts to be more important to you than what society quote unquote deems success because success is fleeting and maybe success is a moment but you're quickly replaced and what are you building your life around and so I think there's a there's definitely a value shift instead of just like this plug in play at first it's like I'm gonna take everything and all this intensity I had in my sport and put it towards something else and be the best and just like show everyone and this is this is my new vehicle it's like just show me what to do and I'll get to the top and then you realize like is this mountain worth climbing even this is a formula that I knew before but applying it somewhere else this isn't actually what I want and I think it takes a lot of time and reflection and kind of self growth to realize like what's worth doing like what's worth like what actually is winning like what do you think enabled you to figure this out because honestly talking with you

[01:36:54] Sasha it's blowing my mind that you you are so wise beyond your years when you talk about that right I mean you have figured something out that most people never figure out in life and yet you have two thirds of your life still ahead of you in terms of years how do you think you made that transition I mean obviously there's some deliberate choices so you made a decision in 2010 not just am I gonna leave the sport but I'm not going to wrap my identity around this sport either I'm gonna go beat the tadpole I'm gonna go and roll at Columbia where frankly I'm gonna suck because I'm competing with a bunch of whippersnappers that came out of high school and they're way better prepared than I am and I'm gonna be doing an internship in something a bunch of kids that are 10 years younger than me and probably a bunch smarter than me when it comes to these tangible sets of facts and skills that one would have learned and I totally appreciate what you're saying that part of that was the challenge of this is my new Olympics my new Olympics is going to be graduating first in my class and doing X Y & Z but but then what you described at the end there was another transition which is wait a minute like that's not even the way I want to live my life anymore which is it's not about being the best tell me how that realization and the application of that came to you I think it's in finding things to be hollow it's going down a path that you think oh if I'm just the most successful in this if I work my way up to the top I'll find identity and fulfillment and I'll be good enough and then you realize as you do it these things look sexy from the outside but once you're in them it's really not what it appears to be it's like people do this so they can show you the country-club in the car and the the business card and maybe some people really love what they do and these are these are side effects but I think a lot of people do things for approval and for status in society and I think at at a very young age I got used to being rewarded by the public but for it for achieving and so I felt that what I needed to do had to be publicly visible and needed to be appreciated and to be validated and then I think as you you get older you know I've spent a lot of time become very very interested in different Buddhist texts and in meditation and just understanding this this bigger picture of life because I think we get so singularly and absorbed in like what's in front of us in the moment and we think it's the most important thing and then the biggest struggle for me and something that I daily work on is what do I actually want to do versus what do I think other people will be impressed with and I got having this like the resume versus the eulogy are you a fan of the book by

[01:39:46] David Brooks the roast character on a second Mountain being the more recent I actually haven't read the road to character but I read the second mountain and found it very very compelling and powerful and I think that's the phase of life that I'm certainly in and I have a lot of questions and I'm exploring like what makes a meaningful life and what actually brings me joy if I can peel away all the layers that my upbringing through sport and society have projected onto me because sometimes you don't really know the difference and you end up doing things that people around you do because that's what they respect and ultimately were social animals and we want to be respected by others to have a sense of self-worth if you can really strip all those things away then you can start to have the dialogue with yourself of what you actually like and what if you really like something that the world doesn't validate who's gonna win like are you gonna do something for them or you can just think for you and this is still you there's still tension there yeah of course yeah well let's play a hypothetical game because what I'm not hearing you say to be clear is you regret the decade and a half you spent killing yourself to be the world's best figure skater I'm not I'm not hearing you say that but I want to just play a thought experiment which is I'm gonna put you in a time machine and I'm gonna take you back and you're going to get to spend the next ten years with 15 year-old Sasha so we're gonna take you back to circa 1998 you're two years outside of your first Olympics but now you I'm gonna change the way you look so that the 15 year old version doesn't realize this is the adult version of her but you now get to become another coach slash mentor to the girl and you know everything you know so you know how the story ends if she stays the course how would you counsel her that's such a hard question because it's going backwards and tweaking something you don't know what's gonna happen going for admittedly yes we run the risk of the butterfly effect here big time well let me ask you then I'll start with some broad themes well the more I think about this question and more interesting it gets in that through the lens of if you only have knowledge through 2010 versus seeing where you are today it might it might be different let me make it an easier question then which is the question I didn't want to ask because it's such a common question which is what advice would you give yourself let's take a hybrid of that basically which is how much would you let her worry about what she's doing even if alleviating some of that worry subjected her to the risk of not being as successful it's really an interesting question because I would want to go back and say enjoy this time right this is enjoy being at the Olympics enjoy being on the ice and moving and having your body like honed and trained to this to such this this incredible degree right it's it's such a rare fleeting moment later you're gonna be jogging and you're gonna be winded different it really is incredible because ultimately it's like the piece of this incredible journey that it means to be human right and it's a very extraordinary exceptional piece that you can get to you know the top of a sport that you can represent your country that you can see the world it's it's such a gift but at the same time if you if you tell this younger girl there's so many things after you're gonna go to college like the world is so much bigger than this maybe you wouldn't stick it out maybe you wouldn't stick out those really difficult times I remember a few years before my second Olympics fourth of July everyone was barbecuing I was training at a center in Connecticut I had the key to the rink opened up was just training by myself and then I went with my off lights coach to the outdoor track and was doing sprints and 100 degree heat and just broke down crying and I was like I don't want to be here I wanted with my family I don't want to do this missus like oh nine that's really what have been in like 2004 before three or four just complete breakdown in that moment if you're like you know what college is gonna be amazing you're gonna find poetry and you you know your philosophy and it's gonna blow your mind and Buddhism why am i what am i doing like how many days am I gonna have a Groundhog Day of doing the same thing over and over in this rink and to this day I go to an ice rink and I smell that that musty smell of rubber mats and that's there's there's like some PTSD certainly it's visceral and I think if you know that there's more and I guess I'm a person that I've got so many interests and there's so much I want to do and I have so much FOMO I want to be in every country and I want to get a PhD and in you know Buddhist studies and I want to do everything so I think if I knew more about the world in those hard times I think it would have been much harder to stick it out when that versus that being your only identity and your whole world well there's there's certainly a reason why they have to put blinders on racehorses I don't know I guess that's sort of the thing that that about it that it feels I've had this discussion with a number of my friends who are you know in your situation right so people who were that at one point the best in the world and now they're they're normal

[01:45:15] I think quote-unquote right I mean anything but to be yeah but you know what I mean there's a sadness there's a very famous athlete who was incredibly well celebrated and decorated 20 years ago he's really fallen on hard times now substance abuse a whole bunch of other things and you know sort of behind closed scenes there have been a handful of people that have tried to help him to really you know get him back from the from the edge of drugs alcohol all of the things that have sort of taken him to within about the inch of his life repeatedly and it's hard to look at him because I still I can't get the image out of my mind of him when he was the best in the world at what he did and there was a whole country that viewed him as the most amazing thing they'd ever produced and now this entire country would abandon him in a heartbeat out of pure disregard and shame for who he is and what he's become and what seems unfair to me is that the same forces that lifted him up he was a national champion at 17 they you know the greatest that that country had ever produced the same forces that put the blinders on him to enable him to you spend a decade of his life being the identity of a nation in a sport are the exact same forces that have abandoned him and given him nothing to cope with the complete emptiness and bitterness of his existence and the shame that has followed it if I had the ability to tell the whole story with all the details it would be a more powerful story but I think you get what I'm talking about because even though this is an extreme example it's not actually that extreme in terms of the emotions it might be extreme in terms of the net effects you know the near-death and the drug overdoses and stuff but I think this is sort of the guilty this is sort of the guilty part that we have as the spectators right is we don't realize that the same thing that we throw on the athlete to sort of praise them is the very same gasoline that is to it a bad fire as it is to a good campfire kind of thing if that makes sense athletes generally start young and so there's a conditioning that sets in early validation through performance and through through winning so it's Pavlovian and you're trained that that's how that's how you're defined and that's how you're respected and adored and so you very much try to prove yourself to the world to get this this validation back but I think something that's important to remember is like you can be a healthy functioning human being or you can be the best in the world at something but you can't be both you believe that to be true I do because I'm talking about sports at this point in time but you have to sacrifice all these other things you have to sacrifice your emotional well-being time with friends like socializing in school these other things that would make you well-rounded and knowing you know someone telling you it's a go it's okay if you fell or you want to take a week off and you're not defined by this you are a full human being and that's not what we value you for but that's not true and I think what happens is in sport you become valued for what you do and as soon as you stop doing it or stop doing it as well as you did all your value is gone and so it's like you spend you know it's like all blood twin tears creating this social cultural value by winning and as soon as you stop winning the value just like it just disintegrates so quickly being versus doing is a very Eastern versus Western sort of mantra yet when it comes to sports there seems to be no Eastern it's all Western isn't it in other words there's no Buddhist athletes in the sense of its just being like even if you're competing in the Olympics from eastern parts of the world in the end athleticism always comes down to to what you're doing

[01:49:18] Nike slogan just do it we don't care how you feel it's about what you do it's funny I was recently reading an older version of the art of war and fifty pages was the introduction it went back to the genesis of Eastern and Western thought and philosophy back to Confucius and back to Aristotle and Plato and in the West we always think that we do something that there's a mover and a moved a cause and an effect that there's

[01:49:48] God and he created everything else and you go into two Eastern culture and and it's symbiotic everything is a relationship God is everything and it's about relationships and the belief isn't that you cause something but that you are part of something and it's all interrelated it doesn't apply to sports but I think it really goes into the philosophies and the way that people in

[01:50:11] Eastern versus Western cultures have historically lived and and that really stuck with me because it's a lot of responsibility to feel that you cause everything that it's all up to you to a certain extent it's true in certain ways but there's there's so much that we don't control and that we still don't understand and that how things are all interrelated and I think that's that's important to remember and I think it's helpful as an athlete to remove yourself from this cause-and-effect way of living to understand that you're you're also a part of something one of the exercises that I find really helpful when I really get in my head is and it sounds morbid but I just start are imagining the world in my absence it's a game you play if you go to enough funerals but you realize the earth wouldn't slow down by one millisecond on its axis if I cease to be here which is not to say that I can't make a difference or that I don't matter I do matter i matter to at least a small group of people if nothing else my family but it's a way for me to get out of what you're describing which is like taking on more sense of importance it is really interesting the number of people for whom their removal from this planet matters is really low now of course the flip side of that is how do you create meaning and purpose which as you've talked about I mean did you know Steve

[01:51:41] Holcomb I did not you know I heard many stories about him and he's featured quite a bit in this documentary the weight of gold tell us a little bit about that how did that come about so a friend of mine Jeremy Blum had found the director his name is Brett and he was actually wanting to do a comeback story because Stephen was I think coming back for a second or third Games had won multiple Olympic medals he was living in a training center in

[01:52:12] Lake Placid and he thought oh what a great comeback story I'll kind of film him going into the games and had interviewed him 12 days before he actually died before he committed suicide and then all of a sudden that changed the whole direction of the film and then brought in all these other athletes some other athletes who had committed suicide and other athletes that had suicidal thoughts or really struggled with depression and really put a voice to what it's like to lose that sense of identity and for Stephen in particular he was living in the training center felt very isolated was starting to lose his vision was driving the bobsled car and you know felt all this the enormity of it the pressure and not really having an outlet for how to talk about it and and would would say that after this Olympics even if I win I'm gonna have to go live in my mom's basement because I don't have money and you don't make any money doing what I do in this sport and I think it's just kind of the isolation and the pressure starting to lose his vision and just the enormity of it he really suffered with with mental health issues and then there's a whole spectrum you know there's people like him and like speedy Peterson who ended up committing suicide as well who might have had intrinsic mental health issues but then there's all these things that are aggravated by the fact that you you lose an identity when you're done competing and even if you're still competing just the enormity of the pressure and you're handling it alone and I think it's so important that athletes Michael Phelps is a part of this so as Shaun White and Apolo Ohno are coming together and really talking about what the process of training is like and what the loss feels like on the other side of an Olympic Games and how they try to process it and from the outside it may look like they have everything and that there's this epitome of success but the sense of hollowness they have on the inside this loss of identity and where it takes them because you have these really incredible type-a personalities that will do anything and sacrifice anything to achieve and then all of a sudden their whole platform for achieving it has been erased and I think it really leaves you like a fish out of water we want to say well all these people that have depressive tendencies or that have committed suicide have mental health issues but we make it sound like that's a binary distinction or something like that like they have cancer or they don't have cancer or something like that I mean in the end I think we're all quite susceptible to quote-unquote whatever mental health means you know I'm writing a book on longevity and probably the reason the book is taking so long to be completed is because I just can't finish this chapter on emotional health it's the final chapter it's the 17th chapter in a book but I feel strongly about writing it because through my own sort of journey I've realized that none of this other stuff I guess really matter how long you live if you're miserable longevity means nothing if it's married to misery but it's very hard to do and people keep asking me how's the chapter on mental health coming and I keep saying I'm not I'm not calling it mental health because it strikes me as a bit of a loaded term it's really emotional health and it doesn't come with a diagnosis and it doesn't come with an icd-10 code and it doesn't have a chapter in the Diagnostic and

[01:55:33] Statistical Manual the dsm-5 and all these other things I don't know if it means that Steve had quote-unquote mental illness I mean the bottom line is it's just a tragedy in this sense and it's just an extreme example but it doesn't in any way it comes back to this point which is maybe it's true 80% of athletes may have this total loss of identity that that can be coupled with some form of depression that follows this and I guess the bigger point because I imagine they're people listening to this who on some level might be saying like I can't even relate to what she's talking about like I'm saying this is the listener and it's true as myself like I'm not even close to being the best at anything like

[01:56:08] I'd give my left arm to be the best at something for one day what would you say to that person it's fleeting I think it's an incredible thrill but I think ultimately it's complicated we're driven by so many things but it's the life that you build it's the relationships and I think where mental health can be exasperated is when there's a lack of relationships Steven was living in a dorm and a training center maybe some people love that and have a sense of camaraderie but maybe some people feel isolated from family and friends and so I think we don't realize how social we are and how much we need each other and we need friendships and family in our lives we've become such an individual society that it's all about me and how good am I and what am i doing versus the community and I think that's why there's been such a spike in rates of depression is this feeling of disconnection and I think it's important to realize that the things that we see people winning an Oscar or winning an

[01:57:19] Olympic gold medal or achieving some great feat it's incredible and it's a life's work and it should be applauded but that shouldn't take away anything from the value of a connected loving life doing something that is fulfilling no matter what that is because ultimately that's something day in and day out that you have to hold on to because all these other things are moments they're moments that pass by where you're quickly replaced by the next person that wins the Oscar next person that wins the Olympic gold medal and you're holding on to a memory but that feeling is it's something you've done you let you'll always have but you still have to step on to that next chapter and try to build those relationships and find satisfaction and fulfillment and build a life again so it's like be careful what you're trading for what how would you help somebody make that transition I mean obviously the first part of it on some level must be accepting what you've said I mean I accept it fully because I've seen it as well right I've I've spent time with the people who have been the best in the world and without exception everything you say is entirely correct based on that experience there is no sum of money there is no number of trophies there is no number of Oscar statues that can accommodate for or compensate for bad relationships or a bad sense of self but the how question is hard right it's what do you do when you wake up in the morning to begin resetting your identity around these things that are less fleeting it takes a lot of work and the work isn't easy because you are letting go of a whole system of values that have defined you to an extreme in your sport and to some extent define society as a whole what we value who we think you know it's the young it's the thin it's the beautiful who we put on billboards and applaud and read about in in magazines and so you have to be willing to let go of what society is projecting as this they're selling thin beautiful you know what are we selling as a society and is that actually making anyone happy you know we think oh when we lose 10 pounds we'll be happier like oh when I'm in this relationship I'll be happy and then you start to realize that these are kind of

[01:59:49] Raja's or false illusions because it's profitable for companies to sell you something and it's easier than looking inside yourself and beginning to change the way that you relate to yourself and relate to the world and I think that's just so there's many many books to read but it's a slow unfolding it takes time and you have to kind of be curious and want to put in the work but it's very difficult to let go of the only thing you've ever known of the way that you're supposed to live and what everyone else applies it's much easier to just play the game the way everyone else is playing the game and then hold up the trophy and then everyone applauds you but then at the end of it you oh-ho it's great for the day and then it just kind of wears off and then it's just like this this trophy but what are you now it's funny in some ways athletes have it the worst and maybe that's why athletes become some of the most powerful examples we have to talk about these things because I'm sure you've heard David Foster Wallace's this is water I said anybody who's listened to this podcast will hear me go on and on about it constantly and I can't recommend it highly enough anyone who's hearing this at this point in time and don't know what I'm talking about hit pause on your podcast player right now and then go to YouTube and then put in

[02:01:00] David Foster Wallace this is water and I thought a 24 minute talk is going to come up and I want you to sit down close your eyes and listen to it and then I want you to do that every day for the next week and then every week for the next three months and then every month thereafter that's that's the doctor's prescription right now but he talks about not athletes specifically but he talks about this idea of self of worship we worship things we worship our intellect our bodies our wealth whatever and to your point they're all hollow I think it's just that athletes figure this out quicker because the window in which you can be great is so much narrower than say the window in which you could be rich or the window in which you can be the smartest or the window in which you can be the fill in the blank it's condensed it's so condensed it's just a super amplified play on the same theme in some way I was actually just an

[02:01:54] Ireland and it would rain and there'd be something full of it and there would rain and be something a little bit and every time it rained I would take it so personally no like the day's gonna be ruined and how did I plan a trip at this time and it's a short summer and I should have figured this out but then I'd be sunny five minutes later and it just showed me how much we identify we it's all about grasping an aversion we want to be successful we don't want to be forgotten and we usually things are on a longer timeline so we can't really see it because we're in it but the weather was changing so fast in Ireland that I could kind of just see the folly of it and the undulation of human emotions that aren't completely rational it's only when it was that close together and tying over to be an athlete it's at such a heightened extreme it's such a short period of time where you're like this hero you're on a Wheaties box you're everything and then you're forgotten and you know it's the next Olympian that they put on the Wheaties box and is going on a speaking tour and it's like okay you're just not that relevant why I mean I guess taking what I said a moment ago Olympic athletes are literally the most extreme version of this because even you know the average player in the

[02:03:04] NFL might have a tenure of three or four years which is relatively short compared to baseball or basketball but as you said an Olympian on average is one Olympics which means two weeks can you imagine being the best in the world at something where your entire pinnacle is two weeks that is a real manifestation and it's hard for me to imagine that that's just a coincidence with this idea that 80% of

[02:03:29] Olympians post their career could experience depression it's hard for me to believe that's just a coincidence the way that we identify the way we see ourselves is completely responsible for our sense of well-being and if you set impossible standards or you know that if you're second best in the world that's the biggest failure and disappointment you're making the margin for feeling successful so narrow and that even if you meet it it's only a temporary high it's irrelevant you're gonna pass through it before you experience it and it's a temporary high - you know it's like a chocolate cake you eat the chocolate here you feel great and then the chocolate cake is gone and

[02:04:10] I got shouldn't be in the talking not exactly like that but it passes by and I think that we have to think about the way we set up and define success and its success the same thing as happiness because I think in sports being successful means perhaps sacrificing and being unhappy and enduring for a very very long time to be successful and to be gratified for for moments or days but it's not the same thing as cultivating a sense of well-being and being content and loving your relationships and having meaningful work and what you do that has been very much undervalued in our society and I think we're seeing a little bit of a lash back in the sense that a lot of people are interested in meditation and in yoga and in the sense of community and there's a little bit of lash back on this individual achiever as being the kind of wherewithal for for success and joy and the answer because people get there and I clove this actually isn't it like you know turnaround although it doesn't show at all you're expecting a little guy soon huh I am a testament to how tiny you are that even when you're pregnant used to look super tiny it's so exciting and the idea of being a mother and moving into this next chapter of my life is I guess there's not words you know I try to think about what it means my whole life was so focused on myself and what I did that I think having the chance to live for someone else and to create a life for someone else is just again it's part of the arc of being human and I'm so excited for all that it brings and it's been a complete diversion from planning to see every country and to so many books that I wanted to read which have now all been replaced with books on expecting and babies and I'm just like uh this is putting me so behind in my reading but it's such a joy and reminder that that life is so much bigger than just you and and the gift and wonder of creating life you know all these things that we consciously work so hard to do and create and yet the magnitude of what our bodies can unconsciously do and create and give life to is just so incredible if you stop to think about it you know which is it's a huge joy and as

[02:06:33] I was telling you earlier I would like my child to not play sports at a very high level but I want to fulfill you in a healthy way all the fantasies that I never had in my childhood and you know the debate team and playing guitar and spending time in the you know wilderness classes so well I'm sure that there'll be a lot of detours and opinions of the child zone is your Olympic medal somewhere in your apartment is it is it featured is it one of those things that sits in a sock drawer or is it something that sits out there it's so funny my mom actually has it and it's it's on top of her it's kind of like mounted on top of her dresser it's as much hers as yours isn't it yeah and I think when I moved to New York I kind of left some of that stuff behind and it was very important for me to split and and create a new identity and not hold on to that so I really I really let it go and just focused on you know I adopted my legal name Alexandra and I was Alex at school and I just really pushed forward but when I wanted to take

[02:07:37] I had two Olympic rings I wanted to take them with me and wear them my mom said I should get to keep one of them she's like I you know I'm putting a lot of time and work and to be fair I can't even imagine now you know as I'm expecting just sacrifice and dedication for you know over 15 years of her life was about me was taking me to different ice rinks and physical therapists and and I say you know what I'll leave her both rings you know she she deserves that but it's again you just the metal is a metal and I'm not again it's what it represents and the journey of my life and how figure skating and sport defined me is incredible and I can't imagine who

[02:08:20] I would be today without that but again it's an object so it's not something I feel compelled to have or put on a wall or have near me but it is representative of this moment of my life you were really fortunate to have motherhood demonstrated for you like amazingly right when you think about what you learned from your and how you're going to write your own playbook that's gonna look different right I mean presumably your kids not going to be figure skating ten hours a day so it's not going to be your either way you know time in ice rink yeah but what are the one two or three things that you will take from the lessons your mom lived the practice that you saw in her as a mother to your son and potentially other children and down the line I think a sense of selflessness and commitment to the family and just what it means to be a mother and and what a privilege it is and I think in society we don't always honor and worship the mother and the way that she should be and that she gives life and and it's you know it's kind of in the past has been relegated to kind of make the home but what we respect is what people do out in the world it's just part of creating your own set of values and and thinking for yourself of like what is actually valuable and I think at the end of anyone's life they'll say it's like the time they spent with their kids and their loved ones you know even these little small moments I think for me having been homeschooled and had my my whole you know a lot of the team around me focused on what I did it created a self centered way of seeing the world and so I think this opportunity to step back and have not life be about like what am I gonna do am

[02:10:15] I gonna be good enough or what's the next thing or how are people perceiving me but giving the gift of life and having my my son and you know show me to kind of really can you know I think a lot of times when we get to a certain place in life we we were a little bit set in our ways of like what we expect what disappoints us how things should be and I think what I've heard from from friends and parents is that your child is your greatest teacher because when they see something for the first time or they ask you about something it's the sense of play that you kind of forget about because you're worried about responsibilities or how things should be

[02:10:53] I'm very much looking forward to that and I think you know I want to expose my child to the world to travel to show him how big the world is and to really just explore it and you know life is this incredible adventure and so it's not really about becoming anything like becoming a product or becoming really good at something it's I think just having this huge life full of love and an adventure well I mean I can't see into the future but my intuition tells me you will embrace and succeed misuk seeds may be the wrong word but for lack of a better word you will certainly embrace and succeed in motherhood in a way that you've done in everything else to date and I suspect it will only enhance this journey that you're on and

[02:11:37] I want to thank you so much for taking the time in the being vulnerable with us to sort of share a lot of this stuff I I know it's hard sometimes for normal people like me to try to extract insights from the best people in the world at something but I think you've done a great job of reminding us that whether you're the best at something that seems you know like there can only be one best in the world it is fleeting there's probably no arena in which that fleeting nature of greatness is more evident than in the
