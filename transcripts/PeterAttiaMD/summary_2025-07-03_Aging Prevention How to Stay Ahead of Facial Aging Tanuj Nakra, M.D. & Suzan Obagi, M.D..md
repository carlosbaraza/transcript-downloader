This clip is from episode  355 – Skincare strategies, the science of facial aging, and cosmetic-intervention guidance | Tanuj Nakra, M.D. & Suzan Obagi, M.D.

In this clip, they discuss:

- Preventative Care Starts Early – Most patients don’t think about facial aging until changes are already visible, missing the benefits of early intervention
- Early Changes Are Best Managed Early – Micro adjustments in volume, skin tone, and symmetry are easier to address before they compound
- Education Reduces Overcorrection – Educating patients early prevents chasing problems later with overly aggressive treatments
-  Mineral vs. Chemical Sunscreen Debate – Why mineral sunscreens are preferred and why certain chemical ingredients like avobenzone raise concerns
- Simple Habits Make the Difference – Daily cleansing and using the right products consistently can be more impactful than expensive procedures
