Full title: #102 – Michael Osterholm, Ph.D.: COVID-19—Lessons learned, challenges ahead, and reasons for optimism and concern

In this episode, Michael Osterholm, Director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota and author of Deadliest Enemy: Our War Against Killer Germs, provides an overview on the COVID-19 pandemic in regards to what has happened to date, what we’ve learned about how the disease spreads, and his optimism and pessimism about what potentially lies ahead. Michael gives his take on the true case fatality rate, why it differs around the world, and which underlying conditions, such as obesity, impact risk of severe illness and death. We also discuss the outlook regarding vaccines, repurposed drugs/antivirals for treatment, and Michael’s growing concern about supply chain limitations with respect to drugs, vaccines, n95 masks, and testing kits.

We discuss:
-Recapping the brief history of COVID-19 and what potentially lies ahead [2:15];
-Some positive news about immunity and reinfection [10:45];
-Case fatality rate—the challenge in finding the true rate, difference by country, and the impact of age, underlying conditions, and obesity [13:00];
-What has to be true for less than 100,000 Americans to die from COVID-19? [24:30];
-How do we best protect healthcare workers? [29:45];
-Concerns about testing capability—reagent shortfall and a supply chain problem [39:30];
-Vaccines and antivirals—The outlook, timing, and challenges [47:45];
-Long term health of survivors of COVID-19 [56:45];
-The impact of comorbidities—Diabetes, obesity, and immunosuppressed patients [59:30];
-Understanding R0 and how the disease spreads [1:01:30];
-The challenge of forecasting with so many unknowns [1:08:00];
-What explains the difference in cases and fatalities in different parts of the world? [1:14:30];
-Repurposed drugs/antivirals being considered for treatment options—any optimism? [1:16:45];
-A parting message from Michael about what lies ahead [1:18:30]; and
-More.

[00:00:03] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter Atia this podcast my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness . and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level at the end of this episode I'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to

[00:00:42] Peter Atia MD com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode welcome back to another special episode of the drive focusing on co vid 19 my guest today is dr. Michael osterholm you may have seen Michael on the Joe Rogan podcast a few weeks ago I saw him then and was immediately impressed reached out to him and asked if he'd like to come on our show which he graciously agreed to

[00:01:09] Michael is the director of the Center for infectious disease research and policy at the University of Minnesota he's also the author of a book that in many ways foreshadowed this book is called deadliest enemy our war against deadly germs and in that book in particular he foreshadows a lot of what we're going through today Mike and I in this discussion talk about everything from our best understanding of what's happening in the United States with respect to the spread and the slowing of the virus what he's optimistic about what he's pessimistic about what he thinks the end state looks like and what you'd have to believe is true if that is to be altered we also get into the weeds a little bit on some technical things around supply chain limitations with respect to drugs with respect to masks with respect to vaccines there are a number of things we discuss and again I think just for the purpose of simplicity

[00:02:02] I rather than get into a laundry list of everything we talked about I think if you're if you've got this far you're probably interested in hearing it so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with dr. Michael Oscar on [Music] Mike thank you so much for making time to sit down with us for some time today and again I want to thank you because I just know that you are constantly being bombarded by requests and there's sort of a challenge you have to deal with which is on the one hand you want to be able to do your job but on the other hand it's somewhat important for people like you doing your job to be able to communicate with the rest of us what you're seeing and more importantly what the implications are and what can be done about it well thank you very much Peter it's very good to be with you and I think that it's venues like yours that serve a very important role in getting information out today far too much of what we deal with is in sound bites it's in three-minute segments and I think that's really hard to convey the complexities and the overall short term long term view of what's happening here so I'm really pleased to be with you thank you well yeah you're in the right spot we're not fans of sound bites here so we'll get right to it and we'll get deep so let's start with kind of the 30,000 foot view which is when we sit here today recording this on March 30th it feels like an eternity ago that you were on

[00:03:25] Joe Rogan's podcast doing what I thought was just an excellent job of giving Joe and Joe's audience an overview of what we knew at the time what we didn't know at the time what the concerns were what do you feel more optimistic about relative to that time which has probably been three weeks what do you feel less optimistic about well first of all I think that it's important to understand as C Lewis Carroll once said if you don't know where you're going any road will get you there and I think that one of the things that I've been very concerned about is we don't really know where we're going and that's not because the virus hasn't given us lots of clues just very briefly to take a step back just for reminding everybody where we've been we've been following this situation very closely since the end of December last year I have been very actively involved I was involved with the SARS investigation in 2003 very involved with

[00:04:19] MERS on the Arabian Peninsula and have obviously done a lot of work an influenza pandemic preparedness and play and so when this first happened and we saw these cases in Wuhan it was really to us oi oh my here comes another SARS or MERS like experience which actually in retrospect those were the easy ones because patients were not becoming highly infectious till the fifth or sixth day of illness you could identify him quickly get him into appropriate isolation so you didn't infect others and we could follow up in their context but it became very clear to us by the second week of January it was happening

[00:04:57] Wuhan was not SARS and Merck this was acting much more like an influenza virus in terms of transmission dynamic lots have spread very quickly and so on January 20th we actually put a document out saying that this was going to be a worldwide pandemic almost two months before the WH OD it we were convinced that we would see spread on February third we put out an additional document that said it would probably take until the end of February early March before we would see cases around the world in any meaningful way because it just the transmission of this virus was such that if we had a sense even then probably had an incubation period of about five days from infection and till the onset of symptoms and that if had an are not or the number of people that you transmit on an average basis to of about two to 2.4 you go from one to two to four to eight to 16 to 32 and knowing that the cases in China were largely about 80% were not seeking medical care they were sick but it wasn't sufficient we said you know it'll probably into February well sure enough it was we also put on a document in mid-february saying that when it did start to show up would probably hit hot spots metropolitan areas because of number one that's where most of the transportation communication of people from China to the rest of the world would be second of all that's where the population density was high note so that you would actually see this amplification sure enough as you know now that's exactly what we've seen so having said that it seems that we kind of know what's going on here and I'll say right now we wrote done with that I don't know where this virus is gonna go next in terms of how long it'll be around you can make assumptions what we see with influenza I think some of those are helpful but I don't think that they're necessarily definitive people talk about seasonality I remind people all the time that we don't see that with the other two coronaviruses SARS was not seasonality just because I didn't in

[00:06:54] June it was in a situation where we first understood we had a problem in February it took us literally several months to figure out this infectivity period get people isolated stop transmission get palm civets out of the markets of the Guangdong province and then it ended it if you look at MERS and I've been there standing outside of a hospital in Abu Dhabi it was 110 degrees and transmission was going on just fine thank you it was not at all being halted by the weather and because of course camels we're not going to be put down as such it just continues to transmit on the Arabian Peninsula year round and our primary means of donor they're just making sure that people don't trample on the hospital setting so if you take that but also take in for Windsor because this is where people come back on the seasonality piece and they say well you know it's probably gonna be like influenza we forget that while influenza transmits seasonally in the winner of each northern and southern hemispheres it transmits year-round in the tropics never stops transmitting if you look at the last ten influenza pandemics over the last 250 years to started in the winter three started in the spring two started in the summer and three started in the fall and every one of them had their big peak six months after the original cases showed up in 2009 with h1n1 it showed up in mid to late March and we had a big peak mid September to mid-october North America was still warm so I don't know what its gonna do going forward but that's where when you ask me good news bad news I have every reason to believe that it won't stop transmitting in any meaningful way till we get 50 or 60 or 70 percent of the population infected which means that the bad news is that we are going to have to deal with those cases unless we can suppress them and we can talk about what the implications that are if we suppress them meaning that we do what wuhan did and the Chinese in Wuhan did of basically shutting down everything in the

[00:08:54] Koni and manor we've ever seen in modern quarantine history that means were going to shut down her country will shut down the economy in any meaningful way and that's just about dollars and cents who's gonna pick up the garbage who's gonna basically be firing police who's gonna do all the things that we count on I'm pessimistic about the fact that we don't have an easy way out I like to say that right now we either suppress this and have this implication we talked about it hope that we can suppress it long enough till we get a vaccine which I don't think will be any sooner than 18 months or we let it go willy-nilly and we will bring down health care systems many thousands to millions of people will die and our health care systems will collapse or we try to thread the Rope through the needle and hit the middle how do we find a way to have those people who are at lowest risk of having serious disease problems who are at the highest risk of dying be in our workforce be more public and handle the issues so if we can do that that's good news if we can't the rest of it's pretty bad news like the numbers you just rattled off as sort of potential projections is that worldwide or was that a domestic figure that's in the United States I mean if you look at you know do the math and just a little over 300 million people if you're talking about 60% of those infected you're talking 170 to 175 million people if you talk about 80 percent of those having relatively milder illness now you're talking twenty percent that are going to have some illness will likely require hospitalization if you then take that down to even one or two percent of those who might die you can just do the simple math and you realize we're talking about millions and that's I don't think people understand yet is that this virus is going to keep going it is very much like an influenza virus in that regard it will go until it finds enough immune people that shut it down I mean if they don't let transmission continue and that's what I don't think people are prepared to understand you is they think that these waves are going to happen over the next two to three weeks and then we're done just remind people that right now in China here we are the end of March this clearly was president in China in mid to late November and we're still seeing transmissions that chyna even with these draconian measures to limit transmission there are people in the Wuhan area who've not been out of their house in 15 weeks and yet we still see cases occurring so this is gonna happen here where it'll be months and months potentially of transmission and I hate the thought of the fact that the one of the primary ways that we limit that transmissions are just enough people get infected and develop immunity

[00:11:31] I might have one good news piece on the immunity piece this is an important one I think we can say with more certainty that there probably is durable immunity at least for the short term and what I mean by that is there was a study completed and published last week using macaque monkeys and they infected a group of them with the virus they all came down with kind of the classic corona virus like illness they then waited until they fully recovered they reach allenge them a month later and all of them are protected against under each a lunge none of them got infected again and just to make sure I know what the reach allenge implied were they PCR negative IgG positive IgM negative yes they were I can't say they're i GM negative I'd have to go back and look at that but they were definitely IgG positive and PCR negative yep and so we have evidence clearly and they didn't just do PCR they did culture - so they actually were actually looking for the actual virus in other words they weren't just looking for surface proteins no no exactly and so I think this study really gave us more hope that there really is durable immunity at least in the short term I can't say it's going to be years and years I know that if you have short-term immunity oftentimes that bodes well for a long-term immunity picture so that's actually an important positive step that these are gonna be people who will be and I call kind of the human logic rods and the virus reaction they will slow it down and today they could be the people that could be out there in the world not worried about getting infected and also would not infect others yeah I was having a discussion with one of the members of my team today and anyone who's ever worked with me knows I play this game called the what you have to believe game which is sort of a way to probe the limits of what biology could tell us so we got a little deep in the weeds on this and I said look imagine for a moment two extreme scenarios scenario one is this particular coronavirus Tsarskoe v2 is a total nothing burger it's just another respiratory virus it's getting a lot of attention right now but the reality of it is when it all plays out and everybody gets infected it's gonna have a mortality that's equal to or less than influenza etc etc if that is true how would you explain the current data through that paradigm and we walk through it but at the other end of the spectrum I said what if it's worse what if it's the virus that could wipe our civilization off the map again I don't think either of these extremes are correct but it became a good illustration of what would have to be true what do you have to believe if

[00:14:06] Tsarskoe v2 and co vid 19 will eradicate our species well you'd have to believe the following one there is no long term immunity to each successive infection is worse than the previous one and 3 no effective treatments will be developed if those 3 things are true this would be the virus that eradicate sauer species fortunately I don't believe any of those are true and you're making a very compelling case for at least the first of those not being true and by the way they would all have to be true for the scenario I just described so I take that as some good news I do want to ask I mean it literally just came out I think 20 minutes ago did you happen to see that Lancet paper that came out going over the revised numbers in China in terms of case fatality I have not seen that one I have seen a similar one but help me maybe it is the same one I've seen well so this one basically took the original case fatality rate of 1.3 8% but followed it up and added a whole bunch of more people to the denominator that were previously in the unconfirmed bucket so you took a bunch of people that we run confirmed you've now gone on to confirm them and the case fatality rate now looks to be zero point six six percent again largely on the basis of not subtracting mortality but adding denominators does that surprise you and what do you think the CFR looks like if one could truly measure all the people that are in that category of having an infection but not being either clinically significant enough to warrant attention or simply falling through the cracks due to socioeconomic factors testing limitations etc yeah let me take two pieces of information and go at that first one is you're absolutely correct it's a numerator denominator issue now the challenge I think in adding to the denominator is that you can add quite a bit to that and drive the overall case fatality rate or CFR down but what we're also missing is the number of people in the numerator and our contacts in wuhan during that time period who were pretty reliable actually concluded in their assessment that probably six to eight people were dying every day outside a hospital that were not being counted meaning that they were not being tested and if you weren't tested you weren't counted and so think about this if you have a case fatality rate of 1% one over 100 and you suddenly add a hundred poor people to that you now have a case with saturated of 0.5 400 okay half of what it was on the other hand if you have that same 200 you added 100 more doubled it but you also add 10 more people who died who weren't counted only 10 now you looking at 11 over 200 and you're now at 5% plus so the numerator is actually more sensitive in terms of impacting the rate than is the denominator and so one of the challenges that we've had is what is that overall numerator and how many cases were missed these are been well written up these cases so I I don't know what it is but let me tell you what I think is important now we've known this I think from early on in China that these comorbidities we talk about this other underlying conditions play a very important role we've known about that with influenza for years their comorbidities can affect you in several ways one of course is the occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome or a

[00:17:42] RDS and the cytokine storm picture in some cases there's appears to be kind of a myocarditis type picture that can occur and of course there's always secondary bacterial pneumonias but I'm going to count those in there because that in a sense is is something we can often deal with with antibiotics but what happened in China was is if you look at the overall case fatality rate by age we saw this exorbitant rate in those over age 65 who are male well if you look closely in China almost 70 percent of men over age 65 smoked and less than two percent of women over that same age group so right there you could have a impact on that situation because smoking has always been associated with worse outcome with these kind of viruses and ironically the other risk factors essential hypertension was also seen as a risk factor for bad outcome but beyond that there wasn't much else obesity which has been highly associated with bad outcomes is actually quite rare in the older population of China it's it's primarily under age 30 where there are starting to see a real epidemic there well okay let's fast-forward to the

[00:18:52] United States we are now getting data out of New York we're seeing an increased number of severe illnesses and deaths and people between the ages of 25 and 50 and almost to a tee the risk factor appears to be obesity forty five percent of our population over age 50 is considered moderate to severe ly obese today this that one risk factor on top of that renal disease has been shown in the past to be associated with bad outcomes 700,000 Americans are living alive today with end-stage renal disease and when you start adding up all these comorbidities that we uniquely have in part because a lifestyle or because we happen to have a healthcare system that's able to keep us alive and with the right drugs and so forth so we don't really know when you put this virus here what it's going to do a good example of that is the difference between a Korea and Italy Korea right now has actually just climbed over 1% it had been below that and part of that was a function is the big outbreak that they and we had that they worked up extensively in the thousands of people within this religious sect the median age of that group was 43 so you know right there you had a younger population that surely would have had a lowercase doubter it you go to Italy and right now about 80 percent of their cases are over age 80 with underlying health problems and they have an 8% case fatality rate so I think that one of the things we're going to find with case fatality it's going to be really country by country dependent it's going to matter where the virus is circulating and what age group and it's going to matter in a large part as to what the underlying health conditions are in China there's almost nothing ever called a nursing home or long-term care facility people are cared for in the home in the United States right now we're sitting in a powder keg long-term care facilities for which for years we've neglected them in terms of infection control I can't tell you how many long-term care facilities we have right here in Minnesota they couldn't find one in a 95 in their house that they needed - not one in 95 I think that we actually stand the risk over the course of the next several months I've seen it probably one of the highest case fatality rates in the world right here that's the first point of what I would say the second part though you deal with this every day every flu season you are constantly confronted with this increased occurrence of illnesses etc and even during the 2009 h1n1 situation even in a bad h3n2 year in in older people nobody nobody reports what's happening what's happening now in places like New York and Detroit and Atlanta and Seattle and so I think that what's happening here actually matches up with the severity that we believe it really is occurring I've come to the point in my old age that when something walks like a duck looks like a duck and quacks like a duck I think it's probably a doc what would you put on the floor as the estimate for the CFR in a fully diluted sample do you think that there's a scenario under which the CFR is 0.1% again fully diluted meaning you actually know all the infected people or do you think that that's really just a pipe dream in the best case scenario is closer to point four point five that's a pipe dream to me and I think it's going to be in the 1 to 2.5 range and I think that it's going to be heavily influenced by those who are over age 65 70 and I think it's going to be influenced by the frequency of obesity in the younger age group in that regard

[00:22:33] Mike I've never wanted someone to be wrong more than I want you to be wrong because if the CFR is one to two percent in the United States and you're right about the spread of this virus the implication of that is more Americans will die from this infection in the next 12 months then will die of all other causes combined and I am absolutely on your side with this one you will get no argument for me I hope I'm wrong I would welcome that opportunity to be wrong I just look at what's happening right now

[00:23:08] I look at indirect indicators a good example right now today the New York Police Department reported out over 900 police officers in New York are infected right now 13% of the work force is out they just had their third death today in police officers and when you start looking at that and this is just getting started when you start looking at that and compare that to a bad flu season which you and I have to deal with far too often with a vaccine on top of it by the way and we know what happens look at this one this one has that potential I think to be in the 1 to 2 I don't think this at all is going to be like 1918 because that was so unique and how it took out 18 to 30 year olds this one's not doing that this is going to clearly be associate with age and underlying health issues but in some ways we are a population that is highly vulnerable because of all the other lifestyle and health conditions that occur in our group so I think that that's where I'm very concerned about it and would agree with you a hundred percent of what you just said can I dare say on a given week in New York City in the past 100 people die a day in New York right now we're averaging close to a hundred and fifty a day just dying from colvin 19 think about that if we're gonna play that what-if game a moment ago what if this is something that is quote-unquote only going to result in fewer than 100,000 lives lost in the

[00:24:44] United States which again still seems for most people struggling to understand what non-linearity means were a little over 2,000 deaths today so even to propose that this could be capped at a hundred thousand it seems very extreme but I think you would agree that if only a hundred thousand Americans were to die before this thing was completely contained you would consider that a victory absolutely what has to be true for that to happen what are the things that have to happen scientifically policy-wise in terms of personal behavior responsibilities like what are the suite of things that must be true if that number is to stay below a hundred thousand in the next year I think two things one is we have to basically suppress transmission as much as we can which I don't think is doable and I say that because it would mean a wuhan leg shutdown and I just don't think as a country we can sustain that I think even and I don't want to equate this in dollars and cents I had an op-ed piece in The New York Times over the weekend in which I said this is not a choice between saving lives and costing the economy we have to look at it's a combination of both and we need people to carry on every day I mean I look at you I mean I don't want anything to happen to you for a lot of reasons but one of them is you're a very key health care provider you got to do your job you can't shut down we can't shut down I mean when's the last time you saw anybody do remote work to pick up garbage if you live in New York City guess what elevator operators maintenance people are really important because if you can't get up to the 40th floor you shut down a part of the city that's really important so I can go through a laundry list of whether it's foods you know people who provide our food etc so we've got it preserve that part of it but at the same time I worry that what's going to happen is an acceleration of deaths due to the failing of the healthcare system right now keeping people live on ventilators having intensive care medicine does make a difference not for every case but it makes a difference but once you go off the edge of the cliff where it's now no longer do you have a ventilator available you have to wait for someone to go off of int and you have to make a choice to take them off when you start running out of the critical supplies one of the things that we've been working on in our Center for the last year and a half has been looking at a very acute critical drug shortages meaning these are drugs you need right now or in the next several hours or people die what's on the crash cart what's in the intensive care unit what's in the ER we came with a list of 156 drugs which we have vetted with all the major medical groups intensivist cetera all these 156 all of them are generic all of them of those almost 85% are made outside the United States and of those many more made in China we are just beginning to feel the severe supply chain collision that's going to occur here in the next several weeks with increased number of cases of severe disease and these drugs that we need because in China the supply chains which were still thin were filled just before this outbreak started and there's about two to three months worth of supply in the chain but there was nothing that came in the back side of it so we're just about done so if you add more time theater this also then means now you got to deal with that situation on top of it if our healthcare system can't take care of these people or we have acute shortages of what we need to provide the care we have been providing then the case fatality rates gonna go way up it's gonna go up and that's I think a real challenge so just to be clear you're not saying that we're gonna run out of pick your favorite candidate drug that I want to eventually talk about with you you know rim to severe versus hydroxychloroquine etc you're saying epinephrine norepinephrine vasopressin paralytics the type of medicine we all take for granted that you need to run an

[00:28:45] ICU but even take something as simple as antibiotics when you're a sitting in ICU for three and a half weeks the chance of developing no skomal infection as a result of being there it's pretty much guaranteed it's almost guaranteed so if you don't have the antibiotics anymore guess what even 5% of all of our key antibiotics right now are made outside the United States ironically you know the two areas that have the most production capability

[00:29:08] China in the Lombardy region of Italy can you imagine it couldn't make that up you couldn't make it up you couldn't and so I mean there's something we're looking at so I think that you know the question is relative if we had ideal intensive care availability we can maintain the system we could take that kind of that spicket of cases and regulate them enough so that they didn't overflow the healthcare system they just appeared I like to say if we have a hundred cases of the disease today and they all hit the healthcare system that's one outcome what if you have a hundred and they hit the healthcare system 10 a week for 10 weeks that's another outcome if we could do that if we could thread that needle with our rope then we'd be ok but I don't think we're gonna be able to do that do you think we have a pretty good handle on what it's going to take to protect health care workers do we understand what amount of PPE is necessary first and foremost and then secondly of course can we meet that need can we meet the demand of that starting with the first question do we actually know what it takes to protect doctors nurses respiratory therapists and everybody who works in a hospital from the cafeteria to the parking garage yeah I think we know I don't think we talked about it very well and we have people who are in denial about it I've spent my career working on both coronaviruses and influenza I can tell you we have absolute certainty today no question about it that influenza virus is in part transmitted by ear assaults these are the smaller particles of more than five nanometer particles and people assume when we talk about airborne transmission we're talking about something that's many many yards away and they actually forget that aerosols are produced just where droplets are when right in that first six feet area and so if you're that close if you have a surgical mask on you surely can do a lot to minimize the number of droplets you come in contact with but that doesn't take into account the aerosol where there's droplets there's errors where there's aerosols there may not be droplets but people have assumed its droplets or then it's aerosol somewhere else and so I think from a respiratory protection standpoint one of the challenges we had in China with well close to 4,000 healthcare workers infected right now in Italy there's well over 5,600 healthcare workers who have been infected now some of them obviously got infected off the job but many of them were on job in respiratory protection was a key factor in each one and so I today feel incredibly incompetent incapable and frankly sad that they're going to be many health care workers who are going to risk their lives to help with this will not have in 95 respirator which they need to have because we just don't have enough we won't and when I keep hearing about this additional production the White House continues to talk about that they never give you the numbers of what we estimate will need versus what's being produced and it's so far short it's not laughable because that would imply something funny there's nothing funny about it but the bottom line message is that we're gonna have a lot of health care workers are going to be exposed and infected with this virus because of that what is the number Mike what would we need I don't know I think this is where again we have a PPE challenge here particularly within 95 that was even much more severe than they had in China or to that extent in

[00:32:30] Italy they did several unique things which I don't know if we'll do here you may have heard but in several of the really high-volume wards in Milan they had Cova infected healthcare workers working if they weren't that sick they were working they went in without mass etc because they didn't have them and so

[00:32:50] I don't know what we'll do here but I do believe we'll have a real challenge with this now some will say well and this is what I find very frustrating is we have to stick with the science and what happened with CDC to their credit about two weeks ago issued new guidelines for the use of PPE respiratory protection but what they said was if you don't have in 95s then use mass but a number of administrators and some scientists have come forward and said CDC recommendation saying you don't have to use respirators where you can use mass meaning it's just droplet that's not what they said and so I think that today for a healthcare worker they just at least have to know what they're getting into I think many almost don't go to work I mean the camaraderie and you know what it's like to be in that kind of setting these are some of the most amazing heroes in the world we don't send our soldiers into war without some kind of protective equipment or without bullets in their guns we send health care workers into this viral battle and we're gonna be sending them in without bullets or without protective equipment and that to me is really sad but that's what's gonna have to take that's gonna be a big question as to what happens there so really we have a problem on multiple fronts we have a problem on the on the supportive drug front we have a problem on the treatment drug front which I want to come back to in a moment we have a problem on the people who are going to administer care we potentially have a problem on the number of ventilators and actual beds etc so is it a largely irrelevant academic exercise to understand which of those things becomes the first failure because it varies so much presumably by City

[00:34:33] Hospital geography that it ought to be an all-hands-on-deck for all of them I mean is there a model here where we pick the ten cities that are either in the throws of hell or we know are about to be and we start relocating health care workers to those areas if that's the thing that we believe is going to be the bottleneck first of course that would only make sense if you could provide them with the necessary PPE otherwise you're losing your soldiers in battle unnecessarily without an appropriate risk to benefit trade-off how do we think about this I mean I haven't spent a lot of time truly thinking about this at the full macro level of what the White House would hopefully be thinking about this but I mean what is the model what can we learn from these successes and failures of any other pandemic well first of all let me just say you articulated it beautifully you hit on every major piece let me just give some kind of relevant information

[00:35:26] I'll give you a sense right now the largest manufacturer in the United States have in 95s is 3m they can produce 35 million in 95s a month they're trying to wrap that up to get maybe five to seven percent more out of their machines okay you just don't build these machines overnight so even when you hear other companies talk about how they're going to double or triple whatever production it is be very skeptical because these are machines that are really very very sophisticated pieces of equipment I mean for example with an n95 most people don't realize that piece of white in front of you is not paper it's a matrix that was actually poured and dried and it has a unique electrostatic charge on it etc so you can get air through but not virus it's a very sophisticated thing well they've produced 35 million a month they've been doing it since late January and we met with them and said this is going to be a pandemic there's one

[00:36:21] Hospital in New York alone this one that used 2 million in 95 s last month in that month 2 million in their institution now you start to do the math where we have basically about 35 million of these in the strategic national stockpile that's it you start looking at the volume we'd need of 400 million or more of these in 95 years to get through the first couple of months and you start looking at the shortfall that's where I have a problem is just let's just be honest okay I'm not trying to blame anybody we're all to blame everybody why are we so ill-prepared but health care workers have to know a statement I made earlier about one of the former defense secretary said when you go to war you can't go to worth what you want you have to go to worth what you have and so to understand how do we best protect healthcare workers I think this is a key and let me give you an example well if we can't protect them because we don't have in 95s what are the other things you can do one is we should start forming Ward's large wards where basically we have eighteen or twenty patients on one ward and you never leave the contaminated zone and at that point rather than doff and Doni outside of every room and having to throw that away what do you do second of all what can you do to reuse these we're published an article this week on our website with 3m support and I mean not financial but there intellectual support of what are the techniques we can actually use that will maintain the integrity of these in 95 but they can be reused so that we can decontaminate we're working on that right now next is what can we do to get infected healthcare workers back if I had to ask right now for one gift we could give health care workers is serology I'd like to test as many health care workers as I could for antibody and making having the discussion we just had on the ability to know that somebody's likely protected then I would know also that these are the people of the safest to put back into harm's way if we did a lot of things like that I think we could really mitigate the risk for healthcare workers but what we can't do it just administrative Lee say well the CDC's made this recommendation ignoring that there are things we must do in Kendu and you and I both know that this is a numerator/denominator world we live in when it gets to rates but it's a numerator world when that person that dies is your colleague when that person is somebody who worked for you when that person is somebody who day after day was there with you bedside holding hands doing the kind of skilled work that is so tough on these people and so we also have to understand the mental health issues and if we neglect that I mean I already know health care workers who literally go home and cry all the way home to work after they just finished another 14-hour shift and I think that's another area that I've not heard anybody really talking about much is this is just like battlefield trauma we've got to start helping them right now we're gonna maintain three or four or five months worth of activity here we can't count on these people to do this day in and day out with more help protect them first support them second and understand them and care about them third and they all have to be part of the picture Mike

[00:39:37] I go back to something you said a second ago with respect to testing do we have a sense where we are now I mean these it seems that we've done probably in the neighborhood of 800,000 tests in the United States in total I don't know the breakdown of how many of those are PCR versus antibody but does that sound about right to you it does absolutely yes it does yep okay so tell me the status of

[00:39:59] PCR is Roche providing the majority of these tests yeah I actually commented this also in my op-ed piece New York Times again if there's an operative set of words in this whole entire experience its supply chains supply chain supply chains just like in real estate its location location location we have changed our world in 2003 when SARS occurred China was not a big player in manufacturing the world supply chains weren't that critical to what happened in China well it turns out today the supply chains are everything including for testing and I'll add the perfect storm here one the world basically is on fire everybody wants these reagents for whether it's PCR whether it's antigen detection whether it's serology number to guess where a lot of the reagents were being made China number three now we bring those two together and we're encouraging people to even do more testing and you know what within a couple of weeks we're gonna actually see an implosion of testing right now in

[00:41:04] Minnesota we are so limited in our public health lab to test if we don't have more reagents in tomorrow we're done we can't test anymore commercial companies have been putting together great packages to sell for testing but what they haven't given you is how deep is their inventory of resources for three agents and they're not it used to be we filled the reagent pool with a garden hose then we realized we needed a fire hose and now we need a damn water tunnel and we're not going to have it so it's just at the time we need more testing we're actually gonna and we I've seen these people get on talk shows and they sit there and say oh we just test our way out of this they don't have a clue about a supply chain issue and so I think this is a huge issue that you raised and it's one that we're gonna do less instead of more and that seems counterintuitive but it's what's going to happen so based on that the idea that we should hope for the best scenario where everybody gets PCR to detect and then antibody to follow I mean that's a pipe dream if we're gonna be reagent limited instead it's gonna be a bit of a picture poison and if you're lucky to get any test if that's the setting which it sounds like based on the reagent shortfall we're going to get to that place what other methods can be used for example can we rely on temperature changes can we rely on any other sort of biometric as a way to take patients who are suspected positive but not yet confirmed and enact policy around that this is we're gonna get creative and this was ironically were things like 1918 are instructive we're back to the future you might say first of all we want to know when the viruses in our communities and one is doing harm and we have a system in this country called influenza like illness surveillance or syndromic surveillance we have set up in a whole series of randomly chosen physicians offices around the country and we survey it every week to every several times a week during the flu season to give us an idea of you know if you have this constellation the signs and symptoms is probably highly suggestive of flu and this is what's going on well it was very interesting in New York City flu had started to wind down by early February to mid February and was actually coming down all of a sudden in the end of

[00:43:29] February boom up goes the number and it goes and it goes and it goes long before anybody was tested and guess what it was cold at 19 we see the same thing here in Minneapolis we just saw that thing go up about two and a half weeks ago and it started going up again so I feel confident that we can monitor enough illness in the community this way and other means that we have that we can tell people it's time to put the pedal to the metal okay it's happening we gotta shut it down the best we can and so I think that's the kind of methods that Public Health is going to be reverting to but you raise a good point what can I do for any one patient and I think the only thing we have going for us season wise right now is if they are sick with an influenza like illness it's likely not influenza because we don't see it circulating right now and we can test for that and we haven't seen it so

[00:44:21] I think you have to assume that there are Kovan infected and go with that but it's going to create challenges I mean one of the things we're concerned about right now is in Minnesota our priority is testing first sick individuals who are in the hospital are they really infected on the second thing is to test health care workers were sick whether they're in the hospital not because we want them to work or not and the third thing is testing workers and long-term care that's all we have the ability to test for right now because we don't have any other really agents and I said then we may out run out tomorrow so we're all going to be finding ourselves

[00:44:56] I think in different scenarios and as much as we hear this good news about the new point of care test coming out from Abbott and things like that we welcome all the tests just make sure you have reagents to go with them and what were the challenges yeah so your fear is that this Abbott test could be technically a wonderful test but it might only be able to do a million tests in total before the supply chain falls apart exactly you nailed it that's exactly it and we have been talking to the companies at some length and remember when Abbott says a million they could tell me ten million it's over what time period but it's over a whole world too and that's the problem we have right now and you could not buy a PCR machine right now anywhere in the world the Chinese wouldn't bought them all up 14 weeks ago you can't buy one in the

[00:45:43] United States as soon as they saw what was happening they bought every machine they could and so we're in a global market for these tests - and it's not just the US and that's another reason why this is such unique event is because it is a global house on fire where everybody wants reagent water and the truck can only deliver so much yeah I mean gee I hate saying such stupid glib things but I really feel like we're playing chess not checkers I say this all the time I say we got to stop playing this like I played checkers with my 10 year old grandson which I'm lucky if I beat it when one moved out on the board yeah yeah it just seems like I'm a

[00:46:20] Miss said it but I think you know what I meant like no I know you were right yeah we're playing checkers we're playing one move ahead and the speed with which this is moving again to borrow from Wayne Gretzky right we have to go where the puck is going not where the puck is and it seems like every every step we take is going towards where the puck is but in the case of a viral pandemic the puck moves faster than it moves in any other game and you're really on your heels when you're just going where the puck is as opposed to anticipating where it's going and that's another really important point is you know we plan for catastrophes but we typically plan for a hurricane or an earthquake or a tsunami one region and then we get into recovery right away not that it's not devastating but you know

[00:47:09] FEMA can't be in all 50 states at once and do the magnificent job that we're seeing in New York and frankly many of us fear that you don't want to be on the tail end of this outbreak where you are one of the latter cities to break because by that time a lot of the resources are going to be used and even those that aren't going to be used up where they can be moved like if additional ventilators if you can move them from place to place it's still gonna be a challenge because you will have used so many of the critical things like drugs and so forth and so where you place yourself in this outbreak right now as bad as New York is they have the benefit we're at least now like Seattle they got more resources than most other places will likely get like I've spoken to many people about the situation around vaccines including a number of people sort of off-the-record who work in biotech companies I've spoken with at least three CEOs of biotech companies off the record without exception no one has been able to give me a scenario under which a vaccine is available inside of 12 months can you explain from your point of view why you think that that's likely and why you're saying look we're not gonna have a vaccine until 2021 I always come back and clarify I could make a vaccine tonight for this I could even with my simplistic knowledge of this issue but the questions would it be safe and effective and that's what's key so I think from an effectiveness standpoint I do think we can probably find something that will be effective even if temporarily meaning is not permanent long term protection but something might require boosters we don't really know that yet the whole t-cell b-cell combination of immunity with coronaviruses is still a question

[00:48:56] I'm more optimistic about that where I think is going to hold us up a lot is safety in the 2003 SARS vaccine work there was some real challenges that developed with the animals with something called antibody dependent enhanced with a de where if he made just a little bit of antibody that was bad because then when you got infected with the real thing you had this antibody dependent enhancement there was a shock like picture and it was a real challenge and that's exactly what happened the dengue vaccine in the Philippines that got pulled two years ago was that that vaccine had an a de component to it that nobody had appreciated and because we have a history with this vaccine with a de I think that no regulatory agency at least in North America or EU is going to license that without substantial safety data and if that occurs it let's just say even one for ten to one per hundred thousand population think how many people you have to study before you can actually know is there an increased risk or not and if this was a really common side effect three or four or five percent got it that would be a much easier situation to study so I think that there will surely be pressure to get it evaluated and licensed and made as soon as possible but right now I think the a de thing is one that's going to hang over its head and regulators are gonna make certain that we have enough data to at least begin to address it what's the technical reason for that

[00:50:27] Mike because that's not something that we see with influenza for example no we don't in fact it's more a flavivirus type issue and the corona virus as we've seen it where basically this whole immune system set up and in a sense is somewhat like dengue hemorrhagic fever where you've been infected with one strain and then you have the second strain infection that has enough cross protection but not sufficient to fully protect you and so it really is an immunologic phenomena this is part of why Hep C vaccination has never really been successful as well isn't Hep C also a flavivirus yeah I think that's also but exactly one of the reasons why it's been a problem so I think that's going to be a let me just say there's one other challenge that I think people haven't thought about yet and that is again the supply chain thing where we just assume anybody can do anything because we got something vaccines take manufacturing capacity right now there is no big manufacturing capacity sitting out there empty waiting for some unknown virus to attack us and then cause for a need for a major vaccine program and so right now the only players there's one single one player in this entire effort that even has the capacity to manufacture these this in any meaningful way all the other ones are smaller startup companies that are bringing some good science to the table but they all are likely acquisition type issues where if they got the product they get bought by a big company and move on and relatively speaking the big companies have not gotten involved and I think that we have to also look at how do you make enough of this vaccine for millions and millions and millions of people and how long would that take I remind people that Ebola vaccine which has heavily funded by the defense industry in both the United States and

[00:52:15] Canada because of the concern about a bio weapon used and so therefore when it came into the quote-unquote Ebola battlefield in 2015 a lot of work had been done on it already and it still took almost four years to get that thing licensed with the data that it had and the ability to provide manufacturing dynamics etc so I think if we do everything we possibly can here and we can show it's effective a relative sense of safety being able to find the manufacturing capacity we're still talking 18 months I think at the earliest and that's not because people aren't going to be working 26 hours a day it's just that's what it takes yeah yeah I mean I think another just point to make that and drive at home is just looking at jinguk's when we came out with a much improved vaccine for shingles I don't know if you recall but you couldn't get that vaccine for your patients over 50 I'm one of the high-risk people have an old guy I know that yeah we had a really hard time getting that vaccine for our patients it took many of them needed to wait six months to get it and obviously it's a fraction of the demand so it's just worth sort of contemplating that and and I think the other thing that you know I want to go from this vaccine discussion into the sort of the antivirals you know I read a really interesting statistic the other day that I actually I guess I knew it was not great I didn't know it was this bad but it looked at sort of antiviral drug development from about 1963 until present or there abouts was a couple of years old a little over

[00:53:48] I don't know I want to say in the neighborhood of 5,000 antiviral inhibitors were proposed in the scientific literature but only 90 of these 9-0 were approved for final use over about a 55 to 60 year period and by the way of those 90 about 40 were for HIV so again I'm not minimizing yeah yeah so if you took HIV out of this we're talking about maybe 50 drugs developed with any efficacy and safety to warrant approval in a 55 60 year period of time what does that tell you well I'll tell you what it tells me is I harken back to when I was in medical school and I went to NIH to spend some time there and I was in an immunology lab and I just remember a lecture one day that left such an impression on me which was and this was immunology through the lens of cancer but the point was the t-cell biology is so robust t-cells are so amazing at what they do that they save us from all these viruses that otherwise we'd be hosed from as evidenced by how few we have in terms of effective antiviral drugs in other words if not for the fact that we had a competent immune system that could fight off most viruses we'd be doomed because our hit rate of developing drugs to stop viruses is actually pathetic compared to our ability to stop bacteria no you're absolutely right the good fortune I think is we are today in a better place in part because of the research that HIV led us into and gave us a better sense of how to do research but I would absolutely agree with you anybody thinks this is a slam dunk it's not and I worry about the fact that we've already made judgment to a certain degree about what works and doesn't work I happen to chair for different major work groups for WHL and what they call the Rd roadmaps for epidemic diseases Ebola allows the NEPA and Zika early on Ebola vaccine was moving along fine we were overseen that but the therapeutics were still a question and everybody'd assumed zmapp a monoclonal antibody was the drug if he didn't use e map was almost unethical finally in this most recent outbreak in the DRC a randomized control trial was set up and zmapp didn't even finish in the top five drugs and it was one of those ones where when you realize wow we've been using this for years with the assumption there of I hope that we have very effective drugs in this current regimen approach with the kovin 19 disease but I don't know that we do and

[00:56:25] I think as you so well know we have two kinds of drugs the coracoid for example are immunologic modulators toll-like receptor modulators whereas if we have people dying from a myocarditis type picture well that's a whole different situation we may actually cause problem using Korakuen so I think that we just don't know yet and I hope we have multiple fronts to deal with this but the answers are far from there yet they're just far from being there I want to come back to the antiviral in a sec but I want to pick up on a thread there which is is it now the second time you've mentioned it basically we're so early in this and we're still back on our heels I feel like a boxer who's been punched in the head so hard I'm having a hard time thinking about counter punching all I'm thinking about doing is not getting hit again we haven't really done the analysis on the survivors yet we don't understand how much lingering myocarditis is out there we don't understand how much lingering kidney disease is out there we don't understand how much lingering lung disease remains in terms of fibrosis or permanent destruction of a subset of the numa sites is there anything that you've learned from SARS and MERS about the survivors that we can take as a potential proxy for long-term view on the health of the survivors I can't say from a clinical standpoint I know that Cyrus was the one in and out there surely were over 7000 some survivors and how much subsequent morbidity that they had with that I can't tell you the one thing I can tell you which I think is another observation but hopefully a positive observation is that having done all the work in the Middle East on the Arabian

[00:58:11] Peninsula unlike with SARS or once the palm civets were taken out of the market humans weren't getting pinged anymore with the virus literally stopped it with MERS those camels keep transmitting and transmitting and people who come from herds where they're close to those animals those are the same animals that infected them if they go back to and it turns out that I'm not aware of anyone since 2012 almost eight years who have been infected going back into a high relatively high infection rate in their own animals have ever gotten reinfected again the assumption that I think we have to be careful about does that mean they're really protected or not but we haven't seen that again so I mean that's probably the only take away and come within it but it doesn't answer the very important question you're asking what is that residual what's it all about and even understanding for certain what got us into this situation with underlying comorbidities I mean I'd like to understand more why do certain comorbidities actually predispose you to a bad outcome what is it about that yeah I was gonna ask you what do you think for example in I mean type 2 diabetes makes a bit more sense but what about type 1 diabetes where there still seems to be an increased risk and that's especially concerning for young people exactly I don't know that and of course that's gonna be overlaid with obesity so then you're gonna have both issues operating at the same time how much of that is compromised lung capacity how much wood is actually the diabetes that's what's really unclear what about immune compromised what do we know about immune suppressed patients we've actually tried to get more information from the Chinese on that we've actually made formal requests for that information and all we get back is saying is that they didn't see any big increase in immune compromised people whether they surviving cancer patients who may have been predisposed to an immunocompromised condition etc no one has reported out of the Chinese data I've not seen it out of the data from Italy other than to say what do you mean by immune compromised you're over 80 what does that mean but from a clinical standpoint not someone who would actually we'd classify as immune compromised I've seen nothing on hiv/aids for example nothing that suggests HIV status puts you at a higher risk at all yeah again this is yet another point on the list of things that differentiates this from influenza we're looking for ways to contrast this again it's hyper immunity immune paralysis versus not especially immuno genic to the same excitement there's just so many things that make this different that as more and more time goes on that more and more I feel we do ourselves a disservice trying to compare these two and it's understandable why we do but it could potentially mislead us if we continue to use influenza yeah and you raised a very good point about I use influenza from a transmission model but I don't think clinically you can and one of the areas we ran into that was with kids when you look at kids today there is pretty compelling evidence now a lot of studies that were done in China the kids do get infected at the same rate that the adults do but they just don't show clinical signs and symptoms and which is just the opposite with influenza kids become little vial reactors in school they transmit to everybody including their parents and their older siblings

[01:01:30] have with influenza and kids is not the same thing that's happening with Co good 19 and kids Mike have you given any thought to the notion that you alluded to at the outset that you estimated are not was somewhere between 2 and 2.4 we tend to talk about our not as though it's a blended number between the symptomatic and the asymptomatic spreaders is there any utility in trying to think of our not as separate and potentially assuming that the the symptomatic people might have a higher our not although that doesn't necessarily have to be the case again you're asking a great epidemiologic question because we're having that debate right now in a sense you know

[01:02:06] I've always said are not really didn't apply to MERS and SARS because these super spreader were so important you could have five patients six patients ten patients didn't transmit to anybody even when people let their guard down and didn't do a good infection control and then somebody could come in and Wow

[01:02:23] I was involved with helping the follow-up investigation at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul in 2015 when an individual came back from the Middle East to Seoul and they actually were infected they went to a hospital a another patient was in hospital a that person infected that other patient who then upon discharge went over the hospital B ie Samsung Medical Center and transmitted in one afternoon in an emergency room sixty some people I mean that was dynamic and just to be clear this is a property of the host not the virus because it's the same virus exactly you're right the same virus same virus okay and so to say that they are not in a situation like that it's kind of like saying your head's in the freezer your feet are in the oven but an average your temperatures just right it doesn't make sense so I've always challenged you are not because I think that it was way way way out on the curve in some cases we saw lots of transmission well I think with this disease we have a hybrid in fact there's a great article in today's LA Times I go look at it highlighting a major event that happened in a choir in Seattle

[01:03:32] I saw it if I recall 60 people in the choir showed up to practice yes 45 have gone on to test positive to have died they were one was 81 was 83 three are in the hospital so yes there was something strange about that so you know we had these events like that and I think that we've had more of those than we care to realize but on the other hand we also have I think the regular transmission of what was really fascinating about the Christian Drazen in his group in Munich have followed up on individuals there who were part of this early outbreak associated with somebody who had flown from Wuhan China to a car manufacturing location in

[01:04:09] Germany was supposedly mildly ill asymptomatic transmitted okay well they followed up on a group of these contacts and they said okay as soon as you get the first symptom call us which they did and they have a series of patients that they literally have blood you feces throat swabs nasal swabs etc in the earliest hours and these people are just getting sick and they were getting progressively sick overtime but what they found with the virus in the throat was fascinating this is on culture now not just PCR the virus level in the throats of these people were about a thousand times what they see with SARS at its highest level and this was right at the very first moments that they were just showing clinical symptoms and if you follow those cases the virus level drops precipitously over each day day four or five it's really much lower now clearly before that and there are hypotheses that these viruses may even been higher in day - one day - - but they weren't coughing or they weren't sneezing so you can say well they may not have been as infectious but to see that kind of virus level just breathing creating the air assaults and people want to understand an aerosol I tell them there's two things understand it by next time in your house and sunlight is peering through a window and you see all that dust floating in there and you think oh my house is dusty those are air salts that's just from us talking that's from us breathing that's what goes on in your house the second thing is next time you're in a shopping center hopefully they open up and you are in a department store you're three aisles four hours away from the perfume section you can still smell it it's an aerosol so I think that breathing and just the talking would put that out there so I think that rather than call it asymptomatic we kind of call this pre-symptomatic meaning that they're going to get sick but they may be infectious beforehand and this is not a surprise we see this with influenza all the time whether somebody is truly asymptomatic never showing discernible signs or symptoms I think is a question that is the data really come down harder and harder in fact I just reviewed a paper for a major journal from the group in China that found a sizable number of people who are asymptomatic never had reported symptoms where they had more than just PCR dated actually and culture data and they were pretty loaded - so I think there is a role for these people how much they're driving the outbreak I don't know but I think we can't ignore that they have to be there and I do believe we have SARS like super spreader events just like one we just talked about with the and but there's a lot of it was just efficient transmission did we learn anything about what characteristics those super spreaders had that made them super spreaders such that we might be able to identify these people a priori and isolate them better now that is again a million-dollar question we haven't even with all the years of looking at what happens with MERS and part of the reason is with MERS for example it's not that the virus got less effective and spreading we just got more effective in early detection and getting these people isolated the first outbreaks for example in the Arabian

[01:07:16] Peninsula with MERS were largely in dialysis units where people who are in sick they were in there for a while and then classic hospital-associated infections occurred were they transmitted to others once they figure that out and as you alluded to a moment are not is a relative term it's refers to in the natural state unaltered this is who you transmit to but if you have somebody that's just hotter than the devil but you put them in an isolation room issue transmitted to nobody technically there are not should drop to zero even though if you had them out in the waiting room there are not might be do and so I think that's one of the issues with MERS we can't even tell you for sure because we've just gotten a lot better at making sure they don't transmit and have these occurred otherwise like the one happened in Samsung Medical Center

[01:08:02] I think we'd see more of these so I don't think we know yet but it's a very important point that we do need to understand much better than we do now how is anyone to be able to model this out given all of these unknowns so on the one hand we I mean I think we would all agree forecasting could be helpful because it would be great to know some order of susceptible areas in the country if not globally we've talked about it now on a couple of occasions here we're going to have to allocate resources intelligently we can't take an approach that says it's gonna be all hands on deck simultaneously everywhere because one we don't have the resources to do it and two it doesn't mirror what's going to happen so it would really be helpful to know that while New York is right now the epicenter of this in the United

[01:08:47] States these five cities are next in line and for we should at a national level be ramping them up such that at a local level they're ready but how do we do this I mean I think my fear is and we've internally been working on models we continue to work on models we are collaborating with people putting together models and they're beautiful and they're elegant but ultimately they're wrong I mean they just have to be wrong because we don't know the simplest things that the models are very sensitive to such as are not and I mean that's by far the most important metric which of course the problem is it's a single number or a couple of numbers in a model that as you point out is anything but a single number the average the example is often used the average you can drown in an average of three inches of water so just as you can have your feet in a freezer in your head in an oven and still be on average at the right temperature it's it's very complicated and it's not just to say we don't know what the distribution looks like we don't know what the probability distribution looks like of these things so as someone who has studied these things for such a long period of time are you more or less optimistic that this exercise of projection and modeling is a fool's errand or what do you think we should be doing here well first of all let me just say I'm not a modeler

[01:10:07] I've had a lot of graduate our statistics classes and I ascribed very much to the fact that all models are wrong some just provide helpful information and I've always said that I've always been I mean I had to live through the 2014 15 Ebola situation where whu-oh came out and modeled it instead we're gonna have 20,000 cases and CDC said it could be as high as a million and it scared the hell out of everybody and we had to explain the next year why we didn't have a million cases it was close to 20,000 and just that air by itself created a lot of controversy because it made it look like we're trying to really hype this I think here the point you're raising are exactly the ones that we've been looking at carefully to say the variability around this feature is from 0 to 1 I mean it's from you know infinite and so that one factor is kind of like a plus B plus C plus miracle and you get an answer and the part just can't be there okay and so I think that that is a challenge on the other hand I would say you can theoretically say without knowing if it works like this this is what will happen if you are able to suppress it in 85 or 90% of the transmission events you can have this happen or if you do this you can have that happen but it can't tell you that's what it's going to be it can just tell you within the framework of what might it look like I think you're exactly right I have gone my predictions which I talked about earlier and I surely don't meet a sitter and sound will look at me but we were right on with this thing all along right to this point even to picking hot spots and now we can't I can't tell you for certain what it's going to do because it's beyond the scope of our experience and I we were just modeling a lot intellectually not statistically on the fluke transmission model because it looked like that a lot

[01:11:56] I think you're asking exactly the right question what intelligence would give us the information so that we could plan this is the next front two weeks from now this we're gonna need to be this is how much we need to have and we just don't have it which is one of the other real shortcomings of our ability to respond today weather forecasters can tell you you got 80% chance in this region right here or having tornados today I can tell you I can paint the whole United States we have a hundred percent chance to have an AK over 19 problem but I can't tell you exactly much more than that right now is there any evidence that this is a globally coordinated effort on intelligence now or is everybody still kind of acting like the guy who just got punched in the nose who's still stinging from the pain and trying to not get hit again to worry about the person sitting in the front row and whether they're drinking a diet coke or a Diet Pepsi many of us were incredibly disappointed if for lack of a better word the WHL in his response there was a sense that china is going to contain it the whole world can contain it and I give great credit to China for what they did but they didn't contain it they slowed it down

[01:13:03] I've surely give them that but why did they close down all the movie theaters last week again why did they remove all the outside reporters to China two weeks ago I think many of us think that they are in part experience some resurgence as they're opening up their economy again and they don't anybody to know it and I know that's a strong statement but I've talked to a number of people from Asia who would say they tell you the same thing so when you look at what whu-oh did I think they set us back a great deal because they made countries believe if just the few countries that we're gonna get this would just do the containment work we can stop it and we couldn't try to stop this kind of transmission kind of stopped the wind and so we held back on a preparedness and gave people excuses not to do it now again we don't have global leadership in terms of how do we coordinate this how do the low and middle-income countries do with this versus the high-income countries every country is fighting for the same tools the same tests the same in 95s and we don't have a way to globally allocate those in any kind of meaningful way so the haves and have-nots are gonna fight it out and the haves are gonna get more and the have-nots or not the only thing that ironically we have going for us which isn't a sense of sad commentary there are a lot less at-risk people living in low-income countries sakes they already died they're not able to be around 280 with long term renal disease they died a long time ago and that's the sad commentary but in a sense may do better and case fatality rates overall than we do because they're not gonna have that high risk yeah when you again this is not a statement of low-income countries so but looking in Europe again when you consider Italy Spain looking very similar and then Germany looking different do you think that the majority of that difference is explained by the underlying health of the population do you think more of it is just stochastic bad luck where in Italy in Spain the regions that got hit first happened to have a greater center of older more susceptible individuals do you think it is an artifact of testing I mean how do you explain what are your explanations for potentially those differences well I think it's totally artificial and I think as demographics if you look at what happened Italy I started in the ski areas but it quickly got into older populations if you look at Germany a lot of that was introduced back in Germany from the Italian Ski Areas and it was in a younger crowd if you look at where the illness is I can tell you right now that is starting to change and it's starting to see more transmission in

[01:15:38] Germany in older populations and when that happens case fatality rates go up it's just like in Korea when Korea had this predominant case-mix of these younger individuals in this religious sect case fatality rates for one thing now look at what's happening as the older population is more involved case fatality rates are going up substantially in Korea I hate to say this but every week is like a snapshot it's not the whole movie and if we could play the whole movie out for the next two to three years I think there'll be a lot more similar kinds of pictures that will over time bear that out that where the risk factors were for coal morbidity associated severe disease we're gonna see higher case fatality rates when you age adjust and when you adjust on risk factors I don't think there's a lot of difference here that we're gonna see around the world Mike I want to be sensitive to your time and of course I want to make sure that you'll agree to come back and talk with us in a week-to-week something like that because as you said the rate at which this is changing I mean to talk again in two weeks would be like talking over two years outside of the time frame of an epidemic but the last question I want to ask you is is there any of the sort of repurposed drugs that are currently being thrown around in on RCT manners that you have any optimism around I mean as you probably saw the study that was published out of France on Saturday looking at hydrochloric you know I mean again I thought the study was impossible to interpret because without randomization it looked promising but you could argue that all those patients would have done just fine without the drug I mean without a control group it's very difficult at the same time I don't want to be critical of that that we have to do something in terms of studying this and using case control cohort if that's the best we can do so be it but you gave a great example with Ebola which said look you can be really deceived by these non randomized trials and when you put them to the gold standard they can fail miserably if you're lucky they just fail in futility not harm based on that how much of your energy are you spending looking at the different types of repurposed antivirals everything from REM dis aveer to chemists at two hydroxychloroquine er are you looking at these closely enough to comment on your optimism or pessimism

[01:17:54] I'm not because I'm not in that part of it I'm doing much more in the up to me ology prevention side but I think it's a critical question I actually feel confident though that the systems are being set up to actually collect the data in a meaningful way so that we can't have answers and I think you nailed it I mean I actually read that same study you're talking about and I have the exact same conclusions you did so I think we just have to as Godspeed do these as fast as possible but we have to keep an open mind and let the data take us wherever it's gonna and do them so in that regard hopefully I can come back in a couple weeks we can have more information I do believe we're gonna have much more information on therapies much sooner than vaccines and that could be a really important response so I know

[01:18:37] I said that was my last question I guess I want to give you one last thing to say there's people that are gonna be listening to this less than 24 hours after we've recorded it so consider it as current as possible what's the message you want to deliver to people listening to this who are afraid who are not afraid just assume you're talking to a heterogeneous mix of people what do you want to communicate to them as far as what steps they should be taking to protect themselves and the people they care about well number one we throw around a lot of numbers we have to never forget these are all people there are loved ones this is real and more people are going to know somebody in the next couple of weeks that are going to be seriously ill or die the second thing is

[01:19:15] I would just say that we're going to get through this we are gonna get through it the question is how do we do it and that's where I think some of us are trying to get the kinds of approaches in place that have a better chance of getting us through than not I appreciate it you were wonderful I would be happy to do this with you again you're great at it you're really good I appreciate that
