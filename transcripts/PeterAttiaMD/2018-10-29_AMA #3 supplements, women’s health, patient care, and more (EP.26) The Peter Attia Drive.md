[00:00:00] all right I guess he's gonna be the beginning is that okay and three two one I'm are you welcoming people people Peter all right welcome to you welcoming I'm at your place all right yeah yeah yeah all right so now we're starting no all right hey Bob Peter welcome back to New York thank you thanks for having me it's it's a huge sacrifice to have you hey everybody welcome back to our third / second AMA I guess technically our second when you consider that the nothing burger one was very specific to the fast again we're still thinking that this might be a quarterly thing we've got these we've got an AMA page up on the on the blog so now folks are asking questions and voting up and down and that's sort of making it much easier for

[00:01:04] Bob Kaplan here who's my my I don't know my right hand my main man my sidekick everybody yeah Burton whatever to aggregate before that he was doing it through Twitter which was super painful let's see today we have a lot of questions I haven't looked at them yet but I like seeing on your screen how many there are it's stressing me out a little bit yeah I'm suspecting it's impossible to get through all of them so maybe we'll just kind of try to draw a hard stop in a couple of hours and see how far we got also for those of you watching this this is the first time we're gonna record one of these in video so I have no idea if that's gonna improve to be of any value or not maybe it won't but nevertheless for those who like to be able to watch a couple of knuckleheads drink their topo

[00:01:57] Chico's as opposed to just listen to the bubbles welcome to to my little apartment all right all right I'm gonna let you take it okay up let's get started and so one of the features on the AMA page is a vote up vote down feature so we can see it which ones are more popular than others so we'll buy us some of those questions towards this and so one of the most popular questions was curious what other reference ranges Peter considers too soft okay so this is sort of on the heels of the last podcast or the last

[00:02:37] AMA where I talked about my blood values before during and after the fast uhm so because I don't remember what I actually talked about I'll just probably just start from scratch and there might be some repetition here so as I just sort of think about going through the labs from start to finish when it comes to the lipids I generally take a harder line on triglycerides than is typically given so the typical reference range on triglyceride is less than 150 milligrams per deciliter apologize I don't know what that is in millimolar for people who are outside of the United States I generally like to see triglycerides below 100 and if we're really gonna get fancy I'd like to see triglycerides lower than HDL cholesterol when both are measured in milligrams per deciliter so again that's probably a bit more of a stringent you know sort of level that I would put on things but that that's sort of the first place I think about it [Music] secondly looking at the LDL particle number which is measured in animal per liter just morally and philosophically I feel like that number ought to be below a thousand animal per liter which is about the 20th percent of the population and the reason I feel that way is you know heart disease and atherosclerosis are the most ubiquitous causes of death so to be average on the disease that is the most common strikes me as just backwards mathematics so you haven't it you really do need some alpha when it comes to a metric like that and I know that there's gonna be some people watching this that are saying oh my god LDL there's all this controversy I don't know when this podcast is going to come out in relation to the discussion that I had with Dave

[00:04:22] Feldman about this the discussion with Tom de spring so either by the time you're listening to this hopefully that point will have been long addressed and if not I assure you it will be addressed so it might make sense to define what reference ranges are because I think people might get confused with what is average and what is optimal mm-hmm and so people might look at I don't know that two-thirds of the country is overweight and or grade-point and so when you look at the average it's gonna be different from what is actually either normal or healthy yeah thanks for bringing that up so reference ranges are usually given around a population distribution but it evolves over time so if you went and looked at a laboratory test from 25 years ago and you looked at in the same units for the same variable you know for example alt or ast the transaminases you would see different numbers and all that's telling you is every few years the labs have to kind of update their reference range on what they're seeing in the population so for some things like hormones you're often going to see you know between x and y and any lab will tell you upon asking they usually don't print this on the lab but we go back and usually ask them what do your reference ranges represent and it's usually either 10th to 20th percentile to 80s to 90 a--the percentile or two standard deviations below the mean to two standard deviations above the mean and again that's usually something they could only say if the data approximate a normal distribution which many of these things do just like height for example so you could report height as you know the average height or the you know interquartile range so the you know 25th to 75th percentile of height I'm making this up if for a male in the United

[00:06:17] States would be you know I don't know five foot eight to five foot eleven and a half but of course if you're asking a separate question which is if you're trying to optimize to be a rower a heavyweight rower you know someone who rose crew you'd obviously want to be probably between six foot two and six foot four I kind of making that up but the point is showing you that you would pick a range that's completely outside of the statistical norm because you're optimizing for something very particular in that case rowing so I basically just disregard all the reference ranges when

[00:06:49] I look at labs and I kind of have my own set of standards that are based on my belief system around what should and shouldn't be the case physiologically so again going down that list after the LDL I'd like to see the small LDL P below 500 animal per liter which is represented by the 50th 25th percentile pardon me I'd like to see the oxidized

[00:07:12] LDL below 40 that's a very stringent criteria because most labs will acknowledge that anything below 60 is reasonable I like to see that even lower I like to see c-reactive protein below one even though most labs consider anything below too reasonable kind of just kind of mentally scrolling through this I like to see uric acid below 5.0 again most labs consider anything below 6 to be normal some some labs even consider anything below 7 to be normal and again I think in part that's because they're optimizing around the prevention of gout and it's very unlikely you're gonna have a gout attack with a uric acid of 6.2 however I think there are a number of other health consequences to that let's see you give alt an answer no so alt and ast as of now on the lab that

[00:08:00] I use the upper limit of a L T is 44 maybe 42 and ast is about 40 I think both of those are unnecessarily high and we typically like to see patients below 20 on both of those oral glucose-tolerance test you mentioned this I think maybe in the another AMA yeah about the one hour two hour both insulin and glucose actually you gave those right so again I don't know I can't remember what the reference ranges are on our lab but I know that they're geared primarily towards a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes there was a day when you would use the og TT to diagnose type 2 diabetes and not what we do today which is rely on hemoglobin a1c I think the use of an OG

[00:08:49] TT is a better test and I think the hemoglobin a1c is is not a particularly helpful test so yeah I generally like to see the fasting glucose below 90 milligrams per deciliter the fasting insulin below six and at one hour following a 75 gram Glu Cola challenge so this is a liquid glucose challenge again if you change the way that you do the test you have to you know come up with a whole new set of reference ranges at one hour for a reasonably muscular male I'd like to see the glucose below 120 or maybe at a max 130 milligrams per deciliter in the insulin below 20 or 30 in a less muscular individual or in a woman who is just smaller I will tolerate slightly higher levels and at two hours I like to see the glucose back down to below 100 milligrams per deciliter and the insulin ideally below 20 or potentially even only 2x what the one-hour glucose was so if the glucose at one hour was eight to see it at sixty an hour less at two hours would be great you know on the hormone front boy it's complicated there because you're dealing with so many other issues which includes symptoms that go far and beyond just the numbers but ice you know if someone's

[00:10:06] TSH is between about 0.5 and 2.0 and they're free t3 is above 3.0 and their reverse t3 is below 12 I find it very hard to see how they could have hypothyroidism regardless of the symptoms they have and if they do have symptoms that sound and smell and feel like hypothyroidism I'm generally searching much harder for another cause which again is not to say you can't be fooled I think you always can be but that would be what I would consider sort of biochemically optimal for thyroid and then of course I think it's probably too nuanced to get into a discussion of what happens when one or more of those is out of whack how do you begin to make the diagnosis and I probably talked about this in the past but you know the TSH is really only telling you about what the pituitary and is seeing in terms of t3 t4 to t4 t4 to t3 conversion so that's telling you about the di Odin ace in the brain that's making that distinction the free t3 is telling you how much peripheral t4 is being converted to t3 and then the perversity 3 is telling you how much peripheral t4 is being converted to reverse t3 which opposes t3 and so the reverse t3 opposes t3 and each of those has a completely different sort of cause so again probably a little more complicated and maybe we'll save that for another ama that's a great conversation with a whiteboard yes that happens that's a whiteboard session because I screw it up if I try to explain it without being able to show d1 d2 d3 is the D ioad mesas and all the hormones probably another whiteboard discussion then would be the the male and female sex hormones that's an even more complicated pathway there are about nine things that we measure there beginning with DHEA FSH LH all the way to dihydrotestosterone or DHT again these are hormones that are sometimes we're looking to keep things below a certain level or above a certain level sometimes we're looking to keep things between a certain level I think for epa and DHA when we look at the red blood cell index of epa DHA i know that's a very messy topic and it's also something we're gonna absolutely talk about on a future podcast so i don't want to get too far down that rabbit hole i definitely want to have Bill Harris on the podcast to discuss that but I do like to see the EPA DHA index above about 8.5%

[00:12:31] I used to sort of think anything above 8% was ideal you know frankly now my let patients up to ten and even sometimes 12% if they're not having any issues like nosebleeds or something like that but again it's more complicated because that's just showing you the total EPA DHA and in some patients you really want to see that DHEA preference preferentially higher versus the EPA and it does depend quite a bit on what which access were most worried about whether it be the neuro degenerative axis in which case the DHEA might be a little more important or the atherosclerosis in which the EPA might be more important and of course it all comes without saying the source of that epa and DHA heavily dependent on sort of you know what you care about and what you're worried about mmm a lot of the other ranges are kind of complicated I've talked about it before so I'll bring it up again does master all is a very important sterile that we measure so we measure markers of cholesterol synthesis of which there are mainly two that can be measured commercially and measures of cholesterol absorption in addition to

[00:13:39] Stan all production so sterols and stanols are slightly different they have a slightly different chemical composition I don't particularly have an interest in how high or low the stanols are or the phytosterols but I use that very much so when making therapeutic interventions with lipids but I do care about the Dez master all and I do all things equal if given the choice like to see that above 0.5 and there the reason for that is potentially obscure but I but I do have some concern about overly suppressing cholesterol synthesis which is typically an issue in patients who are taking statins if you over suppress cholesterol synthesis I think an aggregate there's a meaning at the population level this does not seem to pose a problem but at the individual level I would exercise some caution and so the dis master all becomes a guidepost of course that's all complicated because there are some medications that interfere with the enzyme that converts does master all into cholesterol and so the whole thing becomes a bit challenging and you can't really interpret the level in that context let's see I forget anything mmm oh yeah that's a good one i GF boy this is one where I've really changed my tune a lot over time I used to be in the camp that said you know low IGF is best and in an ideal world everybody should be at or below the fiftieth percentile and that's one where it's not even worth explaining what the numbers are because it varies so much by age that you just have to look at the table that gives you the igf breakdown by age but I actually no longer think that's the case I really think that IGF should be cycled between high and low and for example like when I did my fast after seven days my IGF was probably you know at the 5th to 10th percentile and it might rebound to the 80th percentile when I'm not fasting and so I think it's you know I think epidemiology mostly sucks especially like epidemiology that is involving an intervention like people who do X get Y I think that epidemiology is absolutely the worst the next layer of epidemiology that's like less shitty is like looking at IG F levels and contrasting it with disease because at least there you've simplified a variable you're not trying to figure out like did those people eat more eggs or less eggs like that becomes a separate question and I think based on the epidemiology there's you know there's a there's a u-shaped mortality mortality curve with

[00:16:12] IGF except it's very skewed so it's not even a perfect you and I'm having a hard time being convinced by anyone including proponents of very low IGF that an IGF outside of the range of about the 60th to 80th percentile is anything but optimal so so they're you know I've really switched my tune and become a little more liberal and what I like to see obviously the two things that say three things that impact IGF the most are amino acid intake and there are some amino acids like methionine that seem particularly potent insulin levels indirectly through the binding proteins so therefore you know which is largely determined by dietary carbohydrate and then of course exogenously modes like growth hormone which is obviously very popular in the longevity /what every circles but growth hormone which is an analogue it's the exact analog of the human growth hormone is a hormone secreted by the pituitary gland it tells the liver to make more insulin like growth factor so if a doctor is using

[00:17:23] IGF I hope to hell they are monitoring IGF levels mmm if they're using GH I'm sorry I misspoke if they're using GH I hope you're monitoring IGF levels and so when you're looking at IGF a blood test you're looking at it shot whereas you're living your life as a more of a movie and for example I think if we falter long ago as probably people think of him as a proponent of low IGF one of the things that he points out in his FM DS in the studies is that you get the shrinking of tissues and organs and the low IGF and then there's the regeneration which sort of looks like rejuvenation I suspect when those tissues and organs are rejuvenating or regenerating IGF levels aren't necessarily at the floor that's your rebound right that's where you actually looking at you know synthesis and the other thing so yeah I mean looking at an average when you really should be looking at the cycling that that's right and I think Longo was influenced by it by his mentor by the negative effects he saw on his mentor yeah and and fell altered yeah you know I felt that like you know maybe this having low IGF all the time isn't such a good thing either again I don't want to speak for somebody else's views I don't know exactly where where Longo falls out on that but but you're right luckily IGF is much more stable than gh so people always ask should we be measuring GH in people and my view is that sort of like measuring measuring

[00:18:51] ACTH which is another pituitary hormone that is the one that's most responsible for the secretion of cortisol and unfortunately the answer is outside of very extreme pathological cases like acromegaly or you know pituitary Cushing's disease very difficult to and for what the hell is going on from looking at those hormones because they are so pulsatile you know you go in a sauna for 20 minutes that's gonna change your growth hormone levels significantly probably won't change your IGF levels so significantly so the advantage of looking at very high fidelity high frequency moving hormones is great you're closer to the physiology origin the drawback is the noise can be too much I'm sure there were a bunch of other things that I care a lot about you know I do I mean I but I just I think

[00:19:40] I'm tired of this question I was gonna get into iron and ferritin and TI BC and hematocrit mclubbe and i and white blood cell count i have points of view on everything i'm a little probably too opinionated on this topic okay we lose through our time limit on that question ma'am [Laughter] let's see what next this might be a quick one what aspect of women's health is the least studied / understood hmm is that a high scoring question it was you wouldn't be asking at this early in the nod cast if it was it so ironic that I would be asked that question given that

[00:20:23] I'm not particularly knowledgeable in this subject and I hope I don't represent that I am I do have a number of women patients I would say 1/4 to 1/3 of my patients are female but when you start to talk about things that are uniquely female a couple of things come to mind so I guess what I'm going to do is not answer this question because I don't know the answer but just go off a little bit and hopefully something I say is a value to the people who answer this question obviously the most important distinction between men and women are the sex hormones that's an enormous difference and the other difference that comes along with that is that men experience a much more gradual decline in their sex hormones and as such it's often harder to appreciate symptomatic changes in men you got a guy who's you know walking around with this testosterone two standard deviations below the mean he can actually feel pretty reasonable because you know just like a frog who's been in water that's been slowly getting warmer he doesn't actually realize how hot the water is because he's been in there with

[00:21:22] Alzheimer's if you dropped him in that water overnight it would be pretty stark conversely women experienced two completely you know you know again I'm just completely empathetic to what women go through which is during their menstrual cycle or during their you know reproductive years they have a menstrual cycle which even over the course of 30 days or so 28 to 31 days on average they're experiencing profound fluctuations in their hormones and this is another one of my favorite whiteboard topics and you know I remember there was this one patient I'll never forget she was I was a member sitting down with her in her living room actually drawing this out for her and explaining to her why she has PMS because her chief complaint actually which I thought was an odd reason to come to see me because I'm I don't think like I offer any genius expertise on this but I mean mostly it was just to help control her her emotional swings during her cycle and when I actually drew for her the time course of here the you know here's day one the day your period starts here's day one of your next cycle here's how your FSH your follicle stimulating hormone your LH or luteinizing hormone your estradiol your progesterone and your testosterone vary throughout that and let's highlight what's happening on about day 22 to 28 which is when you have this drop in progesterone and explaining to her that for some women that central meaning in the in the brain that reduction that withdrawal of progesterone can create emotional lability and other things and it's like you're not crazy like that's that's that's like saying like someone who's depressed because they don't have enough serotonin is crazy no I mean it's just everyone has different neurotransmitters and everyone has a different response to hormones so it was a very profound thing for her she was like oh my god like I've always just thought I was kind of crazy and I'm just like a moody and I was like no I mean your mom went through the same thing your sister goes through the same thing I mean this is hereditary and here are two things that you can do about trying to control this again I don't wanna get off on the tangent and go what those two things are that we talked about but nevertheless there was so that's so that's during a woman's reproductive years the second thing that's really profound is you know but the time a woman is in her fifth decade typically all of a sudden that stuff gets shut down so all of a sudden she's losing estrogen she's losing progesterone and she's losing testosterone and I include that last one because most people forget about it so when you talk about the distinguishing characteristics between men and women we usually think about testosterone being the male phenotype describing hormone estrogen progesterone being the female dominant hormones and that's true but what most people don't realize is when you actually convert the units to the same numbers so when you go from nanograms per deciliter and picograms per milliliter which they're often reported in different units and you do an apples-to-apples you when you look at a woman's highest estrogen level in her life which I mean outside of pregnancy is during her ovulate or e-cycle so - when she's ovulating when she has that burst of estrogen if you take that estrogen level and compare it to her testosterone level on average which is testosterone varies a little bit by cycle but not enormous ly the testosterone is about ten times higher than the estrogen hmm now the number never looks that way because testosterone is reported typically in nanograms per deciliter whereas the estrogen is reported usually in pika grams per milliliter but if you you know do like the high school you know calculation of what your chemistry teacher would have you do and put them both in the same units you'll realize that testosterone is much higher so even though a woman's testosterone level is much less than a man's testosterone level a free testosterone firm a woman for in a woman might be one nanogram per deciliter whereas in a man the fiftieth percentile would be about fourteen nanograms per deciliter so called fourteen fifteen times higher it is still a very dominant hormone even relative to estrogen so when all three of those hormones are basically taken away in a period of two to three years I don't want to get too far on the soapbox but like definitely top ten pet peeves or maybe top five pet peeves are doctors that completely disregard menopausal perimenopausal and post menopausal symptoms and women and who without having ever even read a single study or tried to understand the limits and the methodologies of the Women's Health

[00:25:47] Initiative come to the conclusion well no woman should ever take hormones and they should just you know deal with their post menopausal hot flashes and and perimenopausal symptoms and eventually you know let them lose their muscle mass and bone density because God forbid hormones cause cancer or some other equally knuckleheaded conclusion so those are those are really two huge things I think a third thing that I've seen and I gotta be honest I'm kind of lazy I don't think I've seen this in the literature and I haven't probably made a strong enough effort to look at it but empirically it is so overwhelming that I would be surprised if it's not described in the literature is there's something about multiple pregnancies and the HPA axis and women so I usually don't see it after a woman has had two kids but usually if a woman has had three or four kids the likelihood that her thyroid bounces back to normal seems not that high and so I've I have a couple of patients who came into the practice again interested in longevity but their proximate issue of concern was you know ever since you know two years ago when I had my third child or my fourth child I have not been able to get back to the same level of energy that I once had and you look at them and they have a normal

[00:27:06] TSH typically but but usually their peripheral metabolism of t4 is is very altered and and these are I think in some ways like kind of the easiest saves like you in a very short period of time you can make a patient feel a hell of a lot better and and they're just there they sort of fall through the cracks and again I think it might come down to just a failure to appreciate some of the these subtle differences between men and women again men aren't giving birth fortunately or else we our species would have died and we wouldn't have a species if you and I were responsible for procreation trying to think what else our fundamental difference is I mean there were many others part of that question is least studied yeah or understood I think it was a Freakonomics podcast they talked about this a little bit where there was a there was the thalidomide issue and I believe there were I think they were maybe doing

[00:28:03] Studies or something where women were involved and obviously birth defects and horrible things happened and they sort of took women virtually off the table in terms of studying and so there's a long period of time where it was I think men were predominantly being studied and with subjects of yeah we would just sort of assume that's whatever is we see in the men we might see in the women but I think there's been as far as epidemiology goes there's been a resurgence in women's studies and things like that but I do think that there's overall they've been under study just in that regard as well just looking at the female body versus the instead of just assuming you know there they're the same yep that's that's a great example I remember that that's I remember hearing that and thinking god that's I mean everybody knows this story about the lid amide yeah you can't get through med school without it but it's the ramifications of that it's that it's that what happened as a result of that that's a very interesting point you know another difference between men and women I don't know how well it's been studied but I mean most epidemiologic assessments would make a clear case that women all things equal tend to get less cardiovascular disease now I don't know how eloquently these studies have been done and I don't know if they've been normalized for a poby in addition to ldlc my guess is they may not have been but nevertheless if you were to make the assumption that once you'd that once that analysis is done if all things equal inclusive of a poby inflammation all of the other things insulin sensitivity even if you wanted to be really rigorous women still get less heart disease than men and after you've normalized for blood pressure smoking and and really all of the major factors you'd have to look at iron levels as a next interesting concept right so there's pretty interesting data in men that the more metabolically deranged they are the better they do with therapeutic phlebotomy whereas the less metabolically deranged they are the less of an effect they have by giving blood reducing the oxidative stress of iron so it might be the case that somewhere buried within there is this idea that because for a great number of years of a woman's life she is going to have less iron than a man due to her menstrual cycle that may actually offer a protective benefit against heart disease again something I would be interested to know if that's certainly people have speculated that but again I don't know how how rigorously it's been documented and we have another thing out there that's lingering and you're talking to

[00:30:26] Richard Isaacs and very soon actually he'll probably have more insight into this which is if you look at Alzheimer's disease and you look at the prevalence I think it's two out of every three cases are women but so two out of every three cases of Alzheimer's are women and you could probably say that age is a factor in longevity may be a factor and things like that but I think that that needs to be studied more - yeah because I have a hard time believing if that is purely an age issue I don't think that the increase in longevity of a woman can affect that much of a gap in and and again it would be a great discussion with Richard you're right because you want to make sure that you're not being fooled by you know a diagnostic just distinction and things like that as well hmm so piggybacking on the woman's health a little bit what are your thoughts on fasting and ketosis for females well you know again there's real tough question because I find all questions of nutrition to be so individual that it's hard to answer them sort of you know one size fits all sort of one-stop-shop approach that said I think there are a couple things women need to be thoughtful about if any woman is having an issue with fertility I really would not add you know I just I couldn't make a case I can't make a very compelling case for nutritional ketosis if a woman is trying to get pregnant and

[00:31:56] I'm sure this is just going to piss off a lot of the keto herd but because of course if you're in the keto call to believe that ketosis is the optimal State for everything including you know global warming but the reality is if you look at the fgf levels and also if you just think about it from an ancestral standpoint the higher the level of ketone during our evolution the more likely we were separated from food and the more likely you're separated from food the less genetic pressure you should have to be reproducing at that point in time and this this concept is so well preserved in biology I mean we had a great discussion with David

[00:32:40] Sinclair recently to talk about this and it's even true in the case of the sirtuins which would be a you know one of the more important regulators of sort of our aging in our and including you know our reproductive stress so I think when you look at the fgf21 data and the ketosis data there's a very and I I don't - bastardize this because I wish

[00:32:59] I'd known that I was going to be asked this question I would have looked up the page it's it's it's from a researcher in Texas I think he's at he said he might be at UT Southwestern but he's if you search you know date and his names first names David I'm blanking on his last name beans with an M though but if you mangled Mangelsdorf yes yes yeah that's him

[00:33:23] I saw him present at a meeting once and it was remarkable data that looked at the differences in a male and female brain in the presence of changing fgf21 levels and it was so cool to see this difference the pituitary gland is one of the very few pieces of tissue in the body that has what's called portal circulation the liver being the other one so the pituitary has a direct connection via the pituitary stalk to the hypothalamus the long and short of it is in a calorie restricted state when ketones are elevated it suppresses FSH and LH and women but not in men this is super interesting to me and it hasn't has a profound evolutionary I mean again maybe I'm just making up a story to fit this but I mean it's if we're gonna subscribe to any of

[00:34:13] Occam's razor this would be great application in a period of famine you would want women to stop reproducing you would want to shut off FSH and LH you would want men to have no impairment on their testosterone level that's that's all the more time that they should be out there unable to get food so again

[00:34:33] I've always been kind of a little bit careful of suggesting that a that a woman who's trying to get pregnant you know be in ketosis now look I know what's gonna happen everyone's gonna say well I you know I got pregnant when I was in ketosis yeah obviously it's possible I mean I'm not suggesting it's not but we're talking about optimization the second thing of course is should a woman be in ketosis during pregnancy and the answer is I simply don't know the answer clearly we evolved with mothers being in ketosis and having children it's be impossible for our species to be here if mothers were not in ketosis during pregnancy I mean you know we didn't have buffets but that said is it optimal you know again just because something happened in in sort of our evolutionary time history does that mean it's optimal no almost not at all so it's a general rule you know and again I don't like to make general rules when it comes to nutrition I'm not convinced it's necessarily the best strategy just like

[00:35:34] I don't think it's the best strategy for kids unless they have seizures or something else for example so you know a far better strategy is just like don't eat junk food you know don't eat don't eat sugar don't eat highly refined carbohydrates but you know should one restrict carbohydrates to the point where they're in ketosis as a very deliberate act and I'm not convinced that's the case mmm and of course when you start to look at things like maternal diabetes or gestational diabetes rather that's where it gets a little tougher because you know ketosis can be a very effective tool for treating type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes is not type 2 diabetes but it has some of its features so again I really I hope there are some obstetricians out there who spend a lot of time on this problem because it is a huge problem there are many women who go through this my sister I probably have talked about this in the past and I don't think she'd mind me talking about it and if she does I'm in trouble but you know my sister had an operation when she was quite young that took out two thirds of her pancreas so during her first pregnancy she got gestational diabetes which was to be expected because she had like a third of the insulin producing capacity and then it happened again during the second pregnancy and then after that second pregnancy she actually got type-2 diabetes over the course of a year going on a ketogenic diet actually working with a company called fear to health that I'm an adviser to an investor in although that is unrelated to the fact that my sister wasn't you know getting care from them you know she lost 50 pounds you know her hemoglobin a1c went from somewhere in the 12s to in the fives in the course of a year and then she got pregnant again well she decided to go off the ketogenic diet but still be much more diligent and strict and despite that she still you know requires insulin during this third pregnancy

[00:37:28] I suspect you'll have a much easier time recovering following this pregnancy but one of the things that's been frustrating which maybe goes back to this the question prior to this is her obstetricians like they have no insight like they have not a thing to offer her as far as how she should be thinking about managing her blood sugars other than just chronic ram or insulin into her mm exogenously so yeah and this is why context matters and there's no bumper sticker data you could have you know the question thoughts on fasting and ketosis for females you could have somebody with the constellation of abnormalities that is metabolic syndrome insulin resistant type 2 diabetic and maybe for that person their fertility might be an issue and going and going on a ketogenic diet may get them in a healthier State yeah exactly might actually improve their fertility because of the inflammation and all the other stuff that could be happening as a result of what you just mentioned so yeah I yeah well said you should just answer the questions now you do a better job than me I probably have way too many bumper stickers there that lack context that need it what advice would you give to medical students and residents it's pretty broad with regard to what don't do it yeah definitely everyday yeah how do I probably how do I I don't know I'm

[00:38:58] I'm inferring stuff from this but probably how do I get through it to all the way from how do I get through this thing to how do i optimize my time in medical school maybe you can you can sort of look back and maybe I'll start even broader so I definitely really enjoy talking to kids in high school in college we want to go into medicine and

[00:39:22] I think in part I think the most important piece of information must be important you know piece of advice I would offer these folks which is probably somewhat biased by my own experience so I explained that as a caveat and they say look you know here's my bias is don't study pre-med in college and for a lot of them they're like wait why but I know I want to do medicine like why wouldn't I study pre-med and

[00:39:46] I'm like that's exactly why like all that stuff you learn in pre-med is like the JV version of what you're gonna learn in med school like yeah you're gonna learn a little bit of anatomy and some biochemistry and you know physiology and a whole bunch of things and you'll learn them at like you know some sort of superficial level of depth and then you're gonna go to medical school and learn it all in real depth okay great you just wasted four years what you really ought to do in college is study first something that you freakin love like in the end you want to study something where you don't care about the grades you're gonna do well because you are absolutely obsessed with mastering this subject and that look that could be going you know an inch wide and a mile deep on something like you know I want to really study genetics or biochemistry or molecular biology or something alternatively it could be you know what I want to study philosophy and history or I want to study engineering or whatever and you know but the point is what you the absolute last thing you want to do is try to cobble together an education that is geared towards acing the MCAT like I can think of no sadder thing to do than to do that so that's that's sort of my advice on the people going to medical school once you're there you know I mean this sounds kind of touchy-feely but I remember there were some days in medical school where I was super unhappy a large part of it was it was the first time in my life I realized you just had to memorize certain and I had prided myself up until that point in life of never memorizing things like a you know I could remember the dates of boxing matches and that was it couldn't remember a birthday to save my life like didn't want to memorize anything and then you get to medical school and you just can't get three one first principles you didn't you just there's just certain things you have to you have to generate a certain base of knowledge before you can even participate in a thoughtful discussion and so that took me like a year to just a and there were times when I was super pissed off when I was sitting there studying thinking like I'm getting so dumb like I'm not solving problems there are no differential equations you know I don't even get to use vector calculus anymore one of the things that was very helpful and I don't remember where at this advice came from but it was very wise advice which is at any point in life where you're sitting somewhere and you're in a situation and you think it sucks go and find someone who would give their left nut to be in your situation and go and help them out so I remember having this thought and thinking you know what I'm sitting here at you know med school at Stanford I've got a whole bunch of undergrads at Stanford who were among the smartest undergrads in the country and you know half these kids wanted and a half but you know what some percentage of these kids want to get into medical school and they might not right so I remember actually going and just you know putting up my name on a billboard in the I forgot even the name of the god it's been so I don't remember the name of the quad like what the main quad at Stanford was called but putting up a thing like hey anyone who needs help setting for MCAT like I'm gonna be in this room at this time and I'm just gonna answer questions and a bunch of kids showed up and I didn't charge him anything it was more it was actually I was doing it for me right I was doing it to see what their level of enthusiasm was and could I catch some of that infection again and it works you know it's really a powerful tool and I did it again in residency so in residency there were days when I was like his

[00:43:22] Sox like I haven't slept in two days I haven't eaten a proper meal in a week I haven't even changed my underwear in two days like I just hate my life I haven't exercised in three days and then I thought wait a minute you are so privileged to be sitting here right like you know you are one of six residents that's chosen to be in this categorical program look at all of these medical students at Hopkins that would give anything to be here do the same thing grab two of them sit down and walk them through something help you know teach them something and you'll see like they give anything to be where you are and so I guess that's I mean you could apply that to life I suppose but it's it's a it's particularly helpful in sort of this transition from college to medical school residency and beyond what other advice could I give I mean I think a lot of the advice I have is so glib and so cliche that I mean I feel a bit embarrassed saying it you know you hearing it come out of my mouth makes me cringe but you do have to maintain a balance in other words you'd be surprised like let's just say you've you think there's like a hundred hours of work you need to do to prepare for a certain exam you're probably better off putting 85 hours into it and spending fifteen hours doing something else that is you know sort of replenishing you in another way and for some people that's pleasure reading like you know reading fiction for others like me that was always going to be exercise for others it's just sort of blowing off steam and going to get you know drunk again not advocating necessarily but the point is it is important to get out of that you know get out of those books for a while I did not do that in college so when I went to college I just decided I just want to know everything that was knowable and that meant studying every minute of every day I mean I did exercise but I didn't socialize at all in college or very very little actually probably drank twice in all of college and they were both incredibly epic nights actually that's another story

[00:45:29] I feel like Chevy Chase like I feel like there's like a Fletch moment here reflecting on that both will go back to you playing basketball and the Lakers yeah with the fro at six in tennis but in medical school I definitely spent way more time having fun and part of it was like being in such a is my first time living in California it was like oh my god like you can ride your bike outside everyday and you know you can swim you can do all those other things so I think that is important I think the other thing in medical school not to lose sight of is why you're doing it like you you really the more frequently you can interact with patients in medical school the better not for the reasons that I think the can source would say which is the problem-based learning uh there may be some truth to that meaning when you take what's called a problem-based learning approach which was something that I think Harvard borrowed actually McMaster University was the first to do it and then Harvard and two or three other prominent schools started doing it which is this this idea of kids weren't gonna sit in class anymore and do the traditional stuff they were gonna go straight into the wards from day one and then encounter a patient encounter a problem and then go back and learn what they needed to learn to do that you know whether that approach is right or wrong I actually have no insight but what I think you do get out of seeing patients whether it's in a traditional path like they have at

[00:46:58] Stanford where you've spent you know the first two years grinding through class and not was it's it's really exciting like it's it's it's you you start I mean again now I think at my stage it's very easy to take that for granted and be like you know my patients are calling me and you know I'm trying to enjoy my weekend and I'm like you know stuck answering 27 emails or calling the lab or doing I think but boy when you're starting out it is just amazing to realize like you have this bizarre privilege like people are gonna tell you that they would never tell anybody else you know you're gonna see people at a very vulnerable state and that's um I guess it's good to figure out early if that's appealing or not because if it's not if you're not awed by that you probably don't belong in medicine because it's there's enough things that will beat that out of you in medicine that if that initially doesn't owe you you know there's an issue this is totally unrelated but Tim Ferriss had a podcast once about how to say no elegantly and there I forget who he credits this to but there's someone who has this criteria which is if when someone asks you to do something if the answer isn't hell yes don't do it because it's all downhill from there right like if Bob you know if you call me up and you're like I've got this great idea we're gonna do buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh blah if I think ah yeah okay I'll do it bad a bad idea yeah

[00:48:19] I have to think that's the greatest idea I've ever heard and so similarly like if as a college student or as a medical student you aren't bowled over by the beauty of this interaction with a patient you it's worth questioning why you're doing this because it you will slowly have that sort of the forces that be will will do everything in their power to beat that out of you that makes sense it sounds touchy-feely but it is yeah it's not about you feeling its begin with the end in mind you really have to know what your goal is because more or less you turn the have to s in to get twos so you know like oh I have to get up early in the morning I have to be on call I have to you know whatever it is even like a profound thing is like for a mother saying like I have to change these dirty diapers or something I get to change these dirty diapers because I have a kid that I love and we were able to you know make this baby together things like that and I think when you go through something like medical school how rigorous and how tough it is you need you know and you put regardless you're gonna have to remind yourself at times because it's gonna be tough yeah you know that's again well said I don't know why I'm answering these questions you always say it better huh we'll see you wrote on Twitter that you're considering different avenues to monetize the podcast in order to make it sustainable what do you think is the best way to do it so this is something that so we're recording this today on

[00:49:44] September 11th I'm not sure when this podcast will actually come out probably later this month or in October but it'll have been about three months we started this in July so first of all the whole thing was started as an experiment have we officially put every podcast out that was in that first trial balloon yeah okay cool so yesterday with Lustig's coming out that is the experiment yeah we might have squeezed one more in I think it was we're gonna do 12 mm-hmm and he's episode 14 maybe sneak a couple a.m. it is yeah deep dive so I guess I would say now having completed the experiment I have enjoyed the hell out of this way more than I thought I would and I know which you know you and Nick sitting over there you guys are both rolling your eyes at me because you were saying this forever and so was Tim and so is Kevin and Jocko and on Ahad and

[00:50:37] Patrick and like everybody had been telling me you got to do this you got to do this and honestly I this was one of those things where all I thought of was I have to like I have to do that I have to do now I look at it like I get to do this like I get to go and interview people who know more about a subject than I do and pick their brain and the only thing

[00:50:54] I have to do is set up a bunch of goofy recording equipment in front of us I mean it's it's really amazing and I don't actually have to do any of the heavy lifting after like you guys do it Travis does it right there's like basically three people four people who do a whole bunch of work after I do a recording and I never think about it again I've never listened to one of the podcasts after the fact so I'm hoping they're turning out okay but no basically I just get to walk around having spending you know about three hours a week having a cool discussion so that said it still is a highly expensive proposition by my back-of-the-envelope calculation it costs about twenty five hundred dollars to make each podcast not including my time which I wouldn't necessarily want to put a price tag on because I don't know how to value it but if I just include the priceless my time is priceless maybe that takes up to twenty five hundred fifty dollars so you know and it you know so so whatever so you're gonna spend ten grand a month making a podcast that's great but the reality of it is we do need to read you need to remunerated it's not cool to flush 120 grand down the toilet every year and and - there are a lot of things that I want to be able to do that upon further inspection if the podcast can not only pay for itself but pay for some of the research that we want to do that would be great we haven't we just hired our sixth analyst this month so we have a team of analysts that basically I would like to be as large as could be as we could afford to manage which means you've met with you can tell I don't do a lot around here I sort of take care of patients and that's but right now our research team is basically subsidized by our clinical practice so everything is under an umbrella called Atia medical and the patients are basically subsidizing our research and that's fine because the patients benefit the most from their research but I would like to figure out a way for the podcast to cover the cost of our research and if

[00:52:59] I'm really going to be wish not just cover the cost of our analysts but generate an additional pool of capital to invest in the types of research we want to do at certain universities so there are a number of investigators around the country who are doing really interesting work who I think could be doing way more interesting work if they had unrestricted funding to do certain stuff for example people have heard me talk about my obsession with wanting to understand if there are biomarkers or things that could delineate a metabolic signature for a toff adji this is the type of project that by my estimation could be done for a relatively low sum of money meaning this is not a billion-dollar project this is a project that a few people could get together and solve i would like to contribute heavily to that I have a pretty good sense of who the people are that would need to be involved in that project if we can get

[00:53:52] IRB approval to do some of the experiments that I think would need to be done I think those are elegant so all of those things are things that I would like to see partially and maybe in a dream state completely funded by the podcast here's what I have figured out I probably don't want to do I don't think

[00:54:09] I want to sell ads now a couple months ago I put out some questions on Twitter about so we can we can fully talk about the fact that we're drinking topo Chico because we're just advertising for free we're not getting paid to do this that's refreshing I was I was actually very touched by the feedback that we got on Twitter when we put that question out about hey what do you guys think about me shucks in ads because I almost don't remember a single person saying no bad idea everyone was like look you got to make money too you've been putting out free content since 2011 you literally have never charged us for anything you don't have a single ad on your website blah blah blah by all means sell ads and so I think I thought I thought I thought at the time okay well let's do it and here's the way we'll do it we're only gonna sell ads for things that we love and care about and bah blah blah blah blah but to be honest with you

[00:55:02] I don't want to close the door to this but I'm having a hard time seeing how I could make it work because there just aren't that many things that I love you know and frankly I have no idea of topo Chico would want to the sponsor this podcast like I they might not care so so at this point like I guess there's another deeper point which is at some point you will probably have to take an advertising dollar from someone who is incoming versus outbound so today if we were gonna start advertising I would just say Nick by the way Nick is behind the camera so at some point Nick you should just walk through so people can see who Nick is but I would say Nick can you please go and reach out to these twelve companies and we've already made a list of like these are the companies that I love the most and I use their products religiously and

[00:55:50] I pay to use their products blah blah blah blah blah let's go out to them and have them sponsor the podcast and who knows maybe like a subset of them would do it invariably you're gonna have to you're gonna exhaust those avenues and you're going to need to take inbound my fear is even though I do I think I have you know very high integrity at some point I'm concerned like what if I just start deciding subconsciously that a certain product is better than another product because it's gonna pay a lot more than another product would mm I don't know

[00:56:22] I'd like to think that's not the case I'd like to think that I'm impervious to that kind of influence but I don't know if I am and if I could prevent having to go down that path I would like to do so so I think I don't want to do ads so I think that basically leaves two options the first option is to do what my really good friend Sam Harris does and Sam has been beyond generous in his time that he has spent with me walking me through what is involved in a listener support model which is what Sam does an entirely listener support model Sam also if anyone hasn't listened to his podcast he also does a great job explaining his rationale for it and he does it far more eloquently than I could reproduce it here so if you're interested in why Sam feel strongly about that it's worth doing Rhonda Patrick is also entirely through a listener support model though it's a different model than Sam's so I think that is one really good model again I don't think it's going to be as lucrative as ads I mean if we're gonna be honest it's it's probably not as lucrative as ads but I think in the long run it actually could be better the second model is something that I would only be a participant in and it would be there are lots of you know people out there talking about kind of a model like

[00:57:43] Netflix where there's a you know a number of you know people would be part of a podcast network where you only get to listen to their podcasts if you are a member of the Netflix equivalent that is something that has only been put on my radar over the last two or three weeks so it's a little hard for me to sort of quantify and understand the economics of that I mean I understand the economics of it but really pressure test them but that could also be advantageous because again it has the luxury of being it frees you from the constraints of ads it has its drawbacks frankly I mean you're going to lose listeners if you do that even if you make more money you still lose listeners it will reach fewer people because the probability that everybody who's listening to a podcast for free will go and join a service for that I think is relatively low so I know that's not a great answer because I haven't given the answer but I would like to believe that by 2019 we are absolutely monetizing this podcast and I suspect it will be one of the latter two approaches and not an advertising approach I will say this if we do go down that Deut if we end up going down those paths I would still like to talk about products that I like because one of the pieces of feedback we did get from that you know sort of very informal poll we put out was people want to know what things we like and to be able to actually chuck the products we like when we're not getting paid to shuck them tells you we're really just shucking because we like them so you know I like this ring I like this ambulance siren I like this bottle of water you know whatever it is like we can just talk about it openly and I think that there's there's benefit to people in that because then they'll know like okay wow that's that's the way that's that's an ideal way to get an ad mmm okay you have anything to say to make what I just said better like you did with every other question what is it uh Buffett and Munger they did the the annual meetings yeah a lot of times they just I forget the like what he said basically I thought that was well what he said yeah that's that's like I have anything to add I think that's what it is they'll say there we go to Charlie Munger after Buffett does like a dissertation you know on economics I have nothing to add that's what I'm gonna strive for this next question what exactly are you looking to achieve and monitor with your blood glucose monitor your CGM your g6 would you another product if you probably you love I love the g6 and I'll talk about it all day long and you know without advertising it without you know receiving advertising dollars to talk about it you know it's funny the g6 along with the aura ring which I've talked a lot about are these and I've worn every wearable that there is but they're the only two that seems sticky enough that I can't stop wearing them like if I like a month ago I went to charge my aura ring and I forgot to put it back on my finger when I went to bed so I slept without it and I woke up the next morning and realized I didn't have it I didn't have the data like it made any goddamn difference in my life I was so pissed the I was like God how could you forget to put your ring um there's probably a whole separate issue with that but and the same thing with like the continuous glucose monitor I just it's hard for me to imagine I used to not know my glucose in real-time so there are a couple things from it right the first is it's a great way for me to control my behavior and I know it's tempting to want to believe that I'm somehow impervious to the forces of bad food but the reality is a reality of it is I am NOT there was a day I think when

[01:01:28] I you know had a remarkable resilience and willpower and I could do anything you know eat this don't eat that exercise like this exercise yeah I could I was a robot for so much of my life until three years ago and something just happened in 2015 and I just fell off the rails and I've never got back on I simply do not

[01:01:52] Zess the intestinal fortitude to be a robot anymore and I I I could speculate on several of the reasons for that which I don't want to get into but the long and short of it is Here I am I am in an environment where like you know yesterday I was on a plane and they were handing out cookies and I really wanted a cookie I think the only reason I didn't eat that cookie that was bigger than my head is because I knew

[01:02:20] I'd have to look at my CGM data after mmm I mean so there is no more powerful behavioral tool for me than my CGM because in the end I'm kind of a competitive person internally much more competitive internally than externally by the way and I just can't stand to see spikes of glucose it just drives me nuts and so which is not to say I don't go off the rails sometimes I absolutely do we were in Fenway Park through their day and I had fries now luckily I had fasted all day and worked out so I didn't actually experience a spike of glucose from the fries so I got to have the fries without the without the badness but I was sort of ready for it I was kind of bracing myself like oh you might you might get a little testy seeing this thing but that actually gets to the second point which is it has allowed me to very eloquently calibrate how to tether activity levels nutrient deprivation the consumption of treats and minimize the damage you know I don't know that I could drive a racecar very well without seeing my rpm tach like if you plug my ears so that I couldn't actually hear the rev of the engine and you took away my rpm tach and said Drive could I still drive the car yes could I

[01:03:45] Drive it half as well as I can drive it when I know exactly where I'm shifting at every moment where I need to shift mmm no there's simply no way like it you know we don't we just were feedback machines we need feedback so yeah I mean I'm a huge CBS egm advocate and really looking forward to what the next few years will bring when these things can become a lot more affordable and a lot more accessible and the question is can that be done without them remaining as medical devices so the one I wear now is the Dexcom g6 is a medical device it's an fda-approved device and it gives you a number that is in this case incredibly accurate it's probably plus or minus 2 or 3% specifically for the purpose of someone with diabetes being able to dose their insulin the FDA will very likely not allow such a device into a consumer market because the concern would be that such a device could be used outside of a prescriptive relationship with a physician to dose insulin so therein lies a whole bunch of issues that would basically the way it would happen today is the FDA would basically have to neuter the device such that the information couldn't be used for treatment purposes which means they either take away the real-time nature of it which is what makes it so valuable or give you a bunch of ranges and dilute the accuracy those are basically the new levers with which you could neuter one of these devices deliberately which sounds crazy right like it's like the backwards step okay I know you have a

[01:05:24] Zippo lighter we're gonna start using sticks instead you're gonna rub them together you know so but all that said you know hopefully you know in an ideal world the medical device becomes cheap enough that if you want that level of precision fidelity and real-time feedback you'll just you know look doctors write prescriptions for way crazier things than see GM's right got

[01:05:48] Doc's out there writing prescriptions for pain meds all day long and every hormone Under the Sun I don't think it's a big stretch to say doc I need a CG mm-hmm and I think you might have mentioned this too in terms of what you are looking to achieve and monitor with your blood glucose you might have said that it's a proxy for your insulin and maybe you could explain why there isn't a continuous insulin monitor alongside your glucose monitor that would be a nice get if it actually exists a lot in 2011 and 2012 even met with the engineer he's actually I don't know if he's still there but I don't remember his name now unfortunately but he was he might have been an emeritus professor of engineering at UCSD but he was actually the first guy to figure out actually how to do these real-time glucose monitors the what are called a point-of-care device it actually took him out to lunch one day to pick his brain on well why don't we just do this for insulin and he was like would that be interesting and it was just funny to talk to him cuz he's an engineer like why would he know that insulin would be as interesting as glucose or more interesting and and so we actually dug into this a lot and and basically the the short of it is if you can't measure the assay using an antibody or enzymatic reaction that very quickly without any washing yields and answer you can't do it at a point-of-care device and insulin is pretty hard to measure so it was initially measured using something called a radio immune assay I believe today they're usually done with something called Eliza's which are these enzyme linked you know rattle off what

[01:07:21] Eliza stands for but it's it's like it's a chemical reaction where you have to you know puts to put an enzyme on something rinse it off put another one on rinse it off inside resident words it can't be done in a moment so absent that I don't really see any direct way to measure insulin in real time now I've had discussions with some companies who are interested in using CGM data to impute changes in insulin and I think that could be done but I think it's a lot harder than people realize and you would need a lot of data to do it meaning you'd have you wouldn't just be able to do it off the CGM you'd have to do the CGM coupled with a lot of blood draws where you actually could you know basically build a regression curve off insulin and glucose to predict for the future insulin therein may lie and answer down the line so absent that a good proxy for having a low level of insulin is going to be a low level of glucose and a low level of glucose variability and the CGM spits out those reports so you go into it keep making noise with my stupid mic but you know you go into it low glucose variability one might yeah I don't if people can see this but on it and fir that the the a1c might be telling you that the a1c is not telling you anything about the variability but let's talk about anyone see in a moment but you can see that I can spit out at any point in time a 90-day 30-day fourteen day or seven day report and that report gives me average glucose and glucose standard deviation that's the variability so why is that relevant well the you could have an average glucose of 85 95 whatever with the standard deviation of 10 which is very low variability or you could have the same glucose level with a standard deviation of 30 and those are very different insulin profiles so you want to keep you want you want to keep that balance closer

[01:09:17] I've largely discounted hemoglobin a1c in an absolute sense as a meaningful number I think it's you know it's directionally tolerable but mostly and I know that because now I've used CGM in so many patients with calibration and compared it to a1c and you realize that the a1c is really at the mercy of its most important assumption which is a red blood cell lives for 90 to 120 days anything that takes it outside of that range leads to an over or under estimation of the a1c and therefore an over or under estimation of the average glucose and you can with a a 1c theoretically you can say I have an a1c of five point four and you can impute what your average glucose levels were theoretically yeah so the way the a1c works is you measure the a1c and you impute the average glucose the way the

[01:10:14] CGM works is you measure the average glucose which is actually all that matters but you can impute the a1c my a1c runs very high because I have this condition called beta thalassemia trait so I have a bunch of these low I think I talked about this in the podcast don't want to for blood is I have yeah there's the color yeah Mady used to call me shite for blood always in a Scottish accent yeah shake for blood so my little shite Bloods live a long long long time they I have no idea but it's clearly longer than hundred twenty days so my a1c is very high the lowest a1c I've ever seen in myself is 5.6 and the highest is 6.0 I'm so I'm basically just on a1c I'm a pre-diabetic pretty much all the time on

[01:10:54] CGM when you take a highly calibrated rigorous you know look my average blood glucose imputes that I would have an a1c between 4.5 and five that's sort of the range that I would live in so that's a material difference and again I've seen that difference in both directions with patients using CGM so my hope is that in ten years maybe that's ambitious I would hope that the hemoglobin a1c can't even be ordered on a lab and everyone just has a CGM you know and it's like a trivial little you know thing that you know even if you're getting a life insurance exam you just wear the CGM for two months and the data comes from that as opposed to actually measuring this nonsensical number you know okay is it just me or rather like way more like sirens today yeah 911 in New York City I don't know if that's anyway

[01:11:50] I feel like it's been non-stop sirens today which is I'm sorry for the listener but I think they get the heads-up that you're doing a podcast and just want to buzz the tower since that works surprised there hasn't been drag racing for teens going but I didn't get the permission for a flyby there no negative ghostrider the pattern is full lithium or lithium supplementation can you share your thoughts slash experiences yeah so I I think the evidence that groundwater containing higher levels of lithium rather than lower levels of lithium contributing to better mental health is you know as good as any such data can be which is to say not great I call it like tier two epidemiology so the worst epidemiology in the world is people who exercise this way have this much life for people who eat this way have this much you know disease or whatever like that's the worst epidemiology because you're measuring you're trying to accurately assess inputs and outputs so that you leave out epidemiology I just think we should stop doing that for the most part it's epidemiology as hypothesis-generating and it and this is an interesting observation more or less it's an interesting yeah but might the reason

[01:13:15] I'm calling this tier 2 epidemiology is like one of those variables is fixed like the ground water lithium concentration doesn't require you yeah easy yeah there's no healthy user bias and who's doing that the only thing you're measuring is the mental health on the other side so in other words that's a that's a better type of epi just like the you know igf-1 I alluded to earlier [Music] but it's actually not subtle right so if you look at those data it's actually not that subtle when you overlay like the US map of groundwater of lithium and mental health it's a it's a very nice

[01:13:48] Association now there is no doubt in my mind that you could think of other explanations for that I mean and that's the beauty of you know trying to be thoughtful about these things as well maybe the lithium in the groundwater is a proxy for something else maybe it's a proxy for education for socioeconomic status for weather like you could think of ten other things that could be back so all of that said at the first order it doesn't appear that there's an obvious proxy but there still may well be but at the other end of the spectrum what's the cost of the intervention of trying it out and so I decided several years ago that I wanted to try taking some lithium to see if it could help stabilize my mood but you know that's sort of a crazy thing to do so I did a ton of homework and and luckily one of my best friends Paul Conti who I've interviewed and will hopefully be on the podcast shortly maybe even by the time this has come out well that is that that true do you know the order of those Nick oh sweet all right so you'll have you'll have already met Paul Conti by the time this comes out you know Paul has an unbelievable experience with lithium because he is one of the few psychiatrists out there who is still very comfortable using lithium in mono therapy for high-risk bipolar patients so usually a patient with bipolar disorder is treated with several drugs but in some cases some of the drugs either the patient's don't respond they're recalcitrant to the drug or they produce such negative side effects they can drive up you know suicidal ideation things like that that you basically have to resort to just lithium and now that's our really scary that's about as scary a case as a psychiatrist can be in because you basically have to put enough lithium in that patient to take them almost to a toxic dose without pushing them over so

[01:15:40] I wanted to learn everything about lithium toxicity from talking with Paul and this is gonna sound a little crazy but when I first started taking lithium actually took it at a very high dose not the dose that someone who was taking mono therapy for bipolar would take but I was taking about half that amount so I was taking about 600 milligrams a day and again I'm hesitate to talk about this because I know some knucklehead is gonna go and take 600 milligrams lithium a day let me be crystal clear if you were not under they care of a physician who is super dialed in on how to measure lithium levels when to measure lithium levels which lithium's you take because it comes in a bunch of forms doing this is is 10 amount to you know suicide i mean it's complete stupidity so with all of that said under the most careful closely monitored conditions that one could have including getting lithium levels checked constantly I spent about a year taking 600 milligrams of lithium a day in two doses two different types of lithium a slow release a fast release I did it as an interesting experiment and I didn't tell anyone I was doing it because I wanted to know if anybody else would appreciate because I'm an emotionally volatile crazy guy so it's like there should be a noticeable difference and interestingly the first person to notice it was my wife which was about four months in when she was like something's different in you what is it again I have no idea because of course by me knowing

[01:17:08] I was taking the lithium maybe that altered my behavior in the end I decided I did not want to take mega doses of lithium because I did note I could actually have side effects the first side effects of too much lithium are nausea now even when you're nauseous on lithium you still don't reach the blood level that approaches the toxic levels which makes me wonder how those poor patients who are constantly taking 900 to 1,200 milligrams a day of lithium are tolerating it but I noticed whenever I traveled through different time zones if

[01:17:43] I took the lithium at different times because it was being compressed if I was stacking time zones flying East I would start to get nauseous when I took it I was like what the hell is that from and I realized oh my god like you probably just effectively took 900 milligrams so I was like you know what this is way this is I don't think there's enough upside I feel a bit better on this but I don't feel that much better that it's worth this hassle so I just stopped it for a couple of years and then recently like about two years ago I decided I went back and looked at the data and I was like look if those groundwater data are correct you don't need to be taking that much lithium to reproduce the levels it's we're not going 10 to 20 milligrams and that's not actually than over-the-counter dose so so that's why I take it now again you could put this in

[01:18:27] I I have certain you know things that I take that I put in the category of probably not harmful not sure how much value I'm getting out of it this would be one of those things is the the penny in front of a bulldozer yeah this is the 2x2 right so the reward is are you getting a penny or are you getting a

[01:18:46] Bitcoin the risk is are you picking this up in front is it like picking that thing up in front of a tricycle or a train this Timmy is trying to pick up a penny call it a dollar inflation it's picking up a dollar in front of a tricycle yeah at the end of the day hey it's a dollar it's dollar more than I had before and if I'm wrong the tricycle hitting me is not a lot of work what you never really want to do is pick up dollars in front of trains if you are gonna step in front of a train it better be to get a you know yes yes exactly yeah yeah yeah so I don't know if you said this but when your wife said there's something different she noticed something different did she say what it is or do you know what was that difference yes she said you're less of an interesting it wasn't subtle she said I don't know how to put my finger on it it's something about your Adnan down decreased okay and then when you supplement it on you said maybe like ten milligrams versus six hundred mm-hmm where you do you think you're achieving the same effect now it's impossible to know because the very first time I did all this stuff was before I meditated and frankly before I paid attention to any of this stuff I think I can be just as much of an today as I used to be I think the difference is I'm now so much more aware of it that I can correct my Ness quicker like I can be an but then I'll snap out of it in like twenty minutes as opposed to two days so I think now there are so many confounders that it would be impossible for me to say as lithium made any difference in my mental health mmm truthfully okay insights about berberine so berberine is a plant derived extract that has two properties one of which it gets a lot of attention for one of which it might not be as well known the first is that it is a weak a MP kinase activator and for those of you that have you know shown an interest in what metformin does that's sort of the the that's probably the secret sauce of metformin is its ampk activation so berberine when taken at you know sort of recommended OTC doses which I remember the doses anymore I think it's like a it might be actually a comparable dose to metformin it might be like either 500 twice a day or a thousand twice a day does have some of that weak AMPK activation and what that the net effect of that is it decreases hepatic glucose output so it's up regulating AMPK is telling the liver hey you can make less glucose so send less glucose out of the body and so in that sense it's a poor man's version of metformin

[01:21:41] I don't find that that interesting I prefer to just use metformin if we're gonna you know we're gonna go down that path like let's do it pharmacologically with you know potent drugs that we understand that are consistent from batch to batch that have a much higher sort of oversight of regulation that kind of stuff the other thing about berberine and this is that this is when i still do use it in clinical practice is it is also a weak inhibitor of the enzyme pcsk9 which any listener this podcast is gonna be very well up to speed on what pcsk9 is the word on the street is it probably only works in a subset of people who over express pcsk9 so if you so pcsk9 is a is a protein that degrades LDL receptors so if you overexpress this enzyme you're gonna really degrade LDL receptors you're gonna have a higher LDL particle number and probably a higher LDL cholesterol if you take that subset of patients they seem to respond quite nicely to berberine now the question is how do you know that i don't think there's a test anymore to measure that after attack which i think might have got absorbed into vapp or something like that i think he used to have a test but in the end i was like why am i gonna do some tests on somebody to see if they over express pcsk9 before I give them bourbon I'll just give them berberine make no other change and see if there's not a significant enough difference in their

[01:23:12] LDL I don't care and every once in a while you just you look like a rock star you get this patient who's LDL is really high and you check your boxes like they don't have their triglycerides aren't that high they're phytosterols are not that high they're Standells are not that high they're does mas trawls not that high hey they clearly have defective LDL clearance maybe they overexpress pcsk9 which would be one of a thousand reasons you could have like literally there are two thousand genetic mutations that can lead to an inability to clear LDL receptor goes this is like one of them but this one amounts to about 5% of them and so in that patient you hit them with berberine and all of a sudden like everything's fixed do you see that with metformin at all no no I don't think about Foreman possesses that that that that piece of what berberine has mm-hmm okay now what is your reasoning for taking baby aspirin and what does the science say well interesting timing so the science has changed on this as of about a month ago so my thinking on this has actually changed in the past month historically I took baby aspirin just because I come from a family where heart disease is rampant and that's sort of you know if you know in the spirit of our good friend Charlie Munger you brought up him

[01:24:25] I'm gonna go you know show me where I'm gonna die and I'll try to not be there so you know the crystal ball says I'm probably gonna die of heart disease so let's do everything in our power to mitigate it let's keep the lipids as low as possible inflammation as low as possible don't do anything that's gonna exacerbate endothelial dysfunction take the baby aspirin which probably acts primary you know somewhat through yeah it probably has some effect on inflammation but probably the majority of its effect uh is is obviously on platelets and therefore reducing thrombotic events which are the final you know like that's that's what pushes you off the cliff when you have an MI I would have said that prior to a month ago my view on baby aspirin was if your aspirin works test is positive so the aspirin works test is a test we do in urine that measures metabolites of platelets and basically tries to predict which patients will and won't respond to baby aspirin if that level is high my practice used to be to put patients on a baby aspirin if there was at least one other reason to do so so if they had an elevated LP PLA - if I had an elevated

[01:25:37] LP little-a if they had a significant enough risk of heart disease that I would feel that that those two things and I fit in that category right so I have a normal LP little a normal LP PLA - but my family history for heart disease is high and my aspirin works was high so that's why I take a baby aspirin and then you have to weigh that against the consequence of a baby aspirin which is look you're gonna have a little more easy bruising you have the runs a small risk almost unmeasurable of how an ulcer nowadays we're using you know because using a baby aspirin its enteric li coded you know this is a far lower risk than say taking ibuprofen or something like that the coating helps it get into is it in the small intestine rather than the stomach yeah it basically prevents it from you know sort of destroying the gastric mucosa now that said there was a study that came out about three weeks ago we could link to it that looked at healthy so low risk populations and it found that the risk of taking a baby aspirin was very small which we always knew but the benefit was also very very small such that it was pretty much a wash and I would say that you know that's the nature of clinical medicine as more and more data become available you start to revise your criteria how will this change the way I practice I will likely be just a little bit less interested in giving baby aspirin to a patient who is otherwise low risk and then certainly patients that had it didn't have an elevated aspirin works I would rarely use it anyway unless there was some other overwhelming reason will I keep taking it yeah you know as I look to streamline the list and I'm always kind of tweaking what I'm taking you know one thing that's interesting about baby aspirin it's not a great this is a great example of like what our research team is capable of right I used to also think baby aspirin was a reasonable thing to take on a flight you know if you're flying on a long flight you don't want to minimize your risk of a blood clot take a baby aspirin especially if you have another risk factor so any patient

[01:27:41] I had that had an elevated LP little-a which is increases your risk of blood clotting probably by 2 X although that's still debatable hey those are great you know those are patients that should take too baby aspirin on a flight kind of thing then we had the team look into this right I think dan looked into all on this stuff and wrote in a really nice white paper on it and it turned out that turned that the data didn't support it at all actually you know so you were basically in the camp of either taking flight tabs or her low molecular weight heparin which I've taken low molecular weight heparin but it's injectable I've taken it on really long flights and in the end I'm like it's just not worth a freaking hassle like I'd rather just get up and walk around as much as possible so but yeah and just a great example of how a lot of times things that are intuitive might turn out to be not necessarily standing up to the rigor of a clinical trial and these are the things that are easy to study in clinical trials you know a lot of times clinical trials don't answer questions that we care about but this is the kind of stuff where they can give you a pretty good answer okay this is switching gears a little bit how do you use heart rate variability as a metric in your practice and/or in your own personal use sleep pre post exercise pre post eating every morning readiness yeah

[01:28:55] I mean III so when I started getting into heart rate variability it was long before there were commercial you know like rings and wearables that were making it easy to track and so god I'm blanking on the guy's name got me into it his name's will Eden works for Peter Thiel and I'm I don't know how I met will but you know we had a bunch of friends in common and somehow we met and suppose like six years ago and went up and spent the day in Peter's office and he was showing me like the raw data on their heart math so heart math was a company that was running the algorithm on chest straps a chest strap that was gathering a data and then heart math was the algorithm you were doing it and I was really impressed by the data roughly speaking what is heart rate variability

[01:29:47] I guess it's worth defining this there's be another great whiteboard discussion but why don't we get a little like we should have had like a little posted like a little white little flip chart here because we could just draw on the walls too I'm sure he kids do it sometimes when I hear a funny story about this yeah so I got in really late last night and but it was still early enough that somehow my son Reese was up but I like as I landed he's just getting ready to go to bed and I'm like oh I I just I wanted like FaceTime him right so we have this thing where I tell him stories every night and I don't know where this came from but like I just decided the name of the character was

[01:30:23] Reginald I just love the name Reginald right so I'm like Reginald is a four year old boy who has a younger brother and an older sister and it's like everything is about except it's not about Rhys its Reginald and Rhys is obsessed with trash cans but Reginald is obsessed with helicopters so we're into a sweet Reginald story and you can see my wife is sitting next to him and she's like kind of rolling her eyes like come on get on when they get over know and like I gotta get this kid to bed and I'm like so I was like I got to make it a quick story so I'm like one day

[01:30:52] Reginald wanted to draw a picture but he couldn't find any paper so he grabbed his markers and he drew a big helicopter on the wall and riesling sits up and he goes he did wide and I hear my wife go good story dad and I'm like oh I mean but after he drew the helicopter on the wall he was grounded for a month and never allowed to draw again I had to like walk myself back it's a good save I think dad's just do that like I think we just give kids bad ideas and we don't realize it because we fling foot-and-mouth disease I think yeah I think so even the like today I heard I heard about it again she's like he's still talking about Reginald drawing on the wall just so you know when that happens you're the one painting it it's like fine I'm sorry just try to tell a story what was I talking about the HRV

[01:31:50] Ohr V right so so when you look at this will people listening to this I'm sorry this won't make much sense but if you're watching this hopefully you'll see this so it when you look at an EKG which you probably appreciate is there's like this little P wave which is the atrial contraction and then there's the little down tick of the Q the R and the S wave and that's the ventricular contraction and then there's the T wave which is the repolarization and so that is like one heartbeat P dip Q spike r s t can people see that like when I'm doing it I bet I can figure out the technology that it like makes when you're doing that we can make the sinus wave that would be very wrong to Patrick Rhonda would do that that's that's that's that that's Rhonda would take it to that level right we might be too lazy okay so let's say somebody's heart rate is beating 60 times per minute they're there at rest the length of time but those are waves because the spike of the our wave is the most obvious place to measure the beat to beat time would be one second right sixty beats per minute if you're beating a hundred and twenty beats per minute it would be half a second or five hundred milliseconds so what heart rate variability is doing is asking the question how much variability is there between those beats and you might think well if you're just sitting there at rest how much variability can there be and the answer is it depends on what time scale you're using to measure it if you're just measuring it in seconds not much at all but if you're measuring it in one thousandth of a second or milliseconds there could be quite a bit so somebody whose EKG or you know heart rate measurement looks like it's chugging along at sixty beats per minute it might still be you know nine hundred and seventy milliseconds 1030 milliseconds 1005 milliseconds 970 milliseconds etc there's a mathematical algorithm that you applied that you apply that called the root mean square of the standard deviation that basically our MSSD that basically turns that number it's a transformation so it's in mathematics we call these things transformations where you basically compress these numbers and you can then now measure how much variability there's going on okay I don't want to get much more into the math on that in large part because actually don't I'm not I'm you know like I'm not an expert on this topic there's a little bit of this on the Loess deposits right about the height for high frequency versus the low frequency that's right now we included that in the show notes so that's looking at the difference between the RR intervals something like well the RR interval is the raw data like so I'll back up for a moment so when I got really into this there were basically two companies that were doing the analysis heart math and first beat I chose to work with first beat even though I would say at the time both of their algorithms were excellent but the first beat was a you actually that it came with its own little EKG thing so it came with a you would put a sticker here and you'd put a sticker here and then basically you hung this little battery packed wire across your chest like a couple of leads under you had a couple leads yeah and it was actually funny because the the stickiness of their leads was so profound I have like leather skin like nothing can hurt me I was like completely tore my skin off I was like for a year two years after I started using it I was deep pigmented where I had those leads it's like so we ended up like realizing well it's gonna be really hard to do with patients and so they came out with like a less sticky lead and you know we got away with it but it would capture the data then you would actually have to send the device you know you'd have to plug the device in your computer and it would ruin a sort of do the analysis before I get to what I do today the more important point is what did that data tell us what were we looking for so we were looking for several things so the device could measure heart rate heart rate variability and respiratory rate obviously it has the it has the sensitivity to measure the thoracic movement it would use an algorithm firstbeat had an algorithm and I'm sure heart math has its own algorithm and they're both proprietary to impute from that whether they believed that the user was in a more parasympathetic or sympathetic state or under a period of profound stress like exercise so if heart rate variability became very low and heart rate and respiratory rate were high it would basically impute that to be you are exercising and it would graphically represent that one way if heart rate were low heart rate variability were high it would interpret that as low sympathetic tone low fight-or-flight tone high parasympathetic tone it would represent that a certain way and you can you know extrapolate from there well so the the advantage of this is you could get really cool data and you would typically have the patient wear this for three days taking it off only to shower so they would exercise with it they would sleep with it that would change the lead once a day it became a really helpful way for us to try to look at sleep pattern the problem is the compliance was very low most patients didn't want to do it and it took so long to get the data you know if a patient was in New York doing this they'd have to mail the thing back to you know Mary in San Diego and it's just kind of a pain in the ass so the the products like Ora ring or you know there's others like you know woop tries to do this motive tries to do this

[01:37:29] I can't speak to their technology as well but nevertheless now we can basically get those data every day when we wake up just looking at the data from our wearable so as a general rule you want to see higher heart rate variability because that's a marker of more parasympathetic flow provided again that's being measured correctly you those are the things that I've observed so so when you when you look at the recovery index on the aura ring which is one of its menus what it's basically doing is using a lot of data but one of them is the parasympathetic the heart rate variability so as you over train your heart rate variability will go down your resting heart rate will go up I think I've talked about this in the past but I mean you know alcohol and shitty food close to bedtime will absolutely tank my resting heart rate meaning it will drive it way up and will drive my heart rate variability down and it's not subtle it's not like well that's on the edge no no no like it's because you see the tracing of the data overnight it's only reporting the average and the max but you can just look at the raw data and it's pretty clear that you know those things you know really diminish those parameters and and by extension then your your recovery and your sleep quality so heart rate variability then becomes one of the parameters along with temperature movement etc that then feeds into the algorithms that predict sleep quality and recovery mm-hmm again I've kind of forgot the question but I know it had to do with heart rate very yeah how you use it in the practice and personally I'm wondering like do you is it actionable you've talked about doing deadlifts and saying I forget the number but it's it's not small where you say you're doing deadlifts you'll warm up you'll you're you're gonna be warming up to a heavy if and then you actually you walk away because you're not feeling it that day is there anything that you look at it with the HRV the readiness or things like that and today absolutely I'm feeling great but this thing is telling me absolutely III so there's two things that are really valuable the first is and this gets to the point we made with the CGM which is real-time feedback is awesome take away real-time feedback it's hard to do anything I mean everybody's heard the famous experiments when you put on a headphone that delays your voice you hearing your voice by a few seconds you can't carry on for more than a sentence yeah right I've experienced that yeah yeah so that's actually that's horrible that's like a negative feedback that's not just taking away the feedback that's like actually inserting negative feedback which is incredibly destructive so the first thing is when I wake up in the morning and I see that my HRV or my heart rate or my temperature or my respiratory rate is off and again I have my parameters I know what I want to be I immediately can say what did you do different I mean that's how I sort of figured out what my tolerance for alcohol was you can have one drink don't have to and by the way one's not even good like one gives you slight hit two is a brick over the head and probably what time are you drink yeah like when are you drinking that and then like that's how I've certainly figured out like meal timing like oh boy you're eating a little too close to bed like that's not good room temperature like all you know all of the crap that I do is largely based on this empirical iterative tinkering approach which allows me to have data and then of course by giving patients these devices you can figure out what's true for a patient because it might necessarily be true for me so in many ways I'm trying to help a patient understand how they can do the tinkering so that they can figure out their optimal state I mean I look for example

[01:40:59] I like a room to be as cold as is humanly possible I mean if it's like if I don't get under the covers and feel incredibly uncomfortable I'm going to be too hot not by my standards but that you know that might be not at all your standard right so so that's that and then to your point yeah the readiness score for me especially when I'm starting to feel a little sick sometimes that readiness score becomes the harbinger of that and you know I like to see and also it also gives me some inclination you'll often see it dip after you've had two consecutive days a really hard work now I will say this I don't think it's as sensitive to lifting workouts so it doesn't seem to possess the ability to distinguish between like you did deadlifts until you puked versus you you know you were at the hotel gym and you did like press like it can't it but what it sure as hell knows is like you went out and you know expended 1,500 kilojoules yesterday on a bike or you know a thousand kilojoules in a run where you ran at you know seven-minute miles like it knows that and it you you you stack a couple of those days on top of each other and it says wow that's that's serious illness I'd love to see the data on you know because I I think a couple of teams in the Tour de France war the aura ring this year I'd love to see what those data were like it their recovery scores must have been the lowest numbers imaginable because of the physiologic stress they're under so yeah despite the fact that they're so fit and like you know the most remarkable physical specimens you know I mean look at the sort of the trend over the course of the three weeks yeah and see the dip yeah yeah I'm really interesting

[01:42:38] I need to make a note to it because I I'd like to follow up and see if anyone's ever been willing to share those data and you mentioned you may have mentioned this before but on your when you fasted you did a week-long fast you said your sleep was remarkable yes did the aura ring did that did it corroborate it in any way when you looked at the data from the aura ring that it tells you anything really deep sleeve yeah the biggest the deep sleep is what went up the most so the deep sleep when

[01:43:05] I'm the most the light sleep went down the least went down the most so lights the so stage one and two went down stage three and four went up REM was about unchanged HRV was higher resting heart rate was was like what you would acquit resting heart rate was on par with what it is if you're not eating and drinking before bed trying to think what else I have to go back and look I think respiratory rate went down hmm which i think is a vco2 thing I think that the shittier and Morcar be a meal is before bed the higher your vco2 you're really trying to blow off more of that co2 yeah we know that your respiratory quotient is higher so unless your vo2 is going up your vco2 has to be the thing that's going up more that would wouldn't surprise me to see respiratory rate go up a little bit and anecdotally that's at least what I think guys I'm seeing interesting so it'll be half way through this yeah what are we at we're at an hour 45 god damn I freaking talk too much man oh I have a blender like five questions yeah yeah we could get through more questions if we if we do a gimmick I mean you love gimmicks you love oh you know I love get bumper sticker love wallpaper your cars and with bumper stickers I was thinking we could do like a speed round or I used to watch pardon the interruption where it was I think they'd different segments but probably like 90 seconds Nick doesn't have a bell that he can ring with the 90 seconds but maybe he can he's got a timer faster professional is what he's got I'm not wearing my my cows Casio calculator watch but I'm pretty sure it's better than the speed master I could be wrong I don't know the moon watch man it'd be the single most special watch ever made so do you want to give this a shot basically well oh yeah one minute to answer a question yeah 60 seconds to 90 seconds all right so why don't we just say 90 second ickle bludgeon you with a club if you don't if you go over yeah 90 seconds so here we go with the emergence of the coconut oil is player distinct does he start timeing after you finish this I was thinking about that as I was reading yeah after the question after the question yeah I 90 seconds I worry about every five seconds how much time you have left because I know that that would really be fettle hell yeah with the emergence of the coconut oil is pure poison article can you shed some light on saturated fat in the literature and the types of studies done specifically on coconut oil it's a great question for 90 seconds and go I'm gonna time it on your to just so I can keep you honest 85 seconds

[01:45:51] I think that that whole coconut oil literature stuff is sort of ridiculous because I don't want to get started on nutritional epidemiology I've already alluded to it a bunch of times I think it is the lowest form of human inference imaginable which is not to say it provides zero benefit but it's at the hazard ratios that these things typically come up coupled with the reliance on food frequency questionnaire is something

[01:46:18] I've even filled out myself just to prove how ridiculously useless they're like asking me what I ate two days ago not a chance I'm going to be able to give you anything within an order of magnitude of reality all that said I actually think the case for saturated fat may be overstated meaning I think that the view that saturated fat is never harmful and we should be able to ingest it at the tune of 90% of our calories I think we have to accept the reality that that that can't be healthy for everyone certainly clinically I don't see that to be the case I know I've only got 24 seconds left so what I would say is rather than rely on some knucklehead study put out by some bottom-feeding group of you know information providers learn to understand what the biomarkers are the change as a result of it both inflammatory lipoprotein lipid wise time go done would you discuss the recent meta studies that claim moderate carbohydrate intake may be best for health you might be able to cite your previous question so citing my previous answer yeah that study that Britain particularly referring to I'm sure will link to it I don't remember it must have come out of the Harvard School of Public

[01:47:34] Health right yes okay yeah so so the bottom line is look it suffers from all of the usual problems of Epidemiology and this is by the way Zooey harcum actually wrote a great piece on this so I will just point people to that because I think she did a better job explaining this all the usual happy nonsense then on top of that layer and they used like the nutritional epi nonsense which is like again nutritional epi is like its own brand of really bad epi which is in and of itself a horrible brand of science and then on top of that there were some really you know systemic issues that you know she points out they didn't correct for alcohol consumption they they had some other really odd co-founder confounders in there the hazard ratios were themselves quite low and they you know again this is more of a reporting issue than it was an issue of the actual survey but again all of these risks always seem to be discussed in absolute terms when in absolute terms they're not

[01:48:35] I mean people have heard me rail on the Women's Health Initiative for the same reason in terms of the hormone replacement therapy component of that you know talking about a 24 percent increase in breast cancer in a relative sense when the absolute increase was 0.1 percent these things to me are an abomination mmm and I'm gonna just timeout at a minute 26 yeah I think anytime you look at relative risk it doesn't really tell you anything unless you also know they tell you what absolute risk is too you should always look at those two things together yes you have to know look at notice how I'm using a little bonus time here we're outside of the time and he's asking me a question so I'm just gonna take it that's right you have to know absolute risk you have to know relative risk and you have to know the period over time under which the condition was studied relative to the natural course of the illness it's that third party point that doesn't get enough attention it so anyway yeah off the soapbox what is the number one recommendation habit you would suggest every person add to their daily regimen besides physical activity in parentheses for wholesome health okay that's exactly the kind of question like I never want to talk yeah I don't know I mean again you can't answer this question without sounding glib like get a lot of sleep if you do something physical every day don't eat for a long period of time when you do eat don't eat crap meditate I'm gonna leave it at that number one was there number one the number one you know

[01:50:07] I know you could probably work it in somehow to say like the number one the number one habit we're gonna so here's what happened that you could get into is two is two it's almost like Simon's first principle you could say that like don't just don't take someone's number one will look is everyone recommended okay so that would be the elegant thing to say the one thing I would say on this that's important to understand is probably sleep is the one we are going to be most sensitive to in other words if I said to you don't eat for this many days or don't eat well for this many days I mean you could get away with that for a long time you can Nadya I think an average person could probably go thirty days without eating they could go years without eating well and still make her recovery how long could you go without sleeping before you're completely off the rails

[01:50:53] I mean it's days so in many ways you know we say sleep might be the single most important but that's probably not accurate information that's probably not the correct way to say it the right way to say it is probably sleep is the one that you will suffer from the quickest yeah I was close I was like 129 what does it mean if your body has a harder time getting into ketosis via fasting than it used to testing using a precision extra oh that's an interesting question so the implication is that at one point this person was fasting getting into nutritional ketosis are getting into starvation ketosis presumably is this fellow filibustering right now is this the timer going yeah yeah I think it'll be similar to two like people talking like I went on an Atkins diet and I you know but the weight melted off and then ten years later I'm on an Atkins diet and I was like I could my weight wasn't really so much well if I infer that from the question I see to me they're talking about the numerical values of the BHB level yeah yes yeah yeah so it's different interpretation so so the those are two entirely different questions so we should just pick one and answer it if we if the question is I don't get to the same levels of BHB using a precision extra because they went out of their way to explain how they were measuring it I think that's what they're asking it could be a number of things it could be that they are more efficiently utilizing their ketones now so you're accumulating fewer of them because you are drawing them off you are utilizing them more they have become a more preferred substrate it could be that they're actually just producing less of them in other words they're doing something different that they didn't realize they were doing in the past maybe they've changed their composition of fatty acids maybe they're eating more protein maybe they have more car in their diet things like that hard to know without knowing a lot more detail but those would be the directionally the two things I would explore yeah the first one being impossible to really demonstrate outside of a laboratory yeah

[01:52:41] I think it's a great point that a lot of some of the piece trips is another way to look at ketones is it a acetoacetate is that the way those yeah when they're looking at that you think well my ketones are through the roof because I'm peeing out tons of ketones like is that necessarily optimal to be yeah anecdotally it seems to go down over time the more adapted a person gets because their body realizes hey look I mean I'm not gonna waste this fuel here

[01:53:07] I'm gonna utilize it yeah can you give a 90-second reasoning for why you are why you are taking zetia and lipitor are you mitigating risk based on your apoe4 or is there something else going on so actually I'm not taking them anymore which speaks to my point of I'm always changing meds influx but why I was taking lipitor and zetia at the time and will always continue to vacillate into and out of lipid lowering medications is

[01:53:33] I'm trying to live as long as I can and for me that means delaying the onset of atherosclerosis as greatly as possible so you know why you wouldn't want to take an all-hands-on-deck approach to that which is reducing the burden of lipoproteins maximally inflammation into theal health insulin and all these things we want them to be all as low as possible as for the choices of those two agents lipitor it's all empirically derived so so through trial and error I have figured out that you know I synthesized a reasonable amount of cholesterol and taking ten of lipitor three times a week was actually able to when coupled with ezetimibe which is a works via a different mechanism but I could measure my phytosterols they were quite high and you might be a pretty strong responder to it so by you know so the 10 plus 10 stack of those two was a minimum effective dose that produced you know very good results in me meaning it got me to below the 20th percentile typically to the 10th or 15th percentile and you know so 30 milligrams of atorvastatin a week is you know almost placebo dose when you consider what the drug can be given at 80 milligrams daily but today I'm doing something different time okay you met you have mentioned a few times on your podcast that you are currently working on writing a book what will the book be about and what is the expected release date so the book will be about my experience as a shepherd what a lot of people don't know about me is prior to you know the stuff

[01:55:13] I do now I was a shepherd and I you know I just saw I think there's not a not there not there not a lot of you know pop culture references to shepherds we don't you know there aren't really sitcoms about shepherds I mean most people just don't know much about what the day-in and day-out life of a shepherd is like and so I thought that would be a good story to tell to just talk about my experience as doing that and so you know it's been a tough book to write because obviously I have to go back through all of my Shepherd journals which are all bound in leather sheepskin bindings are beautiful or and I hope to have the manuscript completed by the end of this year which would mean probably a release date in early 2020 now the drawback of having an early 2020 release is I suspect virtually everyone in this country will be hyper fixated on politics at that time as will be spinning up to an election cycle and if your choice is trying to understand if someone's going to challenge the incumbent president from his own party and who the opposition will be versus the life and times of a shepherd I think it's gonna be an uphill slog to try to get the attention of the masses but you know I think one of the other drawbacks of a 2020 release date is people are probably dying for that book to be released and they have to wait a couple of years that's right yeah I think the only thing that you can do to you know expedite this process we'd all be grateful believe me I wish I wish I could I wish

[01:56:54] I could get to this quicker what are your thoughts on nicotinamide rai beside supplementation for longevity oh boy there's no freaking way I get to do this in 90 seconds well first of all the good news is I just had an awesome discussion with David Sinclair about this a week ago so in the next two months or whatever that again I keep saying that like I know when this is gonna come out sometime in October November the interview with David will come out actually since that interview a really interesting paper has come to my attention written by one of my medical school classmates Josh Rabinowitz so I actually read both of these papers in the plane yesterday they're freaking phenomenal and emailed Josh a whole bunch of questions to which he responded

[01:57:36] I would say the long and short of it is this and this is not gonna make me very popular with anybody I am completely unconvinced that taking supplemental nr or even nmn by mouth is doing anything other than enriching the companies that make those things let me repeat that nad which you need in the cell you could argue having more an ad in a cell is a better thing that's the second order question I'm asking for an exemption to my 90 second rule this is such an important question Nick is nodding by the way just so you guys know I'm getting the okay so you could say it like a heavy set have you said judge

[01:58:12] I'll allow it but I know David Sinclair is going up on November 5th so you will go into much more detail around sirtuins and nad but nevertheless I was Comic Sans here the fine yeah what the hell was that shitty ass font I did calibri 'calibri no no we should do that you shouldn't be allowed to have that on your computer a veneer times there's lots of options but not Calibri please that's not acceptable I think he did that on purpose problem there's no way passive aggressive hieroglyphics so so hot so so sells cannot take up an ad so cell has to be able to make its own nad so the idea of giving precursors has become obviously the most interesting idea now what Rabinowitz his paper showed and we should link to this so this was in cell metabolism it just came out like if

[01:59:09] I mean in the last few weeks it's a 32-page paper hmm it's I it was it took me a while to get through but basically Josh who was like I said was one of my med school classmates and is still pissed off at me that I didn't invite him to Easter Island two years ago to which I feel horrible and I it's only and it's a terrible omission and he has already received an invitation to our next trip to Easter Island next year he developed his lab developed a tracer to track all of the intermediaries of nad and all the precursors so you can give

[01:59:43] NR n MN and these things can be taken into a cell and then converted into an ad in the cytoplasm and it appears that according to another paper of Josh's that we could link to if people are interested it appears that nad is formed entirely in the cytoplasm and then imported holy as nad into the mitochondria where in theory you would want to have that higher concentration here's what the study showed when you gave oral NR or n

[02:00:11] MN the two popular precursors only the liver could make could take them up and make nad using crypto fan no other cell in the body could take it up so that would suggest to me that if you're taking oral nad a pardon me oral and R or n MN you're pretty much just giving it to your liver which is not exactly the place you want it to be this would not be changed by using pterostilbene that that wouldn't impact it at all similarly all those clinics that are out there giving nad infusions which is very popular that's always struck me as quackery and it just seems even more quackery today because none of those cells are able to take up nad so it would seem to me and I actually emailed Josh about this last night and he emailed me back today and agreed with my assessment based on all of these data would seem that the only way to increase cellular nad would be would be to use intravenous doses of n R or n MN hmm and unfortunately I just hadn't seen that paper because I would have loved to have had that discussion with David because he might have a counterpoint to it he might you know be unaware of it I'm not really sure but but that would that to me is very important and I've actually already spoken with a number of our patients who take supplemental nad and I've take supplemental NR and I've already said to them you know look I think you're sort of flushing money down the toilet again I don't think it's harmful you know this isn't like a four-alarm fire but I think based on these data I would have a hard time recommending that anybody take those products mm-hmm I really went over on that one I think I heard four hours and four minutes and 40s I think Dave Asprey mentioned IV an hour he had Charles

[02:01:50] Brenner on his podcast Charles Brenner I think is involved with I think it's nyan chroma Dex that company and then there's the other company Lucia Melissa bases yeah yeah I think they talked about it but I think Charles was making the argument that you got to take an hour or Kahneman not any D oh well I think it's just NR four Nyugen and then basis is an hour PT pterostilbene which is like a it's like a methylated resveratrol you know more bioavailable supposedly than resveratrol although as we learned from

[02:02:19] David very very fat soluble so if you're not taking it with a boatload of bile probably not doing a hell of a lot yeah okay um what's the next one which brand of supplements have you found effective well I mean the problem is the whole supplement world's kind of a show so unregulated so at some point maybe we can talk about branched chain amino acids because I know that they're I use them you know many of my patients use them and I've learned that most brands out there are not doing anything so but if you talk about like kind of the go-to supplement might this the companies that

[02:02:59] I rely on and and rely on their products are basically Jarrow j.a rrow pure encapsulations I'm not going to spell that because I can't like I might dyslexic when it comes to spelling like I can't spell to save my life oh we got spellcheck yeah I know but like as that I was at the spelling bee I was always the kid that like got out first okay spell the teehee

[02:03:26] Aged know sit down attea so so pure encapsulations Jarrow are probably the two companies that i would be my go-to for virtually anything I'm sure there are a couple of other companies that we will intermittently use depending on the product yeah but those are DHA or EPA it's Carlson's or Nordic Naturals yes thank ya Nordic Naturals and Carlson's I like for EPA DHA if not going down the pharmaceutical route those are also available pharmaceutic then you alluded to this point with metformin versus berberine that there's different regulation going on for those two two products and that's partly why you you would go to med Foreman if berberine was a pharmacological agent I know it's you know Big Pharma yes but the the scrutiny that they're under is oh yeah and I think for berberine when we do suggest patients take it I think we use thorne yeah as the brand that we recommend I know we went a little over their neck I could see you flailing but I figured I spent I wasted part of my time explaining how poorly my spelling was so are you currently accepting new patients no not probably not for the remainder of this year and I don't manage that so

[02:04:45] Mary who runs sort of the operations of the practice manages the the flow of patients and she gave me an earful a couple of days ago that we are not accepting any new patients I'm just based on how overworked the team is at the moment and the follow up question probably that's unsatisfying is the answer maybe is like how do I find a

[02:05:06] Peter Atia clone in my area other than maybe your brother yeah my brother is probably the best now Peter attea clone although it's funny I don't really think we look that much alike but everybody says we look so much alike I mean he's so much bigger than me like you know we just don't look like did I send you guys the video of him in the grocery store pretending to be Borat yes yeah you thought that was me you're just saying that because of the point

[02:05:34] I'm making no that was Paul all right I guess the point is yeah we look we look a lot like so you could so my brother lives in two raha morello I've got a Tom Morello you have him give you medical advice that's right so Tom Morello or and who I guess I'm guessing he lives in LA I don't I have no idea where Tom would live or my brother lives in Toronto so that probably the best way to get a clone of me mmm and then otherwise I think I think it would be a great thing if there's there would be some way that you could endorse other doctors but it's not something that it is something we talked about actually when we started nerd Safari and and I don't I mean I think it is something that would be an awesome service is to create kind of like a I was gonna say tumblr and I was gonna say Grindr to connect doctors and patients but like

[02:06:22] I'm not gonna make the joke but like a matchmaking service between doctors and patients where you could sort of say look without providing an endorsement because I don't think I can be in the business of endorsing people I know there are a ton of Doc's who think the way I think and if there are patients out there who want those Doc's we I don't know why we can't have a play a forum where they can sort of coexist because you know the the first hurdle is just the geography of it right it's like look if you live in Kansas City you know you're not gonna want to see some doctor in New York even if even if you even if

[02:06:55] I had the room in the practice it just wouldn't be practical so we just have too many things on our plate right now and I feel kind of bad cuz we've talked about doing that and we haven't done anything about it yeah but but maybe at some point you know we can because it's probably one of the questions we get asked consistently more than anything else but I feel like I get a lot of that over Twitter and it would it would be a great thing to do is to be able to say look if you're a doctor who adheres to a certain set of principles I just don't know how to do it without being kind of hokey and cheesy cuz like I don't know what we're advocating I don't know what when people say oh they want a clone of

[02:07:27] Peter what do they mean like a bald guy like I don't know what they actually want of I did someone oh I think that my experience from the people that I know and from you know this stuff on the interwebs the Twittersphere and Facebook but like the honest response I think that I that resonates with me the most is that they they hear they'll they'll read what you wrote they'll hear what you have to say you'll talk about your strategy with a patient the objective the strategy the tactics the things that you're doing the things that you're thinking about and then they think to themselves why the is my doctor not doing any of that stuff and I bet if I asked my doctor they wouldn't know they would barely even know or they would say either like you it's not important or I haven't heard of it or whatever the case is but I think it's like the level of deliberate care that you put into each patient at least is my personal experience like being a part of this and so I think that there it's almost like they're there frustrate part of it's like they're frustrated and they find somebody who can be this comprehensive and deliberate and thoughtful so what we should do is just have patients come up with a maybe maybe we could figure out a way to have patients generate like kind of a questionnaire of things that they want in a doc and we could we could be like a central clearinghouse of that where you know the the patients would input and vote on questions that they want asked and then doctors basically would post their answers to those questions along with where they are if they're taking patients do they take insurance if so which ones like are you

[02:09:04] Medicare you know what like there's a whole there's like 10 things you'd want to know and again I don't know make more work for us because I can see Nick like giving me the eyes right now that's like shut the up but but that that sort of puts the onus I think on the patients and the physicians who are willing to do the work I'm sure because I know there were docks out there who are doing the type of work I'm doing and this would give them an opportunity to sort of explain what they're doing and say yeah and like you know I'm in San Diego or

[02:09:31] I'm in Kansas City or I'm wherever so maybe let's put that on the list for our call later today when we talk with Andrew we can figure that out mmm and my personal experience too if I don't get emotional about it but thank you my dad was in ICU for like 30 days I think it's like 30 days at MGH Lazarus yeah like a phoenix rising from the ashes and he was in rough shape and I would I would report back to Peter and some other people and my family and so I think Peter probably appreciated more than my family that we're getting a bunch of numbers spit back and not you know you know how he was doing otherwise although I was reporting that too but you know I mean I learned a few things learned how much you know about this stuff obviously and at MGH they I think they like validate your parking after 30 days so they booted them into the respiratory you know rack you so you went down there for a little while but and one of the things

[02:10:28] I learned too as well is that I would I would bring back the stuff and in the the vitals and whatever and Peter would say this is you know this is sort of what I'm thinking and then at MGH I would be doing the rounds with a with the team over there and everything and being a fly in the wall and adding my two cents and some of the notes that I had taken and things like that they're like they were they're a damn good right there at the MGH and I also thought that that what a learning experience like I didn't go to medical school a little bit was that my advice would be like if you want to be immersed in medicine and just the real deal where people are dying and just fast forward you're learning holy those those people like the the ICU experience yeah my and and and we joked about it at the time which was you basically did an ICU mini fellowship because by the end of those 30 days we'd have our call every morning and you would you would you know we would review in systems cuz in an ICU review everything by systems you start with the neuro system you know the respiratory system cardiovascular system renal system baboom and you know it only took like a week for you to learn how to gather data and then you know how to report it and I'm convinced that if you had one year of sitting in there you would know you know eighty percent of what a critical care doc knows mmm-hmm I mean it's just reps you know it's just that kind of exposure no and you're right it is again it speaks to this point of feedback that we this theme keeps coming up today I like how it keeps coming up the reason I think critical care is so interesting and at the same time so teachable is the cycle time between intervention and feedback is so short you want to know what happens to the pH on the blood and the VCO 2 and the bicarb when you change the ventilator rate you're gonna find out in about 12 minutes do it yeah right you want to find out what happens when you tweak this amount of norepinephrine and this much of vasopressin and this much of this and the IV fluids and boom-boom look at the swan-ganz catheter like you're gonna see it in a minute and you don't get the very few things in life offer you the amount of feedback you get in a critical care unit mmm it's definitely a cool field of medicine and that I would yeah the few patients that you have I would say that what you do in a sense is critical care that the the level of care that they're providing at the MGH and the ICU and then I I see what you do in your practice is I see similarities that you're the your involvement with the patient well I mean it I mean I don't want my head to swell too much I want to be but I want to point something out which is it's really what the patients don't see is what's more impressive the patients generally just interact with me but what they don't see is you know

[02:13:08] Ralph and Nicole and Mary and Heather they're like they don't see the whole team bond they don't see the research team so and I was talking about this with Ralph this morning so so we saw a patient and you know spent 90 minutes with him and it was awesome and he had come in and looked at everything on his labs so we finished reviewing all of his labs and he goes oh by the way I noticed you checked my ESR level and it was really low I was like that is so funny like yeah I checked his ESR cuz his CRP was 6.6 last time and I just want to make sure he didn't have something stupid going on and as he SR came back low and his CRP returned and I was like so after he left I was like Ralph that how awesome was that like that patient had read every single one of the 87 numbers that we checked and was it was asked about the one that I forgot to bring up when we were talking and I was like I love that you know I wish every patient could be that obsessed with their numbers because those are the patients that get the most out of us that extract the most value from us

[02:14:07] I find the patients who are least probably engaged with us or the ones are also getting the least out of us and probably frankly don't appreciate the potential way I think that we have as a team to kind of to you know move the needle you're asking I think you're asking a lot of your patients like I do like that be your own advocate it's really that it's the patient that has the most control over their destiny in many ways yes you you have to put as much effort and emphasis into this as you would any other thing that you care deeply about so if you want if you want to take your golf seriously like you can't just think about it three you know thirty minutes to four times a year if you really really want to be a thoughtful investor like yes you will have professionals help you invest but you still have to interact with those advocates constantly okay a little over 90 seconds yeah did that how much over 90 was that Nick okay are we done I think we wish has been way too long right

[02:15:05] I think we've we've exhausted her a couple more questions video ten would the short oh my god I can't do any more tea one more question fun question okay let's see can make this one short so Bob and Peter you two are awesome and I'm learning so I'm learning a lot from the AMA so thanks tell us more about the latest and best on a bowi for oh because you can you can punt this off that's a pure punt baby tomorrow evening same bat-time different bat-channel because we're not gonna record it unfortunately I'm gonna sit right at this table and interview my really good friend Richard Isaacson DJ rush that's right now is he gonna spin anything is he bringing the techniques twelve hundreds no I've met him a few times and every time I met him he was he's he's fitting yeah he's been so so Richard
