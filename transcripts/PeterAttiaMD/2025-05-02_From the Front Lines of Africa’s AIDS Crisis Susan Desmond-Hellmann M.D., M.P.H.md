## AI Summary

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Susan Desmond-Hellmann discussing her experience working on the front lines of the AIDS crisis in Uganda during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The conversation provides a stark portrayal of the devastating impact of HIV/AIDS in Africa before the advent of antiretroviral therapy. Dr. Desmond-Hellmann shares her perspective as an oncologist treating Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) patients, both at UCSF and later in Uganda, where she witnessed unprecedented infection rates and mortality.

The discussion highlights the critical differences between HIV transmission patterns in the West versus Africa, particularly focusing on heterosexual transmission and the role of untreated STDs in facilitating HIV spread. The episode also touches on the personal toll of working in such challenging conditions and coping strategies employed by healthcare workers.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] Tell me about how you wound up in Uganda. After I got my uh masters in in uh public health, I became the oncologist at at uh UCSF in the university hospital um for the AIDS clinic. So all the patients, this is Moffett. This is Moffett. So San Francisco General had a very well-known program run by oncologists for AIDS patients who were in the safety net hospital. Um but in the university hospital if you were very sick and you had capsy saroma you saw me um and my husband because we had just gotten married um who was an we were interns together he was in the lab in ID doing uh immunology work. M so um the uh two of the chiefs of medicine at UCSF were approached by the Rockefeller Foundation who had started to become worried about heterosexual transmission of HIV.

[00:00:59] Remember I talked about the Haitians and the the hemophiliacs and homosexuals. One H wasn't heterosexual. And so there was a lot of disbelief about African HIV. And in fact, some people thought it must be um uh gay sex, but people are too embarrassed to admit it. Um there were other theories, but um people just did not understand what was going on in

[00:01:22] Africa. And so the Rockefellers said, "We'll give you a grant at UCSF. We'll uh grant you money to study heterosexual transmission of HIV." And this was through an epidemiologic contact tracing lens, not necessarily going into the lab and trying to figure this out. not going to the lab but really looking at epi and and particularly there was a hypothesis that if it was heterosexually transmitted there was something to do with sexually transmitted diseases um and that there was something about increasing your risk if you had untreated STDs sexually transmitted diseases give me a sense of what this meant so we're talking late 80s now we're this is 89 90 and 91 so where we're remind me is act out yet not yet okay just on the brink okay so we have thing and what is the approximate uh conversion? So for a patient who develops AIDS, what fraction of those will go on to develop KS? If you were in

[00:02:21] Uganda at the time, um gosh, especially amongst males, but also males and females. It's so hard to give those numbers, but I would say about a third of the one uh patients who who sought medical attention probably had chaos, some chaos. And what was the prevalence of HIV AIDS in the population in Uganda?

[00:02:44] Depend on the population you treated, um it was double digits in the country as a whole. Wow. If you were 16 years old, if you were a 16-year-old girl and you went to the STD clinic, you had a 50% chance of being HIV positive. 16. And most of those girls was their first and only sexual partner. So what that meant is it was Russian roulette to have sex in

[00:03:08] Uganda then. I mean worse than Russian roulette's one in six if you've only got one bullet in the chamber. This is you got the bullet in one of the two chambers. Yeah. Yeah. And the best business in town coffin maker. Like we would go, we would drive back to where we stayed and you would see if you've ever been in an African village like they'll prop up the coffins made of wood and you just see them because that was that was what was done. It was, you know, the feeling of being scared and sad in San Francisco in 1982. Multiply that by a thousand in 1989. It was terrifying. if we hadn't gotten ARVs, this was killing people. But you know, the same time, the first time we went back to um San Francisco from Uganda was 6 months after we had left, I went back to the CAPS saroma clinic that that I had um uh led and said to the nurse, "Oh, you know, you ask about your patients. I had so many great um guys who I cared for. All my patients were dead. all of them six months. So the the sense of how bad HIV was before anti-retrovirals, it's impossible to overstate it. Just impossible. Um and when we were in

[00:04:33] Uganda, there was it was really clear that you could see someone's immune status with a good physical exam if they had capacity saroma. I wrote a paper that I think is a is a good paper if you do global health and you have limited resources. It was a paper that had one observation. If you had capacity saroma on your soft pallet in on the roof of your mouth, you had HIV. 100% predictive. It it doesn't capsy saroma. There's a Mediterranean form and an African form. It happens on your skin. It can cause elephantiasis, but it doesn't go in and you know the mouth is just a a surrogate for your GI tract.

[00:05:16] Doesn't happen unless you're imunosuppressed with and to be clear these patients weren't necessarily dying from the KS directly. It was that's a that's a proxy for how weak their immune system was. I assume they were ultimately dying from a pneumonia. Many would die from pneumonia. there was was severe cexia and then they were prone to pneumonia and other problems. But capacity saroma in the lungs or the stomach can also cause um bleeding and you can die from that. And again what did you know at this point in time about

[00:05:51] HIV because the virus had been identified by this point. Um what was what was known and what was unknown? So we knew um we knew most of the clinical syndromes associated with HIV. This was with Gallo. Was it Gallow who um uh yeah Bob Gallow was one of the M was you know they had a fight over who who deserved the credit for that credit. Um but yeah, we knew about HIV then um and and we knew the biology and we knew as soon as we got to Uganda and examined patients that this was heterosexual transmission of HIV um and we knew that untreated uh

[00:06:31] STDs were a big reason um and that was a very important thing is the reason going back to these 16-year-old girls is the reason that the sexual heterosexual transmission was so high because the viral loads were through the roof proof because today if if if a person had if a male with HIV had unprotected sex with a female, it would not be that high, would it? It wouldn't be that high. No. So the the one of the really important aspects of

[00:07:03] STDs is the high frequency of herpes and shankroid really open lesions that are very very if not if not it's a one-two punch super high viral load and high viral load and transmissible. Yes. Yes. So we knew all of that. Now we also knew that some of these uh were treatable that um both uh medication also um Musevanany the the still leader of Uganda um had this very funny campaign called zero grazing.

[00:07:42] So they they do a raise a lot of cows and this is very important in uh Uganda is is having a herd of cows. It means you're a an important man. You know, Mousvio wears this hat like he's raising cows. So, zero grazing. The farmers and many people knew what that meant. One wife, one partner, you know, no grazing.

[00:08:01] And so, there was a pretty good uh public campaign. We did a lot of condom distribution. And so, the government was receptive to this. Yeah. They understood the science. They understood the epidemiology. And they were completely on board with the campaign. They were very on board there. They also knew that this was going to be a geopolitical problem for them if if people were dying in the prime of their lives at the rates they were. They they got that this this was really clear to them. Can you estimate in a year how many people died from AIDS in Uganda when you were there?

[00:08:34] Oh, no. I can't estimate it. I guess the point is it's a staggering number and it's and and yet there were so few of you that were on the front lines. If there's 16 million people, it wouldn't have surprised me if there were a million people who died. I mean, it's that kind of numbers. The um I'm probably exaggerating, but not by much.

[00:08:54] And and I think that the the sense of feeling overwhelmed um is just really important. Um what I realized I was doing um I don't know if you've interacted with people in the military u much, but you know, they if they were on the battlefield, they triage. Mhm. I triaged the the I triaged in San Francisco. Um if you didn't need chemotherapy but you had capsy saroma, I didn't see you like I only saw patients.

[00:09:24] Um uh the simple one was vin christristine. Vin christristine is actually re reasonably good against uh KS. Um I used it in Uganda a lot. It does cause some neuropathy but um if you if you're careful about how much and then bleomy again you have to be careful because of the pulmonary toxicity but old good oldfashioned vin christristine and bleo and then um texl tel was approved uh for capsy saroma um after I left Uganda it wasn't a drug um before then but yeah no I would I would see the patient and I would literally ask them and their family can you walk if you can walk if You're too healthy for me.

[00:10:05] You're too healthy. We'll delay. There was triage cuz I only had on the shelf a certain amount of of chemotherapy. How did you manage the personal toll of the the grief and the death of of seeing this? Because I I mean, look, I think every doctor to some extent goes through this um where you you you try to sort of compartmentalize what you're seeing. Um but the truth of the matter is virtually no doctor can really comprehend what you're describing there. and and how how did you process that? I have this philosophy which I I don't recommend it for others. It's just my philosophy. I love um people. I love interacting with people. I love getting to know the patients who I care for and it makes me happy to think I'm helping.

[00:10:54] Helping might be helping them get better. helping might be helping with their pain or they can talk about dying with me because it doesn't make me scared. Um so I get a lot of joy in trying to contribute. Um and even if I feel overwhelmed and if I step back and think how can how can we cope with this?

[00:11:15] Um my coping is more is leaning in. Yeah. Yeah. Just and and does does your husband share that? Do you do you I mean do was there a yin and a yang to the relationship where you supported each other in a way that that that was helpful in that because again I I I I do understand what you're saying and I appreciate that there is uh that there is an that there is a joy that comes from helping people. But I but I can I can also at least personally say that there are moments when it breaks down and you feel so overwhelmed by sadness.

[00:11:47] Yeah. No, I think the well, first of all, my my husband is more introverted. Um, and probably gets more sad. Um, but we are also a good team because we are there for each other. And I think it's it's a special thing. Um, done in small amounts, not too much to be able to come home and say, "Boy, that was tough.

[00:12:11] Here's what I dealt with today." or can you I need to tell this story or I want to talk about this. Um the other thing we did which is I think so important is because I I I do drive a lot of joy in trying to help. Um but I'm not a martyr. I don't believe in it. You know like okay you worked hard I worked harder.

[00:12:31] You suffered I suffered more. I hate that you know. So we went we went to Greece. We still laugh about going to Greece and eating our way through Greece for a week when we were in Uganda. And uh we had a couple of other good trips. We went on a a hilarious safari to a um a place that was Moya Lodge that had been closed to all tourists and was had just reopened. And uh it was so great.

[00:13:01] We saw hippos and elephants and we realized we were the only what you call in Uganda a mazongu which is a white person there. So it was it was a grand adventure. So we had some grand adventures and played tennis, enjoyed friends. So we we did um as much to keep our spirits up as one can. [Music]
