Tommy Wood is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Washington, where he studies brain injury and how lifestyle choices and environmental factors contribute to brain health, cognitive function, and chronic disease. In this episode, Tommy delves into the complexities of age-related cognitive decline and explores interventions to counteract it. Drawing from his experience working with Formula 1 drivers, he highlights the connection between cognitive function and the right type of demands and training leading to improvement. Next, he explores the various theories on the different types of pathology in dementia and neurodegeneration. He makes the case that a large fraction of dementia is preventable through lifestyle choices and nutrient status, and provides an in-depth overview of interventions and supplements that support cognitive function. Finally, he provides a comprehensive overview of head injuries, including concussions and traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), discussing symptoms, how to mitigate damage following an incident, and long-term management.

## Transcript

[00:00:01] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter attia

[00:00:09] hey Tommy good to see you again uh it's been gosh about six months since I last saw you at Coda which of course will become we'll talk something about why you and I would run into each other at Coda given our mutual interest in Formula One um but uh there might be some people listening to this who aren't familiar with you or your work though though it's certainly been referenced and you've been on a number of podcasts so um you know you're well why don't you give us a little bit of your background and we'll uh we'll we'll kind of go from there sure I I do have a a varied um experience and and background which I think is is useful for the bunch of things that I do but also sometimes slightly confusing because people will know me from one Arena but not know the work that I do elsewhere um so I'm an assistant professor of

[00:00:56] Pediatrics and Neuroscience at the University of Washington in Seattle um the majority of my work there is in basic animal pre-clinical research in brain injury we look at ways to treat the injured newborn and pediatric brain and we also do some work in traumatic brain injury um but sort of before I got to that point um I trained as uh as a medical doctor in the UK I worked as a doctor in central London for a couple of years before I did my PhD in physiology and

[00:01:29] Neuroscience um so though I'm not um sort of a registered medical doctor currently I don't have an active medical license um I do have I do have medical training and that sort of helps inform a lot of the work that I do um alongside that sort of formal training pathway I spent a lot of time working with athletes I was an athlete myself as a student I spent some time coaching athletes particularly rowers and that was my main my main sport um and then later on during my PhD and when I was doing my postdoctoral work I worked with a company that that worked with athletes trying to improve performance or their overall health and their longevity in sport that was probably the the main thing that that we really saw a lot of people wanting to to focus on um so I had this kind of track along the side where I've worked with athletes in various ways and then sort of through that got to working with Formula One drivers in particular through a company called pincer now you've had our good mutual friend Luke Bennett on the on the podcast before um so that's kind of where I do some some additional work is is uh in athletic performance and health um and in addition to that I also have some interest in long-term cognitive functions so we look at how the brain responds to injury we look at how to repair that or mitigate injury processes but what I'm really interested in is how do all these things kind of tie together so how do aspects around lifestyle and the environment affect how your brain functions throughout your entire lifespan um and so I work with some dementia charities in the UK related to that and

[00:03:08] I'm also founding uh director of the British Society of Lifestyle medicine so particularly interested in how you know we can use lifestyle to improve population health thanks Tommy that's that makes a ton of sense hopefully for people now to understand the the very nature of your your both your skill set and your interests so um let's just let's just start by diving into cognitive decline and is it and I defer to you tell me how you want to do this would you like to do this starting with the pathologic cognitive decline vis-a-vis Dementia or do you prefer to talk about it through the uh the sort of more ubiquitous age-related cognitive decline so we can start with age-related uh cognitive decline because that's pretty well described so if you look across large population sets you'll see that with increasing age you see a pretty linear decrease in standardized cognitive function and that's across all the different types of way that you can measure cognitive function aspects of executive function working memory um and except for one type of cognitive function which is historical memory and that's probably because of the way that those memories are encoded they're sort of moved from the main memory storing

[00:04:25] Machinery to and kind of spread throughout the cortex and they're sort of protected from some of the um changes that happen as we get older but in general you just see this steady decrease in cognitive function as people uh get older if you then translate that to what we might call some kind of pathological cognitive decline which would then lead into Frank dementia which is um sort of a long-term loss of significant uh cognitive capacity or you know cognitive dysfunction then you might see an accelerated trajectory so there's some period of what we call Mild cognitive impairment which you can diagnose with some standardized cognitive tests and then eventually that will continue into Frank dementia which there are many subtypes but the one that probably people are most familiar with and are most concerned about for themselves is

[00:05:21] Alzheimer's disease or Alzheimer's dementia and there are probably multiple things that drive both of those paths but in some individuals there's this accelerated decline that then ends up in and then having the diagnosis of dementia Tommy let's go back to the beginning of that and just make sure that we've given people a real sense of what cognition actually is you know one of the most common things I hear from my patients is some sort of complaint around memory uh so just yesterday I was talking to a patient and he was lamenting the fact that not lamenting the fact I mean he noted the fact that he had been recently remarried he was very happy about that but said you know one of the unintended consequences of getting remarried is he just inherited like a hundred new people in his life right because all of the folks who you know were his wife's side of the family and her friends and stuff are now kind of a part of his life and he said um I can't remember their names it's the the ability with which I can meet a person remember their name is decidedly different from when I was 20 years younger so he's in his late 50s contrasting this with being in his late 30s so obviously that's one component of cognition it by by the way is hands down the one I hear people most complain about I don't hear many people complain about decreased executive function decreased processing speed

[00:06:48] I I would suspect it's because maybe most people aren't pushing those to their limits and or we don't have as readily available tools to internally discern um decreases in that but but can you just expand more broadly on overall this both the depths of cognition and what it entails but also this phenomenon that

[00:07:09] I'm sure the moment someone hears what you do for a living they're probably right up to you at a party giving you the same complaints uh absolutely and the it's very difficult actually you know so you can um Define you know these domains of cognitive function you've essentially already defined them executive function which is um usually around complex decision making but you might for the average person it might be you know that time when you think about saying something but then you realize it's a bad idea to say it right that's executive function that's the your your prefrontal cortex is jumping in and saying you know that's a really bad idea you know even if it sort of flashes through your mind um but then you have you know various aspects of uh short-term and long-term memory um processing speed reaction time is probably um important as well um however when you talk to individuals about cognitive function they obviously they have their own um things that they want to be good at right so it's very personal from an individual yes we can put do it use a standardized battery of tests and that's what's done uh clinically um but there's usually some aspect of function that they notice is declining over time or that they want to be better at and then they can they can sort of put focused attention into improving that and I believe that you can improve that pretty much any stage of life so that's part of it and you mentioned memory and of course this is uh something that the people will mention the most or and will notice in themselves but there's actually two different parts to memory and it's it's different probably in in most people even in the setting of sort of standard age-related cognitive decline and in those who have you know some kind of pathological cognitive decline the first part of memory is encoding that memory in the first place right the information comes in and your brain you know signals through acetylcholine and other neurotransmitters to actually say this is something that we want to recognize and store and that's the process that seems to be particularly lost in those with pathological cognitive decline that's why things like consterase Inhibitors were um or you know and are still used in an

[00:09:28] Alzheimer's disease because that helps to bolster some of those encoding uh processes but through our style coding signaling and and this takes place predominantly in the hippocampus yes well that's where a lot of the process starts but over time you know you can get you get consolidation and these memories get may get moved around like particularly like we talked about historical memory they get shifted throughout the neocortex which is basically the rest of the the outside of the brain the the other aspect is retrieval like there's information in there and it's getting it out um and retrieval is you know retrieval speed is something that seems to slow down with age um but part of it you know often we think of this as as pathological part of it may be that over time you just accumulate more information and the more information that's in your hard drive the harder it is or the longer it takes to to bring out a certain piece of information yeah this is sort of the argument that Arthur Brooks used that as we're aging it's um your as you add memories you're you're creating volumes in a library and yeah the more volumes in the library the longer it takes the librarian to go and get the specific reference they're looking for um how how can we figure out the relative contribution of

[00:10:41] Library size versus librarian speed when it comes to you know accessing these memories because um I guess this is another maybe way to think about that but the example that it resonates for me personally is I either meet somebody and can't remember their name but five minutes later I can or I want to I have an idea I want to sort of say something about it and at the last minute I can't remember but then 10 minutes later I kind of remember so so it's not that it's not there but boy it took me a long time to get it so I think in reality it's probably very difficult to pass all of these out um and so I don't think we can pretend that we know exactly the relative contributions however some of this is certainly affected by other factors and that's something that you can take into discussion with say individual patients or individuals are concerned about their memory so it seems like sleep impairment or some kind of sleep deprivation or you know sub-optimal sleep impairs retrieval so you know then that could maybe open up a discussion about sleep um there's some subjective stress seems to also play a role here so I think some of it is accepting that your library uh is larger and some of it is thinking about other factors that may be impairing or or you know allowing for that process to be sub-optimal such that retrieval um is harder um and another part that comes into play here which is also important and it falls into that same line of thinking is that as your library gets bigger your librarian becomes more selective in terms of the things that they want to actually put on a bookshelf so imagine as you've met hundreds of people in your life thousands of people you add a hundred new people it's very easy to say do you know what the first time I meet this person

[00:12:50] I may never see them again so maybe it's not actually worth encoding that memory and you become more selective in what actually gets stored so that may be part of it as well and these are not necessarily pathological processes these may be your brain doing its normal job of well how do I figure out what's worth storing and then how do I retrieve what

[00:13:07] I've decided to store this may be a question that goes beyond your level of expertise so I apologize if I'm asking you something outside of the scope but um I guess what is a memory physically and why is there a finite amount of storage so if I if I I have an understanding of why a hard drive is finite and if I only have two terabyte terabytes on a hard drive and I keep adding you know video to that eventually at some point there is no more storage capacity I don't think I have enough of an understanding of what a memory is and why it would therefore have a physical constraint so there have been and I will uh absolutely agree with you this is this is beyond my area of specific expertise um but I know that this is a topic that is hotly debated where uh some people have said that comparing human memory to a hard drive is you know essentially it's a complete fallacy it's nothing it's nothing like that um and so there's you know you we we use it because it's something that we can understand it helps us you know sort of apply a very complex uh process to our own thinking and understanding of how our brains might work but in reality that is not how how memories work and there shouldn't be a limit on capacity in the same way that there is with a physical hard drive um however you might still understand that there are uh probably still a finite number of things that your brain will choose to um to encode and store for the for the same reasons that it may you know you only want to have the information that's that's probably maximally useful for your survival for one of a better way uh to to think about it and then you know that that puts some some constraints on on how the system sets up what it decides to to store and then retrieve my eight-year-old son last night was asking me these questions it's amazing when kids ask questions you can't understand you can't come up with an answer to it he was asking me where the memories were in his brain and how they get there and I'm like these are really good like when I was eight I wasn't thinking of great questions like this so um anyway I it's disappointing that I can't answer my child's questions um Okay so we've established that that as thing as time goes on presumably two things are working against an aging individual one of them not pathological one pathological so the non-pathological is you just have a greater reservoir of memories and your brain might be selectively choosing how to prioritize new encounters and new memories with some understanding that there's you know the denominator keeps growing and I have to be selective but there's also as you said where I think as you're implying there probably are some pathological changes and whether we use the term pathology or not is probably controversial but there are some age-related changes that are occurring that are also for lack of a better thinking in our analogy slowing down our librarian reducing our

[00:16:20] Librarians Vision uh you know some some way that makes it actually more complicated for us to do these things what do we think is at the root of that age-related decline that is specific to be it retrieval computational Cycles process has been executive function all of these things that we would all prize as important pieces pieces of cognition so the way that I think about it is that we know with aging we tend to see a decrease in size or atrophy of the frontal and then the temporal particularly the medial temporal parts of of the brain and the medial the the medial temporal lobe is where your hippocampus sits as well as some parts of the cortex around it that supports it like the hippocampal gyrus and the end and enter rhinel region and there are multiple schools of thought of why those areas of the brain may be particularly vulnerable um some maybe because of their of their specific function uh in memory or because they're deeply involved in the initiation and sort of the continuation and structure of sleep which is obviously very important for memory consolidation and also various processes of recovery and repair um but there's also um if you think about the whole number of things your brain is exposed to um those areas of the brain seem to be particularly susceptible to negative outside influences and then also susceptible to you know beneficial uh sort of supportive processes like actually putting greater Demand on those areas of the brain such that they respond and increase in their function so when I think about the various buckets of things that are required for a healthy brain for one of a better phrase they are around Supply vascular

[00:18:19] Supply supply of metabolic energetic substrate there are important things around structure and function so this could be a structure related to neuronal membranes so the importance of say a DHA omega-3 fatty acids and which are concentrated in synapses they're very important for communication between neurons um and then you know mitochondrial function as as an important part of that and then you might think of actually you know placing a demand on those uh on those structures so in most aspects of biology the the function of an of an organ is proportional to the the demands placed on it so you increase capacity um but then that also requires some period of recovery and that's where sleep and other things come come into play um plus you might want to avoid negative outside factors so if you think about dementia we know that there's some risk associated with things like smoking um potentially air pollution chronic inflammatory or infectious conditions like periodontal disease seem to be associated with it so you want to have um sort of this supply of substrate you want to have good function you want to make you allow that area to rest and recover you want to avoid things that that then may impact those processes and then sort of what I think is driving a lot of this is the amount that we actually you know ask those regions of the brain to do which does decline naturally over time um based on how we currently structure our our lifespan so of all the things you said there I think the one that we're kind of gonna click on first I guess would be this idea of uh demand and what we ask of the system so in in certain areas as you point out it's it's pretty intuitive right um You cannot maintain muscle mass without putting the muscles under significant demand that is so strenuous that you wouldn't be able to maintain it indefinitely right you wouldn't you know if I look at the workout I did this morning I wouldn't be able to do that to my muscles or to my heart indefinitely you can do it for a few hours but as you point out if it if nothing else through sleep but even more than that there are just days when you wouldn't push that hard um and so so in other words it you sort of think of exercise as a hermetic stress yeah um no I haven't thought about it this way but but there are certain organs for which I I would guess that that's not true right I mean does the liver need to be stressed like do the hepatocytes need to feel the insult of ethanol to otherwise perform well I I guess I haven't thought about it through the lens of kidneys and uh and and the liver and stuff what do we know about other organs and their need to do what say the heart does or skeletal muscle does so I've I've thought about the liver um in particular and I think you can you can say that the the the case holds particularly with with uh alcohol exposure as as uh as as the example that's what you said and that's what I think of as well not that um the liver doesn't function without alcohol exposure but if it wants to um optimally deal with a certain type of um a product say ethanol it wants to metabolize it then we know that with chronic alcohol exposure before we get to the point where the the you know we we damage the liver um you see an up regulation in size

[00:21:57] Chrome p450 2e1 you see an up regulation and aldehyde dehydrogenase you see an up regulation of a mitochondrial uh function and Metabolism to regenerate NAD which is sort of at the rate limiting step for alcohol detoxification so yes if you stress the liver with alcohol it will upregulate its function in order to have a greater capacity when the next um you know the the next drinking session occurs so I think there are sort of parallels across multiple organ systems yeah and just make sure listeners aren't hearing this and thinking oh he's telling us to drink more to drink more now I think what you're saying is uh and we would all agree that the health benefits of alcohol are none but you're saying before you get to destroying your liver with alcohol irreversibly vis-a-viscerosis if your goal is to be able to drink two drinks a day you have to drink daily like you you're gonna you're gonna have a better job tolerating two drinks if you occasionally have a drink as opposed to if you never have a drink I mean that's sort of what you're basically saying yeah that that's right and so if you want your your if you want an organ system to function in a specific way so you want your brain to function uh improve its function in a specific domain or you want your body to function you know your skeletal muscle or your cardiovascular system to function better in a specific domain you want to train for a marathon or you want to be a capacitive power lifter right you apply a relevant stressor that's like you said it's hermetic and you give time to recover and adapt to it and then you get an increased capacity later and so I think that that's very relevant for the brain uh but I might use um exercise as a way for people to better understand it because you can kind of see that happening but then to kind of draw that analogy out um you might say okay there are other other rules or other organ systems where there's evidence that that's that's the case as well so let's go back to the brain and talk about what might be a difference between kind of a positive versus a negative demand so um

[00:24:04] I'm sure most people listening to this podcast right now are under some cognitive demand where you know we're not just sitting here idly shooting the breeze we're talking about stuff that for for most of us requires some thought some concentration to pay attention to this so uh you know is listening to this podcast for for different people producing different levels of cognitive demand for example depending on their level of familiarity with the subject yes um absolutely and again I think that the idea of cognitive demand is relative to the individual as well as what they want their their brain to to function best at um however when we think about cognitive demand I think there's there's multiple different ways that you can come at it so when

[00:24:55] I think about generating skills um or maybe just brain development more broadly to start with you might think about how does uh a toddler interact with their environments such that they're developing motor skills language skills social skills and it's often this you know concerted effort for a short period of time where you are right at the limit of your current capacity being able to stand being able to walk being able to climb a tree being able to pronounce a certain word and then um you know you know maybe you could put a time frame on it maybe it's somewhere between you know 20 or 30 minutes something like that you know could you know adults may be able to do this for longer um right at the edge of your skill set and then you know probably there's some failure in there because the process of failure sort of up regulates our the processes of focus and attention as well up to a point before we get frustrated and then there's some rest and Recovery your toddler is going to sleep a bunch after they spent a lot of time exploring the environment trying to improve their their motor skills and I think that kind of provides an idea of the type of focused attention um that you put into something that then drives plastic reorganization which is what we care about we want to try and drive an increase in functional capacity in some domain of cognitive function and so it's probably going to be something that that looks like that um and there are benefits to continually doing things at the level of your current uh capacity right if you're an athlete you're not always pushing the boundaries you know you're not always doing a red line session that drives a bunch of adaptation so and I think that the brain is similar um but that's very different from how most adults perform in their day-to-day work where yes it's very it feels cognitively demanding but your multitasking task switching so you're never providing focused attention on a specific subject and you're also not really providing that sort of stimulus to increase skill in a specific area necessarily so even though some even though you feel busy even though something feels cognitive demanding I don't think that those stimuli are the same in terms of what's what's driving um you know a a functional change um in some some area of the brain yeah it's a very important point you raise and it of course always begs a question that I have when people tell me or when I feel this way myself that you know I just can't remember things I'm just not as facile cognitively and and I always just wonder where distraction and lack of focus fits into the mix so um are there any kind of heuristics for what is too much task switching what is too much distraction because as you said it's you feel very busy sometimes and I

[00:28:03] I actually went through a little about of this yesterday I was really trying to get a lot of things done and then one more thing got put on my plate and I had this window of 10 minutes where I accomplished literally nothing by by toggling back and forth between three different emails text WhatsApp and a document I was trying to work on and I just couldn't get anything done I mean that's to be that debilitated is pretty unusual for me but in that moment or those in that 10 minutes I I I accomplished exactly zero I would have been better off for 10 minutes literally just walking around the house or walking around the block um so so clearly there was sort of a threshold there but but do you have any way to think about what that looks like and where you've crossed a line into being you know busy and unproductive rather than busy and productive or focused and productive so I would probably make the argument that humans in general cannot multitask in the way that you describe it um and again we can sort of break this out there are probably two different types of multitasking um one is the performance the automatic performance of learned subroutines that kind of just happen and you could do multiple of them at the same time so say you're a dancer and you're running subroutines the steps you've learned interacting with a partner into you know listening to the music you know you are technically multitasking but those are all sort of learned subroutines that are essentially happening automatically or you know subconsciously what you're describing as multitasking is that process of focusing on one thing then another thing then another thing and we know that there's a loss function in terms of the you know the time it takes to get back onto a new task from from the previous task and it's something in the order of you know like people have said 20 something seconds right for you to to kind of refocus onto something so say you're you know switching your focus every minute or two the amount of time you actually have to to focus on one specific task is dramatically reduced because you know a significant proportion of that is just spent with your brain figuring out what it is you're asking it to do so in that setting um so say you're you're doing things that allow you to to enact learn subroutines in your work you could probably do that continuously and there's less of this sort of stressful demand uh on on your on your attention but if you're needing to directly focus on multiple things at the same time then switching from one to the other I would argue that the majority of people cannot do that well even though they may think that they can yeah one way that I think about this in terms of exercise is if I'm doing a a steady state you know aerobic efficiency we you know called a zone two workout on a stationary bike

[00:30:56] I can listen to a podcast in an audiobook and be completely focused on it I can still manage to be on a bike and pedal not often worry about traffic or anything like that and I can be focused but if I'm doing a higher intensity cardio workout or if I'm lifting weights I can't listen to podcasts and books the those tasks just demand a little bit more of my attention either to not get hurt or just to focus on the movement in other words they're not as you know presumably automatic as just holding 90

[00:31:27] RPM at a fixed wattage riding around uh so would you would you say that that's kind of an example of something that's you know really automatic versus something that's just a high enough order of processing where you can really only do that one thing yeah I think that's that's a good way to to think about it um and more broadly

[00:31:48] I think that you know traditional work based multitasking is probably the point where there's this biggest gap between perceived demand and the amount of beneficial cognitive stimulus you're actually getting um and it reminds me of something that a former colleague of mine at hintzer James Hewitt was some he also used to be a professional cyclist and he he calls this the cognitive middle gear and it's this this point where effort is high but uh sort of the end product is minimally useful um and if you can think about uh athletes who may go out and thrash themselves at threshold for like an hour and do that every day it's very hard right and then it feels really hard but in terms of physiological adaptations that improve performance there's a big gap between how hard it is and benefits exactly yeah it's it's not it's it's too hard to give them the wide aerobic base and not hard enough to give them that

[00:32:56] Peak Performance well well this is actually kind of a nice quick way to segue and I want to come back to this but just let's talk about formula one for a second so you know you and I have been fans of this sport for a very long time but I think a lot of people listening to this have become fans of F1 through Netflix's uh drive to survive series of course if you're listening to this and you don't know what drive to survive is I I recommend you go back and watch the last two seasons at least um but I think anybody who's watched the sport will appreciate how much they need to be able to do while driving and on a personal level this is something I can relate to because I spend a lot of time in a car and in a simulator and I am nowhere near being able to do what a driver does so for folks to get a sense of this first of all they're traveling at speeds that are simply unbelievable right their straight line speed is you know 200 to 200 and up to 220 miles an hour depending on the the setup they have for that race and the amount of things that they have control over on this computer that masks arrayed as a steering wheel in front of them is unbelievable right so between every corner they're making some adjustment they're switching the brake bias with one knob which shifts the emphasis or force between how much break is on the front wheels versus the rear they're altering the slip angle of the differential which is allowing inner

[00:34:26] Wheels versus outer Wheels when they're going around corners to move at different relative speeds they're obviously adjusting drag reduction system when appropriate they're adjusting access to battery power if they're passing or overtaking or trying to defend there's simply no shortage of things oh and by the way they're pushing a radio button to talk to their engineer who's talking to them the whole while so I will just say Tommy I have been driving for nine years I can't come close to managing all of these variables in the simulator even let alone I mean the most I can handle when I'm driving is driving and talking and maybe adjusting brake bias here and there but but I'm just so beyond my capacity to do any more so how do these guys do so much and I think more importantly for those of us who can't what do we need to do to get better at that capacity or is it just so sport specific and because these guys have been driving carts since they were five things that I have to think about while driving they don't is that is that simply what it comes down to

[00:35:35] I honestly think that's that's a lot of it um many of the things they're doing you know like we talked about this idea of multitasking being running several learned subroutines at the same time which the which the human brain is is very good at that's essentially what they're doing for a lot of those a lot of those functions um and if you've spent your entire life as a race as a racing driver which they have essentially they've been casting since they were young kids um these guys then you know when the compute setup changes uh or you know there are new things on the car based on new regulations right they're just stripping off a top layer and adding on a new one so like the what they have to learn is very minimal compared to everything else that that's that's probably happening automatically so yes

[00:36:22] I mean there's a huge cognitive demand and probably a lot of what you know they're actually using their their brain power for in the moment is you know you're reacting to others right you that's that's racist you can't learn that yeah exactly and so that's where most of their attention is and everything else is is probably is is happening automatically now when you have drivers that move up the ranks and there's a pretty big jump from F3 to F2 from a complexity of the car standpoint and again from F2 to F1 are there things that coaches will do with the drivers during those big transition years to really help them get up to speed um you know I'll give you an example I don't think this is an example of what

[00:37:05] I'm accomplishing but just people are probably very familiar with watching the drivers before races play sort of half physical half cognitive games right where they have like little lights on a board and they have to touch them or they're playing catch or juggling or doing all these sorts of things are those things doing anything to sharpen their brain or do they just look cool it probably a a bit of both but I would argue that um for some drivers it certainly seems to be beneficial and it's very different from from driver to driver um however uh there are definitely drivers who you know when they move up the ranks or even you know those who have been informing one for a long time they'll have a dummy steering wheel right so they can you know move through the patterns of of doing everything even if they're not on track and this is this is often the same as you know when we were learning subroutine so so say you're learning a new dance you'll do the steps one by one without music then you'll start then you'll start to string them together right then your ad complexity you'll and you know it's the same thing so there are multiple opportunities for them to practice some of these skills even though they don't get a huge amount of time actually racing on on the track um when you're thinking about the the sort of reaction um games that some drivers doing and and some of them may do it in terms of you know practicing starts um and again you know they'll have sort of a a dummy set up to do that or you know balls and reaction you know reacting to somebody throwing something um some of it is probably um some of it may be Placebo right it helps them feel like they're getting ready which is great and anything you can do to improve that you know you would welcome but then the other part of it may be moving you onto the appropriate part of the Yorkies Dodson arousing arousal curve right which basically says that there's this u-shape or inverted

[00:39:00] U-shaped curve of like how aroused you are and how you perform and that curve is different based on the sport um and so some period where you're having to focus and react but also remain relatively relaxed uh because that's that's incredibly important right you want to be fast off the start line but then the first thing you have to do is get into turn one when you have eight guys around you trying to navigate at the same thing and you have to you have to react to them so if you were very tense you know that that would decrease your performance in that setting so I think some of it is just getting you to the point where you're focused but then also relaxed you know if you're doing it with with a with a some kind of skill based thing that requires you to also um you know be relatively fluid so it could be like catching a ball suddenly right you can't do that if you're very stiff and tense so I think it's something you know some of it's this balance of getting into the right mindset before you then you have to have to do do something once you get into the car now most of us have you know we're never going to be professional drivers or athletes and certainly as we're aging those the need for really complex motor skills and cognitive skills may go down but what is the equivalent that you think about for a person as they reach middle life and they're thinking about transitioning you know or what lies ahead of them as they as they transition into into older age in other words what is that Apex set of skills that they need to be able to have to give them the the highest amount of physiologic

[00:40:29] Headroom possible to avoid or minimize this age related Decline and and more importantly potentially even avoid the pathologic stuff that we haven't talked about yet but we'll come to I think a lot of it again is probably quite individual right if you want to be able to perform a specific task right you want to be able to drive cars for as long as you're able right the next four or five decades so then you would you would want to push your skills as far as you can in that

[00:41:04] Arena while you're able and then you have like you said maybe we'll talk about more about this idea of Headroom you you cannot at least not yet we cannot completely stop the aging process but you may be able to slow the decline and or if you increase your the the level of capacity it will take longer to get to a point where you know function is lost such that you can no longer engage in that activity um the you know when you're thinking about the brain you know there's a whole bunch of things related to language skills um obviously memory is important um but how you interact with your environment and and I think social interaction is critically important than something that is probably um under discussed in relation to long-term cognitive function that's that's a critical aspect as well particularly as people spend less time um with others um uh sort of because of a societal effects but when you think broadly about how cognitive function declines with age it seems to mirror very closely the amount of demand that we put on our brains and again across like how Society is constructed because cognitive function essentially increases from birth to some peak in late teens or in your early twenties which is the period of formal education it is your job to learn right it's your job to develop skills that's when most sports are learned that's when languages are learned that's when skills are learned and then after that you essentially spent about a bunch of time doing the same thing over and over or you become hyper specialized in one specific skill and that's rewarded in a number of jobs right and so say you're a surgeon you want a lot of those processes to be automatic you don't want to have to think about all of them continuously right so it's beneficial it makes you better at your job um but there's much less room for that period of skill building or putting in you know effort into developing or providing those kinds of stimuli that then drive plastic reorganization in the brain that may increase Headroom so I think some of that natural decline with aging is a function of how we use our brains in general uh in society and then there's a a drop off when we retire and we can we can see that in in various different types of data sets where those who retire earlier seem to experience cognitive decline sooner and that's probably because the the cognitive demand that we do get in our daily lives the majority of that comes comes from work so the you know an important answer I think is you know if you're trying to maintain a basic set of cognitive functions is to actively work on ways to increase

[00:44:07] Headroom increase absolute capacity throughout the lifespan because I mean at some point capacity will decrease but you want to push that out as far as you can you know hopefully you'll die of something else before you know you lose you know the majority of your cognitive capacities yeah I mean again I think everybody's aware of the anecdote right where boy you know Sally was just sharp as attack and then she retired and all of a sudden it all went to hell in a handbasket but you know you hear this so many times that you realize there must be something to this it can't just be you know an observational phenomenon that's best explained by something else there may be other contributors to it maybe people who are retiring younger also have more health challenges maybe they're of lower Associates I mean you could come up with a lot of confounders that could explain this yeah but but I suspect that there is also a signal there there's some fire in the in the uh the presence of that smoke that says you know if you retire and in its place add nothing cognitively um you know you could expect to see a decline I also can't help but wonder how much of this has to do with sense of purpose which again I think maybe Falls outside of kind of you know we're now getting we're getting really warm and fuzzy outside of the scientific discussion but but you know it's a the question I always have is look retirement should be thought of maybe as a financial decision maybe retiring means I no longer need to work for money but I'm going to work on something else and if that something else is not as cognitively demanding right let's say you go from being an accountant where you know it's pretty cognitively demanding you have to be you know you're in a spreadsheet all day um and you say well look I'm 65 I'm done with that and I don't need to work anymore but now I'm going to go and do something in the you know I'm gonna do something philanthropic where I'm going to work for you know I'm really interested in homelessness as an example I'm going to go and do x y and z well you probably have more sense of purpose you might derive more satisfaction from that uh even though it's not as cognitively challenging do we have any sense of how that factors into it or is that just so far outside of our ability to to kind of understand risk the majority of of studies that have looked at this have I guess they fall into two camps which partially answer your question but don't necessarily answer it fully um the the first is looking at you know the removal of that stimulus through through retirement has been done in in several population-based studies they usually account for medical conditions that you know might cause you to retire early because that's an important that's an important confounder um and when you look at other studies there are you know there's evidence to suggests that late in life cognitive activity so whether you regularly play chess or you dance or you do something else that there's cognitive stimulating that's protective against um incident Dementia or cognitive decline um so the two parts of that would say that removal of work as a major cognitive stimulus increases risk but that adding some other kind of cognitive stimulus mitigates that risk um and there are several studies where you do some kind of cognitive training maybe it's a computer-based brain training in older adults in their you know 70s you can see significant improvements in cognitive function and if you think about all the things that are most protective in terms of of preventing cognitive decline there was a big met analysis done by uh jintai you who's a professor in Shanghai looking at all the different potentially modifiable factors for cognitive decline the two most important protective ones were early in life education which I think of as increasing Headroom so the more you learn and skills you develop early in life and the longer you do that for the greater Headroom you have and then late in life cognitive activity which then provides that protective Factor so

[00:48:24] I think there's enough evidence you know as much as we can right now and most of this is observational although there are some Interventional trials in older adults you can say that if you're no longer working if you replace it with cognitively stimulating activities you're probably mitigating you know all of that risk or at least most of it and we've discussed this a little bit in the podcast in the past that not all cognitive tasks are created equal so you know for example my reading of the literature was there was it wasn't any evidence that doing crossword puzzles is necessarily going to do anything for you other than make you better at doing crossword puzzles um but dancing now that's a bit different actually um because no two steps are ever exactly the same you're always sort of problem solving especially if it's sort of complicated dance um you know solving a business problem is more elaborate than doing Sudoku or whatever it's called where it's you know they're just sort of little predictable word games and so um would you agree that maybe what you replace it with there's also some variability in the complexity of that and the less color by numbers or paint by numbers it is the more likely it is to well let's use that example painting by numbers versus painting right they're both painting but in one case it's a much higher level of of cognitive load yeah and I think there were there were two streams of evidence that that are maybe that maybe support this so one is around uh cognitive activities performed on a computer so there are a number of different ways to do online brain training um there's a system called brain HQ which probably has the best um evidence to support it was actually developed by um one of the researchers who sort of did um a whole bunch of the sort of primary basic research in terms of how we learn in the first place back in the 90s um and they've they have some nice data that shows that if you do these complex uh training games which are often uh reacting to something uh or you know shifting Focus right they require you to be they're very interactive then you can see parallel improvements in things like uh verbal memory and executive functions so things that you actually care about in real life you're not just getting better at the game you're getting better at certain cognitive functions which is what you really care about and that program is called what brain HQ and that's something that people would do online that's like a game yeah yeah it's a subscription service I have no relationship with it but in terms of online Brain Training Systems it's been used in a bunch of clinical studies it's probably the the best evidence one in terms of creating sort of translational improvements in function and then related to that there are also studies using uh video games um where if you randomize people to play

[00:51:18] Solitaire versus Angry Birds versus uh Mario 3D um like the 3D um the 3D game results in better improvements in working memory and um there is some response inhibition which is a version of executive function so the more complex the more interactive something is the seems to be the the greater the improvements in cognitive function associated with it then related to that is work in physical activity so you mentioned dancing there are studies that have compared dancing to um uh circuit training that is as cardiovascularly challenging but obviously without that element of social interaction music movement steps you know reacting and you see better improvements in the dancing group and some people have termed this open skill versus closed skill um physical activity so closed skill is you know unidirectional doing the same thing again and again so like sitting on an exercise bike um inside you're not doing anything else at the same time except maybe listening to a podcast um versus uh say table tennis or badminton so the the physical nature of it the the cardiovascular stimulus is the same but you're not reacting to the environment um and and other people and when you do those open skill uh type of physical activities you seem to see some some greater improvements in in uh cognitive abilities so there's there are those various things that say that the more domains or the more complex the interaction you know associated with the activity the the greater the associated improvements

[00:53:01] Yeah the more variability there is right it's you know to be able to walk outside on an uneven surface where you know the slope is constantly changing and you kind of have to be able to visit physically and cognitively be aware of what's beneath your feet it's going to be a lot better for you than walking on a treadmill or even walking around a track in circles um so so let's talk a little bit now about the pathology side of this thing so again I think listeners to this podcast have have a decent understanding about Alzheimer's disease and

[00:53:30] Alzheimer's pathology we've certainly had a number of podcasts on the topic but but maybe let's just kind of refresh people's memories on the difference between Alzheimer's disease specifically and perhaps other kinds of Dementia such as vascular dementia chronotemporal dementia Lewy Body dementia for that matter and maybe even forms of dementia that don't necessarily fit neatly into these uh boxes like you said those those are probably the four main types of dementia although there are other ones that then are associated with maybe other neurogenitive conditions so uh the types of dementia associated with Parkinson's disease or ALS they can be sort of complex and and multi-domain and you might see changes in different areas of the brain what the main thing that ties together

[00:54:17] Alzheimer's disease and this is something that's worth digging into because I think both the the Genesis of the the eponym uh as well as how we now use it um is very interesting but the thing that kind of ties together forms of Alzheimer's disease and there are you know two as we think about them early onset uh Alzheimer's disease and late onset Alzheimer's disease but what really ties them together is the the neuropathology which is if you slice somebody's brain open um particularly again within the medial temporal lobe that's where the sort of like the primary you know atrophy and pathology seems successful that it can be throughout the brain is amyloid plaques and Tau Tangles hyperphosphorylated Tau within the neurons and this was how the disease was originally uh classified there was a an initial case uh August D who uh

[00:55:16] Alzheimer treated in um an asylum for several years and then looked at her brain after she died and he saw these things under a microscope then collected other cases where they saw similar things and this was done right at the beginning of uh biological Psychiatry where you know trying to find uh biology that that explained uh psychiatric symptoms and one of the things you could do at the beginning of the 20th century was look at things under a microscope you know after that person had died and that's that's that's how they classified it however um you know what whenever you want to we can get into how actually these pathological

[00:55:59] Hallmarks correlate very poorly with somebody's symptom burden and disease progression and the reasons why they they accumulate may be very different from person to person and may matter much less from one person to the next however is these pathological Hallmarks that created the classification of what we call Alzheimer's disease yeah so um you know it's funny I wrote about this story in in my chapter on on Alzheimer's disease and and pointed out that I many years later uh you know they exhumed I guess part of uh part of her brain and um lo and behold she actually didn't have the sort of typical Alzheimer's disease that we see today which isn't what the disease that 99 of people with

[00:56:46] Alzheimer's disease get a very small subset she was in that subset get a variant of the disease that is genetically predetermined and I can't remember which one she had I think she had pscn1 or did she have app I don't know it was it was passing one but that's actually quite hotly disputed uh interesting yeah so uh there was a paper in Lancet uh neurology 2013 where they they sequenced her brain and they they supposedly found this mutation but then another group got another sample of her brain and couldn't find any mutations um associated with familial or early on to Alzheimer's disease so um there's actually and then though um if she did have uh early onset you know a monogenic or some also abdominal mutation um it didn't seem you know some people have looked into her family history afterwards and her children didn't seem to get it so even if she had a spontaneous mutation it didn't seem to be passed on so there are a lot of people who think that actually there's no evidence that she had a mutation well that may be the first correction I need to make in the second edition of my book because I noted that that she in fact did have it at pscn1 and as a result it may be a different disease entirely right it may be that pscn1 mutation psen2 app mutations which are all these essentially essentially autosomal dominant deterministic mutations that result in people getting this disease and getting it very early I mean this is not uncommon for someone to be stricken in their night in their 40s and certainly be dead before they're 60. um what is the alternative explanation if in fact she did not have any of those mutations um what is the best case explanation for her disease it's severity and the histologic findings [Music] so by some telling of of the story um as after examining her brain outside was encouraged supposedly by his mentor

[00:58:51] Emerald craplin to gather together cases to sort of build this idea of this this sort of common pathologic process and again it's sort of you know your recounting history so it depends on on who's telling it but some people say that actually Alzheimer was quite reluctant to try and group these people together because they were so different and I know you've uh sort of mentioned that that famous line which is that once you've seen one case of Alzheimer's you've seen one case of Alzheimer's right this they're also very different and apparently this is something that

[00:59:23] Alzheimer felt as well he wasn't sure that they should be grouped together in the version of the story where she doesn't have an orthodontal also abdominal mutation in psm1 um it's that she did have some kind of um decrease in a cognitive faculties um and that which led her you know which you know there are a whole bunch of environmental other factors that could could play into that we could certainly talk about that but it led her husband to then put her into an asylum and we know that one of uh you know the fastest ways to to trigger cognitive impairment or cognitive decline is to basically remove somebody from their environment and completely remove all stimulus social social interaction and all the things that ground them in you know who they are so that version of the story says that because of the Asylum that she was put in and the way that she was sort of completely disconnected from her normal environment um that then triggered an acceleration uh in her in her cognitive decline which then you know maybe a sort of a sort of like a maximized version of of what we might see in in individuals uh nowadays who experience uh cognitive impairment and then dementia do we know her APO E4 status when they were looking for pscn1 did they check apoe that's a good question but I don't I don't know if they check that or if anybody said that or if they have I I haven't seen it so so let's sort of talk about the current state of affairs with

[01:00:54] Alzheimer's disease and let's go back to a point you made earlier do you know what the discordance is between the presence of amyloid beta on a histologic sample obviously taken postmortem and the presence of and or even severity of dementia related symptoms in that person while they were alive and the contrapositive of that which is to say the severity of symptoms in a person while they were alive and the absence of amyloid beta on a pathologic specimen after they've died what what is the because in an ideal world it would be a one-to-one mapping that is a hundred percent concordant anyone who has symptoms will have amyloid beta on autopsy and nobody who doesn't have symptoms will and anybody who doesn't have symptoms never has it and nobody who doesn't have symptoms will have amyloid right it's a it's a perfect one-to-one mapping well it's clearly not that so how messy is it you it would be nice if we could you know put an uh an r squared or an R value um uh on this to see how tightly correlated they are um I think you know I have to reach deep into the the depths of my memory and if people have tried to do that kind of um correlation it's you know the r is somewhere around 0.1 or something um so you know which just means for people it's virtually uncorrelated yeah there's a couple of percentage points maybe in the variability and cognitive function that's explained by uh the variability in or the amount of amyloid that you have and that's very clearly described in animal models as well as in humans and we also you know there are several studies where they've made some very good drugs that can you know decrease plaque burden in the brain but that doesn't seem to then correlate with later cognitive cognitive functions and may have a high risk of of side effects although that's a whole other story that we won't don't need to get into today um so pretty much anybody who dies with Dementia or experiences dementia will have some burden of amyloid plaque and and

[01:03:05] Tau Tangles I don't think I know of a case where somebody had that without any um and but we also know these things naturally accumulate uh over time and you can have people you know there are multiple cases where they've looked to the Pathology where you have significant um a burden of these neuropathological

[01:03:26] Hallmarks with no decrease in cognitive function and so I think there's or or beyond what might be expected given that person's age and so I think that opens you know there's a possibility that the sun you know the sum are the factor people are now thinking about other things that may come into play here so um microglial function phenotype and so microglia are the main immune cells of the brain these are now be being increasingly interrogated in in

[01:03:54] Alzheimer's disease dementia you know other processes might be important so lysosomal function um is potentially uh important as well which is basically processes proteins uh for breakdown and you know that gets impaired and that may trigger some of the accumulation of some of these things but the alternative is to maybe think that some of some of these Hallmarks may be epiphonominal right they just accumulate um in the face of neuronal stresses and

[01:04:23] I'm I'm speaking about this largely or pretty much only in in the case of late onset Alzheimer's disease your brain is going to get exposed to a bunch of things um be that decreasing metabolic function be that smoking vascular disease and then as neurons get stressed they start to secrete some of these proteins or accumulate some of them and there are some lines of evidence that suggest that some of it's actually a beneficial response so amyloid beta has some antimicrobial and metal collating effects so it may be this actually a response to a stress that's then supposed to be protective you get to a point and they've shown this very clearly in animal models where if you can force amyloid plaques to accumulate in large numbers where they do start to become damaging in their own right but up to that point um it may be more of an Epi phenomenon or a you know a response to a neuronal stress rather than this core sort of underlying um pathological process yeah there's so much there to think about right so so on the one hand you could say well look is is amyloid beta necessary but not sufficient for amyloid plaque so the classic example that would be APO B right APO B is necessary but not sufficient for atherosclerosis uh you have to have it but by itself it's not enough you also have to have inflammation and endothelial damage or dysfunction for the apob particle to get in there and cause damage but apob is causally related and that's why reducing APO B reduces events it's necessary but not sufficient if that were true of amyloid it could explain part of the observation that lots of people have amyloid without symptoms because it's only necessary but by itself it's not sufficient but that wouldn't necessarily imply causality because it would to have causality you would have to say removing amyloid because it is necessary though not sufficient removes the disease and as of yet to your point we don't really have evidence of amyloid reducing strategies working now the the flip side to that which I know people will argue is it might be because those and I don't know where I stand on this I'm very confused by this it might be that well we're applying those therapies too late and if you applied amyloid reducing therapies earlier if we knew how to

[01:06:51] Target people long before they were at the doorstop of MCI maybe we could do something about it in this sense it's sort of like saying well you know lowering APO B a week or a month or even a year before someone has an MI probably isn't going to help um but doing so 10 years before will so how do you think about the causality and the the the the necessary but not sufficient argument and also this temporal argument of if if in fact APO B is playing a role we may be way outside of our window to do anything about it

[01:07:29] I'm open to that idea still though I am skeptical based on the range of animal and human human evidence so far um it's possible that um amlobita is necessary uh but that but but if it is necessary we don't have evidence that it is sufficient to cause um dementing processes there's been some some recent uh work in this area that that sort of I feel you know supports the idea that that maybe it may not even be necessary or sufficient um which is uh there was a recent uh this uh process called panthos pathological anthos which is pathological flower this was uh published by Ralph Nixon's group out of

[01:08:18] NYU last year and what they showed was that you know in a specific knockout model in mice um this you know when we traditionally think about amyloid plaque accumulating we think about it accumulating outside the neuron and it's sort of like this whole bunch of protein that's kind of just sticking together and eventually that is injuring the neurons around us being secreted it's accumulating you know aggregating and then it's it it's causing damage that way well they show with some some really nice techniques is that what's actually happening um at least in this model is that amyloid is accumulating inside the neuron it is um aggregation uh inside failing lysosomes which is supposed to process proteins and they aggregate within the neuron which then Rises right the the cell dies it disappears and you leave a plaque in its place it's sort of like burst the neuron open and so in that setting there's a nice quote by by Nixon that says that um if you're trying to remove amyloid it's the same thing you know to try and treat Alzheimer's diseases the same thing as trying to uh revive somebody uh from the dead by removing their

[01:09:34] Tombstone um that's that's essentially what it is the the plaque is the tombstone of a previous neuron that failed uh its ability to process protein and then left this in its place there's still a lot of work to be done to say is this was actually happening in humans which you know haven't been sort of genetically manipulated as we do with a lot of you know Mouse models um but that's a very Stark concept right that's a very strong concept because it implies that amyloid is an absolute marker for something horrible just as walking through a town and seeing lots of tombstones tells you if they occurred over a short enough period of time something bad happened in this town but removing the Tombstones does nothing to erase what just happened in that town um exactly what is the what is the critical response to their model so the people that would be on the uh amyloid is at a minimum necessary maybe even sufficient how would they be critical of of Nixon's work so I think you could you could say that um even even if that's the case even if this is not if this is intracellular accumulation all you've done is you've moved the site of initial accumulation uh if it does hold in humans and that maybe that that would be the first major criticism is show that this happens in humans and I think that they're they're working on some pathological samples to to see whether this is the case um you could say well okay first show this is how it works in humans and then you could say well even even if that's the case all you've done is you've moved the amyloid from outside the cell to inside the cell where it first accumulates that doesn't then stop it you know causing damage being a primary causative Factor because you know once that either the first and you're on itself and then the structures around it could still be could still be uh damaged um or you know because then you might get a microglial activation right you get this immune response right that that can then trigger some of the nursery processes so so I think there's still a possibility that even if that's the K even if that is the process as it happens you know you could still say oh well everything else is still the same so let's talk about some of the other ideas Tommy and and we can talk about some of them broadly but I'd like to also hear sort of if you were if you were uh you know Alzheimer's Czar for a day and it was your your job to allocate allocate funding for both um prevention and treatment right so to if you were going to allocate those types of dollars presumably you'd want to have a strong sense of where to put those resources but but what are some of the other theories right sort of vascular metabolic you know obviously there's a genetic component so just tell me where you think it sort of shakes down and then and then we can go from there as to what the implication is from where maybe we ought to be spending our resources it's important you know we've gotten this part you know this far I've talked a lot about uh Alzheimer's disease it's important for me to mention that um a lot of the the work and thought

[01:12:44] I've done in this arena is is not on my own you know I primarily have worked a lot with Dr Josh turkner who is a neurologist which I am not um and obviously has a lot of sort of front-facing experience in this and so a lot of these ideas as they come together you know we we wrote a paper about the demand model that's where you know some of this discussion comes from but it's very much a collaboration with with him and others so I won't pretend that I suddenly figured anything out by myself because I certainly didn't um nor can I say that I figured it out or else I'd uh be getting an invite from the king of Sweden uh some time to go and let's go and meet him um but when we look at late ulcer Alzheimer's disease

[01:13:25] I think we've gotten to the point where there's such a broad number of environmental and lifestyle-based risk factors that seem to be critically important um that's really where I would focus my efforts and you can definitely say that even if the the brain is responding to neurological stresses or you know the absence of expected inputs with the accumulation of certain pathological

[01:13:56] Hallmarks there's still some Upstream process that's driving that and that's where I would want to focus and you know I I think our our best evidence so far is in factors around diet lifestyle and and you know peripheral peripheral Health you know cardiovascular health being a critical being an important one there was a Atlantic commission report in 2020 that looked at dementia broadly and tried to estimate what amount of dementia What proportion of dementia would be preventable and they estimated that 40 of dementia is preventable based on you know population attributable risk and a bunch of different risk factors um you know looking at physical activity body composition diet quality smoking hearing loss which I I think of as a cognitive demand which is lost educational status and my guess is that this is actually an underestimate um because they didn't include sleep they didn't include nutrient status particularly homocysteine status which other individuals have suggested has a population attributable risk of around 20 uh for late onset Alzheimer's disease and then they also you know when you do these kind of Assessments right yeah and you've written about this recently when you do a population attributable risk or population attributable attributable fraction you say if we remove this entirely What proportion of that disease would disappear and we have a mounting um sort of poverty of evidence that says that these risk factors interact so when you do a population of tributable risk you say this is a linear effect it's additive right this on top of this on top of this but in reality we know that yeah very creative they're actually interactive yeah so I think if you took into account other risk factors and more complex interactions between them my guess is that the majority uh is probably preventable uh by focusing on some of those lifestyle environmental factors can you say more about the homocysteine one uh we definitely manage homocysteine very aggressively so we're very liberal with our use of methylated B vitamins to keep homocysteine down we typically

[01:16:09] Target eight or nine as the upper limit we want to see even though the lab reference range says up to 13 or 14 is normal uh do you have thoughts on that and and I guess also tell me about the um the mechanisms Our concern is mostly through cardiovascular by the way uh because I think there we have pretty good evidence that homocysteine uh impairs the clearance of two molecules sdma and adma that impair nitric oxide synthase which obviously has an important role in the cardiovascular endothelial World perhaps it does in the brain as well I'm just unaware yeah so a lot of a lot of the work uh in this Arena I think we have to be indebted to somebody uh called uh David

[01:16:55] Smith Professor David Smith he's a former uh chair and head of the Department of pharmacology at the University of Oxford uh who's done a huge amount of work on home assisting and cognitive decline um and actually this this dementia charity in the UK that I'm on The Advisory Board of he is the chair of their scientific Advisory Board um he has done a number of

[01:17:15] Interventional studies looking at this uh the main one is the vitacog study um where they uh randomized individuals with elevated homocysteine to a B vitamin supplement it was a B12 and folate folic acid um and then looked at rate of cognitive decline and rate of brain atrophy and they showed that if you could reduce homocysteine and the the greatest risk is is with those with the home system above 13 there's also an elevated risk in those with a home system above 11. so the cutoff that I use for cognitive decline that's based on you know hard evidence in the clinical literature is 11. um and you can you can slow cognitive decline and brain atrophy um if you decrease home system uh beyond that point um there's a number of potential reasons for this uh the first is you know there may be a direct mechanistic effect related to the neuropathological

[01:18:15] Hallmarks so homocysteine seems to activate cdk5 which phosphorylates Tau and then also inhibits phosphatase 2A which dephosphorylates Tau so it may contribute to the accumulation of of Tau Tangles hypophosphorylated Tau in neurons um but then sort of more broadly and where I think you know the majority of the action is and sort of excluding cardiovascular is the importance of the methylation cycle in creating functional neuronal membranes and the reason why I think uh this is because of evidence of how home assisting level or B vitamin supplementation interacts with omega-3 status um uh we know that if you want to try and put a particularly a molecule of DHA into a lipid membrane you need to attach it for you to create a phospholipid and that process of creating phosphatidylcholine say which then attaches to your your DHA so it can sit in your membrane it's it's very methyl intensive right so it requires there are several methylation steps that require that to happen when you look at um there are actually sub-analyzes of several randomized clinical trials that show so in the vitacog study what they showed was that the the rate of brain atrophy was uh only slowed in those who had in the highest tertile of Omega-3 status there was a study in the Netherlands the bee proof study uh where they they also showed that um the benefit was greatest in those who had the highest levels of DHA and then there's also the Omega ad study where they supplemented with EPA and DHA but then they saw benefit in those who had the lowest levels of homocysteine so there seems to be an interaction between

[01:20:09] Beaverton status and omega-3 status in terms of cognitive decline and brain atrophy and the best way to think about that is is probably both are required in order for DHA to be inserted in a functional way into a neuronal membrane um let's pause there for one second Tommy because I just yeah I want to make sure people understand what what it is you're you're saying here which is if you lower your homocysteine from 13 or 14 to 9 or 10. all the while maybe taking some DHA and we haven't talked about doses but what are we thinking one to two grams of DHA one's two grams a day yeah doing those two things together which don't require any medical care I mean anybody I've never seen a person who with you know the right amount of methylfolate methyl B12 Sometimes some

[01:21:05] B6 is needed you can pretty much always get your homocysteine into that zone coupled with you know a high quality DHEA no affiliation with any of these companies but I like Carlson's and Nordic Naturals as the two um what would you say is the risk reduction would you would you say that that's a 20 risk reduction in all cause dementia just doing something like that that's what others have suggested they've calculated population attributable risks and they've I and it's actually it's more than that because yeah that was just the home assistant another 20 has been attributed to poor omega-3 omega-3 status so this is kind of frustrating because I I know that there are literally hundreds of thousands of people listening to us speak right now whose homocysteine is elevated whose

[01:21:59] DHEA DHA is low uh DHEA is low and um they are unaware and their doctors are unaware of everything you just said and there's no drug including a thirty thousand dollar a month drug that is going to come close to that level of prevention so why do you think there is such a disconnect in in in how we think about prevention and we haven't even talked about the obvious stuff like I'm just going to leave the obvious stuff aside you should sleep sleep is important exercise is important not having type 2 diabetes is important controlling blood pressure is important not smoking is important we're going to take those off the table they're enormously important but they're so obvious we're not going to talk about them but the homocysteine thing is not that obvious and yet you know a 20 risk reduction when you're starting with an absolute risk that's as high as a d is I mean that's like having a winning a winning lottery ticket in your pocket and just not knowing it

[01:23:04] I can't explain why this is not better understood like when I've talked to your Physicians about this or I've you know I've had old age psychiatrists who are like I'm immediately going to start measuring homocysteine and supplementing B vitamins you know plus or minus Omega-3s um and I know so I know David Smith uh a little particularly through my work um sort of through this charity and I think he's gotten to the point where he's incredibly frustrated I don't want to speak for him but basically this pretty significant body of randomized clinical trials showing these improved outcomes has has not been incorporated into prevention guidelines it's not been incorporated into things like the Lancet commission report which looked at population attributable risk um but based on you know the information we have and this is cheap easy to do you know it's easy to measure home assistant it's easy to measure in omega-3 index um if you need to or you know assess the the DHA intake in your diet um I think there's you know I I can't save a certain but I think there's massive potential benefit you know even if it's not 40 um with with the combination right huge potential benefit here again you know with with high quality evidence to support it do you think there's uh I mean do you think there's just a bias in the medical community against non-pharmacologic interventions and I mean look there are a few people that are going to stand here and be more critical of the supplement industry than

[01:24:36] I am I really think it is a filthy industry especially in the United States uh I think it's it's disgusting everywhere but in this country it's especially disgusting and the total lack of Regulation um the complete predatory nature of it and the total lack of quality control means that on average it's filthy however that doesn't mean every supplement is you know a bad idea and and they're you know I probably take a dozen supplements a day or you know at least nine or ten if I were to really sit there and tally them up including obviously methylfolate methyl B12 uh B6 EPA and DHA so right off the bat there's five so probably take another five um but I can't help but think that there's a there's a systemic bias in the medical community against supplements and some of that I think is probably well founded um yeah because I know how frustrated if I'm just going to be completely honest I get when patients show up in the practice and they have a list of 40 supplements um and I you know I I and and I can tell just looking at them because I've done this exercise a thousand times that 37 of them are garbage yeah but three of them are worth it and

[01:25:54] I I don't know what the answer is I I don't I don't know what it takes to bridge that Gap but I guess this is just an example of where you might just have to bypass your doctor and sort of say look I need to know what my home assisting level is I need to know what my EPA DHA uh uh levels are and I can fix this on my on my own and uh by the way since I'm in the process of telling people what supplements I like especially given that I have no affiliation I'm very happy to do this so

[01:26:20] I prefer the gero supplement for methylfolate and methyl B12 I just find gero to be a very high quality supplement in general um I'm sure there are many others out there I I also like the pure encapsulations B6 um so so those are kind of the variants I'm using do you have any supplements that you've tested or found to be particularly trustworthy as far as manufacturers go yeah I uh for a lot of the supplements that I take I like um I like Thorn yeah just because I know they have a a high a very stringent regulatory process and there's multiple points in the process where they test uh for um for for impurities or contaminants um there's also they also have a subset uh so particularly so say if I'm working with a tested athlete that you know if you recommend a supplement it has to be NSF for sport certified or similar so you know there's no banned products in there and they they have a line like that um pure encapsulations I think is good momentous uh do some some good supplements um I think part of part of the problem here is that you know if you you have to be I mean it depends on the the medical system that you're working in right if you're in the

[01:27:39] UK you're in a nationalized healthcare system if you're over here in in the US obviously it could be several different types of system but you need to be able to prescribe it so that needs to be built into a system and so in the UK in the UK you need to have a physician prescribe those supplements to you no but if you're a doctor and you want your patient to take it right then it's very hard there's a there's a there's a big gray area where you then start recommending your patient go to the pharmacy to buy a supplement that's a I think part of it is this gray area whereas you're protected if it's you know in some respects if it's I see yeah

[01:28:17] I see there's this indication that you know the National Institutes of clinical Excellence nice have said this indication you can prescribe it or you know it's available right that there's kind of guidelines around it and so I think that's missing that's part of it but even other Physicians so and I work with a bunch of Physicians who are interested in lifestyle medicine um in lifestyle medicine and I don't want to Tar multiple people with the same everybody with the same brush but they're very against supplements they're like lifestyle medicine doesn't include supplements right we don't do that and anybody who does recommend supplements is sort of not allowed in the club um which is hugely problematic because again you have good good evidence to say that there's benefit there so so some of it may be regulatory or you know whatever the system and how you can get your patient these these things or or or whether you know either you'll get in trouble if you start getting home assisting tests on everybody which are you know they can be tricky to do right they have to processed quickly it's a slightly more expensive blood test compared to some other blood tests you know so and then there's also the you know there's some like you said I think there's some bias in there in terms of whether people think supplements are allowed or not gosh it's it's really it's really frustrating um yeah um all right let's move on from from the the topic that is that is that is disappointing to me which is one having a winning lottery ticket in your pocket and not playing it and two um being such a Puritan in one's view that you wouldn't think everything is on the table right I mean my view is look

[01:29:59] Alzheimer's disease and dementia in general very very complicated formidable opponent ideally have as many things as possible in your in your quiver you should have a jab you should have a right cross you should have a left hook you should have an uppercut you should have all of the above to somehow suggest we only want lifestyle or we only want supplements or we only want drugs

[01:30:24] I've never understood that rationale but you're right it permeates into cardiovascular medicine it permeates into cancer it permeates into into everything and it's just created a bunch of silos of people who each have probably some uh some some truth and some expertise uh but are better you know equally limited by their blind spots so um let's go back to the Pathology again just really quickly um what is sort of your unifying theory on these these things so whether it is the the homocysteine the uh limitation of omega-3 marine-based fatty acids we didn't even get into glucose hypomatabolism but it's something we've discussed a lot on the podcast I think people are very familiar with hypomatabolism whether we talk about low-grade ischemia and the vascular microvascular disease how do you think it's do you think it's all working its way through a final common pathway of neuronal damage which leaves the tombstone in its wake and that's the only thing that's basically common to them is that they leave the same tombstone yes that's that essentially summarizes my current thought process and the so again working uh with others I think you know including uh David Smith

[01:31:41] Josh turkin I mentioned earlier he did this big meta-analysis on um modifiable factors uh risk factors for cognitive decline and you know trying to build this like systems approach to cognitive decline or late onset Alzheimer's disease and so then my current thought process is that all of these things are necessary healthy vascular Supply you know some kind of metabolic substrate that is taken up um and and available to neurons of the brain you know that you have the the nutrients required to build uh quality uh structure that you have um the absence of things that may impair some uh repair process like you you mentioned a bunch of them uh which which are clear risk factors like smoking and then you know to kind of tie everything together you create you you require

[01:32:37] Demand on the system that drives you know creates a stimulus for adaptation those things are required in order to respond to that stimulus and then you have a period of recovery and adaptation that allows for you know concept consolidation and plasticity and any individual may have an issue in one or more of those areas but then what ties them together is the tombstone that they leave in their wake but you know the the exact way that looks the exact number of tombstones say or how those tombstones look or you know what else is going on is probably an expression of things like you know genetics and other factors which then explain some of that some of that variability but that's kind of yes it's maybe the the final common pathway but everything that's important is happening Upstream of that before we leave dementia I'd like to talk a little bit about one of the strongest associations I've ever seen with mitigating risk which is strength um so the you know this is often demonstrated with simple measurable things like grip strength but I don't think it's that the strength of your grip and the ability to open a jar is particularly important it's just that you know very high levels of grip strength very low levels of growth strength variability here is a great proxy for overall strength people with a very strong grip they're able to carry really heavy things and that requires strength all the way up and down their chain why do you think strength has such an important bearing on both the avoidance of dementia so from an incident standpoint and also survivability so just to give people some numbers when you compare the top 10 or so of people from a strength perspective to the bottom ten percent it's about a seventy seven zero percent reduction in both incidence and mortality associated with all-cause dementia again that's when you start to think of like things that we have some control over this Also

[01:34:41] Rises to the top of the list and I'm not suggesting that someone at the bottom can be at the top within a year but if you think about this over the course of your life this is all this is something we can all aspire to what do you think from a physiologic standpoint explains such a stark relationship so when you talk about or when my experience of talking about muscle mass and muscle strength with you know hard outcomes say Dementia or or cause mortality yeah you know usually the response is all right calm down bro um clearly you like to lift weights and you know therefore you think that that's the answer to everything and um you know people who are healthier are stronger and that like that's just the the confounding Factor but I think we have um good evidence that that's not the case uh the main one being that you can take individuals in their 70s you can put them on a very basic resistance training program and you can see improvements both in like white matter connectivity you can do an MRI scan or you can test them on various tests of cognitive function and you see improvements as a result um you know of of of this training program so then if you think if you want to think about potential reasons why uh the simplest is that some kind of Novel movement is a direct neuromuscular stimulus you are stimulating the brain to create new connections driving plasticity because you know your you know the recruiting of motor fibers that that motor skill is in itself a stimulus a cognitive stimulus but then uh we also know that the amount of muscle the muscle that you have and the amount that you move it um it's a it's an important glucose sync so if you think about uh blood sugar regulation and we know that pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes like you said are significant risk factors for uh cognitive decline and dementia so you know it may be you know your increase increasing glucose flux that helps regulate blood sugar uh we also you know if you're moving your muscles uh there's this sort of still exploding area looking at myokines um so things released by muscle tissue that may support uh brain function um igf-1 vergef bdnf brain derived neurotrophic factor that may support uh neuronal function abuse of survival factors to to keep neurons around um we know that exercise is also you know through a hormetic process anti-inflammatory so chronic inflammatory conditions we kind of mentioned earlier but you know can be associated with increased risk of dementia and you're decreasing systemic inflammation uh through the through physical activity um so that kind of group of things I think all of those are playing a role I don't know exactly which is most important if any um frankly I'm not sure I really care that much because I know that it's a very important intervention so um and and again it's documented that it can actually work and you can implement it pretty much at any stage so one of the reasons you know probably why one of the reasons why it is so beneficial is because it has these multiple plyotropic effects and they're probably you know added you know at least additive if not synergistic um as well as yes there will be a certain amount which says that the healthier you are the stronger you are so there's a little bit of that but then there's a whole bunch of things on top of that yeah when when I met with similar resistance uh no pun intended to to the idea of the importance of strength and muscle mass I usually respond with something which is look even if strength training and uh meaning have a high degree of strength and muscle mass and cardiorespiratory Fitness even if all of those things didn't add a single day to your life in fact even if they shortened your life by six months they would still more than be worth it in terms of the quality of your life especially in that final decade which is something that most people unfortunately don't want to pay attention to until they're in that marginal decade as I call it and you realize that at that point having poor movement being in pain having low strength limits your capacity for doing just about everything that that people would find pleasure in whether it be playing with their kids or simply going for a walk or you know carrying out any basic activity of daily living at the extreme level so um anyway I think I think it's it's a fitting way to end our discussion on this before we transition so the only thing I want to talk about Tommy is another area where you have a great amount of expertise and that is around head injury um about uh oh gosh 10 years ago I had a friend that suffered a very significant head injury uh riding a bike down the street and a jogger bolted out between some parked cars didn't notice him riding and they hit Head to Head you know the jogger got the worst of it because he was wearing a helmet but nevertheless they were both devastated by this he was going about 40 kilometers an hour um she sustained multiple fractures to her head but he sustained a concussion that was so bad that basically he wasn't himself for about two years he's more or less himself now um can you explain what a concussion is even even this uh like the idea of what concussion is is quite hotly debated um but in general you would classify a concussion as a mild traumatic uh brain injury with more severe traumatic brain injuries you might think of like complete open skull fractures and you know direct penetrating trauma to the brain things like that so this is you know the skull remains intact but there has been some transmission of force or um a a wave a blast wave say if it's a blast injury that's been transferred uh to the brain then at some level in order to have symptoms of a concussion you have some kind of disturbance of neuronal function and that can either be because of you know abrupt loss so there are some you know significant head impacts in particular where you can get shearing of axons um you know direct axonal injury of the neurons and then you that you know that cell is essentially is essentially lost as you've sort of ripped it apart but even more um you know milder impacts may cause uh disturbances that include like the the neuron firing when it shouldn't this can then sort of create this pattern of activation again that's not expected or in an area of the brain where it's you know it wouldn't normally occur in a way that it wouldn't normally occur and then this can then cause these down stream processes within cells that can cause mitochondrial damage swelling you know you then might see the accumulation of certain um pathological proteins so tau is is like just like you see in

[01:42:00] Alzheimer's dementia it's also a response to um and your own like direct neuronal injury in a concussion I I work with a neurosurgeon who's uh definition of concussion is any impact or Force to the brain that causes the disturbance of function of one neuron unfortunately that's not something that we can measure because you probably need multiple or you know large sections of the brain to to have aberrant function for you to be able to actually measure it or detect it um but you know those are the various processes that are going going on uh you know when you get a head impact so it could be as as quote unquote mild as just a headache for a few days um following a head trauma or it could be you know in the case of this friend of mine for a couple of years uh light was they had a lot of photosensitivity they had a lot of auditory sensitivity they had difficulty you know processing things they were much more irritable how common are those types of you know more severe symptoms than just a headache for a few days after a hit to the Head so in reality it's quite difficult to to say how common things are because millions of concussions happen every year in the in the us alone most of which probably go unreported um and so it's only when you see more significant symptoms or you know something's you know has happened in front of a so you're playing sport it's happened in front of a doctor you know you you get a formal assessment and you know the downstream effects are you know are varied you know can be around uh you know verbal effects photosensitivity um noise sensitivity uh affects the memory Focus um reaction time you know depending on on how you're measuring things and probably um some of it is exactly which area of the brain uh was was impacted and then there's there's a systemic response aspect as well so there are um you know it's you can only really do this in animal studies but part of the process of of um the sort of the disease process after traumatic brain injury is a systemic immune response that seems to sort of contribute uh to to some of the symptoms so you know how much of an inflammatory response you get how much of a fever do you get um that can then you know cause some issues throughout the brain um as well so what do we know about the short-term management of concussion and the long term and what is the relationship between a concussion and a traumatic brain injury which are terms that I think both both people are hearing and of course the term TBI in the past decade uh is is sort of more front and center for people uh I suspect in large part due to two things right probably uh a greater understanding of

[01:44:58] TBI occurring in the battlefield and also in at least one sport American football though obviously it occurs in more than that yeah so like I said the concussion is generally considered uh you know within the so so all of these are tbis traumatic brain injuries okay of you know their various severities a concussion is sometimes also known as a mild traumatic TBI a mild dramatic brain injury or mtbi and then and I and I think this is where probably most of our you know Focus today will be on because you know the more severe brain injuries so say if you do have skull fractures or penetrating head trauma or you have you know significant loss of consciousness that requires you know intensive care that requires Specialists Neurosurgical treatment that's that's probably beyond what most people here will be thinking about but if instead you're thinking about concussions on the sports field or blast related or sub concussive uh exposures which might happen again in sports or in the military um and there's increasing evidence that says that sub-concussive um impacts or blasts so an example would be sniper fire right you essentially have a mini explosion happening right next to your head um several times a day right if you're if you're in the range practicing and there's some evidence that suggests that even that over time the damage can accumulate and cause issues with cognitive function and there you call it sub-concussive because each individual one doesn't necessarily cause symptoms but depending on how you define the concussion you may or may not get um symptoms anyway so there's kind of a gray area there but you know each individual one would you wouldn't be able to detect it really um but the damage seems to accumulate over time if you have a significant um head impact so say on the sports field is probably again where people are most familiar with it there's probably two aspects that are worth separating so there's the there's the formal medical process and medical assessment that you should undergo and there'll people who made you know in uh multiple Sports now they may have some baseline cognitive testing so that when you do get a concussion they re-test you they make sure that you get closer to your previous Baseline before you're allowed to play again so things like the impact assessment is often used in um a sort of Youth and college sports um and so there's that part but then what I'm particularly interested in is how can we mitigate the effect of an impact initially like are there supplementation and other strategies that we can do to make the the athlete who's or somebody who's at high risk of concussions more resilient to that impact and are there other things that we can do to support recovery or minimize the effects of of the impact so with the with the short-term sort of post-concussion management there are um two or three things that I think are particularly important so the first is thermoregulation and which is basically managing normal body temperature my PhD was actually looking at the effects of temperature on response to brain injury and it's very clear that the hotter your brain gets after an injury the worse your outcome pretty much any type of brain injury stroke traumatic brain injury you know also these neonatal and pediatric brain injuries that I study and we know that a lot of sports happen in heat stressed environments so you're on the field you're hot already or you're out in the sun and if experimentally if you heat that brain up first which happens during exercise and then you have an impact and then that brain stays hot that can that seems to to worsen outcomes so getting somebody out of a heat stress environment cooling them down if you need if you need to and you can use external external ways to do that you can use things like Tylenol to help regulate body temperature and that particularly becomes important because this at some point a few hours later an inflammatory response is going to kick in and it's very common to get fever there's been a big um you know I mean it's Decades of work how long does that um does the does the um sort of power or potential of that intervention last so if a person has a concussion you know at two o'clock on a Sunday afternoon is should they be in an environment of taking Tylenol and cooling themselves off for the rest of the day or is that something that would you'd want to carry out for a couple of days and just continue Around the Clock

[01:49:53] Tylenol to keep to prophylactically ward off fever that's a great question and it's something that the field probably still struggles with um but a period of 24 to 72 hours after the initial injury is probably the most critical um the the most important thing is preventing fever and the reason why the reason why fever causes issues is because you create you increase the mismatch between metabolic rate and capacity to produce energy to match that metabolism so if you have mitochondrial dysfunction you're basically increasing that Gap in terms of required energy production which then exacerbates the injury any evidence for cooling Tommy so for example I mean obviously as you know from your work um when you're doing uh certain types of heart surgery you can actually cool the patient to 19 degrees Celsius at least back when I was training that was The Sweet Spot I don't know if what the temperature is today but if you were um basically doing anything where you had to cross clamp the aorta and prevent cerebral perfusion you would you know you would you would cool the patient literally have ice around their head the anesthesiologists would cool the patient and obviously that was very protective so is there any evidence that someone sustaining a concussion should go beyond just getting out of the Sun and taking

[01:51:18] Tylenol but perhaps be laying down and be you know bathed at least have their head covered in ice so the the short answer is no there's no evidence for that um and there's a long story to answer that question so in animal models and again this is something that I've I've published extensively on hypothermia is Magic for acute brain injuries right if you can decrease core temperature by three to four degrees

[01:51:45] Celsius for you know three you know 24 hours and 72 hours after the injury you get a significant reduction in in brain injury in one specific scenario and that's a cute um acute brain injury in babies that have some kind of issue around birth therapeutic hypothermia so cooling to 33.5 degrees Celsius cold temperature for three days is the standard of care it was brought into the resuscitation guidelines in 2010. they do that just externally they're not using ECMO or anything like this okay no uh so if uh the so some of those kids can go on accomo but that's because of respiratory failure and so you can call on pump but no this is a just an external cooling with it with a with a with a blanket in models of TBI it is similarly neuroprotective in animals um huge bodies of work say that if you if you create a traumatic brain injury in an animal model and then cool the animal down they get decreased injury dozens of Trials billions of dollars have been spent trying to replicate this in humans and it has not worked um and you know people thought the temperature wasn't right the duration wasn't right you know obviously in traumatic brain injury have a very heterogeneous population maybe the population wasn't right um but in reality there's no evidence that hypothermia works for concussions or any kind of traumatic brain injury but what what does seem to work is maintaining normothermia so basically a core temperature at or below 36.5 degrees Celsius ideally there are some people out there who will sell cool caps uh and things and and there are you know

[01:53:26] I think I once spoke on a podcast and said what I just said and somebody emailed me and was like here's my unblinded open study of my cool cap in some hockey players that shows that it improves recovery from concussion um there is no high quality evidence that these things work um so particularly because they're externally cooling the brain you're probably not going to get the brain cold enough to do it you know what you need to do is you would need to cool the blood going up into the brain so yeah um but in reality I don't think there's much evidence there so focusing on preventing fever or managing fever I think is very beneficial but then active cooling below that doesn't seem to add anything and and these studies they demonstrated they were actually cooling the neck they were demonstrating that they were achieving a significant reduction in brain temperature so not um so these external devices like cool in the neck in individuals with concussion that hasn't been shown to be beneficial when when they've trialled hypothermia um did they demonstrate did they actually demonstrate efficacy of cooling not that it reduced no concussion but did they show that they can cool the brain no so this is another issue is that um particularly with milder external forms of cooling how do you know the brain is actually being called and so yeah sometimes so in these studies you may see like particularly they're doing external cooling on the scalp they'll uh do uh they'll measure scalp temperature and say well the scalp is colder therefore the brain is colder that's not necessarily the case right so so no there isn't documented evidence that these things can directly significantly cool brain temperature yeah so so there's two problems right one is we don't know if we're even cooling the brain in these studies and of course therefore we don't know if cooling the brain would would minimize or mitigate this risk it could be the complexity of the human model and given our surface area relative to you know timely you know infants have a surface area amount that allows for easy external

[01:55:36] Cooling in fact that's one of the challenges of taking care of pediatric patients is they're very susceptible to insensible losses in the way that adults are not so you hear you're using it to your advantage so that's very interesting if it doesn't work in other words if we could be sure that those studies are indeed cooling the brain but it is not having an impact what is your explanation for the discordance between that and the Pediatric and animal literature so there are two potential things that that could conceivably remain as our answer questions so one is that the majority of cooling studies although this has been overcome in a lot of them but the majority of cooling studies are probably not cooling soon enough so there's actually a very narrow window um again based on animal studies that says in an acute brain injury you basically need to start cooling therapy within six hours but probably ideally within three hours of the injury now if you're running a clinical trial this person has to be found right it's the same as doing thrombolysis in stroke like trying to get it as soon as possible it's very difficult so if you could immediately call maybe maybe that's part of the issue the other issue um which uh is is potentially a little bit controversial but I think it's increasingly being appreciated in the neonatal literature is that when they did the original cooling trials the control group were kept at 37 degrees Celsius and had a lot of fever so it could be Oh you mean the controls were managed with Tylenol and thermoregulation to keep them at 37. no so so originally they would um in those original cooling trials in neonates they the control group was hot so if you look at a baby's normal temperature after they're born they don't immediately go to 30 37 degrees Celsius they may never get there you know they'll slowly warm up over a day or so but though in those trials the control group were immediately warmed up to 37 and they also frequently had fever and they weren't managing those fevers because they were because that was in the era where you were worried about the kids getting colds you may have made the controls worse off and artificially created a gap exactly so in more modern cooling trials they do targeted temperature Management in the control group so the control group is kept at 36.5 um uh degrees Celsius core temperature and then compared to that the cooling group doesn't seem to have a benefit so some of the effect in neonates may be due to a worsening of outcome in the control group rather than benefit in the intervention group very interesting um okay another topic I want to ask you about is a hyperbaric oxygen and presumably this will be in The Chronic phase not I mean maybe someone's looking at this in the acute phase But but so so address it as you see fit but clearly I see a lot of people talking about hyperbaric oxygen I get asked about this all the time from patients uh I'm quite ambivalent about this so I'm I generally think the hyperbaric oxygen industry is a racket um I think there are definitely indications for it there are clearly places like wound healing where I think it matters uh you know

[01:59:11] I I probably think the opportunity cost notwithstanding there might be it might be reasonable to consider hyperbaric oxygen for for brain injury but I haven't really found any compelling data so it's possible I just haven't been looking hard enough and and obviously you're closer to it so what what's your state of the understanding of the the role of that

[01:59:35] I think the the phase is critically important um firstly because in the acute phase of injury there is evidence that hyperbaric oxygen can be detrimental um there are I've I know of some studies where they've tried to get hypoxicillin in as early as possible after traumatic brain injury and they've had an increase in negative uh side effects I don't think those studies are published yet but I've certainly heard of that work um going on so presumably just creates more reaction more reactive oxygen species in a hyper-inflammatory environment exactly that's exactly it and again so if you have you have impaired function and then you try and shove a bunch of extra oxygen in there you're essentially just driving oxidative stress um and that I know I I know of some people who have actually you know there have been significant uh injuries in like professional sports and they've immediately got gotten that person in the chamber that is not something that I would recommend and I don't think there's evidence to support it longer term so in The Chronic phase

[02:00:36] I think there's a possibility of benefit and again you know there are some data out there to suggest that those after concussion or traumatic brain injury they may see um Improvement after exposure to multiple rounds of heartbaric oxygen however there are a couple of things that just you know should drive some aquapoi is currently one is that most of these trials are single arm uh you know uncontrolled studies and it's actually quite hard to create to create a control group in Hyperbaric Oxygen's um studies because you you can tell when the chamber is being pressurized and so to try and create a scenario where you have a sham effect that may create the same Placebo is quite tricky um the second is that um you know a lot of the you know I read a study where they're like you know these people they all improved you know we did six months of hyperbaric oxygen they got it twice a week and in my mind you're just invoking Voltaire um where they said where who said that medicine is the art of entertaining the patient while nature cures the disease right that brain was going to get better anyway having said that I think there there are some there are some you know sort of early data that suggest that you know improved uh cognitive function you know maybe you're restoring uh metabolic uh function within the brain mitochondrial function with um some periods of hypercoxane it probably takes several um uh several rounds so like maybe like a couple of months at least 30 plus exposures seems to be required and again this is sort of like anecdotal I've seen people's pilot data this is not large randomized control trials or anything like that uh but there I think there is potential benefit and you know part of it and by the way how long maybe long after you're saying anytime after 72 hours or you'd wait even longer potentially

[02:02:31] I'd probably wait a couple of weeks would be my guess until we're sort of like the full initial phase of the injury has has resolved um and and you're basically saying two 60-minute sessions weekly and and they're doing this to what depth or what's the whatever metric I think metric pressure I think generally they do to to two atmospheres I think I think is is generally two atmospheres an hour at a time twice a week and potentially something yeah well it's certainly long enough for

[02:03:02] Voltaire to to take over um it's very it's very difficult to know what about supplements such as creatine monohydrate and our good friends the omega-3 the Marine omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA do they play any role here in in supplementation if a person is not using them I.E adding them or is there any benefit for using uh higher doses than people might might use we typically you know talk about using five grams of creatine monohydrate daily talked about that in the past on the podcast lots of benefits associated with creatine monohydrate use both cognitively and physically and we talked about you know two two or three maybe even up to four grams of EPA DHA having um benefit uh what What's the what's the evidence for their efficacy here and and how do you think about dosing them so I think the doses are very similar but I do think uh there's a strong case for for benefit um there's you know no good study that gives every you know a bunch of people creatine before they get traumatic brain injuries that's one of the problems with tbis it's difficult to predict therefore it's hard to hard to do you know good quality prophylactic studies but in animal models you can see that if you supplement with creatine for several days um you know the optimal period maybe five to seven days uh with a with a loading type dose so the equivalent of you know 0.2 grams per kilo something like that which would you know the 20 grams per per 20 grams per day for a week the equivalent in in both rats and mice before a traumatic brain injury is significant in neuroprotective that kind of dose and time periods so something like 20 grams a day for a week has been shown to significantly increase brain creatine levels by doing something like magnetic resonance spectroscopy you can point an MRI scanner at the brain and you can see the levels of creatine in it at the same time there have been some studies in in high school football athletes that have looked at that same measure over a football season and seen that related to the number of impacts that the the kid gets there's a decrease in brain creatine in the dorslateral prefrontal cortex and the primary motor cortex so suggesting that creatine is being used up by impacts and you know it provides this sort of short-term pH and energy uh buffer that may be protective when when there's a when there's an impact and those kids are taking 20 grams a day throughout the season or five grams a day no these these are two separate lines of evidence so one is that's just looking at innate or endogenous yeah so they're not supplementing it's just looking at endogenous levels of creatine that decrease throughout the season that's related to impacts so we know that with standard dosing of creatine we can increase our brain creating levels and we also know that uh with impacts uh brain creatine seems to decrease and one of the um one of the thought processes behind something called second impact syndrome which is that you have a concussion you recover okay you seem to be doing okay that first can that first concussion or that first impact doesn't have a big effect but this the next one has a much bigger as an outsized effect yeah we saw it and one actual example of this in the

[02:06:23] NFL this year with the Dolphins quarterback right yeah yeah exactly and and one of the things that may be happening there some people think that at least part of that is you've depleted brain creatine with that first impact and then there's a greater effect of the second impact and there's probably maybe multiple things that happen because brain choline also seems the decrease in a similar in a similar manner then so I think there's there's a there's a case to be made for prophylactic creatine in those who are at high risk if you can you know estimate when you're going to be at highest risk I may do a loading period 20 grams for a week so you know you can increase brain creatine but then after impact you know there are several studies that and I think this is what you've talked about previously where creatine May improve some of the problems that happen after a concussion so we know that creatine can offset some of the um the cognitive deficits caused by sleep deprivation and sleep can be an issue with those with concussion um in multiple studies creatine supplementation improves cognitive function uh that seems the greatest effect seems to be in those who are oldest but if you have some deficit in cognitive function which may be related to creatine if it's through a concussion then a supplementation may be beneficial um and finally there's some evidence that it may help with mood creatine has been tested in two randomized controlled trials where they've added it on top of ssris and those who responded poorly or or incompletely to the ssris and sort improvements um in in depression symptoms so I think there's multiple reasons why if you're a high risk of a TBI or you've had a TBI it's worth thinking about creating supplementation and presumably if you have long enough time just being on five grams daily will get you will will get you what the 20 gram loading dose do so you because again to your point if you if you can't predict when you're going to have a TBI you can't always be taking 20 and waiting if you just took five every day you'd produce similar levels of uh of within the brain um and tell me about your thoughts on on

[02:08:26] EPA or DHA specifically around this for relates to concussion I think DHA um is probably the the more important one um and it's very similar actually to some of the processes that we thought about with cognitive decline you know around neuronal structure and normal neuronal function there was one nice study where they looked at supplementing with different levels of DHA again throughout a high school uh football season and what they saw they supplemented with either two four or six grams of DHA and actually all of those groups um and with no greater benefit with a higher dose um saw a decrease in player related circulating neurofilament light which is a a marker of neuronal injury that you can pick up um you know when you get you know when you get when you get when you get a concussion so across the season you're a filament like tended to increase in the athletes but that was mitigated in the

[02:09:23] DHA supplementation groups is that a biomarker you see in the blood or is that something you see on a can you tag for it on an MRI no it's a biomarker you see in the blood interesting um are there any other supplements that you think should be a part of the toolkit for basically anybody I mean here's the reality of it is we're all kind of at risk for TBI I mean you get into a car accident you have a TBI you're walking down the sidewalk and someone bumps you while they're on their little electric scooter you can get a TBI so it's certainly the case that different occupations different sports different stages of life will have a higher versus lower risk but um it's hard for me to imagine that if there's a low risk way to mitigate it we shouldn't all be doing it given that none of us know when we're gonna you know get hit by an aberrant softball or get into a car accident or fall while we're skiing or whatever it is that we do so so what would you put in the category of kind of No Regret moves along with DHA and creatine which already have so much benefit that we've discussed in other podcasts vis-a-vis brain health uh and in the case of creatine not just brain health but also uh you know muscle performance um and anything else that rises to the level of you just you got to think about it yeah so assuming that other things are taken care of so right you know you're in good mathematic health because we know blood sugar regulation is going to be important and um you you know your homocysteine isn't 15. right I think that that's going to be important then the final thing that I would say goes in that list is is coding as citicoline or

[02:11:01] CDP choline um and again now you know similar enough for that just eating eggs or things that are rich in choline yeah so if you if you eat a couple of eggs a day on average um you know some things with lesser thinning you know phosphatid or choline you're probably getting enough from the diet um but post impact I would probably take one to two grams per day and there's there's some evidence that not the choline helps with very severe traumatic brain injuries but in those you know in in survivors there's some improvement in neuropsychological outcomes in those who supplement with choline so that's another one those three things I think uh are definitely worth considering and tell me the format you you would supplement the choline in acetylcholine uh Slash CDP coding which is the same thing okay but Alpha GPC which is the other form of codeine is is much less studied in in that context so

[02:11:56] I would take take um Cisco links okay and again presumably we're going to the same brands that we're talking about right whether it be Thorn or gero or uh pure encapsulations kind of go with a super high quality brand even if you're going to pay a little bit more it's a relatively small price to pay uh to consider the uh the alternative um Tommy this is super interesting uh amazingly we have not really spent much time on F1 um maybe I'll maybe I'll close with one

[02:12:26] F1 related question um for the for the Casual Observer of F1 maybe someone who knows a little bit about it but not a lot you've obviously you get to spend a lot of time on the inside of F1 what's something that you think would surprise the um the Casual Observer about the sport and maybe something about the demands of the driver what do you think would would kind of endear people to pay closer attention to F1 which is of course my secret ambition with this podcast so I'm not sure if if this uh qualifies as your for your last request but but the thing that surprised me the most is probably related to the first things you said um you know what and and that is how much attention is paid to the health and performance of the driver relative to the health and performance of the car historically in F1 the car was everything right yes I mean and then basically you just bring in a driver who was good and that was it you'd let them get on with it and because of the amount of travel the amount of media commitments so I mean they probably spend half their time with media commitments right rather than working on the car or working with

[02:13:40] Engineers or in the simulator or whatever you know so so probably the amount of time they have to do things like that but because of all of that the the capacity to do a bunch of things related to their health and performance is is quite small right they just they just don't have that availability of cognitive or time resources to do it so this you know they'll spend a bunch of time with their with their coach or trainer on in the gym aerobic work all that stuff is important but then things on top of that it's very variable from driver to driver how much they focus on it and it's also variable how much they're willing or interested in in focusing on that so what was useful to me going into that world is I I imagine you would be the same right you'd show up and be like I have a list of 100 things that are going to help um here it is and um when you work with professional uh or high level endurance athletes right solo athletes they're all it's all their own performance there and they're usually type A's they will do it they'll do all 100 things no questions asked in that setting you have to be really certain that the thing that you're asking that driver to do is going to be is going to be beneficial so you know even if you don't have hundreds of randomized controlled trials you have to be you know you're really working with that sort of this idea of positive asymmetry so like very little risk very high potential benefit whatever whatever it is and you're also selecting that one thing you know or instead of the 99 the 99 other things on your list so it really forces you to focus on what's going to be the most impactful thing that's actually likely to be able to make it into you know the the sort of the drivers processes and you know you know have have a a strong feeling that that's the thing that you should really be focusing on yeah the the opportunity cost is so great that um and there's so many other demands as you said I mean understanding the balance of the car understanding how they can because I think what most people probably also don't understand that we take for granted as as sort of die hards is you know you've got 23 races in the year every race the car has to be a little bit different yeah every circuit is different so uh a street circuit like Monaco has pretty much nothing in common with a big track circuit like Monza and you know a circuit that has lots of high-speed corners without many low speed Corners is totally different than the reverse and you know circuits with long straightaways where you want very low drag very different from circuits that are short and fast and each of those changes everything about the Dynamics of the car changes everything about how temperature gets into the tires stays in the tires degrades track surface all these things so you know the minute they finish that race on Sunday they've got two weeks sometimes one week to completely change the car to optimize it for what they think it's going to do and behave the next week and the driver has to be ready to do that and yeah and then you know someone like you comes in and says all right like we've only got this much time to get you physically ready and of course the jet lag demands are sort of insane right I mean it's uh yeah it's it's really hard to Fathom how much they are crisscrossing the globe I'm sure actually there's a there's a great um little video I saw in on Instagram that showed uh like the flight path of the Season uh and it did it to the awesome like F1 theme song it's just it's so perfectly done um without naming any names um what what um intervention or advice that you've given a driver are you most proud of in terms of the impact it's had on his performance so I think um something that I really enjoyed or I thought it was really impactful recently was um helping a driver who was focusing on time off the start line um and of course you know in general I'm not directly interacting with the driver the driver has a coach and a lot of the interactions is me the coach and tinkering the things the coach goes away obviously has other people they work with and kind of implement things but there's um basically various different ways to get um get the driver ready to react

[02:18:18] I think my airpods my my airpods have died so getting the driver ready to react um and have an optimal reaction speed off the line but then you also want to balance that against the sort of how they might react later in the race because that's the the arousal curve we talked about earlier so there were various things that we tried in terms of um uh training reaction time there were some supplements we tried out so um things around uh caffeine timing and dose um uh I think tyrosine is an interesting one that that may also be beneficial but

[02:18:55] I think we Tinker with that a little bit um creatine was obviously something that that came into play uh there are other skills that I think translate um uh across that kind of thing like uh playing the drums so you have to be relaxed but you also have to be you know timing is critical I don't think that one was ever implemented but that was a the a thought process that that we talked about so and you know there are a whole bunch of things that happened and a whole bunch of things that were changed and the outcome improved I can't say that anything that I did made the difference but at least you know we reached we reached the end goal which was which was a nice process of sort of uh scientifically tinkering with things to to get our end goal well Tommy thank you very much for uh humoring my uh my endless fascination with F1 and um thank you more than that for for making time to to share with me and everybody listening um all of these insights uh this is a fascinating discussion uh I I seem that the the more I learn about the brain the less I know uh which is a common refrain for for for anybody I guess who's trying to get deeper and deeper into subject matter so um anyway thank you very much

[02:20:04] Tommy and I uh I hope to see you this year at coda yeah likewise thanks so much uh for having me I certainly feel the same uh about the brain and that's one of the reasons why I'm so fascinated with it and I really appreciate uh the time to talk to you and then obviously everybody uh for listening as well thanks Tommy thanks
