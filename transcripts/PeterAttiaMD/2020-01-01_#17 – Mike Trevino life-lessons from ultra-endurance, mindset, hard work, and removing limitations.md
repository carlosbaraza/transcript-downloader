## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD com

[00:00:41] welcome to this episode of the Peter T Drive this was a really fun one for me to do and it was done relatively without much preparation or prompting so in this episode I interview one of my really really close friends Mike Trevino Mike and I have been friends from the moment we met which was about five years ago and you know they'd send number things about Mike that are really interesting and you'll learn a lot of them in this episode starting with the fact that mike is arguably the most accomplished amateur endurance athlete certainly that

[00:01:10] I've ever known but you'd have a hard time making a case for any other amateur endurance athlete period his accomplishments are beyond legendary and we go through many of them here though not all of them and that's sort of why I wanted to have this discussion with them it's like Mike and I see each other every week we somehow figure out a way to time our travel such that there's one day a week at least three weeks out of the month when we're not traveling and we can go out and do a ride and it's a relatively short ride we ride about 40 kilometers but it's just kind of this amazing time when we get to catch up on life and all of the things that you know we think about together and so Mike shares a lot of that stuff today he gets into again anything you could listen to this and easily come away overwhelmed and thinking wow there's nothing about that guy's experience that I can relate to because he's basically setting World Records in running in cycling he's doing these things like the race across America that

[00:02:08] I think it's almost impossible for a normal person to fathom what that means it's impossible from me too found them what that means and I have some experience in these sort of ultra distance world but I think he also is able to make the case that look the lessons that he learns in doing these things are applicable to life and they're applicable to specifically things that you might want to do for your own endurance you know if you're currently able to run a 5k and wondering what does it take to get to the 10k or the half marathon or you're running the half marathon and you want to run the marathon what does it take well in many ways it's sort of taking a page out of

[00:02:41] Mike's playbook Mike's a really special guy to me Mike and his wife nada who are very close friends have been there for me during arguably one of the most difficult periods of my life and they were the first people to basically show up when I needed to be picked up and so I'm forever grateful to Mike and his family and I just find that our weekly bike rides on Sunday mornings which are usually when we do them are among kind of the most cherished things that I do outdoors anymore so much of what I do is now alone I lift weights alone I ride my peloton or my wahoo kicker alone and this is kind of the one time a week when

[00:03:19] I get to go and be with somebody else for you know or an hour 75 minutes half an hour and a half and I value it greatly one anecdote that I'll tell before we jump into this episode just to put in perspective for anybody who is themselves a cyclist or a reasonably serious athlete just to put in context

[00:03:36] Mike's you know accomplishments and just his ability so about four years ago when I was you know training very hard as a time trial list and at this point Mike was you know he was running but he was kind of done with his ultra distance career and had not been on a bike in probably a year and he was like you know

[00:03:54] I'm gonna come out and join you one day for one of your workouts I said they that'd be great you know and I couldn't expect that he could even come close to keeping up with me because at the end of the day just conditioning seems to matter and how much preparedness you have matters and so we went out to

[00:04:09] Fiesta Island where we train and there's you know a loop that you do that's part of the training so we did this workout together it was a very tough workout lots of sort of three-minute four-minute all-out intervals and at the end of the workout we decided to do two hot laps so that's two laps of big loop of fiesta island that would be about almost 14 kilometers for those two laps and you know I was fit like I was training for races and I guess as I said

[00:04:36] Mike hadn't been on a bike in about a year and we went out and did these two hot laps and I couldn't believe it when I crossed a line for the second lap I mean I expected Mike to be three or four minutes behind and I look back and he's all of fifteen seconds behind me and I was like wow I'm about as fit as I'm going to be at this stage of my life there's not a lot I'm going to do to take my game to the next level and he's pretty much right where I am just out of the gate and that was kind of an interesting you know wake-up of like there are guys that are just at a different level and these guys train and they're forget about it they're in another world so I hope you enjoy this episode it's really geared towards people who have some sort of interest in physical performance but I really think there are enough sort of life lessons placed within here that I think anybody even someone who has no desire to run a marathon or do anything crazy like that is still going to find something in it and finally at the very end if you just don't want to hear anything else and just want to skip to the very end we do disclose what we consider the second best beer of all time again we do not disclose the best beer because you know

[00:05:49] I've got my reasons for that but I'm at the very least those of you that are interested in great beer will get a little tip at the end so anyway I hope you enjoy [Music] like I'm super excited to sit down and talk about all this stuff with you you know we've known each other for such a long time now but you're such a sort of mild mannered understated guy that if someone googled your name they wouldn't realize a fraction of what you've accomplished and I think a lot of people who are gonna listen to this who are gonna be I think will learn a lot from this and be able to apply it to what they're doing I doubt many people who listen to those ever ever gonna want to go and do Ram or try to set 24-hour world records in cycling and running but

[00:06:24] I think the principles that you've learned over the years are applicable to someone who's going on to try to run their first 10k or whatever but let's start with a funny story which is what you do for your birthday this year I ran so how old you turn 43 in December and what is your shtick on your birthday starting at 40 the the new goal became run run my miles and yours yours Amala so this year was 43 miles so I remember when you called me later that day after you did your forty three mile run which in and of itself was crazy but the part that I found most impressive was your nutritional strategy yeah this year was a new experiment I thought it was in good shape and decided to try the run no calories so self supported but no calories just to see if I could pull it off so I left with a couple crystal light packets for flavor on hydration and 20 bucks to buy worst case buy it banana at a 7-eleven or something like that and I pulled it off yeah so you had had dinner the night before yeah I started fasting at 5:00 the night before had a beer just by the way just I just want to state for the record the beer that we drink we never mentioned a name never ever okay just yet so don't let that ever slip out in case that was the beer you had so you got a beer at 5:00 p.m. 5:00 and went to bed 9 or 10 up at 4:00 and out the door by 5:00 no breakfast no breakfast and that was it started running and you ran about eight minute miles for 43 miles yeah just over eight with some hills went south I went left North County San Diego went to the coast ran up Torrey Pines gorgeous morning and just kept going down the coast of La Jolla and Pacific

[00:08:17] Beach and done a point woman and turned around and stopped at in Pacific Beach at the pier where I met my family noonish and we had brunch and you said you weren't even really hungry when you were done I wasn't I was and I expected it you know we were ready to have a big brunch and Bloody Marys and celebrate you know my wife brought the kids and balloons and created our favorite restaurant and not was great it was a wonderful day yeah so in the parlance that's that's what we call fad adaptation because you know if you do the math it the extent to which you're expending energy or you're probably expending somewhere in the neighborhood of six to seven hundred kilojoules per hour and you know if you were trying to get access to that just from glycogen I mean you'd be done in probably two three hours two or three you know two or three at most and I was fairly aggressive pace right so you know there's a series of energy stores that you tap into depending on your output and duration you know that well so now I try to keep an even pace and stay hydrated didn't really stop it was actually nice because in Prior runs I'd you know you have to stop at a 7-eleven and wait in line or stop at a gas station and get something to drink and buy a banana or granola bar or something and you get tight so I was able to keep moving how did you drink what so I had I had 20 ounce handhelds and fortunately was able to refill there's a little drinking fountain at Torrey Pines State Beach and there's one in low a Shores you know and kind of know where all the stops are so

[00:09:54] I just planned it in a little 30-second diversions and by the end I was just doing you know straight water which felt tasted better I turned around Point Loma OB and then went back up north and one last water stop in South Mission Beach and ended in Pacific Beach so I remember one of the first times we hung out we were introduced by a mutual friend subscribeee in 2013 and this is back when I was cycling pretty seriously you were running pretty seriously but you weren't cycling much at the time but I was telling you about this shake that I make this generation you can I call it the Peter Kaufman where I take the generation you can and I mix it with heavy cream and almond milk and it's like it's like the best meal you could have in a shake right and I was like hey you know what why don't you come over after your workout on Sunday and I'll fire this up for you and you said sure

[00:10:45] I'll be there and you came over but the part that blew my mind is you ran over and it was a 50 mile run you know even though we only live like you lived in La Jolla at the time so we only lived maybe 12 miles away from each other but you had turned it into a 50 mile run to end at my place I forgot about that yeah of course because for you that's nothing well no it was it was actually one of my longer runs training for so that was that was 13 and that Sunday Saturday or

[00:11:14] Sunday was one of my long runs training for what was supposed to be a 300 mile run down the coast and so I think I peaked around 50 or 60 in terms of and I was doing 130 mile weeks getting ready for that 170 you hit one week didn't you know I the week of the run night at 315 313 315 ended up being about 275 miles the run itself which was Gaviota State

[00:11:40] Beach to San Diego to raise money for the Navy SEAL foundation so that 50-miler was training for that which was by six weeks after your shake remember your wife and daughter saw me standing in the driveway and she kind of looked at me out of the corner I and just ran in the house the pool of sweat yeah modest way but yeah you came in and fired up the shake so I'm really glad to microscopically contributed to that recovery that day yeah it's all about that shake so where'd you grow up grew up in Iowa and were you like a cross-country star in high schooler's no no I was actually a football player wrestler in Iowa I started riding my bike at four and was out the door independently by six and then you know doing 50 and 100 mile rides by the time

[00:12:32] I was 10 or 12 did raise bribry which is a bike ride across Iowa first one was an 87 when I was two I was 400 miles across the state so I mean I I always liked your endurance stuff but most of my time was spent my dream was to play Notre Dame football your dad went to Notre Dame right my dad went to Notre Dame my grandfather did my mom went to st. Mary's which is the sister college there so my dream was to honor Dame football so that was big to you know wait about 200 pounds in high school and wrestled heavy wakes I didn't want to lose weight you know it's offensive lineman offensive tackle in high school and then when played football in college inside linebacker in college and I remember the first time you told me that I was like how were you a football player like you just you don't have an ounce of extra weight on you at this point and so what was that metamorphosis like to transition from being kind of a power athlete to an ultra endurance athlete it wasn't planned you know it was College became about College and I played a year and a half of football and I wanted to finish college early I just didn't want to go the whole four years so I just loaded up on classes and realized I was there to study and work and not necessarily play football so I quit football played rugby and my first job out of college was actually a startup in Europe and the interesting byproduct of that whole transition was I was learning German living in Heidelberg Germany I was running sales and marketing for this tiny little startup there and the family teaching me German one of the daughters was dating a rugby player that played for the local semi-pro rugby club and when he found out I'd played rugby he said come practice with us and their practices at the time were runs in the mountains in Bavarian southern Germany so I just fell in love with trail running so it you know just you know and

[00:14:28] I ended up playing rugby with that team which was fantastic it was a blast but I also ended up losing weight and that's just sort of fed on itself so by the time I got back to New York you know I'd lost 15 pounds and just kept training kept running didn't lift as much and it just fell off me I was at my peak - 18

[00:14:48] I'm 170 now when I was race you know it's 155 160 so I lost 560 ish pounds over the course of five ten but the amazing thing because I've seen so many pictures of you back like at the picture there's a great picture of you that hopefully will figure out a way to sort of link to it in the show notes but at the beginning of the mm I think 2004 Ram maybe and it's like I'm looking at you and I'm like I know you're 155 pounds but you don't look it you look like a beast yeah it was never about looks no but it's like you're you know you become purpose-built we've talked about this being an engineer I've always just looked at my body's just utility to achieve an outcome right so how do you engineer the outcome that you want

[00:15:32] I made a transition from running to cycling in hindsight it was a fairly short transition I was writing a lot cross-training when I was competing in ultras running 2000 1 2 3 but I I knew I wanted to do Race Across America and so I it was always I mean I was still riding 150 miles a week when I was running 100 miles a week so I was still riding quite a bit but then as soon as I stopped running and started riding my body just changed my massage therapist who's still my massage therapist today couldn't believe the transformations your body just changed overnight but that's all I was doing all I was doing is training you have that sort of unique ability where you can go out and run a sub 3 hour marathon which that's a very fast marathon but at the same time you're setting 24-hour world records on a track and running I mean you ran almost 150 miles in 24 hours right yeah yeah I didn't send any world records on the track running I did set some course records on a track 24 hour run and a 1 which was the San Diego one day and I swore I would never run on a track again it was the probably the hardest alter a single day ultra I ever did because it's just so monotonous you run a quarter-mile track quarter-mile track Clea maca collagen you know South San Diego running 24 hours just going to you you looked forward to every four hours or every six hours they change direction they blow whistle and you crossed that ship tracking was and then you change direction and you'd run the other direction for hours that's what you look forward to hmm and at the time this is a one I mean I was running with the handheld Sony

[00:17:09] Walkman and I had tapes back then the the CDs were still skipping a little - yeah CDs didn't work and shortly after that you know mp3s you started playing with mini disks and other things but so that and in hindsight you know I'm running with a water bottle in one hand in a Sony Walkman in the other hand carrying it for 24 hours and did you have like a big support staff or something like that I did not have anyone there at that event in fact I had a cooler that I brought you know I backed my truck up to the you know I'm back at the track and - a cooler in the back and left a hatch open and I just crude myself for that I didn't want to bother any woman you couldn't ask anyone to say out there this was sort of your opening thing like this this was the event that kind of put you on the map of like because again you didn't a lot of these ultra distance guys have been sort of doing that stuff for a longer but you just sort of showed up and was not like your first big win that run was actually at the end of what had been my first sort of big year so I in 2000 I ran my first 50 it made the transition from marathons and you know the question was just can I do a 50 and I did the it was quickly called a PCT 52 Pacific Crest

[00:18:27] Trail 50-miler I'm hot August and I then did a hundred mile er called the Angeles Crest 100 starts in Wrightwood ends at the Rose Bowl Pasadena about six weeks after that and I was doing the hundred because my goal is to qualify for what was and still is the Super Bowl of ultras the western states 100 I didn't get into the western states this was in 2000 but I submitted for the bad water so that was my goal so in 2000 applied to get into the bad water I did for 2001 the July 2001 running the bad water and so 2001 was I stacked a bunch of races I did a bunch of 50 modelers actually the Boston

[00:19:08] Marathon you know in there between two fifties and so the track run was actually at the end of that season so I did he's been doing a lot of water and then I actually on September 11th of 2001 I was scheduled to fly to Colorado to try to bag a bunch of 40 nurse set a record of 14 errs and had to postpone that a week and did it a week or two after that and that was in September of oh 1 and then I did the track run in

[00:19:36] November of what 1 now is you into my ear so tell people what bad water is because that out here means a lot because anyone in Southern California knows what that is but yeah so bad water is a running race that is starts in Death Valley in California so it's nice and cool nice and cool so you know it's a cool 125 at the peak around 4 o'clock you know it's so hot if you run the white line it's you know 10 degrees cooler the surface gets really hot so the air temperature is 125 the surface to making fry an egg people can fry an egg on a hood of a car so I did the bad water and how long is it it's 135 miles and you start in Death

[00:20:17] Valley at 100 or so feet below sea level I don't remember exactly and it now finishes in Witney portals which is 85 hundred feet so it's a beautiful me go through all these ecosystems starting to desert the journey over to 395 you roll into Lone Pine which is sort of a cool little mountain town in California the base of the Sierras and then you start get on this portals road Witney portals road which is about a half marathon pure you know all climbing so you have 13 or so miles of climbing up to the Whitney's portal it used to actually go all the way up to the top of Whitney for safety reasons they stopped doing that and funny side note is I had I was doing a lot of climbing a lot of mountaineering stuff in 2001 so my crew

[00:21:05] I did have a crew for bad we already have to have one so I had two crews I actually had a running crew in a climbing crew and my climbing partner was waiting for me at the portals I don't think I've ever talked about this with you so I did the race you know 10:00 a.m. start I finished I forget my time but I finished the next day around noon or 1:00 and my climbing partner was there right we were gonna go climb so we're gonna you know hike up to the base of Mount

[00:21:33] Whitney and we were gonna climb I think the east face of Mount Whitney and he had all the climbing gear ready to go and I finished you know 135 miles and I said hey buddy you don't want me on the other side of the lane you uh you don't man you know and so we ended up going down to Lone Pine in heaven Pizza yeah bailed they old on the climb I have a much smaller story than that meaning like it's a fraction of that but in 2007

[00:22:00] I was I wanted to swim across Lake Tahoe as a training swim for a longer swim I was doing later that summer and trans Tahoe I mean you can do it ten different ways to Sunday but I wanted to do the longest possible crossing but I didn't do a good job picking a boat captain I left it till the last minute I didn't know how to get someone really good so I just kind of went to you know some local and said hey man can you pilot me across this thing and turned out he was clearly drunk and we only know this because I left accidentally I left my GPS device on in the boat the whole time we were on the boat but he didn't realize that the purpose of the guy in the boat is to set the direction the swimmer sets the speed the boat sets the direction he followed me so we asked our way across Lake Tahoe and I mean it was a total [ __ ] show I ended up like running out of food because of course I only budgeted this to be so many hours and it ended up being like two and a half hours longer it turned out to be probably the hardest one of my life mentally but I remember that day I was like uh you know we started at night so I'm like I'll be done by 2:00 p.m. I told my brother I was like dude have the bikes down at

[00:23:07] Lake Tahoe as soon as I get off we're gonna ride around the lake you know which is like a 80 mile ride or something and I swear when I finished that swim I was I could barely walk to the car just you know the Sun beating down on you like the mental fatigue he goes like yeah I don't know how I thought that I was gonna ride around this lake at this point that's the greatest I mean the training the training for these things is what prepares you and not just the miles not just a time on your feet but it's stuff like that that mentally demoralizing right it completely humbles you and I think if I look back on the stories you know very few stories come from races a lot of my stories come from the training and we all have greatest or

[00:23:51] I mean I've gotten stuck in the desert sandstorms learned to bring goggles with me to ride my bike and goggles to deal with sandstorms I had my beam I used to write us off right and my beam delaminated so hot in the desert so the carbons sat in this this carbon beam sat in a aluminum sleeve and it was so hot it delaminated so essentially what happened is is that my seat lowered about six inches and so I was on my way out east to the Salton Sea and I think somewhere around Westmoreland and

[00:24:23] Brawley found a machine shop and I went to the guys and none of them spoke English and I said do you guys you have any screw some cheap metal screws and so they had a bunch of power tools and they three of us they pulled up on the sea got it to a relatively close spot where I needed to be and we started drilling sheet metal screws through the aluminum the carbon because I was you know 200 miles from San Diego hundred 50 miles from San Diego and and I just wouldn't occur to you to call a friend and come pick you up no I mean yeah you're you're on your own as part of the journey and this is the this I had a flip phone that

[00:25:00] I turn off because you had no reception out there so I don't think I probably even could have called a friend at the time great you know the stories are endless and you know stuff like that another you know Whitney story we tried to rock climb Whitney in May and it was still all snow and ice and what should have been a six or eight hour climb turned into a 22 hour climb no food no water and brutal same deal we had planned to meet some people afterward and but those you know those are the most memorable stories it provided you get out alive provided you get out of life yeah that's the caveat so you very very briefly a moment ago alluded to ram which again anybody in the cycling world especially in the ultra world will understand what ram is it would generally be regarded as the single most challenging cycling event again I don't even know how you compare it to the Tour de France obviously the

[00:25:51] Tour de France or one of the Grand Tours like the Giro or they Vuelta those are remarkable feats that only the best professionals in the world are gonna do or was RAM you know it's an amateur event although some pros have done it but I don't even remember when I learned about Ram like it was always something I knew about and couldn't fathom that people could do it so you obviously decided to do it but tell us what Ram actually is Ram is the race across America it's a bike race across America it started in the I think it's the early 80s and my first exposure to Ram was actually when I was a kid there was a guy named Bob Breedlove who was a surgeon in Des Moines Iowa who was doing this crazy race across America so

[00:26:33] I learned about Ram and I was already riding my bike and just holy cow these guys can go 3,000 miles across the country non-stop you know so it's the same length as the Tour de France but it's not in stages unless you decide to make it in stages you just go non-stop so the whistle blows and first person to these coasts wins and to put that in perspective the Tour de France which is ridiculously grueling there's about 22 days it's about 22 days yeah and the winner is gonna do ram in how many days eight and you know depending on the route in the year it's over a hundred thousand feet of climbing and you're going through the desert of California the hills of West Virginia of course you're the Rockies and you know Kansas and in the flats that are windy and the year I did that we went it was very windy crazy rains so you know the thing about RAM is it's not just the person riding the bike it's the logistics it's the crew you're dealing with rules crazy race rules and so it's a really multifaceted a really engineer the race to do well right so of course you have to prepare for it but you know your bike equipment you have the vehicle equipment you have race food racer food you have crew food and then you think by everything from batteries to we were rigging the car to get power extra power we had speakers on the vans and it's just crazy logistics getting ready for something like that which is part of the fun it's part of its you know all the different variables you have to control for I've seen world-class racers bail before they even hit Arizona because they just their crew blows up my crew in 2004 when I did it only one was a cyclist you know it's kind of like building a company you know you problem solving comes best from people that represent different functional areas right so I had massage therapists I had a doc I had one cyclist and a software engineer my sister you know I had a really mixed team none of them except for one knew how to change a tire on a bike and I figured we could teach him that yeah and that crew dynamics is the biggest part of all on that thing off it's all about the crew you know when you're talking about eight nine days that's unbelievable I always felt the highest compliment that I ever felt or the greatest sense of pride I probably ever felt during my marathon swimming days was when I got asked to crew chief for one of my fellow swimmers so when I was doing the swims you know have to have a crew chief and that person basically is the one that is designated in charge there is one and only one boss on that ship and everybody does what they say no matter what the [ __ ] is going on that's right so you have to trust that person with your life they're the ones that make the decision on when you have to change feeding if things are going wrong they're the ones who pull you out of the water if they think you're failing that's like the guy in the corner who can throw the white towel and when you're getting the crap beat out of you so because you know as athletes when they're doing these ultra distance things like they can become delirious and then you have to think about their safety so you know a number of occasions I got to crew chief or friends of mine who were doing some of the most ridiculous swims I've ever seen like Forrest Nelson is a friend of mine who again outside of the swimming community nobody would know him but he's the guy's ridiculous I mean he's so load around Catalina Island that's a 50-mile swim he's done a double crossing of Catalina in the winter which is I mean just from another planet and yeah you realize like you know the responsibility that's on you and you are responsible for making sure the other ten people the boat aren't screwing up their jobs and you are a hundred percent responsible for everything that swimmers doing counting their stroke right all those things and and again the longest

[00:30:10] I've ever had to crew is you know be a chief is maybe 36 to 48 hours I can't even imagine what a crew is going through for nine days it's nine days it's nine days of the most intense and you know these are first real problems but this is an invented a challenge for her right that we should keep that in persist so but when you in the moment when you're in the race and there's other crew out there and there's other racers out there and especially as you get more and more sleep-deprived and vested in the the outcome it's as real as it gets so that's exactly right in fact my crew chief the first year was the only cyclist he had brought his brother I think his brother was a math professor at MIT or Columbia and they ended up getting into a fistfight in the parking lot of a grocery store in the Midwest and I heard screaming out I was down first leap I heard screaming outside of the RV what's going on

[00:31:05] Byron and Jerry are in a fight what it's come to blows and they didn't speak for the rest of the I mean that was the I mean that this is these are brothers so that was one of many things that happened that year but I broke my crew in the first 45 hours I didn't I didn't get off the bike for 28 hours I didn't sleep for 45 ish hours and when I was supposed to go down for my first plan sleep the goal was to sleep 2 hours a day after the first night so I ride through the first night and then sleep into the second but it's a funny story I came off the bike forty-four hours just outside of Mexican Hat Utah in second place tell folks where the race starts the race started in Oh for the race started in downtown San Diego so Star of India started in San Diego and you start heading east you go through it's not just that you're crossing the country you're diagonally crossing the country you're going from the bottom left corner of the United

[00:32:04] States to the top right corner right that's right ignore it finished that year in Atlantic City and so we you know I don't remember how many miles but you know call it 800 miles to the event I went down from my first sleep and I'm naked getting massaged and my massage therapist is just trying to put me to sleep and just as I'm falling asleep I feel this rocking and the whole

[00:32:28] RVs rocking and I like for whatever reason something fires and like wait that's the wind and so I jump up completely naked run outside the RV and I'm standing on the highway like which way is the wind blowing which way am I going I didn't even know which direction I was going and the crew had just slept now just everyone's asleep and isprobably half hour after I had gone down I hadn't slept yet and they realized I wanted it if that's a tailwind put me back on the bike and it was and it was and so they put me back on the bike so they got me all dressed and getting me dressed you know I've it was a process because at that point how sunburned and pretty beat and sore and shaved you got me dressed got me back on the bike and I started riding and I saw the guy in first place I passed the guy in first place who was just coming out of his first lead slept for an hours this was for open robic yeah so you very robic was had just slept I passed him and I was then in the lead wasn't by design but then he what happened is he and I then rode for four or five hours and pushed into Utah you guys got the field we got the field and what happened is that wind was a storm and so if I had stayed I would have gotten caught in the storm and so what happens we got the storm there's one guy behind me named

[00:33:44] Wolfgang Fasching it's a world-class endurance athlete and you know Seven Summits guy Austrian guy greatest guy he was behind me but a few hours behind me had blown up in the desert just a lot of the European guys struggle with the heats I just can't train in the heat over there so your aerobic and I ended up pushing my 1012 hours ahead of everybody else and everybody else got caught up in this storm so I don't have been a really very good strategic move to get back on the bike I ended up sleeping around the 4850 hour mark I did get my you know hour and a half and at that point we were ahead of everybody else and everybody else was just playing catch-up for the next six days it's unbelievable I mean we'll come back to talking about aerobic who would go on to become probably the most storied rider and am history correct yeah yes five-time champion yeah I think four or five time yeah there's a book that talks about Ram and I've read it and I'm blanking on the title now we'll definitely link to it in the show notes to remember the book I'm talking about oh well you're in it but barely because I remember talking about it with you a few years ago and I was like Mike this is the year you were second and Ram and you're like yeah I didn't want to talk to the reporter but

[00:34:50] I I know we'll figure out what the name of the book it's a great book because you know if anybody's listening this and thinks what the hell I want to understand a little bit more about this you go into it and the book because I mean robic must have been able to speak with the with the author you know you just get a great picture of this crazy dude what he's Serbian right he's Slovenia in Slovenia no yeah so he was riding for the Slovenian army was a soldier mm-hmm and his full-time job was to be an endurance athlete and he was just a beast strong you know just in his mental patients was just phenomenal although that year if I recall of it first of all you're a rookie so Ricky's not supposed to be I was not supposed you were not supposed to be writing challenging him yeah in fact that year was the race directors couldn't figure me I was a runner who is this guy then I just didn't know any but I was young you know I didn't know any better I just hammered and just I all along it was part of my plan I was actually off my pace than my you know I'm all about looking at my expected pace over 55 time stations and altitude gain and loss and planning it all out I was off my projected pace so you know I was a little bit disappointed with why I was but that's eight days of 3,000 miles so you know things get out of whack pretty quickly so you know it's all about just being in its adaptation right in real time now was this the year or was it the following year when robux team basically accused you guys of cheating that was that year so that year robic thought he was gonna win it he had been prepared he should have won by a day yeah he expected to and so his crew all you know

[00:36:24] Armed Forces guys about halfway through the country when I was still in it and they for whatever reason they just I just wasn't sleeping for that year I just didn't I could not sleep you know over the eight and a half day slept ten and a half hours oh my god I just couldn't sleep and you know we can talk later about the mental effects of not sleep and me sleep I've found is more important than food and hydration when it comes to thermal regulation and muscle glycogen restoration and synapse repair informational literally when I was clinically insane by the end of that race fully delusional by the end of that race but I just kept hammering and so the robic team what who is this guy what is he do and he has to be cheating and it's legal to spot people so they sent a van back and they just attached him to my team and apparently this has sort of raised tactics the RAM is famous for other racers playing mental games and the race directors kind of encouraged it and that was all new to me I mean I'm kind of a pure clean just going hammer and let the best man win and they loved that those antics or I meant the mental game the mental games and so the accusations of cheating were chalked up as all their just mental games but it did become more than that for me because the racetrack you know at first of all I had the press which is why I wouldn't talk to the press after that I had the press asking me what do you think about the accusations my team hadn't told me yet in robux crew just accused me of cheating so the officials would you know scrutinize me and they eventually they went through their accusations and you know it was all funny the damage had been done I had one really really bad night he was in Kansas or a little bit past that and it came after I robic told me flat-out you're gonna win and he said you don't need to sleep you're gonna win and I said we've got a thousand miles to go wait so you and robic would actually be riding together at some point you got even legal you're you're allowed to ride together for 20 minutes every 24 hour period mmm and so we rode together and we talked his wife was pregnant at the time and oh for when we were riding you know we were talking about his I think he knew it was gonna be a boy so he's talking about is his soon-to-be-born kid and you know asked me where I was from and and so we talked a little bit you know he his English was okay and actually had a great time and then I told him to go ahead and he said no you go ahead and so I know riding ahead and got ahead of him a bit and he was hurting at that point cuz I think he was just like what and I was I did my best to look fresh and was smiling and joking and you know acting like this is just a little stroll you know in the park so mental games but shortly after that his team accused me of cheating and you know it all played out over a day or so what's interesting is one of the race officials I almost I don't think we've ever talked about this but I quit I quit the RAM I think we were in Indiana we were outside of

[00:39:22] Indianapolis it all came to a head and the race official his name's Johnny Boswell and Johnny came up to me and he said we're so sorry about everything that's happened I heard you you're withdrawing from the race is there anything we can do to keep you in the race and I said this isn't why I came out here at you know this is crazy and and mind you I've you know 2,000 miles into it yeah with no sleep you're not even able to think I just got off the bike robic at that point was four or five hours ahead of me was completely demoralized right and my team's having to answer questions about why they pulled me off the road to sleep in the

[00:39:57] RV just crazy stuff right all within race rules and so I told Johnny it's the only way I'm gonna stay in this is if no one speaks to me for the rest of the event I don't want cuz there were a crew or press vans cruising up alongside me trying to take pictures trying to interview me and I said I want everyone to leave me alone the only way I stay in this and at that point I'd felt like you know the race is lost I'm not gonna win this race drawbacks too far ahead so four or five hours with how many miles to go is insurmountable 881 800 I think was around 800 miles I'd have to go back and look and believe or not I went for a run I went I I would say I don't believe it but I you went for a run before we rode our bikes today I did you just decided at 5:30 in the morning you needed to go for a run just you know get a little workout in before we got on our bikes so I asked myself what's the one thing that'll Center me and for me Ron

[00:40:56] Ian's always been my meditation but it's just I get centered right so I asked my crew I said you find my running shoes not you know but and I went for a run and I found a park bench in a little town in the Midwest and I ran you know a mile or two and I just sat under a park bench and I checked myself and it was you know you could say I was sleepy but I was of probably the clearest mental I knew exactly why I was there and what I was doing and I asked myself do I want to do this to my crew they were demoralized I was hurting and I ran back and I said all right I will do it under these conditions I will get back in the race and doing her these conditions and I did and the officials stayed with me and kind of protected us the rest of the race and it was fantastic they gave us space but they just kept an eye on us the rest of the race and I've you know since we I still exchanged Christmas cards with Johnny Boswell and we'll always think of him as a friend because he you saw what we were trying to do and

[00:41:55] I think a lot of people like what's this guy doing and what's it what's his angle it was this strategy that normally people took to ram as far as how much time on the bike versus how much sleep time what would what would be considered the sort of best practice 20 to 22 hours on the bike 2 to 4 hours of sleep you know so you want to sleep if you're you know at a minimum 18 to 20 hours over the course of a week so did anybody ever experiment with I'm gonna ride 18 hours and sleep a fall sick a lot of guys have talked about time traveling right so yeah you ride 300 you hammer and you go off you know so you ride for call it 18 hours and then you get off the bike and you sleep six and I think there's something to be said for that I mean that's the ultimate you know if you can do that and sustain it and still put the same performance in on your six or seven 300 miler then that may be there you know it's just math if you know cumulative time elapsed is less than just hammer in the whole time it's tough though I'll tell you it's tough to get off the bike it takes a lot of patience especially early on the race where the other guys are you're gonna see like

[00:43:01] Jesus I'm gonna sleep for six hours when some dudes sleeping for two like I'm gonna wake up you know given the difference in speeds three hours behind a guy that's right and there's a guy here in San Diego that his name's Pete Penn Sears and he held the transcontinental speed record for a long times fifteen point four miles an hour for eight and a half days that includes off the time haha via yeah that's ridiculous so his on bike speed is 20 miles an hour he's flying that he didn't stop much but he said there's really two and I eventually experienced this there's two things that will determine whether or not you can win RAM um one is what is your RAM speed and really what is your speed what's speed can you maintain on the bike after you've depleted your muscle glycogen and you're just cruising because it's that's your that's ultimately gonna determine how fast you can really go we used to call that your all-day speed in the water this is weird well beyond thresholds we're just talking about something totally different that's right that's right you're no longer trying to stay five percent of threshold you're you're just you're done right that's that's one and the other is what's your REM cycle and he taught me this and his wives used to do it for him is she would watch him sleep and then watch when he would come on a trim and she would chart it and they would do this before the RAM because obviously it changes over time and so right up before the RAM his wife would watch him sleep time it and then she would wake him up and that the whole point being don't wake yourself up in the middle of REM you're gonna be sleepy and not be able to perform so she'd look at his eyes until because theoretically you go from

[00:44:36] REM you you if it's late enough you might go out to stage one two which is a perfect time to wake somebody that's right so she would wait till his eyes stop moving she would wait till as I stop moving bring him out he would feel rested even though it was two hours and he said look if your REM is ninety minutes instead of two twenty you know two and a half hours you're gonna win yeah Wow that is freaking incredible sleep engineering engineering the sleep and then he you know we talked a lot about you know staying liquid cuz it's you know you don't want to move blood your gut while you're writing because then obviously you're taking blood away from your legs so stay liquid try to let your body do as little work digesting but you want nutrient-dense calories right and nutrition and nutrition and hydration should be one of the same to the extent that you can tolerate that so yeah you your engineering your sleep your engineering your your intake of course your engineering and your training and race strategy then people engineer the [ __ ] out of their bikes to maybe they're doing all kinds of crazy things to get their bikes dialed now you got to know pants Harris pretty well and you got to ride with him you told me a story about him once and I couldn't believe it like how old was he and how fit he still was yeah you know for I was introduced to him in oh four and went out and rode with a group of guys that still ride and he invited me to ride with them so I rode up there in North County San Diego and I wrote up did 60 or 70 miles to meet them and we rode and we were rode up a hill that was a twenty six percent grade probably a hundred or so miles into our ride I was about 140 or so for me and we rode up the hill we were leading this crew and I looked over to him at the end of the hill twenty-six percent grade in North County I think it was up near Fallbrook or Vista where he was former nuclear engineer at San

[00:46:28] Onofre and he said what's your heart rate right now and I think it's like 188 and I said what's yours and he said it's 181 so he's 60 I don't know how old he was he was mid-60s then and his heart rate was like 180 and I said what's the highest your heart rate has ever gotten and he said I just hit the highest heart rate I've ever seen so here he is in his mid-60s and I and I asked him I know you say I've never gone up this hill this fast and I've never seen that heart race so here's someone in their mid sixties and if you do the math right 220 less your age and that's your max heart rate that's that's can see so you know he should have been around let's call it 160 maybe max heart rate for highly trained adapted semi professional athlete world-class athlete transcontinental speed record holder at the time and here he is hitting 180 and he just I'm still reeling in the 26% I mean admittedly I've never been able to climb particularly well on a bike but I don't actually think I could pedal a bike up 26% grade unless I had like a mountain bike or something like if I took my road bike now which probably

[00:47:41] I can't even remember if I have a compact crank I probably do so I'm riding like a 34 23 I don't think I could get up 26 like that hill when we're coming around like Hodges as we you know when ya the light before you get to del Dios that's maybe 18% maybe and it's a and it's only like 60 miles yeah exactly yeah it's nothing it's nothing yeah in fact he told me most guys will what they call Paperboy so they weave back and forth to get up that so they'll paperboy and then the roll used to be they would go there's an avocado grove it gets to the top of the hill and when they were kids were younger they would go grab avocados and they would start just I just all you have to do is lay it on the road and avocados would roll down and start start bouncing down the hill and they didn't try to nail guys on their bikes wrong so if you're slow and they get beam by avocado oh my god so Pete came up to me before right before the race and it's a good luck you know that record needs to go and you know wish you the best and he he taught me so much I mean very early on I haven't talked to him in in a few years but he taught me a lot and just that this whole notion of engineering to sleep the nutrition the training plan the race strategy of course all the cruise stuff and that's a lot has to come together there's so much more I want to talk about on that front and I want to come back to robic because I don't want to forget this there's a lot of people listening to this who they can't relate to what you're talking about let's call a spade a spade I doubt there's anybody listening to this who's ever gonna go out and ride Ram let alone you know do any of the other crazy all

[00:49:10] Trinder and stuff but I get I am sure there are a lot of people here who are thinking I really want to run a marathon one day or I really want to do an Ironman you know I want to take that leap from Olympic Distance to Ironman what can they learn from you to make that transition which you know for many people running a marathon is as crazy as doing a 24 hour run and for many people doing an Ironman for them is as big a stretch as it was for you to be Ram I think we all have the physical ability we all natural-born athletes everyone some people may you really believe that

[00:49:41] I believe that I firmly believe that now some people may have better genetics or better biomechanics but look I was heavy and a jock football player and I'm not the best endurance athlete I was able to engineer myself kind of hack my way to positive outcomes and if I can do it I think anybody can now people may have different goals so I think the biggest thing is just assume that you have in you somewhere the ability to do great things the other piece of it is change your mindset right

[00:50:13] I whatever your goal might be whether it's run a half marathon instead of a 5k if that's what you want to push yourself is there should be no sacred cows right we have these constructs in our mind about limits and I'd say that's the biggest thing I've talked to people about this before it's just change your perspective on what you think you can do just throw it out the window it's the classic you know if someone gets electrocuted and they get thrown across the room it's not the electricity throwing them across the room it's their body they have the innate ability to do amazing things this most people haven't figured out how to tap into that so I that's my only piece of advice is just check your assumptions at the door right and just open your mind up a little bit we talked about all these things you've done and what's missing from the story is you were working 60 hours a week as an engineer at Qualcomm during this period of time yeah in the early 2000s I was running a software company and you know we had test engineers and programmers etc working at Qualcomm in lots of other places that's right so I actually but it fit very nicely with my routine so I would get up at 3 ish run that ride and just wants to be clear that's 3 a.m. 3 a.m. run and run how far what would be give me a day in the life of turned eight 1212 was sort of my staple mm-hmm run 12 jump on them you know no shower jump on the bike ride in to work shower

[00:51:36] Aston seat by 6:30 and I was a programmer at the time I met even though I had people I loved the architect and build stuff right so somewhere in there and prepping for my run that would make a smoothie with whey protein isolate and glutamine and glucosamine and flaxseed oil and all the stuff I needed to recover so I'd have that in the freezer come back from my run grab that throw it in my pack throw my computer in my patch amp on the bike and then I'll put my feet up and so from 6:30 to noon

[00:52:05] I would sip on a smoothie that was super cold and eat over time you know that those would be my name's 2,000 calorie shake essentially right and so that was my routine but it worked because that was my recovery time and occasionally I would go out and run or when I was training for bad water I learned that you know bad water was all about just becoming a human water filter because you have to push so much fluid in that water just because you sweat so much that I would go and do sauna time so I would run over to a fitness facility that had a nice on and it's Jacuzzi now just focused on raising my my body temp so

[00:52:41] I'd sit in a sauna and then I would go sit in the jacuzzi and I'll just pound waters and I would go back and work for a few hours and just you might find yourself to be hot and to basically process as much water as possible did you have to pay attention to your minerals and electrolytes because you know that level you can start getting into concern around hyponatremia and things like that exactly yeah in fact I learned to love salt so I would actually find it kind of became a salt geek so I would find different salts with trace minerals and elements I fell in love with his Celtic sea salt that I found and it just felt like electricity put it in your mouth and I would actually just do you know teaspoons of that so I would do grams of salt I mean of course other things magnesium and potassium etc so without a doubt salt was a big part of it and then of course fat in you know whether it be a tablespoon of coconut oil or something else I would do that throughout yeah you were kind of far ahead I mean I think today most people if they're gonna be objective so let's dismiss all the sort of zealots on all sides of the equation but if you're gonna be objective there's no doubt that if you want to be an ultra distance athlete you have to be fat adapted now that doesn't mean you have to be in nutritional ketosis but you must be fat adapted you do not want to do these things with an RQ above about 0.75 to 0.8

[00:54:00] I feel like you sort of backed into that because there wasn't anyone to look to 15 years ago there weren't people doing this stuff we're talking about it the way there are today when did you figure that out and and what made that so clear to you there were a couple of things and you're right it was it was accidental I backed into it and it was through experimentation again just checking all your assumptions at the door there was this note back then there was this idea shouldn't run more than a marathon or two a year which at one point I was doing one a day and just as part of my training regime so what about this whole idea of carb loading really excites felt bloated and it didn't you know might performance the next day my heart rate and you know blood was still in my god and out so I met Rick for me often when I woke up the next day about weather and I was gonna run her train was my heart rate and my resting heart rate used to be 37 38 and if was ever above 40 I would just stay in bed it wasn't adapted and there was no point in and stressing myself further because I would break into overtraining well that in and of itself is pretty impressive because I'm guessing many people listening to this or thinking this guy's just a hammerhead he's just a robot but that takes I remember from my days the hardest decisions were the days when I pulled back on training that's right cuz that was like you're struggling with your own demons am I good enough am i

[00:55:17] I'm gonna stay in and not train today but my opponents out there training oh my god what am i doing but you this is almost where it helps to have a trainer that's right who you can outsource that decision to but you had the discipline to do that but after a lot of research so you know couple things you know I want to come back to fat adaptation and you know carb loading I learned so I had some fairly objective indicators that I would use to make decisions because I'm a big part of doing this consistently over time is just to be objective with yourself in my really in course record shape or am I just fooling myself and so what are the metrics what are your times time doesn't lie right time is objective your heart rate it's subjective it's a great metric to use horsepower if you're on the bike is the absolute and if you know you're at altitude there's some other things you can do in mountaineering to keep yourself in check and Mountaineers are the same way the very discipline if I'm not where I need to be by 2:00 p.m. I turn around its not summit day it's not gonna work is that that is important when I talk to those guys that have summited Everest especially those talked if you guys have done it repeatedly that actually impresses the hell out of live to climb another day yeah that it's that simple so I borrowed from mountaineering I'll get back to the the fat thing in a second because there were indicators early indicators in terms of just being in ketosis and what your body does over time to optimize endurance so mountaineering is actually where I learned about fat you know get back to that in a second so the carb thing didn't work for me right and

[00:56:46] I learned accidentally that you can actually fast and do better and feel better and feel cleaner and so I just started phasing things out right so I started phasing carbs out drank very little alcohol and very monastic lifestyle for a long time there I had no girlfriend lived in a little condo by the beach and just worked my tail off and trained and loved it was a very simple life no drama outside of just not maybe not feeling good about my run that day there's a very simple life engineered intentionally to be that way so I did learn that the traditional thinking was wrong and I also learned that the assumptions around what a human body could do were wrong and learned that through experimentation so back to the mountaineering thing so there's a great book called it's called fast and lighter moving fast and light there's a mountaineer and a marked white who's a batshit crazy

[00:57:44] Mountaineer who was doing all kinds of stuff in the 90s and I've always been intrigued by doing endurance stuff and in the mountains and there's guys not doing what I knew would eventually happen I came to it late and of course had a family decided risky my life wasn't worth it anymore but we knew that metabolizing your body is very different at altitude and actually taking a shot of oil at altitude was better than eating a bowl of spaghetti and it's written about and and that's where I learned sometimes it's better just to take a shot of olive oil never forget reading about this and I'm like I'm an experiment with that if they're doing this at altitude and it's working and it's actually helping them right first of all a little Nalgene vial of olive oil or flax seed oil to take in your pack if you're doing a non summit day to not have to carry a bunch of food you know from an energy density standpoint an energy dense way and your fat adapted and your body has a hard time metabolizing the fat and anything else at altitude and it's hard to cook at altitude which is another story so I learned that fat that's actually not bad and also learned there sugar is not good when you're doing long events because you know insulin response and you bonk and you know so sugar is great it's like a drug though right we mean it's chasing the dragon wants you to have your Twix at Mile 20 you're gonna want another one your your I'm your host your now you have now committed to a pure glycolytic strategy and you better have it timed perfect you and it is part of the strategy and you know and argue in terms of optimizing performance should be part of your strategy but you you only get one shot at it so if you're doing a hundred you better you know if it comes before my lady you better know what you're doing because after that I'll be know if you're gonna take a mountain Dew don't do it at Mile 20 because it is at that point all bets are off your body is now shifted into a completely different world and it's gonna want to stay in that world and you know that well so I came back from the Himalayas in OH - I spent a couple months over there in

[00:59:53] Tibet on Everest and we were eating yak meat which you can't cook at 25,000 feet and so I came back with just crazy parasites which I later learned in o3 and so the other part of this to answer your question about sort of backing into it is the only way I was gonna get rid of the parasites was to essentially go nuclear on my own body which meant like a 10-day fast I did the Eastern Western thing so I went to you know that's just disease this guy you know San Diego or

[01:00:20] UCSD and I said well how do we get rid of this stuff how do we each like I'm gonna give you some stuff and it's gonna be really hard on your body I need you to take it and I said what are the people doing for thousands of years because the tapeworms and other stuff has been a problem for a long time as you starve yourself just starve it starve it eventually you know get rid of it so I did both so I said give me the meds and I did the meds and I didn't eat for ten days so I just drank warm water every day didn't really train and did other crazy stuff that just completely cleanse myself and by day three day 1 and 2 was brutal by day 3 I just it's like my whatever a hundred and seventy degree vision went to I could see around myself right I could feel stuff I could smell stuff and it just turned into this journey it was of course fixed the problem got rid and

[01:01:14] I was I was developing exercise induced asthma I became allergic to certain foods and I was allergic to myself I was actually alert of course fighting these parasites but I didn't know it at the time all that went away in oh three by fasting and I felt better and so I backed in so I was obviously in ketosis because I started trained again by day seven I wasn't eating but I started training again and I felt fantastic and that's when I realized like holy cow like it was accidental but between the fad and understanding that that's a component of performance and then the fasting which was again just to get rid of parasites I realized I can actually perform even better throwing everything else out the window yeah it is amazing I actually didn't know that story about you I didn't know that you didn't have to do this 10-day I didn't even know about the whole parasite thing and those things really interesting because I I know a lot of people who have had that experience right they go off and they climb Kilimanjaro and they come back and they're never the same you know one of the people who was actually helping me and that trans Tahoe swim had just come back from Kilimanjaro and this person's kayaking one of my kayakers and I mean had to literally hop out of the KY I can take a [ __ ] in the water about every I don't know hour imeem devastated by these parasites but it's really interesting I mean I can it certainly strikes me as relatively low downside to at least give a trial attempt of fasting coupled with the medical therapy I mean certainly there's evidence to suggest that fast and coupled with chemotherapy can increase the efficacy of chemotherapy I mean this has been now actually demonstrated

[01:02:55] Valter Longo has talked about this quite a bit but you know Dom D'Agostino's been talking about this for at least five years now so I didn't know that about you I love that I feel like I know everything about you and yet I've already learned like six things about you two in the last hour that I didn't know let's close out the RAM story just cuz I again I'm to me your RAM exploits might be your second most impressive story we're going to come to the most impressive feat of them all in a moment but there was a really sad ending to robic wasn't there in fact there was a sad ending to robic and Bob Breedlove so

[01:03:27] Bob Breedlove died in Oh 5 on the RAM I was a few hours ahead of him these aren't I think at the time I did Everest it was 1 in 8 people would die so you're not talking about people are asking me about finished race there's death rates to some of these races so one and they died on Everest I don't know what the stats are today k2 is even worse cases like one in three or something crazy there's a few that are just and and that's you know it's why with young family I'm not you helped me a few weeks ago pull the tree down and I had my climbing gear out for the first time in 15 years right and swings around a tree

[01:04:03] I walk over and I see you with a chainsaw and a freaking 80-foot tree and I'm like it might you need a hand its first time I climbing here he's been out in a while so yet so robic unfortunately I had a fantastic performance number of years after we raced against each other and he died on a bike in Sylvania gosh it's been it's been a few years he was riding down a hill or he was riding down a as I understand it riding down a gravel road fire road or something in

[01:04:35] Sylvania and crossed the centerline and we ran into a car coming up and went over the top and him I mean I've been there I may have crashed several times and I just there are so many people I know that have died on bikes which is why I just don't ride as much anymore eventually it's just law of large numbers right you're out there enough something's gonna happen yeah I had that wake-up call in 2010 there's a guy named

[01:05:05] Nick Venuto I don't know if you knew Nick but he was the CFO at our company as the back when I was working a biotech company and amazing cyclist he actually won the mount palomar time trial a couple of times so for people who are around here and understand what mount palomar is it's basically ALP do as in terms of rise grade and you including the same number of switchbacks so it's a serious climb and every year there's a time trial and Venuto would win it and

[01:05:30] I'm run one afternoon I was leaving this was back when I was could call myself a cyclist and I was like buggering out earlier was like five o'clock because I wanted to go home and I had intervals to do that day and on that day I remember I had the luxury of calling an audible which was I could either do repeats on

[01:05:46] Torrey Pines which would be Hill repeats or I could go out to 56 on the bike path and do vo2 max repeats because it's not as steep you know you're only climbing like sort of 4% as you ride from Carmel Valley out the Poway and I just decided you know I'm gonna go ride Torrey Pines today so I did and I remember walking out my door cuz Nick and I opposed each other and I said and he was like he you know I know everybody says this about everybody he literally was the nicest dude on the planet I remember saying alright next see you later man and Nick used to ride to and from work every day he was such a devoted family guy that he just didn't want to waste time training outside of his commute and he lived far away so you know he'd get in like 40 miles a day training just on his commute he's riding home on the 56 bike path the same road I was gonna die could have been doing my intervals on and if I showed you where it happened it's the last place you think this could ever happen but a woman driving her SUV decides at that moment she's just got to check her cell phone and she drives up the embankment through the fence and hits Nick and kills him and I couldn't believe I mean I just you know to think like I was just with this guy two hours before and unfortunately that's just not an uncommon story like you know obviously since then have known of other cyclists ever died but I didn't know any as well as him and yet you know given what you've done you really know a lot of people who have met this horrible fate on a bicycle and a lot of times actually the cyclist is a hundred percent not at fault you know in the case of Nick's clay case I mean he's on a bike path nothing he could have done to prevent that that is a lightning strike you know to be hit from behind when someone veers off a freeway going 75 miles an hour and hits you I mean like you're done you're done and on a bike path that's per jacket you'd think that you know the worst you can do is make a mistake and go down or someone else on the bike will hit you which is probably non-lethal you know my brother who's a really good mountain biker the reason he's just so obsessed with being on a mountain bike he goes look here's the difference when I used to ride on the road if something bad was gonna happen statistically it was the driver's fault on a mountain bike when something bad happens it is always my fault that's right that's right and it's a broken collarbone or you know bokun arm it's not it's usually not lethal it's part of the reason why I don't ride as much as I did and I was hit actually similar driver

[01:08:08] I thought she saw me she looked right at me I don't know if the sunlight Sun was setting but I was also bike commuting leaving work and she accelerated right through me she had a stop sign she just rolled through it I was doing about 35 just just rolling down a hill and on there it was slow motion and you know

[01:08:27] I've had other accidents but that was probably the most mentally I mean that's when I bought my Compu trainer actually my wife got it for me because she just I just wouldn't get on the bike cuz I really thought she saw me and I couldn't hit my head and I couldn't move the right side of my body and I apparently was making this crazy noise sound just moaning on what year was this this was in oh it was Oh 607 and that's was when

[01:08:51] I mean it took me but she was absolute sweetheart about it I mean she was just devastated I mean I went over the hood and the back of her car and the bike went one way and I went the other and we were both you by then doing 40 and just you know I hit the pavement and rolled and and fortunately my wife was a mile away and call her and come get me and I tried to walk it off I was gonna try to ride home and I just literally was it shook me up it shook me up and after that I just said you know it's and I have to you know many deaths friends and guys like robic you know there's just said you know it's gonna happen eventually it's going to happen yeah by the way going back to the compy trainer you're probably one of the only people that's broke in a Compu trainer twice twice yeah the comp uter aider at this point is a resistance trainer and I've stopped replacing them and I just get on at this old Slocum stand which I've had powder guttered a couple times from sweat and rust and I used the first time I saw your kung fu trainer I was like dude what have you done to this thing why I have my contraption I've engineered for the PVC you know at the time it was a blackberry and computer stand and other stuff it's now an iPad holder and some of my contraption strapped in the front of it bracketed to the front of it for my screens so of all the incredible things you've done and as I you know as we become closer over the past five years

[01:10:17] I've gotten to know all of these things but you're so unassuming that I have to like pry them out of you but I don't know what it is about trans Iowa but when you finally told me about that I was blown away I think trans Iowa might be the most ridiculous feat in the history of cycling certainly as far as a one-day event goes so explain the motivation for that what the hell you did how fast you went like what would talk to me about trans Iowa what's right you know growing up in Iowa and having done the bike ride across Iowa RAGBRAI the registered annual great bike ride across Iowa many years I always you know asked myself how fast could you do this and one go even when I was a kid I'm like why are they stopping you know I get people drink at night and party and it's a fun time but why isn't anybody doing this in one push it's possible and so it's been on bucket list thing right a lot like hearing about Bob Breedlove in the 80s about RAM that was became a bucket list thing so

[01:11:16] RAM became a bucket list trans Iowa became a bucket list and and so no did Rama no for and lots of other stuff and decided that I could work at my own sort of attempt at trying to set her a speed record across Iowa it's where I'm from and it was a bucket list and so I got actually my ram crew chief was the official because they they're you know to be a rat to record the you MCA has to you have to have an official and he was you MCA official and my uncle best friend from high school and you know some couple other people crew me for it and it's a you know penny on your route you can pick her out and you know there's you MCA recognizes record attempts we looking at it's just a few simple criteria so I picked my route set my date and pick my official I'm a distance was what 270 so that you know 170 more 270 and change actually more climbing that you'd think most people think I was flat but it's not how many feet vertical

[01:12:13] I'd have to go back and look at the stats but several thousand feet of vertical so you start at one river and then at the other right one east to west and was able to do I didn't have to unclip it was pretty cool I there was a half way through some guys from construction on the road and the guy had a stop sign I got on one lane open I'd have stopped up and I waved him I just let me through forget the car behind me was my crew vehicle but let me through and he flipped it around and you know so

[01:12:42] I'd have to unclip for the entire state and managed to do in about ten hours and 40 ish minutes I can give you all the stats if you want but I did about 25 point seven miles an hour average a little tail when the star a crosswind it was beautiful day conditions were perfect you know in fact there were stormchasers out the night before there were tornadoes all over the place it was in May and so this was the lead-up to RAM oh five so this was a no five so it was a great so you start with a bit of a tailwind you and you got a cross one in the middle then you end up with about a tailwind right with it you got a head headwind ended with a headwind and I felt fantastic in fact I thought about continuing on and well let's go do the next state but you know it was it was a fun day I'll never forget looking down at my I had a polar heart rate monitor at the time and I just couldn't believe the numbers cuz I you know I've done coastal stuff training here right I'll ride up to

[01:13:40] Newport or whatever and do 1 days or 1 push rides with two water bottles don't stop don't unclip if you know less you have to but I looked down I was I just covered my home state and ten and a half hours and it was fun yeah I mean you didn't have a power meter at the time but I remember when I was time trialing

[01:13:59] I used to have so many models that I could basically estimate power by CD a wind speed velocity etc and I remember calculating you were probably doing about 310 watts to 320 watts for 10 hours and 40 minute that would have been your average power obviously you would have been flowed and I remember thinking wow we're in a different league here people like you know like you know you're really a professional cyclist at that point you're not really amongst the amateurs anymore well the metric and professional cycling is watts per kilo right so and you weighed what at that point 160 so that's what 72 kilos yeah I mean so you have to figure that if you were averaging 310 to 320 watts for ten and a half hours your FTP was probably very close to 380 ish maybe 400 watts I mean that's a professional level at least a non Ito professional level FTP meepo certainly probably gives you about a 10 to 15 percent boost on that if but you know like the best guys in the tour during the sort of more Ipoh driven eras were putting out I used to know this stuff so well I think they were putting out about six point three to six point four watts per kilo anything over five is five sort of the well five or if I couldn't is nice yeah if you can do five without drugs that's incredible and I and I that's kind of where I try and unintentionally cuz I you know I had no for me it was if this has always been sort of a sacred endeavour right I knew how to make money I didn't you know I to the extent that I needed to for RAM I had sponsors but for me I loved the product side of getting into clothing and other gear production and design but for me it's never been about monetizing it right so I you know been invited to join professional cycling teams and train with him and you know teams come out here or Arizona and it's never interested me it just was never something that I wanted to do that wasn't part of the deal for me it's always how good could I be and I knew the drug side of it as well on there something to happen it was there's a lot of drug use in RAM and in these sort of drug tested throughout I don't know I don't know if anyone else was it's one of those things where I think that so it's such an epic event I don't know what you would do because there's so many components to an optimal performance right so I don't know what drug you would do you me stimulants would eventually blow you up yeah I mean modafinil I mean I think modafinil is banned on wada and you sada but modafinil would certainly help what is that it's a drug that's approved it's only FDA indication is for narcolepsy but it's a non stimulant that keeps you awake actually a pretty interesting drug this was our drug of choice in residency we have used the [ __ ] out of this drug

[01:16:52] I was during residency taking two to 600 milligrams daily the maximum it has ever been tested at his 600 milligrams but in the airforce and they had done a study which is what the study that I clung to which was they put a bunch of pilots into a simulator flight simulator and so the placebo group has nothing and predictably over the course of 24 hours their performance declined so you know but not surprisingly and then you had like a caffeine group and their performance got a little bit better initially but then sort of petered out if not outright crashed by 24 hours and of course I could be completely mistaking some of the the details on this but this was the gist of it at 200 milligrams of madoff Annelle which is the standard dose performance was maintained for a very long period of time but at the end of the 24 hours it fell off but the thing that I always clung to was at 600 milligrams I think performance actually just got better monotonically over 24 hours and so I found this to be the most amazing drug in the world because basically in residency you're sort of sleeping about four hours a night on average but it never works out to that so it's like you'll have zero and then you'll have six and then you'll have seven and then you'll have zero and then you'll have three and then you know I mean and so being able to take modafinil was huge and you know modafinil has a number of interesting properties I don't really use it more than a few times a year these days I only really used around jetlag significant jetlag but it strikes me as being a pretty impressive drug again notwithstanding the fact that I'm pretty sure it's wada and you saw it it probably is but that goes back to the point that I had no desire to be professional because I didn't mean for me it was very simple which is natural performance and if you're augmenting with things like that it's just you're not answering your question right you throw into these are variables that are called unnatural and where do you stop IVs have always been sort of a disputed territory for ultra athletes

[01:18:48] I've never if you go into Venus you're done in my opinion right you should not need an RV that's not natural to me even if it's just saline doesn't matter a lot of people disagree with me and that's just my personal opinion there are a lot of guys that design their whole plan around being able to go into Venus and get you know oil change and and I haven't I mean that's just me it's just my own standard there are very few things I think drug wise that would you yeah Ram is a tough war amps a tough one because it's not it's not clear to me that EPA would help you that much in RAM it's not even clear to me that anabolic steroids would help as much as they do in the tour I mean I think EPO is a much more important factor in Grand Tours than even the anabolic steroids or the glucocorticoids or corticosteroids yeah yeah the stimulants I mean that used to be the drug of choice up until the about the 80s and professional cycling but as you pointed out I mean stimulants you better know when you're using them and for how long because it's you can fall off a cliff pretty quick yeah and I've seen guys do that I've seen guys do that and I've been part of a few studies that have tested down it's not Liberty

[01:19:55] Station and I think was the NTC down in Point Loma the Naval Hospital I participated in a few studies with Navy SEALs and they were testing different things and the seals and Special Forces they're on a whole cocktail right depending on what they're doing they're in transit they're taking one thing if they're getting ready they take something else and it should and methanol is a great drug it in that setting because when you consider that the alternative is stimulants with their horrible cycle oh you know well not to mention the psychological that means stimulants throw you right throw your judgment and do other things so I agree

[01:20:34] I agree you know I've never tried adderall even once all of them the time I've taken my def and I've never once tried adderall and yet I've talked to a lot of people who swear by low dose adderall for you know mental clarity like 10 milligrams or something like that but I don't know I just I don't feel like stimulants would sit well with my system yeah I didn't even know what adderall and some of the guys that software programmers on my team were trading at at all that's a few years ago like what do you what do you guys doing and we're gonna go outside I'll be back and and you know two hours later there's still a heads down a clearly I've seen it clearly I mean it's certain tasks it's works yeah I've seen I think that this low-dose adderall strategy for the right person can be remarkable again the question becomes frequency at what that's right has it become too much you know today when we were on the bike we were kind of talking about this a little bit but I remember when I was swimming a lot it's a very tight-knit community you know the weirdos who want to do really long swims or really long rides or really long runs or whatever but it became clear to me a few years into my swimming endeavors that most of the people I swam with were addicts were recovering addicts so they had they were former alcoholics they you know you know recovering drug addicts or things like that and I remember thinking this is so interesting like I'm the only non addict who does this amongst my peer group but

[01:21:57] I've come back and revisited that assumption and now realized that of course I am an addict and just because it's not alcohol or drugs doesn't mean I'm not and so it makes me wonder like what kind of person does this stuff what motivates them what are they numbing where's this coming from any of you and it's a philosophical question but if you ever sort of stopped and said what the hell drove you to do all of this stuff because at the risk of just being a little blunt like it ain't normal man like you ain't normal to do any of the [ __ ] we just spent the last hour talking about it's normal to me it's my normal no it's not it's not and I learned this on RAAM and I've never I haven't experienced it since but there's a sequence of mental states that I think you go through in these things and call it normal homeostasis and then you move to with sleep definite you move to illusions hallucinations people talk about that laugh about it they're funny but you're still with it and then you get truly delusional this is when your mentally insane there's a time on RAAM toward the later part of a four where I literally didn't know why this van was following me and I somehow concocted this whole story about being chased and somehow crafted that we were going by a power plant and I thought they were spies and I was truly delusional and I was paranoid and I would try to get away from him and I kept racing away from them and they're still following me and they're turning where I'm turning I'm like what the hell's going on and finally decided to get off the highway well I get off the highway and I'm in a cemetery in the middle of nowhere and I put my bike it's all I had to protect myself in between me and my crew and they followed me and this van is here and they get out and like what are you doing and they're like so you didn't recognize them even while I got out of the recognize them I was confused this is after six seven days and maybe an hour and a half two hours asleep

[01:24:01] I slept about the of my 10 ish hours the whole race one of the three hour block it's very end where I just shut down so I had very little sleep over six or seven days I was just I was losing it so it's not normal right and eventually came back and the next day in daylight like holy cow and I remember everything or more the whole episode and they're like we picked a freaking cemetery of all places to like peel off the road it was a cemetery and it what they were scared who is this guy what is he doing and then you know then finally he got to

[01:24:32] New Jersey and 60 miles from the finish and I had completely lost it and threatened to a dear friend of mine Howard whose massive college swimmer former college swimmer and I decided I was gonna get in a fight with him and he just he stuck his hand out and I thought I was gonna get into a fistfight with her and I was 160 and he was 220 and twice my size now you lose it yeah what's the but more deep-seated I think that's your question right what motivates this I started the marathon I was living in New York City actually living in Stamford Connecticut in 97-98 and I moved back from Europe and came to New York was working for Price

[01:25:13] Waterhouse and I was living with guys I went to school with you know they're Goldman Sachs and etc etc and they were bringing home a case of beer every night and I was sleeping on a couch because I was tired in New York City I just wanted to get out of New York and so he crashed on their couch and Stanford I was always on the road and after a week of those guys bring in beer home every night I'm like this isn't what I want to do so I needed an excuse so believe or not for me and by the way when you're on the couch you can't get away so these guys would sit and watch TV and drink beer and five guys sitting around you know living like the earlier they were in college taking the train into New York you know every morning to 5:30 and just doing the drill so I it was actually an escape for me so

[01:25:57] I started turning for the meet 98 New York Marathon in the spring of 98 and that was my excuse sorry I can't drink I'm got to get up and run in the morning and that's what I did so that's how it all that's how it all started it right around the same time was going through a brutal breakup with my college sweetheart and I think that was the second component of it right had no desire to socialize and just wanted to get back to some foundation that I could find for myself so a lot of transition so I'd say you know running away from his stuff is where it started and then of course it evolved to you know once I did my move to Chicago did the Chicago

[01:26:36] Marathon then did New York which was my goal did in New York as Batman in 98 it blasts freakin blast running just did no didn't worry about time just had a good time but then realized that you know I could actually pull off some decent times it's not that hard I've hardly trained for this and I did well by my standards and so that's when I moved to San Diego in 99 as I said you know I'm gonna get serious about this and really focus on it obviously what what do you think about it's a big question I get what do you think about when you're out there for so long and I've do you get bored and I've never gotten bored and for me you know you and I have I think similar backgrounds right we working class families who care deeply for us but we've also had a lot of stuff happened to us over time you know for me it's always been a time to work through stuff and just think about things both past and present and so it's been very meditative for me and unfortunately and I've learned over time to somewhat mitigate this but it's where

[01:27:39] I found my happy place right I'll never forget I just saw this a couple years ago in my application for bad water in 2004 the 2001 bad water why do you want to do bad water and I said I love ultrarunning and you know follow-up question is is why and you know it's the only time I feel normal and I like to feel normal I feel normal when I'm out there doing that stuff it's just it feels right right or wrong that was my comfortable spot now at least going back to that time what felt abnormal when you weren't running probably the biggest thing that felt unnatural maybe not abnormal is I just I've never been terribly social I never when I moved to

[01:28:23] San Diego I you know I I like to build stuff I like to challenge myself and I just didn't fit in in New York I didn't fit in out here and I liked just pushing myself and that was abnormal that was unusual and I would have people ask me all the time about the sacrifice that I was making to do what I do and my response has been it's a privilege to do what I do I love doing what I do it's fantastic it's not a sacrifice if it was a sacrifice I wouldn't be doing it so that's in my mind abnormal and this is and I don't judge people right I mean I don't judge people for not doing this but it's just I don't choose a path of accepting that I have certain limitations and certain things aren't possible I think that's [ __ ] I just refuse to accept that certain things are not possible because most of the time it they're wrong it's amazing I mean you you know people listen to this who obviously don't know you won't necessarily appreciate some of the the nuance in this but and obviously I won't mention names but one of my favorite stories is there's a piece that came out about you and vogue men's vogue I don't know god it's got to be 12 13 years ago and it's an amazing piece we'll make sure we link to it in the show notes here and it's amazing like it's a really great piece that gets into it and one of my favorite stories is how on the the day of the Oscars that year you get a call from someone basically saying hey so-and-so wants to invite you up to be her guest at the Oscars tonight and it turned out to be like one of the biggest a list actresses of our generation and you just decided now I don't want to go and I'm thinking you remember you told me this story I was like oh my god I would have freaking walked to LA backwards or on my hands and knees just to have had a chance to have met her let alone have been on her arm all night but you just don't care I love it yeah I don't care I wish I could say I didn't care you believe it or not I out of everything that I considered in that and I think I mentioned this to you when

[01:30:33] I first I just told you this story recently although it was written about years ago it's someone that knew my mom knew how to get to me that's how the introduction came in talking through it and I just don't want to go to LA I do not want to go to LA I don't want to do the drive to LA that is I don't if it were here sure I'd no big deal I'm not doing anything today but it might be fun but I don't want to deal with that but you know I think a big part of the mindset my mindset at the time was I was really good at saying no I'm not so good at that now I say I say yes to a lot of things and at a detriment to time with my family or kids but at the time I was very disciplined about saying no if it wasn't on the critical path I wouldn't do it and I was very focused and I was just great at saying no in fact there was a time there for months where I just told my family I'm busy I don't want to talk to you I don't want to communicate with you I'm gonna be laser-focused and

[01:31:35] I want to eliminate every potential distraction I can and at the time that for me would fell into that category it was just a distraction when do you think you made that transition to you know today your priorities are clearly between mostly two things your family first your company second you obviously still exercise much more than the average individual could ever fathom but you know you're not trying to set world records anymore what led to that transition was it simply meeting your wife it was my wife yeah yeah this I mean there's a funny story here I met or didn't meet but saw my wife two years before I formally met her and I thought she was an angel right I saw her and like oh my gosh this is the woman of my dreams but I was training for an that was the end of that didn't even talk to her may have walked by her office once or twice and that was the energy she was also an engineer she's yeah yeah she was a she's electrical engineer and at the time was that Qualcomm and so sorry love at first I didn't talk to her and I'm relatively shy I not a big fan of hitting on that wasn't my deal so a couple years went by and we were both in the spin room a couple years after that

[01:32:54] I had a cast I had shattered my elbow training you know six training for RAM and had reconstructive surgery and had a cast that had drilled holes in her so it's from my arm hit all the way down to my wrist and I was drilling holes in it so I could shower with this cast never had pins and wire and crap in my left elbow and she came in and I had a pull of sweat and say I'd gone in I was doing 12-hour I couldn't ride outside with my cast it was too dangerous but I was even 12-hour sighs well our sessions on a spin bike in the Qualcomm training room and I had gallons of water there towels of course and carrots and celery that was my nutrition for the fiber and so and a stack of DVDs I was there at 3:00 she rolls in it six or seven and at that point I think I'd take my shirt off and was just hammer and write I was not expecting anyone to come in on a

[01:33:49] Saturday and so I throw my shirt back on and she gets on a spin bike and it was it's a fun story but I won't tell it now but it was her right so I met her and we eventually went on a day and she and her dad furnace creek 508 were my crew on the furnace creek 508 later that year she got me I mean I I went we went to Hawaii shortly after we met and

[01:34:13] I ran a poly a cola so I ran from PI a at the beach up to the top of Haleakala on the last day of our stay and this is six weeks after we met and like she gets me she crewed me in the middle of the night running whatever forty miles up to top of you know this volcano I Hey all right this she's the one we decided to get married after our third date so that she changed I mean it was I'm done yeah you know I'd answered the question most of the big questions I still had some bucket list things but you know where do you draw the line right so I it really comes down to the tree I found myself asking the question what am i doing so I'd be out in East County doing my 300 miles training for I did the UMC a 24 hour race that fall and in training for that for the first hump I had never asked myself that question what am i doing out here it's kind of like Forrest

[01:35:07] Gump when he's running back and forth across the country and he sort of stops and realizes he's done yeah it was bad and I that was my last ride in East County that you know 10 12 years ago like I asked myself that question and I knew I was done because I wanted to be with her and so it was that simple so

[01:35:28] I'm gonna let you get back to your day and I got a hundred things to do today you got three great kids you are a man that I admire greatly you've created a tribe where you don't have to leave I mean you can you know get to work from here you get to play with the kids you get to be with the kids most nights obviously you'd if they still have to travel because you're still running a startup company but what do you take from all that stuff you learned about being at the you know right at that level of being among the world's elites ultra distant athletes how do you bring that how do you bring what you learned from that to your your ability to be a dad or maybe asked another way what do you take from those experiences that you want to impart on your kids that's a tough one because I I only learned what

[01:36:15] I learned because as I figured it out on my own and so I want to expose the kids to stuff and let them take to whatever they take to I want them to know I want them to be proud of their dad and their mom you know we liked my wife played college basketball and still holds records here in San Diego for shooting percentage etc so I want the kids to be proud of their parents but at the same time like I don't want them to feel like they're they live in our shadow I try not to go to the pool I know a lot of the coaches from my prior life so I don't want the kids to get special treatment because they're the the spawn of me and so I try to actually coach them right now they're a my twins are eight my sons three have fun it's really pretty simple have fun I hated hated wrestling and I grew to love it when I was in high school I hated it when I was their age but did your parents make you what go through to get you through that transition to make me but it was more pure right in Iowa if you're not wrestling something's wrong with you I mean I started wrestling when

[01:37:17] I was five I thought it was ridiculous why are these guys crawling all I mean this is just crazy who are you wrestling is smelly and I just didn't you know didn't wasn't into it and then and then I grew to love it when I got stronger and I saw the strategy in it and loved wrestling in high school but I grew to love it at my own pace and so for me right now at the kids I don't take a lot other than just hey guys you may not you know when a lot of us just nutrition in lifestyle that's the biggest thing that I try to bring to them is this whole notion you don't need to carb-load you know I'll make them this morning before my son when twists with me you know it gave him some dry nuts and some cherries and my daughter's off for the rest of the day and so a lot of it comes to nutrition in terms of the things that

[01:38:05] I've learned it really comes down to adversity and hard work I mean like you said we live in Nirvana I've really tried hard to create an environment for my family that is they can feel safe secure they can explore but I want them to see you saw me out with a chainsaw for a reason first of all I love Jason yeah you're the only friend I have who drops more wood than me if I thought I was the wood chopping socal like no one in San Diego could be chopping more wood than me but I will say this in the last four weeks you have broken me you've taken it to a new level and until four weeks ago I had no idea you even chopped wood yeah we need to take a picture of my pile right now yes

[01:38:46] I want the kids for me I really want the kids to see that Hardwar comes in many forms its physical its mental etc and I want them to see the perseverance lead by example and we live in this society where everything gets out sourced and it seems to be like I'll let other people do the work for you look it like you mentioned I you know we run a small company there's 15 of us now but I take out the garbage and I run the company and I'll do that until the day I die and

[01:39:15] I want my kids to see that too I don't think there's you know whether it's Iowa background or you know I think we were cut from the same cloth that way nothing is beneath me well you know I fully believe in scaling through people and all that great stuff when it comes to running a company but at the same time when it comes to my kids I want them to see that dad will roll up his sleeves and whether it's cutting down a tree taking care of the yard or taking care of the house whatever it might be

[01:39:42] I'm just putting new faucet in yesterday because like why are you down there because I'm fixing the faucet yeah you're so far I mean I wish I had that desire discipline whatever like you know I've just taken this opposite approach and I do worry deep down that it's in the long run it's not the right thing for my kids because I grew up around a dad who did everything yeah my dad didn't do anything I so interesting my dad my dad was the handiest dude that ever loved my dad fix anything he couldn't fix anything it was a joke still at his joke with our family and he it's funny he comes out here now and he's clearing brush with me so and he loves it and I love it but the kids will make their own decisions of course we could hire someone to put a new faucet in but I want them I want them I first of all I enjoy the accomplishment and sense of pride if say I just did that and enjoy tinkering around the house but it's good for the kids to see the biggest thing for me with the software company has been in terms of taking the lessons from endurance and so that my family and my company are like my two families right and never give up it's that simple right and we've taken a lot of different paths to get to success for my training and my endurance accomplishments our family we've done a lot of different things to try to architect the best situation for our family and we've done the same thing with my company you know and I sit on the board of a few companies as well and my only advice is don't give up it's that simple when training you don't give up a lot of it nears you get a lot of adversity but don't give up it's usually the person that keeps moving if you don't win the race you'll finish the race so just keep moving but there's something more to it right there's this intelligence like you knew the days that you need it to back off and I suspect that your greatest asset outside of your mental toughness which I just there's just no way to displace that or there's there's no substitute for just the raw mental toughness but I think it's that you've been for example very fortunate in your career to not have many significant injuries you've had one arthroscopic knee operation I mean there's nothing they like yank that little tiny sliver of meniscus off it for a guy who's run tens of thousands of miles and has done all you've done you know you've got a broken collarbone from a bike crash you've got a broken elbow from a bike crash you got a little meniscal nubbin that got cleared pretty quickly I think part of that is just the intelligence with which you've been able to approach this which is like you sort of know what are the days to push what are the days to back down and to me that's the thing that like if that if that knowledge can be codified that's probably the thing that people would benefit from greatly right if you're listening to this and you're thinking how am I going to run a marathon well

[01:42:23] I'm you know the VP of operations at whatever company I'm at or I'm the single mom who's trying to figure out how to get two kids off to school and back while working 40 hours a week but I still want to set these physical goals like you got to be able to train smart everything you do has to be Purpose

[01:42:40] Driven yeah I'm gonna read a text I got late last night hey Mike quick question today was meant to be 20 per higdon that's how Hague didn't who fantastic marathon coach puts together training plans didn't realize that I'd be climbing a lot super awesome although after I only got 12.5 in should I go pound more flat f it I'm also running out of time and my you know response to him is the general rules to stick the plan even if you didn't get all miles as scheduled in other words don't try to make it up and he's a guy training for his first marathon he's up in San Francisco a good friend of mine so I've learned through mistakes if I push too hard if I try to make up miles for example I'll blow up how do you codify that I mean a lot of us just it's just you voracious appetite for information and researchers fan the literature is there the information is there it may not be in context right so

[01:43:31] I've learned a lot about running and fat adaptation etc through mountaineering and cycling through other so there's it's there it just needs to be translated I mean you and I are huge fans of richard fineman and if you look at what firemen did with the whole Challenger investigation bringing together a cross-functional team of engineers and physicists etc in terms of problem solving and scientific reasoning the best approach is a cross-functional world-class expert team because you've think outside the box and you bring other ideas from other domains so then codifying it comes down to don't limit yourself to just thinking about a marathon or whatever think you know look at yourself and be objective and figure out what it's going to take to achieve whatever you define as success if you're a VP of ops of whatever company and you want a marathon you want a 5k look around you the informations there the resources are there I mean so much that's the thing right you we talked about this when I used to ride out east in the desert I would print out maps scan from a atlas and then I'll put him in a ziplock bag to keep him dry from my sweat and I would literally that was my navigation I would chart out my 300 miles my 400 Mahler's it's so easy now to get information perhaps too easy because when you have to do no work for it sometimes I think it's you're more vested so in terms of translating some sort of general rules don't be afraid to ask questions my friends asked me I coach a lot of people informally today and it's generally you don't overthink it I mean all I definitely think there's something to be said for looking at the data and analyzing etc unless you're looking to break a world record don't be too hard on yourself and just get out there and have fun

[01:45:15] I'm sustainable you are very data light these days you know we were out riding this morning and lamenting the heat and how slowly we were riding relative to what we would like to and I was like these power meters they never lie to you you know just once I want this thing to lie to me and tell me I'm better than I am today and you're like dude I don't have a power meter I don't have a heart rate monitor I'm just out here having fun and I was like you know why the hell do I have a power meter I don't compete anymore I don't do this I get off yeah why do I have this data yeah artifacts of the past I I don't even have a speedometer on my bike I mean I have my phone in my pocket for emergencies buried it's not even tracking me yeah next we're gonna ride Saturday so you and I ride once a week this has been kind of an amazing tradition you've got me back on the bike I took a 3-year hiatus and I've really enjoyed our

[01:46:07] Sunday morning rides we only ride 40k we're at 40k and you listen to me rant the entire time I love everything but the only reason is if I were granting I couldn't keep up with you so it's like I have to have to let you do the talking so that you know it can normalize this a little bit so I can keep up no but it'sit's awesome the last thing I'll say is and this is going to be disappointing to the listeners because I'm not gonna let the cat out of the bag but you are the guy who has introduced me to the greatest beer in the history of beer and this was probably four years ago I came over to your place one day and you gave me one of these things and I was like yeah I don't really like beer then you're like yeah just try this I mean that was the moment the rat hit the lever and got the cocaine I was like this is from another planet this this isn't beer this is all that [ __ ] I thought I hated you know Coors Light and

[01:46:59] Budweiser and every IPA on the planet like that I just find disgusting this was a different animal and to this day even though I don't drink much I might have one bottle a month including right now I just fetched one as we were sitting here talking it's hard to put in words how good this stuff is and I don't if you know this but I mean you probably do know this so once you introduce me to said beer I don't do anything in modern raishin so I wanted to make sure I could get enough of it for us so I had one of my analysts start looking around the country to find that kids at the time you were only getting it in Belgium right yeah I was I was bringing this into the country as yeast samples I was ordering it online and the first shipment came as a box of yeast samples which is I guess what they did I ordered it online right and as you said the euro a bottle it was not cheap that's not cheap and you've since you know I've traveled to Belgium to experience this firsthand it's a great beer and so I had

[01:47:59] Nick Stenson who was at the time and still and still actually is working for me and I was like and making figure out anything like he's just like a savant of figuring stuff out and I was like Nick can you figure out if we can get this beer in the United States two days later he calls me goes alright 13 bottles up at this liquor store in Alameda

[01:48:17] California 42 bottles in this place in New Jersey boom he rattles off the whole country and he's like so how many do you want I was like I'm not sure I understand the question he's like well which of these ones do you want and I was like all of them every single one 260 bottles of this stuff arrived and you know that lasted us for a couple of years he did it did and I've been fortunate I have stockpiled because the last shipment I got for you was about what six months ago we got youtube us six months ago so the cellar is full of this beer and every other beer this

[01:48:54] Brewer makes and they're all fantastic like there's any can we give the listener a bone I can't I don't want to name this beer because honestly I mean not to sound like a dick but I just I'm not gonna be happy if we can't get this beer anymore and I'm worried that it's such a limited beer that if I say what it is I'm never gonna get to drink it again so I'm just gonna have to be a selfish jerk can we name the brewery and not screw ourselves or what people figured out we can't name what I love about the brewer the brewery in Belgium they're truly authentic they just don't give a [ __ ] right so they're just here low volume they do all these crazy runs they experiment they try different things they have some of their do like 300 bottle runs they're just they tinker and it's fantastic and it's also bad everything I share anything of its some of its not all of its great it's a couple sours that I just don't care for it might a fan of those but yeah from strong Belgian ales do you know quads and everyone I've introduced it to has just been blown away you don't have to be a beer drinker you know you don't have to be a guy who even likes alcohol like there's just something about this that's so good so so here's the bone I think we can throw people in one of our droughts a couple of years ago when we were between like being able to find more of this stuff you introduced me to a beer that I think we can share with the general population that I honestly is 80% is good it's close it's not special but it's fantastic it's a great mass production beer I agree with you and that would be

[01:50:26] Judgment Day Judgment Day lost a job is a sin San Marcos California brewery Judgment Day is up there so it's a strong Belgian quad as they call it there are a few others shimei grand reserve and others but the Judgment Day is it's a local brewery it's the closest thing that's right there are a few and

[01:50:46] I've come at it from a few different directions to try to find something similar to our favorite judgment days in judgment there's a few other you know cask aged Judgment Day equivalents that the lost a be put out that are fantastic but it a little too smoky or a little too oaky etc say judge my face it is it's dense it's a dense strong 10 plus percent alcohol all you need is one yep you know and I find it to be the best beer when there are a lot of people over because hey I'm not gonna drink any other beer it's so gross and B I'm not sharing our special one that's just yeah that's I've made the mistake it's funny

[01:51:29] I shared this beer with one other friend and he's not a beer drinker either and he he said nah none I drink wine and I gave him this beer and he had to be thinking oh my god that's two of my beers gone well and now he's gonna go and get more yeah I didn't go I have stuff dating back dating back to the early 2000 so I actually have a stockpile of age really good stuff so I

[01:51:56] I'm completely out by the way hi how are you none I gave you my last batch cuz I was so grateful for all the help you've given me yeah you can have one I got my one for the month today so they went and bought up everything they could find and I've learned if I want to share it I take off the leg off the label it's other in the world's supposed to be the world's best beer and I forget the name of it in Belgium it's easier to get than this now alright so for the listener oh and here's another little point I was at

[01:52:28] BevMo this week totally opportunistic I pulled in I was looking for like a credit union that I needed to go open an account in blah blah blah and as I got there's a BevMo here I'm gonna go get some more lost a because that's where I used to get the Judgment Day and I go in and they don't have it and they're like yeah we're not carrying it anymore it's not profitable enough I'm like what the hell is wrong with you people who cares how profitable it is it's the greatest freakin mass-produced beer in the history of civilization so now I'm sweating it are we gonna be able to struggle to get Judgment Day so what we need to do is go up to the brewery that's what we need to do and we'll just fix that maybe if enough people are listening to this and they can repeat the demand we're not gonna BevMo we might start stocking it again and it's relatively cheap I mean it's it's ten bucks for a magnum basically yeah pine or whatever it whatever that size is it's cheap cheap well Mike we've talked about what I consider some of the most ridiculous feats of human endurance along with probably the most ridiculous feat of beer engineering in the same discussion if people want to learn more about you unfortunately you are a hard guy to learn about a Google search of your name yields almost nothing is there anything you want people to know about you Rita but we're gonna figure out a way to find that vogue article which i think is great we'll link to a page that you have that talk you know that kind of lists out some of these things that you've done is there anything else people can do to learn about you no I'm just go to Peter's website well I used every website years ago we've tweaked that to just be a landing page but I at this point go to Peter's website well maybe one day when you sell indigenous your current company you know after you take a little hiatus and really relax maybe you'll reconsider this idea of forming a coaching company because I think in many ways you actually have the perfect skill set right which is you're a software engineer who knows how to build huge products that can be scaled and more importantly you bring an expertise to this field that nobody has and I don't know I get the sense that there are people out there who would really value being able to access your brain to help them accomplish their goals so maybe we'll plant that seed here today maybe all right man thank you very much and I wish you the best on the remainder of this smokin hot day and saying thank you you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog and the nerd Safari at Peter attea MD com what's a nerd so far you ask just click on the link at the top of the site to learn more maybe the simplest thing to do is to sign up for my subjective lean on lame once a week email where I'll update you on what I've been up to the most interesting papers I've read and all things related to longevity science performance sleep etc on social you can find me on Twitter Instagram and
