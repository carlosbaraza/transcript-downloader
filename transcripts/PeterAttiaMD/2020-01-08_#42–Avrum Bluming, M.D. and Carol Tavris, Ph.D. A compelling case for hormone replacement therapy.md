## Description

Original release date: 2/25/19

In this episode, Avrum Bluming, hematologist, medical oncologist, and emeritus clinical professor at USC, and Carol Tavris, social psychologist and author of Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me), discuss their collaboration on their recent book, Estrogen Matters. Their book takes on the very polarizing and confusing topic of hormone replacement therapy for women suffering with symptoms of menopause. In many ways, the story and history of HRT is in striking parallel to the bad science that led up to the dietary guidelines being set forth in 1980. Carol and Avrum make a compelling case that most women benefit greatly from being on postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy, and can do so without increasing their risk of breast cancer. We also cover the history of HRT, the impact of the Women’s Health Initiative, and take a deep dive into each of the clinical conditions for which HRT should be considered, such as cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disease, and osteoporosis, to name a few.

Dr. Bluming has graciously offered his email to take questions directly from fans of this podcast: avrumzbluming@gmail.com

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast featuring Dr. Avrum Bluming and Dr. Carol Tavris discussing hormone replacement therapy (HRT):

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode explores the controversial topic of hormone replacement therapy for women, particularly focusing on the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study and its impact on HRT prescriptions. The guests challenge the widespread belief that HRT increases breast cancer risk and discuss its potential benefits for heart disease, bone health, and cognitive function. They present evidence suggesting that the WHI study's interpretation and communication led to unnecessary fear of HRT, potentially causing harm to women's health.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Estrogen levels plummet to 1% of pre-menopausal levels during menopause [23:48]
- Women are 2x more likely to die of Alzheimer's than men [23:26]
- HRT can reduce heart disease risk by up to 50% [25:15]
- Approximately 40,000 women die annually from hip fracture-related complications [1:34:38]
- The WHI study showed no statistically significant increase in breast cancer risk [52:48]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Consider HRT within 10 years of menopause onset [1:29:30]
- Discuss individual risk factors with healthcare provider [1:44:03]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Women with pre-existing cardiovascular disease should exercise caution with HRT [1:30:13]
- Women without a uterus only need estrogen replacement [1:31:24]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:

Medications mentioned:
- Premarin (conjugated equine estrogen) [1:39:44]
- Bioidentical hormones [1:40:13]
- Progesterone (synthetic and bioidentical) [1:41:30]

5. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Calcium score for cardiovascular risk assessment [1:31:24]
- CT angiogram for vascular health [1:31:24]
- Bone mineral density testing [1:34:38]

6. **Notable Quotes**:
"The more you know, the less you fear" [2:18:49]
"We don't know what cancer is" [17:48]

7. **References & Resources**:
Book: "Estrogen Matters" by Avrum Bluming and Carol Tavris
1991 New England Journal of Medicine article by Goldman and Tosteson [25:15]
Women's Health Initiative publications (2002, 2003, 2004) [1:20:13]

8. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are the specific mechanisms by which estrogen protects against Alzheimer's disease?
2. How do different forms of progesterone compare in terms of safety and efficacy?
3. What role might genetics play in determining individual response to HRT?
4. How does the timing of HRT initiation affect outcomes across different organ systems?

The episode provides a compelling critique of the WHI study and makes a strong case for reconsidering HRT as a valuable therapeutic option for many women, while emphasizing the importance of individualized risk assessment and shared decision-making.

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic

[00:01:04] I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming

[00:01:23] I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our show's members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:28] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level it makes sense for you I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription this week I had the pleasure of interviewing two people doctor Avram blooming and dr. Carol Tavis and if Carol's name sounds familiar to you it's because it should I've spoken about her often as she is the author of one of my absolute favorite books mistakes were made but not by me and if you haven't read it I recommend you hit pause now go and buy it come back

[00:04:34] Carol's a social psychologist and an overall great skeptic her collaborator in this project which we'll get to is dr. Avram Blooming who's a hematologist medical oncologist and an emeritus clinical professor at USC he's also formerly a senior investigator at the National Cancer Institute the book we discussed today is their most recent project a book called estrogen matters which has its name suggests is a book about hormones in particular it's a book about hormone replacement therapy in women now I realize at this moment about half the people listening to this ie those of you who are guys are thinking do I really need to listen to this episode and the short answer is I think you do at the very least if you know a woman or care about a woman you should be listening to this episode why because in many ways this topic has created as much confusion and generated as much bad information as any topic in medicine and yes I am including nutrition science which is the absolute bottom of our understanding of science and the sort of parallels between the story of HRT and the nutritional guidelines in the 70s and 80s is almost uncanny and that comes across during this interview when Carol and Abram tell a story that I had either forgotten or didn't know the book is written in I think a very clear way and I do recommend that anyone who is interested in this topic you know not just take our word for it in this episode but instead get the book and go through the references I spent a lot of time utilizing my team to help prepare for this interview because as familiar as I am with this topic and I think I'm more familiar with this topic than most physicians I still felt the volume of information was just so great that I wanted to make sure

[00:06:24] I had gone back and read all of the studies in preparation for this and in many ways I'm glad I did because it allowed us to really get into some of the details here and hopefully do so in a way that isn't confusing for you but rather at least opens the door to your thinking about this this is a very polarizing topic it is almost a religion so you will see that there are people on both sides of this that are pure zealots and unfortunately that just makes it that much more difficult to sort of interpret the literature on this but in the end you will have to be the judge of this it is certainly my view and I don't hide that view anymore that most women do benefit from being on post menopausal hormone replacement therapy but not all women do and I think one of the challenges for physicians and patients alike is trying to stratify which patients will receive much more benefit than the risk that's posed to them and of course perhaps as importantly identifying the patients for whom the risk is outweighed they're always disproportionate rather to the benefits the interview largely covers the subject material covered in their book which is to say the history of hormone replacement therapy the impetus for the

[00:07:37] Women's Health Initiative a very serious critique of not just the initial publication but the subsequent publications and then a little bit of a deep dive into each of the clinical conditions for which hormone replacement therapy should at least be considered and of course I think the most important of these is in not just cardiovascular disease which gets a lot of attention but a neurodegenerative disease and I think avram makes a very compelling case for that so without further delay here's my interview with dr. Avram blooming and dr. Carol Tavis before we get to this week's episode I want to remind everyone that one of the benefits of being a subscriber is a discount program that we've created now the purpose of this was to take the money that companies have offered to pay for advertising and say look instead of doing that I'd rather just talk about the companies that have products that I love and use without being paid to do so and say take that money that you would have given us in advertising and pass that on to discounts as listeners so the first ones coming out this Wednesday and if you're not a subscriber yet that's okay you've got plenty of time to sign up head on over to Peter Atia MD com forward slash subscribe where you can have access to this discount and future discounts and now let's get to this week's episode with Carol and April guys thank you so much for making the trip down from LA today we're happy to do it this is one of the topics that I have been meaning to explore so deeply over the past two or three years through what was originally going to be a multi-part blog post and a number of other things and there always was a reason not to do it and then you and I spoke about a year ago Carol and I said Carol I'd love to interview you about mistakes were made and your response was I can't talk about that book anymore I'm so tired of it all

[00:09:31] I want to do is think and you know think about this new thing that I'm really excited about which is estrogen matters and I must admit I was embarrassed at that point to acknowledge I didn't realize you had been working on it even though I had read the paper that you guys had written in 2009 which we were talking about a few minutes ago so it was sort of an aha moment for me and I was delighted because I thought well you're gonna do a much better job than I would have done you know because you're gonna put so much more work into it so I guess for the listener that's not familiar with you Carol let's start with you Carol you're a psychologist social psychology social psychologist what's a social psychologist writing about estrogen for my lifelong interest has been in bringing good scientific research in psychology and medicine to public attention and as you well know this is an effort that is not always greeted with Azaz and Cheers and thank you ever so much for showing us that our beliefs are wrong and our time to be replaced but it's my lifelong quest and that's what I do and that's of course what mistakes were made but not by me was about why it is that people resist new information that is better to know that it's beneficial that improves our knowledge and that's been my life work and as a social psychologist I have always been interested in the barriers to critical thinking and the reasons that people do not accept information when it is in their best interest to do so so knowing Avram blooming for as many years as I have we have discussed over the years how our shared interest is in medicine and mine and psychology reflect the same concerns what happens when research calls into question some established belief that is widespread in our society you know I know I've told you this before but I'll repeat it that mistakes were made but not by me as would certainly be in the list of the three books I have recommended and/or gifted the most and in fact I remember reading it and just somehow finding out how to get ahold of you and just calling you and emailing you and inviting you over for dinner it was you must have thought that was the weirdest thing ever not at all I was very flattered and pleased by the way and by the way this work on estrogen that Avram has so excited me about could be a chapter in that book it actually is as are other things that we have discussed for example dietary recommendations and things like that that I know you have contemplated going back on and thinking about that so from what about you I tell us a little bit about your your background your training as a clinician and and why in particular this issue has become something that's resonated with you I'm a medical oncologist I've spent over 50 years as a medical oncologist and my reason for going into the field was to help people live as long and as well as possible enlisting them helping to decide how best they should be treated and breast cancer constitutes about 60% of my practice and I've watched the progress in breast cancer very happily noting how many people we now cure and in fact our early breast cancer now is about 90 percent curable and I found that while I was making a lot of people better in terms of the cancer I was making them worse in terms of the symptoms associated with the treatments they got and when you treat something for that long you want to understand what it is so that you can treat it most effectively and first let me say at the beginning I'm a medical oncologist and I don't yet know what cancer is and I'm in very good company because I don't know anybody who knows what cancer is even though many will tell you they do and they're wrong and so it was important that I challenge every assumption on which my practice was based and I've done that continuously and the major assumption dealing with breast cancer is that estrogen causes breast cancer and it doesn't and almost everything we've done in the treatment of breast cancer is based on that assumption so that women have been denied estrogen for at least the last 30 years but especially since 2002 and the result is that many women have been hurt by being denied that medicine so let's take a step back in history now because in your 2009 paper it's actually the second table I was actually reviewing it again this morning it's a beautiful time course of hormone replacement therapy in women so I'll let you guys decide how you want to tell the story together but let's go back to at least the 1940s of the 1950s how did this idea of hey women go through a pretty abrupt withdrawal of hormones let's take a moment to think about how we can make that better how did that idea come about I think to give us perspective let's compare men and women the number of women with breast cancer in the

[00:14:53] United States is approximately comparable on an annual basis to the number of men with prostate cancer the number of women who died of breast cancer each year is also approximately comparable to the number of men who die of prostate cancer we like simple answers all of us and to think that testosterone is responsible for prostate cancer and estrogen is responsible for breast cancer is a very simple way to go about dealing with this and what we found is metastatic cancer of the prostate was initially treated with castration if testosterone causes prostate cancer taking off the testicles eliminates that testosterone and in fact it helps doesn't cure but it helps in some cases similarly we castrated women estrogen is made in the ovaries if we remove the ovaries we can cause breast cancer to regress once it has spread and it does help not in many cases but in a significant number it helps as far as cancer of the prostate is concerned that's where we've stopped if castration didn't help we did what we could to palliate with breast cancer what we did if castration didn't help we went on and removed the adrenal glands of women now the adrenal glands make a small percentage of circulating estrogen and by the way they also make a small percentages of circulating testosterone we never remove the adrenal glands of men we remove the adrenal glands of women and as you know there are hormones made by the adrenal gland that are necessary for survival so once you remove the adrenal gland you have to replace the hormones that were necessary for survival and we did that if the adrenal gland removal didn't work we then would take out the anterior pituitary gland at the base of the brain because that gland produces a hormone that stimulates either the ovary or the testicle to make the responsible hormone and so we used to do hypothesis Tamizh and while I was in practice we did that and as you know the anterior pituitary makes many hormones that are necessary for survival so we had to replace many of those hormones and we didn't really help too many women with that let me reiterate we did nothing like that for men and we hurt a lot of women by doing that we did it with good intentions but we hurt them what we then found is when women had breast cancer because we were concerned that it might come back we prophylactically removed their ovaries saying well if estrogen causes breast cancer this will help prevent it from coming back and we tested that with seven different studies none of those studies showed that it worked did we ever treat men by prophylactically castrating them never and we never will cause men still control medicine by and large so we were doing a lot with good intentions and hurting women we then were looking at what estrogen is capable of doing and this goes back to your question back in the 1940s there was a book written called feminine forever that essentially said well women should take estrogen forever and it'll be a an eternal

[00:18:35] Fountain of Youth that's not true that book was oversold that doctor who wrote that book was paid for by the drug company who made estrogen and we didn't know that until his son told that to the press after he died but estrogen did do some very good things and what we found estrogen is capable of doing is first estrogen can relieve the symptoms of menopause the way menopausal symptoms are viewed as well it's hot flashes and night sweats and usually lasts a year or two and tough it out lady and you'll get through it and point the fact there are many symptoms associated with menopause that aren't just hot flashes and night sweats it includes palpitations it includes cognitive decline it includes joint pains sleep disturbances right lots of things and it usually lasts about seven and a half years not two years and in some women it goes on for decades and women are taught to suck it up and deal with that estrogen is also capable of reducing significant heart disease by up to 50 percent there was an article in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1991 by Goldman and Tosta s'en that said time for action not debate saying if women took estrogen they would live longer they would be healthier that was 1991 and we now know that estrogen has been shown repeatedly to help diminish the risk for significant heart conditions so let's pause for a moment because I want to make sure that people listening to this and I hope it's not just women but it should be men as well unless you're a man who finds himself not knowing any women then maybe you won't listen to this but let's explain what these hormones do a little bit so there are not many papers that I have printed out in my office because we just don't print papers up that much anymore you know we don't physically have a paper copy but there are a handful that

[00:20:51] I have printed up and one of them of course is the WHI both the 2002 and then some of the republication 's because I do like to show people the actual data which I think speak for themselves but another thing that I have printed up is the hormone cycle for a woman during her reproductive years and I started doing this about three years ago and I was surprised how many women didn't know what estrogen was doing in their body how it would rise during the follicular phase peak during ovulation decline during luteal phase and come up for a second bump before declining at their period and similarly how progesterone would would follow a small thing now we're gonna link to images of that in the show notes but the point I want to make is you know women go through this for what 35 years of their lives maybe longer maybe 40 years of their lives and I guess I was just surprised that I remember having a patient who was complaining of horrible

[00:21:47] PMS and so I said well it has to do with the reduction of progesterone and in some women the fall of progesterone during the end of the luteal phase is so rapid that for reasons we don't understand that's gonna produce a change in something and you can ameliorate that by doing X Y & Z and the woman looked at me and she was like this is incredible like you've made me feel like I'm not crazy because you've shown me this graph that explains what's happening with my progesterone levels so I do want to make sure that someone listening to this spends a moment to understand what we're actually talking about you have these hormones that we're gonna hear you know we're going to talk about luteinizing hormone follicle-stimulating hormone you've alluded to these already coming out of the pituitary telling the ovaries to make these other hormones and and really is it safe to say at the risk of oversimplifying the reason it seems that women only experienced this during a finite period of their life is that's kind of when evolution wanted women to be able to reproduce without this cycle of rising estrogen progesterone falling levels women wouldn't be able to reproduce is the risk of oversimplifying is that a fair statement of why they have we have this finite window finite window during which time women have these hormones versus men who have kind of you know men have a much more gradual decline in their reproductive hormones this is a crucial thing to say Peter this is really important this was something I didn't realize until we began working on this book I assumed that in menopause estrogen declines I think that's the way women see it it just declines the way testosterone declines in a slow moderate way no estrogen plummets to 1% of what it was before menopause I think most women have no idea that it's that great a drop in estrogen levels and no wonder that many of the symptoms that women have by the way include depression and they attributed to a well it's a midlife crisis I'm having now it could be an estrogen depletion crisis as well and so

[00:23:48] I think it's really important for women to understand that this is not just a little fall-off it's really a major drop I want to add one thing here to this because as the social psychologist of this duo what interests me is the way women have been given false information for so many years about so many aspects of their reproductive cycle and experience that it's no wonder that many women have a great skepticism about what medicine has to offer them in reproductive issues just what operon was saying about there was so little hesitation in cutting women up and removing this part and removing that part let's try this other thing things that would never have been tried with men that men would just never have agreed to and so women have had an understandable skepticism about the medical establishments advice and starting with feminine forever Robert

[00:24:44] Wilson's ridiculous song of praise to estrogen women began to think well you know what the hell with all of you on this estrogen is I don't need it it doesn't make me feminine forever and who dares to think that I need to be feminine forever in that traditional way and menopause is just a natural phase of life and I can deal with it as I dealt with the onset of menstruation so what I want our conversation to bring here is an understanding of why women have been kind of whipped back and forth and whether estrogen is good for them or bad for them and tying on to that we left out another grotesque example of this which Sid Mukherjee has written about so eloquently in the Emperor of all maladies which is the radical mastectomy which ties into all of this you know

[00:25:30] Avram the points you brought up a moment ago I wasn't even aware of the pituitary resections I was aware of the oophorectomy is of course I had no idea they were resecting adrenal glands which strikes me as ridiculous but to actually resect the pituitary gland I mean that's McCobb it's it yeah yeah exactly trans

[00:25:51] Fino aid resections i mean is hard to believe and yet lost in that story which should be added just to complete the sentences and up until Bernard Fischer came along it was viewed as completely nonsensical that you would do anything other than disfigure a woman with breast cancer by removing every piece of tissue above her ribcage it's interesting point you raised right which

[00:26:14] I never really had contemplated truthfully which is could that have taken place if the roles were reversed gender wise I'd never really thought of it think also about hysterectomies the routine use of hysterectomy on the assumption that a woman once she's had her children doesn't need to have her uterus and by the way since we're removing her uterus let's remove your ovaries as well because what the hell they're just there let's take them out as if they have no function that casual attitude of let's just get in there and get rid of and the term hysterectomy you want to maybe provide a bit of context for the listener on what that means well hysteria was thought to be caused by the wandering womb which detaches itself and wanders through the female body causing mayhem and despair yeah yeah part of her more ludicrous notions about the female body the point is women weren't treated fairly and they're still not being treated fairly and just to amplify one point I made I mentioned that estrogen can significantly decrease the risk of heart disease what many women tell me at that point is well old women die of heart disease young women die of breast cancer I'd rather not take estrogen if estrogen causes breast cancer and it's the answer to that is twofold first estrogen does not cause breast cancer and we'll get into that in detail but more than that in every decade of a woman's life the incidence of death from heart disease is greater than the incidence of death from breast cancer I want to reiterate this point it's it's like you were reading my mind in preparing for this discussion I I did something I normally don't do I normally don't put as much time into prep but this is such a data-driven discussion and and the data are just so voluminous that I I really had to spend a lot of time preparing and my team helped me greatly but I have a chart that we will include in the show notes which makes your point very eloquently if you begin at the age of 25 you take a cohort of 25 year old women and you forward-looking project their ten-year mortality from breast cancer and from cardiovascular disease by decade I'm gonna read off the difference in favor of cardiovascular disease so if the number is greater than one you'll die more likely to die of a heart attack than breast cancer if it's less than one more breast cancer starting at the age of 25 going up in five-year increments with a ten-year forward look 3.5 X 3.5 times more likely to die of heart disease 2.4 X 2 point 1 X 2 point 3 X 2 point 5 X 2 point 8 X 2 point 4 X 2 point 1 X we're now at 35 years old two point three two point five two point two three point three by 55 four point one by sixty five point six by 65 eight point one by 70 and twelve point four by 75 when you do the math on aggregate across lifetime it's seven X difference in favor of cardiovascular disease over breast cancer where are the red ribbons heart disease kills more women than the next 16 causes of death including all forms of cancer AIDS and accidents the other thing people listening to this know how near and dear heart disease is to my heart because it is the number one killer for both men and women there's another area where I think women get a bit of a short straw here which is women present with heart disease quite differently do you want to say something about that sure the typical presentation of a man is crushing chest pain pain that goes down the left arm starting at the left shoulder women can often present with an upset stomach and because we generally don't think of women as suffering from heart disease the diagnosis is initially missed quite often although doctors are getting more and more sensitive to that now all right so I took us off a bit of a detour Carol your points a great one I want to come back to make for the first time in my career because I don't treat many women going through menopause but any women it was a patient of mine who's going through it I'm gonna be a part of it but this past year I got to see firsthand how quickly a woman can enter menopause because if you happen to do labs on women frequently enough you can see the drop so I had a patient who in August of 2017 I like to check labs on what would be day five so I can really standardize where the FSH and estradiol should be she had what looked like completely normal levels her FSH was you know something in the neighborhood of 10 her estradiol was maybe 90 she was starting to have symptoms though so I said to her look you are very likely in a perimenopausal state I expect you will enter menopause in the next three or four years she was probably 47 rechecked her blood in november her FSH was 68 her estradiol was unmeasurable i rechecked the labs because i couldn't believe it same result reached out to one of my mentors a gynecologist named Riley Lloyd in Chicago and I said Riley what has happened here and he goes you just happened to see her fall off the cliff this happens all the time it's just we usually aren't looking at laboratory tests that frequently so it's an interesting point that I'm glad you emphasized it and also you know you cannot say exactly at what age one of the women we'd described in the book who wrote a blog about this Katie Taylor who said she was 42 she was extremely depressed she was having all sorts of symptoms she was treated for her depression with any depressants that didn't do anything her doctor said maybe you should quit your job that will help her here's stress levels oh sure and fortunately her father is a leading breast cancer specialist in England and he said you know what you could be in perimenopause and she was and she was so many of the symptoms that women begin to develop in their 40s they don't associate with menopause muscle pain sends them to rheumatologists and depression sends them to therapists and fighting with their spouses sends them to family therapy and they don't think that their changes of menopause might be involved I want to say by the way that I am one of the minority of women who sailed through menopause with no symptoms and my mother as well and so I underestimated how many women really suffer it's not a verb I like to use much but many women suffer with the symptoms of menopause which I never did and I think that many of the women who are kind of casual about menopause oh you don't need to take anything this too will pass this too will pass easy for you to say if you're not sleeping for seven years well that's really interesting Carol I didn't I wasn't going to ask you that on the mic but I was planning to actually ask you that after which was what is your personal experience with this and how much of a role has that played in your motivation and it I'm interpreting your answer to mean your motivation for this is more in the in the spirit of truth seeking than it is a personal vendetta absolutely and

[00:33:19] I'm glad you brought that up because it's the first thing people want to know is do you have a vested interest in this do you want to defend your own decision to be taking hormones you know are you getting money from the drug companies so let's make this very clear here now neither of us has a vested interest in this neither of us has taken any money from drug companies I have been a vociferous critic of big pharma and a lot of its manipulations of research and it's inflated claims and no I don't have a personal interest in defending HRT in fact as a feminist psychologist for many years I was really critical of the kind of take it for granted assumption that once a woman hits menopause then you got a new fill her tank with hormones to get her back to being a real woman

[00:34:04] I was very critical of that which was easy for me to do when I was 35 and Avrom I want to just maybe give you the chance to say the same sort of thing you've obviously provided a CV that provides an interesting explanation for why you would care about this given the volume of patients you would have taken care of but is there something more personal was there particular patient that sort of broke your heart in terms meaning the experience that she went through broke your heart and is something that you think about a lot as you're on this crusade some particular thing no but in fairness let me tell you that when my wife reached 45 she had breast cancer and she was treated by me with chemotherapy and she went into menopause and unlike Carol she was very symptomatic and she didn't complain for two years she had the nice sweats the difficulty sleeping the joint pains the palpitations but women is supposed to suck that up and take it and she did and then she started to find that reading which is her passion was now being challenged because when she'd read a book she couldn't remember what she had read two or three pages before she did numbers in her head she's one of the smartest people I know and she was unable to remember telephone numbers and that's when she spoke to me and she is one of the first people I put on a study which we'll get to later which is a study of hormone replacement therapy in women with a history of successfully treated breast cancer and it took about two weeks and she was back and she would never go off them so I guess while we're on that topic I'm gonna tell my story of why I started to care about this so deeply a woman came to me about five years ago who had survived an ER PR positive breast cancer so for the listener that means she had a breast cancer that showed sensitivity to estrogen progesterone it was not her to new I believe so it was er PR positive her2 new negative she was very young she was probably in her early 40s at the time of this diagnosis she underwent a hysterectomy loofa wrecked me at the time she also underwent her mastectomies she basically became lost so she described it to me this was before I knew her she described it to me as being unable to get off the couch she described the fog of being something that her doctors at the time attributed to chemotherapy and they said to her once the chemo is done you will feel better three years after the chemo she felt worse and it finally occurred to her and to her husband that maybe this had something to do with the fact that it at the age of 42 overnight she lost every sex hormone in her body she couldn't find any doctor on the plan who would prescribe hormone replacement therapy to her because as a breast cancer survivor whose ERP are positive how could you do such a thing though she did eventually find someone who was willing to give her a trial she felt immediately better I mean immediately better the sort of as you described it within weeks she felt like she got her life back could do everything again and by the time I met her she was on a very clever regimen which was mostly estriol so topical estriol not estradiol and we can get into the details of that later along with she didn't need the progesterone obviously because sure she had hysterectomy and physiologic replacement of testosterone to reduce them sort of up to about half an anagram per deciliter level in her case interested me so much because I started thinking wait a minute isn't she increasing her risk of breast cancer and

[00:37:50] I won't get into the details of where that took me which rabbit hold but it obviously in some way led to a converging discussion that we're having today so I want to go back to now we're in the 1950s you've got the snake oil salesman out there he's telling every woman she must be on estrogen when did the tide change or when did the nuance start to emerge about different levels of replacement in the 1970s let's just go back a premarin which is an acronym for pregnant mayor urine which was an inexpensive way to manufacture a lot of estrogen and was and still is the dominant form of estrogen sold in the

[00:38:33] United States and that is the company the company that makes pur marine is the one that was supporting Robert Wilson premarin was being used on women who were going into menopause and in the early 1970s we found that there was a significant rise in the incidence of uterine cancer and as you mentioned estrogen alone does increase the risk of uterine cancer as much by as fivefold and so estrogen prescriptions fell off dramatically in the early 1970s by the late 1970s we had learned that giving progesterone together with estrogen either on a cyclic or a continuous regimen nullified that increased risk of uterine cancer and so at the end of the 1970s hormone replacement therapy started to increase again it continued that way until about 2002 and in 2002 it is estimated that about 16 million women in the United

[00:39:40] States were taking hormone replacement therapy either estrogen alone if they didn't have a uterus or the combination if they did have a uterus and that constituted about 22% of the appropriate age population in the United States that was 2002 by 2004 it was down from 22 percent to 10 percent by 2010 it was down to 5 percent and that was due primarily to the publication of a single large study called the Women's Health

[00:40:16] Initiative which you alluded to earlier now prior to that there was a large cohort based study called the Nurses Health Study and many people looked at that and said when you look at the Nurses Health Study which is in epidemiologic study so there was no randomization the benefits of hormone replacement therapy for women who had a uterus or estrogen replacement therapy for women who did not seemed quite compelling and didn't some people actually ask the question is it even ethical to conduct a Women's Health

[00:40:47] Initiative which would by definition subject some women to a placebo arm two things to that first the Nurses Health Study was a study that was done out of Harvard where a hundred and twenty thousand nurses were followed for up to thirty years and yes it wasn't randomized but the thought was that nurses were sophisticated enough to be able to report symptoms and to keep careful count of the medicines they were taking and it's a classic study it still is and what they found as you point out is women who took it for five years or 10 years or 15 years had no increased risk of breast cancer and so when the Women's

[00:41:30] Health Initiative was first undertaken the extensible rationale was not to see whether it increased breast cancer what they wanted to see is that it really have a beneficial effect on the heart and the brain and the bones that's the reason it was set up and there were some studies that said it did and there were two studies that questioned whether it did and so the theoretical rationale and

[00:42:01] I say theoretical because they were motives that weren't immediately apparent when it was first set up but the theoretical rationale was to see if it was as good as we thought it was now one of the things that I didn't learn until probably three years ago because my first interest in the Women's Health

[00:42:21] Initiative was in the nutritional study which was by budget the smaller of the two I think you probably know these numbers I'm probably guessing somewhat but the WHI was about a two and a half billion dollar study is that correct was one billion just one billion for both arms right just it's not a lot but it's still a billion dollars okay

[00:42:43] I found for some reason the 1 billion was just one arm and the other one but nevertheless it was really two completely separate studies right there was the nutritional study which we're not going to get into and then there was the study that you're talking about this was initiated in what year about 96 96 okay and the fact that I'm alluding to or the fact that I was alluding to a second ago that I'll get through now that when I saw it three years ago I thought that has to be a mistake was the the quality of the health of the women enrolled in that study do you want to say a little bit about for example the prevalence of obesity smoking hypertension conditions their average age was 63 10 years after the average age of a woman entering menopause 70% of them were seriously overweight or obese more than half were smokers they had high rates of hypertension and this was not an ideal healthy sample by any mean in fairness if they were looking to see the benefit on heart disease what they said was well we're going to take an older population because the incidence of heart events would be greater in that population we would see a difference sooner between the women who are on hormones and those who weren't and so for economic reasons it made sense to choose an older population but this was never a normal population and as soon as the study came out in 2002 it was immediately extrapolated to all women everywhere and there's one other detail about this study that I think you you will shed more light on and you do so in your book which when I first read it I thought that can't be right but women who were especially symptomatic were excluded because of a concern that if you took in women who had serious vasomotor symptoms and they were randomized to the placebo your dropout rate would be too high is that correct that's correct and that would be all right if you acknowledge that up front but three years after the study was first published there was a study saying that it has absolutely no benefit on quality of life and the first question when you read that is what planet were these people living on and the reason they found that is because women who was significantly symptomatic were excluded for just the reason you stated that if they had been randomized to placebo the fear was they would stop the placebo and drop out of the study and so what the report said is well among these women the majority of whom were not symptomatic we found no improvement in the symptoms that weren't there but the New York Times headlined it saying hormones have no benefit even on quality of life by the way the 13% of the women who were symptomatic had a significant improvement but they will lost among the entire population yeah you you would have been very statistically underpowered to catch them because yeah they represent such a small subset of the cohort let me let me just give you one bit of history here when the Women's Health Initiative it did one of these stop the presses thing you know we've found this increased risk of hormones on breast cancer so we have to stop our study immediately and have press conference and announce this this this terrifying finding okay and I remember clearly from calling me up and saying Carol they're announcing this alleged increase in the risk of breast cancer number one the journal articles in JAMA has not even been published yet you could not go directly to the journal itself and look up the findings for yourself this is a big no-no in scientific communication and publication but also the increased risk this alleged increased risk of breast cancer was not statistically significant it wasn't statistically significant in my business you don't get to go into publication and say gee you know we didn't get any significant results here we found something that looks problematic or interesting and maybe we need to do more research but not significant and that's what really first gave us pause why are they heralding this strange finding for what purpose and why are we wanting to scare an audience in advance of actually offering the real data and that's what got our skeptical neurons flaring I want to come back because we're gonna go really deep on the difference between absolute risk relative risk the difference between the cees versus the c plus m PA grew i want to go deep on that but i want to pause here for a moment to ask you an honest question which is you hear this and it's stinks of conspiracy theory except that i'm the most anti conspiracy theory guy out there I typically attribute to in competence rather than malice you know I mean like it's Oswald killed Kennedy there's enough two ways about it we don't want to believe that we want to create a bigger narrative because

[00:48:16] Kennedy was so significant and Oswald was so insignificant but the reality of it is conspiracy theories almost never hold up was the wreckin spirit I mean I'm using the word loosely I'm trying to it's I'm asking in the loaded way but when you look back at it through the lens of what we know today it seems improbable that this cluster could have taken I think they were behaving just like scientists who went into this research with a strong belief that HRT is harmful to women and in particular increases the risk of breast cancer

[00:48:48] Jacques Rousseau who was the cardiologist who led the women's health initiative had published an article and I don't remember which Mary might be sick 1996 basically saying it's time to bring the HRT bandwagon to a halt the HRT bandwagon this has too many women are on HRT this is not a good thing and it's time to it's time to stop the rolling bandwagon so he himself clearly had some kind of bias going into the direction of this study I don't think it's a it's not a conspiracy you as a reader of mistakes were made but not by me know that when you go into a research project with a belief that you really are sure of you see in the data what you expect to see in the data I mean I remember years ago the first book I ever wrote which was on anger in those days people thought that ulcers were caused by suppressed anger and I would go and look at these journal articles these were not malevolent people or fraudulent researchers but they so deeply believed that suppressed anger causes ulcers that they would say well we didn't actually get a significant result here but it's looking like that's what it would be if it were significant I mean really let me add two things to that if I can first the article says this is the 2002 article of the Women's Health Initiative says that this increased risk of breast cancer almost reached nominal statistical significance I don't know of any other article any where that states that statistically significant doesn't mean it's true but it means the finding has a less than 1 in 20 chance of being coincidence so it's worthy of investigation but almost reached nominal statistical significance that sounds like you're straining to reach a conclusion that you didn't reach but there had to be other accomplices here so on some level the journals had to at least make a case here by the way out of curiosity why did this end up in jam and not New England Journal of

[00:50:54] Medicine the initial publication any they've published in both JAMA and the New England Journal of Medicine but the first one why first one of this gema gema may have accepted at first and JAMA came out with the press release I don't know of any other situation where JAMA or the New England Journal came out with a press release before the published article was available to doctors to read well and you saw of course in our chapter on this Robert Langer writing last year why he waited so long we don't know but he was one of the investigators who revealed the background story about this there were 40 principal investigators distributed across the country they were summoned to a meeting to discuss the paper that was going to appear in JAMA they were told for the first time what this article was going to consist of it had been written by three members of the writing committee for the Women's Health Initiative they said you you can't do this and they were told well okay let's see it's 9:00 a.m. you have until noon to read this report and offer your criticisms and at noon when they offered whatever they could put together in three hours they were told too late the article has been published in JAMA Mnet's if the warehouse ready to be sent out so for conspiracy who most of the investigators themselves never saw that first JAMA I invited one of those three investigators to come speak at my local hospital several months after the study was published and he was asked by one of the doctors in the audience about the significance of the findings how come this was published around the world it was responsible for a 50 to 70 percent drop in hormone prescriptions and yet it looks as though the data aren't statistically significant what am

[00:52:48] I missing the doctor asked and he was told by one of the three you know this is the most expensive study ever done by the time we're finished it will cost about a billion dollars and so if we think we have found something and the results don't quite add up and this is a direct quote the statistical police have to leave the room and the medical audience was aghast who were the three writing authors of the study rowan shlonsky was the doctor who's a professor at UCLA who was talking Jacque

[00:53:24] Rousseau was the principal investigator and I'm not sure garnet Anderson no garnet Anderson was the statistician I'd have to check and see if she was one of the three she was one on the press release anyway yes she was the one who said what sort of when asked about these findings she said well when it's an issue as important to women as breast cancer we intentionally set the bar low if there's any dangerous information that we found any danger we set the bar low no no that's not how you do a study what's sort of disturbing when in reliving this story because I read your book like six months ago so I feel like

[00:54:01] I'm reliving this this bears an uncanny resemblance to another story that took place in the mid 80s when the dietary guidelines were being set and there was basically an NIH consensus that took place and I was giving a talk there's a Grand Rounds at UCSD in 2011 I believe or maybe 2012 and I gave the talk about how there was this consensus and everybody went in a room and 36 hours later they came out with this consensus but the problem was the consensus didn't match the data it wasn't orthogonal to the data but it was very far from what the data were and

[00:54:41] I believe it was mark hagstead who's no longer alive who at the press conference said when asked something about don't you feel like maybe we need to know the answer a little bit more and he basically made a similar argument which was with the stakes being as high as they are we don't have time to wait for definitive answers so I give that I give my talk after the talk of woman comes up to me and she says I was an endocrinologist at

[00:55:03] NIH and I was one of the and I can't remember how many people were in the room call it you know forty people or whatever I was one of the people invited to that I think it was basil Rifkin I can't remember who was the person that was running this section but she said and I'm not making this up though I obviously I'm paraphrasing she said when we sat down in the room they closed the door and they said here it is we've already written the consensus statement nobody leaves this room until we all agree to this statement and she said they were basically held hostage in that room until they agreed to the consensus statement which 36 hours later they basically did and they all left the room

[00:55:43] I even remember her making a case about how they brought in really crappy Chinese food to sort of feed them a little bit give them enough food but I mean that story I've never forgotten that story and it was very upsetting and it really is an extreme example of mistakes were made but not by me I do believe that you know basil Rifkind and

[00:56:01] Mark hex-head and all these guys had good intentions but they were now so far gone from any sense of understanding what data meant that it was irrelevant I mean they had gone purely into the role of evangelists and the story you just told sounds so unfortunately similar that that like I it's like I'm in a bad movie it doesn't even if doesn't sound possible the other thing of course is the negativity bias which cognitive psychologists have studied finds that people are more drawn to negative news than to positive news and certainly negative news is what sells what gets attention I think if the Women's Health

[00:56:42] Initiative had stopped the presses to say we could we are happy to report that HRT is beneficial for women and prolongs their lives and makes them feel better this would not have been as newsworthy or as shocking you know and Jacques Rousseau told a reporter from the New York Times that they wanted to do it this way to break into the noisy news cycle and get attention for the study mmm would be nice if you had good data behind your press release but so there were there were a number of motives if so much money had been spent on this don't we have to have something really worthwhile to say to warrant that expenditure so let's talk a little bit about the statistics so one of the tables I have printed up in my office is from I think it's the 2014 or 2015 jam a paper that went back and looked at all the data because a lot of times women will say to me doesn't HRT increase the risk of breast cancer by 25 percent that's that's the common question I get asked does an HRT increase the risk of breast cancer by 25 percent so where'd they get that number right there getting that number from the news so let's talk about where that number came from the first number is 26% mm just to be a stickler yes exactly but we round we round to here's 5 well because they came out two years later with 24% that's correct the initial 26% was among women who took hormone replacement therapy meaning the combination of estrogen and progesterone if you look at estrogen let me interject for a moment because I should have done this earlier let's explain what the study looked like in terms of randomization you had two cohorts of women correct you had women who had already undergone a hysterectomy and they were randomized to estrogen or placebo correct so Cee so conjugated equi estrogen or placebo and women whose uterus was still in place were randomized to Cee plus MP a versus a placebo correct correct was the randomization one to one to one through all events okay the women who were randomized to estrogen had no increased risk of breast cancer in fact if you want to be a stickler and play the same game my recollection is those women had a hazard ratio of 0.7 nine and the confidence interval ended up at one point zero one to translate that into

[00:59:05] English the women who were on estrogen only had a 21% risk but the 95% confidence interval crossed unity which meant it was not statistically significant the p-value is point zero seven if my memory serves me correctly which meant there is a seven percent chance that that effect was random meaning it didn't hit the five percent threshold right but I remember that mostly pretty pretty close the the fact is there was no real increase among the women who got estrogen alone that we would hang our head on there was one paper that came out that actually showed a 30% significant decrease but that didn't hold up in in subsequent papers so let's say there's no increased risk with estrogen alone with estrogen and progesterone there was a reported 26 percent increase and it's important that we understand what that is first that was not statistically significant so that by scientific standards we think that could have been caused by chance alone what was the p-value I don't remember the P thing but it was you're saying it was not definitely below is it above 0.5 yes it wasn't statistically significant but in order for there to be a 26% increase you have to know what the actual risk in numbers were was for women who got the the estrogen plus progesterone so let's well I was in this way this absolute yeah you're gonna explain absolute yes is relative yeah you're comparing the incidence among women who took the two hormones compared to women who were randomized to a placebo and there was this 26% reported increase now you could have a 26% reported increase if you have a real increase in risk or if your control the women who were randomized to placebo had a lower than expected risk of breast cancer and in fact when you look at those numbers you find that when you compare the women who were randomized to the two hormones compared with the women who were randomized to placebo on the estrogen only arm there was no increased risk even among the women who were randomized to the two hormones it was because there was a lower than expected risk among the control group who were randomized to the two hormones that you had what looked like an increased risk not a statistically significant one but an increased risk what's the best explanation for that is there one yes the women who had taken hormones before being randomized on the study who were randomized to placebo had a lower expected risk of breast cancer than women who had never taken hormones if you take the women who had taken hormones before going on the study and removed them from the control group you find no increased risk when you compare the women who got the hormones with the residual women in the control group so the women who were taking hormones before the study had a lower than expected risk of eventual breast cancer they lowered the control group number and they gave you this artificial increased risk that you saw among the women who took the two hormones is that clear course it's always hard to make that clear that's an example of the kind of data manipulation that went on to try to create the impression of a real finding that really what that really was not there but Peter to your question about absolute and relative risks that's what's crucial here if I say that eating a grapefruit doubles my risk of bunions

[01:03:18] I need to know what numbers were talking about if the numbers jump from one person to do person out of a hundred or out of a thousand that's not a very big I can't say it's doubling the risk but it's trivial but if the numbers double from 500 to a thousand in a group of 10,000 then we might have a finding we should be paying attention to most studies epidemiologists of course report relative risks where we don't even know in some cases we don't even know what the absolute numbers are Abram and I were at pains in our book to see when we would read studies that reported an increased risk of X Y or Z or a reduced risk of something to see what the absolute numbers were are we talking about outliers are we talking about a finding that's really statistically strong as well as significant and in many cases we couldn't even find what the absolute numbers were but where we could we really paid attention by my calculation which you can do straight out of the data reported in the Women's

[01:04:19] Health Initiative the absolute increase in risk if you believe the 26 percent relative increase it turned it calculated at about 0.9 cases per thousand or 9 cases per 10,000 so that link was less than one percent absolute risk increase even if it turned out to be true which by the way to simplify matters when I'm talking to women about the risks of hormone replacement therapy

[01:04:52] I say as a general rule consider the Women's Health Initiative you're ceiling on risk this is probably as bad as it would get and if you would accept that there's an increase of 1 percent in your risk of breast cancer and here are all the caveats on why I'm fine that hard to believe but at least you have a case study here for how bad it could be when you stack the deck against you statistically and against that is what are the benefits to you absolutely we have to wait but even talking about those risks which we don't accept as real and there are other studies like the Nurses Health Study that as I mentioned earlier showed that there is no increased risk of breast cancer with hormones taken for 5 10 or 15 years even assuming those risks we know that women who were diagnosed with breast cancer while on hormones have a better prognosis stage 4 stage and women who were diagnosed not taking hormones and even the Women's Health

[01:05:56] Initiative and one of the subsequent papers said that the women who had been randomized to hormones and have gotten breast cancer had a lower risk of dying from breast cancer than the control group that didn't get hormones this is huge this is such an important thing for physicians and for women to understand and it seems so counterintuitive women who've had breast cancer who are too on

[01:06:23] HRT have a better prognosis this is astonishing and what's interesting about it is you can dismiss the Nurses Health Study on that because of the healthy user bias that goes into it it is easy to say and I think it's a legitimate criticism that the women in the Nurses Health Study who had better outcomes of course they had better outcomes they were more health conscious they were nurses they were selected you know through that process to be that way so that the proponent of the woman's health initiative will say it's a better study because it was randomized notwithstanding the limitations of that but it's interesting that in this subset analysis which is always fraught with its own statistical issues the finding of the Nurses Health Study with respect to this point you make still held up that is to say I'll repeat it because it is so important a woman who is on HRT at the time of breast cancer diagnosis has a lower rate of mortality not just all cause but breast cancer if I'm correct yes and if we amplify that just the little hormones have been used estrogen specifically has been used to treat breast cancer and there have been significant favorable responses I can't imagine treating lung cancer by increasing the number of cigarettes you smoke every day and yet as early as 1944 there were researchers publishing a 25 percent response rate among patients with measurable breast cancer who were treated with estrogen if a woman gets pregnant after breast cancer flooding her body with estrogen and we used to advise women never to do that and women disregarded our advice the pregnancy does not increase the risk of breast cancer coming back if anything it decreases the risk of cancer coming back this is what I find so important and so fascinating which is the heart of this discussion is to try to puncture the widespread premise that estrogen causes breast cancer and that's the course the great fear and it's but it's just an imbedded assumption and here as Avrom has just described research from from treating women with breast cancer or women who are pregnant or women who began menstruating very early the many directions we might look at women on birth control pills do any of those things that increase the amount of estrogen in your body is that or is that related in some way to breast cancer and it is not that's the key so another interesting aspect of looking at the women's health initiative which it's very hard to look at the data and not ask the question what is the role of MPA because when you look at the women who had a uterus these are women who got estrogen and progesterone synthetic progesterone progestin versus placebo there was a trend towards a higher breast cancer but when you look at the opposite the women who had no uterus and therefore only needed estrogen the trend was in the exact opposite direction to the exact same magnitude I mean it almost looks but you couldn't make it up there they are mirror images of each other so you have to ask the question what are the differences and there are two one of them had a uterus one did not and one took synthetic progestin and one did not so that question is does not having a uterus oh and or does taking synthetic progesterone make a difference first on this synthetic progesterone its

[01:10:08] MPA Madrasi progesterone acetate which was used in the Women's Health Initiative because that was the most widely prescribed projet sarone available in the united states first let me go back to saying that the increased risk seen with the combination was not statistically significant did not hold up and was due largely to a problem with the control group if you accept that anything we say at this point is speculation and and irrelevant really but I'll take your question so what has resulted from that is people are saying well the problem really isn't estrogen will give estrogen a pass the problem is progesterone and in fact this particular synthetic progesterone well I'm not sure there's a problem because the numbers don't really bear that out but if there is a problem there are now forms of progesterone which are not synthetic that are now being advised and used and thus far have not been associated even with any finding of an increased risk of breast cancer but in addition progesterone also has been used to treat breast cancer and progesterone works as well as tamoxifen does to treat breast cancer in a randomized trial comparing tamoxifen to progesterone in the early 70s when tamoxifen was first produced and marketed progesterone did a little better than tamoxifen but because in the doses used it was associated with increased fluid retention and women became nauseated it lost out to tamoxifen but it was used to treat breast cancer there was a study that came out of India by a an investigator trained in England who found that if he gave an injection of progesterone around the time of surgery to remove primary breast cancer he significantly improved the prognosis decreased the risk of recurrence so making a lot of noise around progesterone doesn't really fit the available data that we have so two things one actually had a discussion with Jo and Manson about this a few years ago which was why did you use that crappy estrogen and progestin why didn't you use what we would use today which is bioidentical estrogen bioidentical progesterone and I've always had a lot of respect for

[01:13:01] Joanne by the way I don't know if you guys were able to did you interview her for the book I don't yeah anything and she gave me an answer that I thought was very logical and you've alluded to it already she said you're probably right Peter I mean I think the bio-identical hormones are likely better but we had to do it with what was available in that we had to test what was being used by the average physician at the time and certainly people at the time were making some noise that shouldn't we at least use bioidentical human hormones which intuitively makes more sense but she said a study testing that wouldn't have made sense in the 90s because that wasn't what the average woman was being tested so that said most women today are using bioidentical progesterone aren't they when they're when they're receiving hormone replacement therapy no they're still using synthetic progestin well first premarin yes let's talk about the estrogen the word bioidentical is a buzz word as you know bioidentical really refers to estradiol which is the leading circulating estrogen in a woman's body and there are pharmaceutical e prescribed estrogens that are made by significant manufacturers that we have no problem with and I want to get back to that in a minute but bioidentical is also used for what is prepared by pharmacists based on prescriptions written by local practitioners where quality control is lacking there is no clear dose equivalency and every responsible investigator I know wants to make the point that buying something because it's got the word bioidentical which sounds comforting is stake second premarin which is pregnant mayor urine and i say that rubbing your face in it because it sounds so terrible is the longest studied form of estrogen and we now have sixty years of data with premarin and most of the studies that show the benefit for estrogen are studies that were done on premarin for the same reason that joanne manson gave you it's the one that was used most often in addition premarin contains at least 10 different forms of estrogen including some that are the most beneficial forms of estrogen for brain health which is not present in estradiol or estriol so that my preference based on data only is premarin because we have the most data supporting it now as far as progesterone is concerned yes micronized bioidentical progesterone appears to be the safest form of progesterone administration what do you think explains this a bit of a pivot but what do you think explains the mechanism of action so so I'll take a step back and premise this put the following you alluded to this earlier most people intuitively think testosterone must be driving prostate cancer but the problem is men tend to get prostate cancer when their testosterone levels are at their lowest not their highest and men with hype testosterone when they young don't seem to get prostate cancer so it's just a bit confusing and in fact there's more recent data to suggest that the lower the testosterone the more likely the probability of a high-grade prostate cancer so everything seems to be moving in the wrong direction as testosterone goes down may I just interrupt that it's the same with estrogen as women get older and have lower estrogen levels the rates of breast cancer increase so therein lies my point what do you think explains the mechanism by which estrogen withdrawal and/or removal and the same for progesterone is increasing this risk and why avram can you point out these examples of administration of these things the seem to potentially improve the condition what do you think is happening at the molecular level acknowledging what you said at the outset which is we don't have a goddamn clue what cancer is we have clues but I said I don't understand what cancer is and the reason

[01:17:08] I said that right at the beginning is to try to forestall just this kind of question the best answer I can give is we think we understand the environment that is friendly to a cancer which is the environment in which the cancer develops and we try to change that environment to make it less conducive to the continued growth of the cancer that means in a low estrogen environment you might use estrogen because that is now unfriendly to the cancer in a high estrogen environment you might remove estrogen same with testosterone but exactly how that works

[01:17:48] I would use a lot of fancy words and they would try to cover my ignorance appreciate the honesty most of us tend to use those fancy words and hide our ignorance behind them so in 2002 the Jama study comes out and there were a bunch of follow ups so there was a 2003 a 2004 follow up what did each of these follow-ups attempt to do the 2002 follow-up said that the combination of estrogen and progesterone increases the risk of breast cancer not true we've discussed that increases the risk of heart attacks increases the risk of cognitive decline decreases the risk of colon cancer and helps protect the bones that's really what it said and then there were all these arguments about the statistical significance of the breast cancer finding and so in 2003 they came out with a second article showing borderline statistical significance for the increased risk of breast cancer and this is the point you alluded to earlier and this is actually the paper that I am looking at more often because this is the one that went from point one point two six as the hazard ratio to one point two four and this is the one where the p-value actually went to 0.5 from I believe point I was a show that it was that's right borderline statistically significant but in 2006 a follow-up article said that that reported increased risk in that population had disappeared with continued follow-up and that article never made the headlines and most people aren't even aware of it and in fact people like Jo Ann and I think this is why I respect Jo Ann a lot she is one of those investigators from the WHI who I believe is trying to course-correct it I remember driving to work one day and hearing her on NPR and this was probably like maybe five years ago and she was being interviewed and I don't know if I will be able to find you know if we can find the link to this that would be great at it I doubt we will but she basically made the point she said look I think I think the recommendations went too far and you know I could at least respect that she was now walking it back now she may come to a different conclusion than the one you've come to but she was at least willing to say look

[01:20:13] I think there really are a subset of women especially those entering menopause who have symptoms who deserve to be treated and we made a mistake that was really my interest was willing willing to say that it was okay for women to take hormones this is the mantra that women hear all the time the smallest dose for the least amount of time the smallest dose for the least amount of time and as Algrim keeps pointing out there is absolutely no empirical evidence to support that advice it's a bit like saying smoke the fewest cigarettes for the shortest amount of time and you'll be you'll get the benefit of smoking but without the lung cancer it's not so but I think it does represent a compromise in terms of the women health women's health initiatives realization that HRT really was beneficial for quality of life issues for women in menopause what they were not prepared to do was to consider

[01:21:05] HR T's benefits over the long haul for women in later years in reducing the risk of osteoporosis dementia and heart disease that they are not willing even yet to suggest that HRT has any prolonged benefits over time you don't have to go back to NPR I I believe it was 2017 when Joanne Manson published a paper saying just what you said first yes we went too far second we found that women who are nor moans had a lower risk of breast cancer lower death from breast cancer and in fact lower death from all causes compared to women who weren't taking hormones but she didn't endorse the use of hormones she fell back on the lowest dose for the shortest period of time which would be okay if hormones weren't so beneficial a study that came out

[01:22:03] Beynon and occult from Boston which we quote in the book showed that if every woman in the United States took hormone replacement therapy now admittedly this is before the Women's Health Initiative was published it would increase the median survival of women by three point three years in this country there's no other intervention I can think of that has such a great consequence for longevity and Phil Sorel at Yale calculating how many women might have died prematurely from heart disease because they went off HRT was thousands and thousands of women per year the number he came up with was 50,000 women between 2002 and sometime in the early teens might have died as a result of being taken off hormone therapy one of the diseases and I'd like to do this a bit more systematically now because you guys have done in the book such a great job your book is organized basically once you go through the case you've made you then basically have a chapter for each outcome so let's start with one of them let's start with the brain near and dear to my heart as well as you think about longevity you have to think about delaying the onset of dementia and again what most people don't realize in fact I think it's one of those things things where I remember the first time I learned it I thought how did I not know this already the great divide in chronic disease is

[01:23:26] Alzheimer's disease it's the one that disproportionately targets women so women are two times more like to die of Alzheimer's disease than men and let's put that in context for a moment can you imagine if I don't know women were two times more likely to die of heart disease or of picka given cancer pancreatic cancer you know something that's not sort of gender specific you'd be like scratching your head thinking how is this possible and so what's the explanation for that

[01:23:58] I'm not going to offer one but I will offer a hypothesis the most obvious difference between men and women is not the rate of longevity and women which would be the knee-jerk response to the why that's occurring women living a year and a half two years longer must explain it but those data don't bear out so another hypothesis might be women have an abrupt loss of hormones men have a gradual loss of hormones so say a little bit more about what your beliefs are now with respect to the data and what they tell us about the risk of Alzheimer's disease for every woman diagnosed over 60 with breast cancer two women are diagnosed with Alzheimer's the curate for early diagnosed breast cancer is now approximately 90% the cure rate for

[01:24:44] Alzheimer's disease is zero we have treatments for breast cancer that we haven't gone into but it's not really the subject of this podcast and there is no treatment for Alzheimer's if there is one disease that women fear more than breast cancer its Alzheimer's and exercise and diet and mental gymnastics and even a product of jellyfish has nothing to do with preventing

[01:25:15] Alzheimer's disease the one potential preventive medication is estrogen and that can reduce the incidence of Alzheimer's disease by between 20 and 50 percent depending upon this study you look at in that chapter where we review those studies animal studies lab studies real-life field studies randomized controlled studies the findings converge from all of those directions of research to show the benefits of estrogen on the brain Barbara sure at mcgill who has studied this question for many years she's someone from my side of the professional offensive room a psychologist and she was asked about taking estrogen for many years and so forth and she said you know I get so cross when people say taking HRT is not natural she said what's not natural is for a woman to live to be 85 or 90 years old and if estrogen is something that can help women to live with healthy mental functioning in those later years that I am all for it yeah that's a great point you raise which it goes so much beyond all of this but that that really envelopes this discussion what what does natural mean exactly if natural means what evolution intended we're all irrelevant by the time we're my age I mean let alone your age right I mean so if we've decided to live in a society where we value living beyond our reproductive years then why aren't we entertaining things that are quote unquote unnatural exactly it really is an asinine argument to me but obviously I'm biased in that respect absolutely so let's now talk a little bit about heart disease because if the increase in breast cancer was this screaming headline in 2002 the second headline had to be heart disease and stroke as Carol pointed out with a median age of 63 with 70% of the population overweight a significant number of whom were obese with half believes about 30% 34% were obese if that's right with half of them or 40% smokers and with a significant number having high blood pressure that was treated this doesn't represent a cardiovascular healthy population we know that estrogen is capable of causing platelet clumping platelets as you know a small quarks that circulate in the blood that help prevent bleeding by going to a site of bleeding and plugging it up estrogen can cause these platelets to clump and if you already have blood vessels that are narrowed by pre-existing heart disease a platelet clump can further narrow the blood vessel and cause a cardiac event and it's a result of that it is recommended that women with pre-existing cardiovascular disease not start on hormone therapy and the ideal time to start is around menopause sometime within the first ten years of cessation of your periods now having said that that doesn't mean that older women must never take it in fact that increased risk of cardiovascular events is seen generally during the first year that a woman starts hormones point of clarification that increased risk but that's after the window of opportunity ten years after menopause begins correct it there is no increased risk if a woman begins HRT at the time of menopause no pre-existing cardio ok the disease this is actually what I wanted to ask you about so thank you for clarifying this let's make sure that the listeners are crystal clear on this if you take a woman entering the normal perimenopausal to menopausal state and she has no pre-existing cardiovascular disease and I want to come back to how we'll define that but let's wait on a moment the data make it pretty clear there's no increase in her risk of cardiovascular disease ongoing correct not just four or five years correct okay k-stew you take a woman who is let's just make the math easy she's 60 years old and she went into menopause at 50 so she has a window now that is 10 years there is zero evidence that she has existing cardiovascular disease she begins hormone replacement therapy how clear are the data that she is also not increasing her risk of cardiovascular disease well it depends on the studies you've done to show that she has no narrowed blood vessels let's let's go gold standard to the best of our ability calcium score is zero CT angiogram shows nothing lipids are beautiful and she's probably okay but let us say we are not here trying to increase sales of hormones no no I understand what we want to do and just to make it clear is empower women so they not be given some Curt answer when they ask about it this is a legitimate course of action to follow but with and after a discussion with your physician yeah what I'm mostly trying to do is identify the women who might be at risk and who need to think twice about it which sounds like it's women who are who have been completely deprived of hormones meaning they went through menopause they have been off hormones they are now call it ten years out and they have some pre-existing clinical or subclonal atherosclerosis is their risk only one year after starting therapy and then it returns to baseline their risk is highest during that first year and then it diminishes and diminishes and diminishes there haven't been the kind of studies that I can tell you it returns the baseline and I can't say that with assurance but the major risk is during the first year and if during the first year it doesn't occur the likelihood is they will be well and won't have one of these events this is interesting because there was a similar step there was a study I shouldn't say similar there was a parallel study to this idea published I want to say it was in JAMA but it might have been the

[01:31:24] England Journal of Medicine a few years ago that looked at men with older men who were not particularly healthy put on testosterone replacement therapy and one year after the study the men on the testosterone group had a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease three years after the study initiated the risk was equal and at five years the men receiving testosterone had a lower risk of heart disease than the men on the placebo it's actually quite interesting that it mirrors what you've just described and I'd never made that connection until now it is quite interesting and it's the question we get most often from women who entered menopause and were scared off hormones because of their doctors and now ten years later or even more than that they this is one of the most common questions that Avram gets can I go back on it now

[01:32:13] I've been off this room for ten years is it safe to go back on because I'm suffering because I'm having so many symptoms because I'm really and discomfort in the quality of my life is terrible I would like to go back on hormones is it safe so we understand the importance of this question and how an individual woman really needs to assess what her particular risks are and Carol that case study that you you know hypothetically put forth that kind of flies in the face of what most people think most people think a 60 year old woman who took hormones eight years ago and has not been on them anymore can't possibly have symptoms right it must be something else no they do indeed have symptoms

[01:32:52] Avram said earlier the average length of time a woman has symptoms during menopause is seven years that's the average for some women it's ten or twelve or fifteen I'm from gets letters from former patients saying you know I'm in my 70s here are my 80s and I'm having this terrible trouble sleeping and my doctor won't renew my prescription won't renew my prescription I'm 78 years old you know I'm doing fine on hormones please and the minute they go off and that their symptoms often return so let's talk about an area that doesn't seem to have that much controversy but just for the sake of completeness let's let's talk about bone mineral density in osteoporosis for a second first let's talk about bone mineral density bone mineral density is used as a substitute marker for osteoporosis it is a bad substitute marker it's the best one we have but it's not a good test and one of the ways to explain that is bone elasticity is what allows bones to bend without breaking and allows us to be active without suffering acute fractures bone elasticity is due to the girders within the bone that are made of collagen and that are broad and healthy and bend the bone mineral density measures the envelope in which those girders are contained the envelope is the cortex of the bone and the cortex of the bone is made largely of calcium to show you what a bad measure bone mineral density is and I'm sure you know this

[01:34:38] Peter if you give patients fluoride you will dramatically increase bone mineral density and the bone will become thick and break easily and have no elasticity and that's not a good treatment for osteoporosis the best way to check for osteoporosis is to take a bone in the body and put it in a vise and see how much pressure you can exert before the bone snaps the problem is you know it's funny I do that test on most of my patients but you would be amazed than there are subsets of patients that refuse that yet they refuse that test exactly and we don't have that test yet although somehow we're able to do it on bridges to predict when bridges will fail and I'm not sure why we can't do it on bone yet but bone mineral density is used as a substitute and we now know that as many women in the United States will die each year of a hip fracture as the number who will die of breast cancer wait a minute that that sounds almost impossible to believe I'm very sensitive to how often people die of hip fractures so did you say that in a given year there are as many women who will die from a hip fracture who are obviously going to be much older that's a concentrated older subset as all women who will die of breast cancers who will die of breast cancer the I don't know that the hip fracture is directly responsible for their death but approximately 21 percent of women who fracture their hip will die within a year of the hip fracture and that number is approximately 40,000 which is the number of women who died in this country of breast cancer every year do you know how many men died of hip fractures or sustained hip fractures that within a year precede their death I haven't looked it up I think it's close but I don't know and and it is okay and estrogen will decrease the risk of osteoporotic hip fracture by up to 50% better than any treatment available over the long term and you can well say well now we have calcium and vitamin D for example and that is and bisphosphonates well calcium and vitamin D first then you can turn on television and see women talking about that and since we just mentioned that the problem is not the shell of the bone which is fed by calcium and vitamin D which aids calcium absorption it is the internal girder network of the bone in a postmenopausal women who is not on estrogen calcium and vitamin D have no protective effect against hip fracture so let's talk about bisphosphonates which do help prevent hip fracture almost as well as estrogen does the problem is if you take them for longer than five years you have an increased risk of fractures within the femoral shaft they're called atypical femoral fractures and that increased risk has been used to say that bisphosphonates should not be used for longer than five years whereas you can take estrogen as long as you take it your bone elasticity and your bone health is preserved and there's nothing as good as estrogen anything you want to add to that Carol I think he said it just perfectly alright Carol tell me about colon cancer what does HRT do to increase or decrease a woman's risk of colon cancer which is a cancer that you know a lot of people don't realize how high that is on the mortality table because it's lethality is of course nowhere near as bad as sort of pancreatic and lung but it's up it's more lethal than again it depends on how you define it but it's gonna be more lethal than breast cancer so this is a big problem this was almost an unintended or unexpected discovery about the benefits of estrogen in reducing the rates of death from colon cancer I think it was kind of off the mint chart of is this something we want to even think about as it as being a benefit of estrogen but a number of significant studies have shown that it does indeed we do in the reduce the risk of colon cancer this was one of the few things that didn't if I my recollection is this was one of two or three findings in the Women's Health Initiative that was not really changed over time and not particularly controversial as I as I correct yes there are other studies including the Nurses Health Study that showed that there are many studies that showed 20-25 percent decreased risk of colon cancer among women taking estrogen but we don't know why I will say here at the beginning with the Women's Health

[01:39:44] Initiative the first thing they wanted to say in that those first years was something they called their global health indexes that what they called it a room this was supposed to be a sort of an overall measure of health and longevity claiming that estrogen reduced longevity and increased women's mortality from all causes over the years

[01:40:04] I mean was quite a quite an exaggerated claim and over the years they have been walking back from that one well okay it doesn't really increase the risk of dying from all other diseases that there might ever be I mean they were really looking to scare people for some reason at that point then they stopped talking about this global mortality rate statistics especially because they began looking at individual risks of death from various diseases and finding that there was no increased risk diabetes is another one that estrogen seems to decrease and the Women's Health

[01:40:40] Initiative diabetes was self-reported I've never can you explain why the hell that was the case no there are so many gaping holes in my understanding of how the Women's Health Initiative came to be arsed and that's yet another example of rather than actually make diabetes a secondary or tertiary outcome we'll make it a self-reported outcome

[01:41:03] I don't even I've never seen a study where that's been a case as you single most expensive study ever done in this country and that's the third time one of the people around this table has said I've never seen that so tell me why you believe that HRT might actually reduce the probability of diabetes rather than increase it because the numbers suggest that it that's all I would like to see many more studies before we reach that conclusion and you'll note we didn't mention diabetes in the book no yeah that this is something I just brought up from actually mining looking through the data myself because it was so counterintuitive let's talk about their real downsides it's hard to dispute that there was a real increase in pulmonary embolism and venous thromboembolism you alluded to it already because you talked about platelet activation let's put it in context can we talk about the magnitude so we saw the increase was clear and relative how big was the absolute increase it's very small and a clot a thrombophlebitis a swollen leg because of a clotted vein is usually not very serious unless as you mentioned a piece of the clot breaks off goes to the lung that's a pulmonary embolus and that can be fatal the incidence is small I I don't have the number in my hand it's it's significant enough that if the patient is has a condition or is taking something that can predispose to that kind of Claudette must be a consideration before somebody starts on hormones the other thing that stood out to me was the increase in the incidence of gall bladder disease though it was never really clear to me what the hell they were talking about did they mean coalified like did they mean stones and the gall bladder stones yeah and that seems to be a statistically valid finding and cholecystectomy removing a gall bladder among women who are on hormones is a not infrequently reported finding and has to be thought of so when you take a step back and think about all of this I think we're just as a society very conditioned to want binary answers something is good something is bad something is all good something is all bad for the unfortunate reasons you've described HRT following the Women's Health Initiative fit into the all bad category I don't think you're here saying it's all good but it sounds like it's more good than bad and obviously that's my belief as well how should a woman who's listening to this who is either not in menopause yet in menopause past menopause how would you counsel her to think about this as she approaches her physician who may already have a very strong point of view about this I recently got back from

[01:44:03] London where I gave a talk at the Royal Society on the book and a discussion on the pros and cons of hormones and when you walk into the Royal Society in London emblazoned across the front in Latin it says take no one's word for it and there was an interesting guy who was the first president of that I'm blanking on his name Isaac what was it something

[01:44:26] Newton Newton that's it yeah yeah yeah so you're in heady company there exactly right and the reason we wrote the book with references on every chapter trying to give people the data on which our conclusions are based was as I mentioned to empower women so that the book is meant to make you a better consumer of health care so that when you go to your physician you and your physician together can work out the best program for you to follow and our conclusion from the book is that the benefits of hormones far outweigh the downsides and hormones have been unfairly excluded from medical regimens that women should at least be offered for consideration I would add to this because I come from a history of course of feminist criticism of medicine and psychology and the bias in the nature of research and so forth in gender research and so I am well aware of and for a long time supported many of the feminist criticisms of HR tea and of in general the medicalizing of normal problems of life the less is more movement in medicine is designed to educate the public that sometimes you don't need to medicate every possible problem you could ever have in your life and that we're taking too many medications and too many drugs and so forth and so forth and with much of this

[01:46:04] I completely agree but the alternative to over medicalizing our problems is not to under medicalize them either and I think that many women influenced properly by feminist critiques of medicine have become you know think that there's something unfeminist about taking HRT you know something anti-woman about taking HRT

[01:46:28] I'm not enough of a woman if I need to take hormones or that kind of argument and I think it's as much a feminist argument to say what is best for women overall what is best for a particular woman who is dealing with symptoms that are painful and difficult and complex you know I'm going to be speaking at a meeting of where it was interesting the board told me well we can't possibly invite you to come and talk about your book because everybody on this board is anti HRT and they're feminists and they've been anti HRT all of their lives and so forth and then she called me the next day and said well the board has decided unanimously to ask you to come talk about this book an account of they're now all in menopause and suddenly saying you know what my body is talking to me and I need to listen so I think that the issue of HRT for women is not there's a correct ideological stance to be taken but rather one that needs to look at what is best for most women and for any given woman making this decision and let me just add at the beginning of our discussion you spoke at about a patient of yours who was suffering through menopause who went on estriol and progesterone and a little bit of testosterone no progesterone she had had a hysterectomy I'm sorry we like the the estriol was too right safest way perceived to give her as I just have to say that we don't have large-scale studies on estriol so that one has to take every step very carefully and the simplistic answer that testosterone has to be good because it can stimulate libido and since it's a male hormone it must be anti breast cancer testosterone has also been associated with the development of breast cancer it can show some stimulation of growth of breast cancer in culture and that too has to be looked at very carefully these are all such important questions in fact when you think about what we've just talked about we have talked about cancer we have talked about atherosclerosis or all of the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and Alzheimer's disease so you've base it and then when you add fractures to that you have basically if

[01:48:51] I'm doing the math right accounted for about eighty to eighty-five percent of deaths that women will experience and you're talking about something that could move the needle by let's be conservative and call it 10 to 20% potentially more but let's say conservatively 10 percent will there ever be a correctly done Women's Health

[01:49:15] Initiative that will include these other questions we've never asked the question about other forms of estrogen we've never asked the question about testosterone which most women don't realize this but even during her reproductive years she has 20 to a hundred times more testosterone in her body than estrogen even a tabulation and she's losing that as well as losing her estrogen but to your point we don't have a clinical trial that asks that question will we know and the reason we won't is the idea that every truth can only be determined by a prospective double-blind randomized study is simply not holding up in fact there are now many articles appearing in the general medical literature talking about well followed carefully put together observational studies that can give us information that we simply can't get from double-blind randomized trials I think when we begin to understand better what cancer is we will have better answers the data that we tried to string together our data based on studies which follow our ignorant sand our attempt to see through this darkness to work out the best treatment for any individual patient do you think there's something else at play which is notwithstanding the complexity and the cost of repeating a study of that magnitude notwithstanding notwithstanding the complexity and cost no that's what's standing that's what's standing in the way of course well I guess that's my point is it is the issue that the NIH which is really the only entity that could ever fund a study of this magnitude right there is no industry version of this study has has this been

[01:51:15] I mean did you interview folks I'm trying to remember who you interviewed from NIH did you get the sense that this is case closed in the same way that unfortunately many still view the dietary studies of the 70s and 80s as a bit of a case closed let me just add that people ask us why we are a voice in the wilderness voices in the wilderness well we're not and if you look at the people who have endorsed our book they include Vince Da Vida who is the director of the National Cancer

[01:51:47] Institute out of the NIH yeah Vince actually along with Steve Rosenberg my mentor and I forget the name of the there was a radiation oncologist Sam Hellman Sam Hellman they write the Bible on oncology they write a very important book called cancer that's correct Jerry casera who is the editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine endorsed our book Lesley turn berg who is the president of the Royal Society of

[01:52:12] Medicine in England endorsed the book these are very well informed people as many female groups endorse the book as well Phyllis greenberger who's the CEO of the women's science cooperative endorsed the book these are people who are aware of the data are aware of the limitations of the data available to us and they strongly recommend that this book be read not just by women but I have men who come up to me who thanked me for saving their lives because of their wives getting better and that was killing them yeah but you see a question

[01:52:55] I think Peter - is what kind of research needs to be done to help us answer the questions that we have remaining what kind of research so there won't be anything as big as the Women's Health Initiative as costly as that as the statistical police have to leave the room because we're never going to be able to do anything this big in this elaborate again I think that's true but what I think what I'm seeing that I find really interesting and Avram alluded to this already is that we're now can do studies comparing the outcome of randomized controlled trials with observational studies and it turns out we've all thought oh the RCT is the gold standard and if it isn't the RCT then forget it I don't want to even look at any observational study I don't care what other field studies I don't want to see any other kind of data if it's not an RCT I'm done and I know you know some scientists have that view what really impressed us in gathering the research we did was that when you look at different methods of Investigation across many different samples many different countries many different times when you start to get a convergence of evidence where you don't just have one outlier here saying oh look HRT is beneficial but know there's a convergence from so many different directions then you can feel a little more secure that you're really on solid ground and I'm finding - the thought from just said I want to underscore this not every RCT is bias free and reliable as we've just been seeing and not every observational study is to be thrown out because it's only an observational study yeah there's another point here that so much of our thinking about epidemiology is based on nutritional epidemiology which John aya needies has recently described as I mean effectively garbage I mean I think he even went so far as to say that and if you know John he's quite measured in his words but I mean he's basically said there's no role for nutritional epidemiology and so you might say well then there's no room for all epidemiology but there is a difference I think and it's subtle but it's important part of the trouble with nutritional epidemiology is it relies on things like food frequency questionnaire x' which anybody who's ever actually tried to fill one of these things out realizes they're almost impossible to gather data whereas epidemiology may in fact have less of the data crisis when the intervention is simpler and certainly taking HRT is simpler than remembering what you ate over the past seven days point two is so this is by the way I have no overarching point I'm just stating a bunch of thoughts as I try to wrestle with what you're saying point two is I think we have seen that it is impossible to eliminate healthy user bias from epidemiology there are no branches of statistics that can eliminate this and we must always acknowledge that and that is why we have to be careful when we look at epidemiologic studies of things where the intervention is more likely to appear in a healthier group or a more health-conscious group or more affluent group the third point which I want to highlight what you've said is we are lulled into a false sense of confidence with randomized control trials and yet virtually all of them have some measure of what's called performance bias which you know Preta med which is generally regarded as the best nutritional study despite the you know change in the statistics around the randomization suffered a very large performance bias meaning the group that was treated was given much more attention than the group that was the placebo and therefore they were probably or at least possibly more likely to change behaviors in other ways that could have impacted the outcome so your point is correct which is just because something is a randomized control trial doesn't mean it is free of bias I

[01:56:46] I had something I think really crucial here that's in a way a theme throughout our book which is that the demands on researchers to publish or perish has meant a proliferation of badly analyzed studies so this is where you're an epidemiologist you've got a thought you've got thousands and thousands of people in your sample and you don't find what you thought you would find you find no connection between cucumbers and bunions right and so instead of saying gee we find no connection between these two things they then engage in these statistical practices that are no nose for any statistician or scientist to do and yet the results find homes and medical journals I go back into my data

[01:57:33] I rummage around until I find some tiny subset of the sample that seems to support my hypothesis you don't get to do that and yet in these studies over and over as we show in our book not only do they get to do that but they get published that's the reason for that the wonderful table with a list of risks of increased risks of breast cancer that include using an electric blanket for more than six months but less than two years and eating grapefruit and so forth those were preposterous findings that weren't replicated and yet all of them found homes and medical journals and that's the concern yeah I have the table here I was actually reading it well actually I was reading this in your 2009 paper and it's great you know fish intake 14 percent increase in the risk of breast cancer french fries 27 percent french fries one extra helping of France it was just one additional serving of french fries for a week per week in the preschool population yeah no no look I mean if you're eating fries at the age of four I promise you that grapefruit 30% increase but only if you eat half a grapefruit that's right three three quarters of a grapefruit ameliorated the risk exactly being a Scandinavian flight attendant finish to be particularly yes yes yes good to be very specific but if you were

[01:58:52] Icelandic instead of Finnish the risk went from one point eight seven to four point one and if you use an electric line get it's interesting the risk goes up to almost 5x but that's only if you are african-american and only if you use it for a certain number of months per year and only under a certain number of years you have to use it for more than six you have to use it for fewer than six months a year but for more than ten years there you go you can't make this up I mean that's somebody really looking to eke out something statistically significant well one other point to put in when we started by saying we don't know what cancer is let me tell you one of the things we do know one of the hardest malignancies to treat when I started was called acute promyelocytic leukemia this is a condition where the bone marrow is full of very immature angry cells called promyelocytes or Pramila blasts and chemotherapy even intensive chemotherapy was associated with a two to five percent possible response rate with no complete remission and everybody died and about 15 years ago several investigators found that the problem with Pro Melo blastic leukemia is not that these terrible-looking cells are multiplying too quickly it's that these cells are facing a maturation arrest that immature cells multiply very quickly that's how we go from being two cells to being an organism in nine months and then they start multiplying slowly as cells mature they multiply less actively if there's a maturation arrest so the cell cannot mature beyond a particular point the cells grow very quickly and they kill the patient if you give something and in the case of acute promyelocytic leukemia it's a form of vitamin A called trans retinoic acid if you give that to the patient you remove the maturation arrest the abnormal leukemic cells proceed through normal maturation the disease disappears and the patient is better and so looking at the tumor cell as the enemy instead of as the smoke behind the fire of the maturation arrest was misguided and I think we're going to find in many malignancies that our understanding of what cancer is is going to change and we're going to stop trying to identify the tumor cell as the enemy but we're not there yet there are people that are really talking and this has been this has been something this has been a voice that people have been starting to starting to gain some volume is you know looked at the role of stromal cells for example so we we have focused as you're pointing out almost exclusively on the actual cell that has undergone the genetic alteration to render it cancerous but the stromal cell that surrounds it the the environment in which it lives in cellularly is is now I think people are starting to realize there's something there that's and now how we target that for treatment becomes a second question but this is a great point and I want to thank you for writing this book because

[02:02:10] I don't know how much you guys thought about it before you did it but you know you're gonna make some enemies writing a book like this because you're going up against effectively established medical entities that have a position and it becomes easy to discredit people who come across a zealots and I'm not saying you're coming across the zealots but anybody who writes a book that basically says some very obvious you know well laid out conclusion is incorrect you don't get to say that meekly right you have to say that with a megaphone to overcome the noise and when you do that it looks like well your result and we welcome the criticism and the discussion and rather than make enemies we welcome critics and that way we will all learn we don't claim to have the final answer but we think that this book represents an important step forward in empowering women and helping them live longer and live better and Avram you know when Avram has debated those who have a publicly different point of view and has said okay here's my point of view here's the data here's what I find please tell me why you disagree and they don't they can't they haven't and well what is the best what is the best counter-argument you have heard to your point of view and even if it's not at a macro level but two specific issues it is incredible how silent the other side is incredible I've debated people in public I debated a leading advocate of hormone replacement therapy who learned in the course of a debate a leading opponent of holding upon it in the course of the debate said look if all you care about is looking good feeling good and living a long time then take estrogen I said it's very rare in life that your opponent actually does the mic drop for you I put that on a slide and use that in future talks that's almost hard to believe one thing we didn't touch on is race so we've talked about pre-existing heart disease and that may be a fork in the road that may be a place where we need to reconsider or

[02:04:32] Reese travefy when we talk about race we know that there are different racial predispositions to breast cancer has anything come out of all of the revaluations of the data that would suggest one way or another that Caucasian african-american Hispanic Asian women might actually benefit or be harmed differentially from hormones the first answer to the best of my knowledge is no but the reason for that is the overwhelming majority of the study patients are Caucasian there was a report in 2003 that said that the incidence of breast cancer has dropped precipitously and people in the women's health initiative said well we published this study in 2002 and the incidence of hormone replacement therapy went down significantly and while we can't claim credit we can't think of a better explanation than that well that's preposterous it's preposterous first because can sir doesn't start and develop within six months some people think it takes as long as 20 years and when they were greeted with that the answer was well we agree we didn't decrease the risk of cancer starting but what we did is cancers that were subclinical therefore not diagnoseable that would have been stimulated to grow by the hormones never mind that the hormones don't stimulate the cancers to grow they diminished and that's the reason for the decline well first you don't know how many of the women who didn't get breast cancer where were we're not taking hormones but even if your point is right then the decline should have been among the very early small cancers that just peeked through as a result of the stimulation that you are postulating and the incidence of cancer diminished not among that population but among the more advanced logic cancers and by the way that the Kleins started in 1999 not in 2002 and yet in the literature they take credit for that but has the define occurred among all groups oh and I'm sorry and the point I was making is the decline did not occur among black women that it was only seen among Caucasian women I do we have data on the different uses of HRT among women at that time not that I know of it also didn't occur that the Klein wasn't seen in Norway which is largely Caucasian of course most research has been conducted on white women and not on African American women although I mean the the ethnic question and the regional question is a very important one and I think for that reason the fact that national menopause societies in every country from India and African nations and South America and Canada and that long list of other menopause and early menopause societies all have endorsed the use the the beneficial use of HRT for women and have argued against take the smallest dose for the shortest period of time does that make the United

[02:07:53] States one of the more anti HRT countries it does well I would say so see it's interesting in in England where premarin is on the National Health and as routine is kind of considered the old-fashioned you know HRT and bioidenticals are somehow trendy or and better but there isn't the quite the antipathy toward HRT that we see here nonetheless the women's health initiative had international repercussions I mean it certainly has in

[02:08:23] Canada where I naively stupidly tried to have this discussion with my mom's doctor and I mean she looked at me like I had 12 heads before basically saying son we're in Canada here we don't do that I mean it there was no discussion this was not let me hear why you think your mom would benefit from being on hormones it was full stop we'd have an easier time if you were asking me to attach a third arm to your mom oh well you know that we include the book with a letter from a Portuguese a gynecologist called my dream and this is the guy in

[02:09:07] Portugal saying a critique of the Women's Health Initiative I had a dream that the Women's Health Initiative apologized for the harms that had caused and leading so many women to go off hormones so this would suggest that there's been a new European consequent was very favorably reviewed by the London Times in a two-page spread and interestingly the author of that article was Animax dead whose name is on a book

[02:09:31] I see in your bookcase and how has been the receipt here as I mean you have pointed out some very notable folks but by and large it seems like the investigators the pis from the WHI have been quite silent has there been any any reception to what you've basically said which is let's debate this openly let's lay the data out find the criticisms and let's get better they have no incentive to they are the Goliath why does Goliath one to argue with

[02:10:02] David and Jane in the book we write that if somebody came to you and tried to convince you that the earth was flat you wouldn't respond to them you would just ignore them and we're not arguing that the earth is flat but that's the way this is often being treated well I mean the analogies not quite right it's like if someone came to me and said the earth is flat and just asserted it I would absolutely ignore them but if they came to me and had evidence including photographs of a flat earth from the moon and photographs of what was once around Earth and said here's the optical illusion in other words you're not just showing up saying the earth is flat that's why it's so heavily referenced yes anything else you guys want to talk about this hobby I mean I could keep talking about this but

[02:10:49] I think in in less time than I expected I thought we were gonna need to talk for a long time but you guys I guess it's a it's a testament to how well thought-out your arguments are and I don't think that this podcast is a substitute for people reading the book in fact I want to make that point clearly that you should not take our word for it on this discussion I think this is an important enough question I also think the book is accessible enough meaning it's an easy enough book to read you don't have to have a medical degree to read the book and I think everybody should make the effort to read this book and should actually follow up in the references and should say well wait a minute is that really true because I had that response and I'm very familiar with this literature and I still found myself at times going to the references and saying wait that is how did that happen oh wow

[02:11:38] I you know because what you did nicely is you laid out the time course of the literature of the studies and I think that's an important exercise thank you Peter our goal was to make the book readable enough for lay readers certainly of course for women personally concerned about this issue so that they will understand what the evidence shows without having to read every study at hand if they want to I mean so in some sections will have a drumbeat of findings showing look it's benefit look it's benefit look it's benefit look it's benefit you could read those studies or not if you wanted with a discussion of what the alternatives to HRT might be for heart or brain or bones or feeling good in your middle years we consider all of those alternatives what their limitations are why we think estrogen is better so our goal was to make it readable for general readers but also to provide the sources and information for those who want to know in more detail what the science shows it's worth mentioning that when I write a paper I write it for a medical audience physicians and it's a pretty dry data filled paper and the first paper I wrote with Carol which you have in your possession hormone replacement therapy real concerns and false alarms we wrote it together Carol took the data that I put and she included her Carol touch which includes things like a criticism of the Women's Health Initiative saying in the paper what were they thinking well I couldn't put that in a paper but it read so well and so easily that I sent the paper to an oncologist friend of mine who is the editor-in-chief of the journal cancer and just asking him for his comments and he got back to me in about four hours and said with your permission I want to publish the paper and he did with Carol's personality embedded in the paper and it's embedded in the book making it witty and enjoyable to read as well as data felt

[02:13:49] Thank You Avram well it's a pleasure we didn't discuss hormone replacement therapy after a diagnosis of breast cancer we touched on it but chapter six in the book does discuss that and that's still an open question but it's an open question it's not an obvious conclusion as I mentioned getting pregnant after having a diagnosis of breast cancer does not compromise the prognosis in fact that might improve the prognosis that pregnancy which floods the body with estrogen before age 20 is associated with a 70% decreased risk of eventual breast cancer we used to tell women if they got pregnant and they had breast cancer they must abort and it turns out that's not true and in fact aborting can negatively affect prognosis and we present all the findings in that issue so that it's something worth discussing there are 15 studies in the literature looking at hormone replacement therapy after breast cancer and all but one of them show no increased risk of recurrence and the one that shows an increased risk of recurrence was stopped prematurely had a follow-up of two and a half years and is a worthwhile study to look at but clearly should not be the last word including the senior author of that study said they should not be the last word in this subject yeah I'm glad you remembered to bring that up because that was another you know look I've always personally thought a patient with a personal history of breast cancer not to say so we'll come back to family history personal history of breast cancer with the exception of that one patient who was adamant I mean her words were I would rather be on HRT then I would rather be dead and not be on HRT but I've always felt that that is that is a really scary place to be one of the interesting things that we talked about in the in the heart chapter is precisely because so many women are surviving breast cancer and living for many years after breast cancer that then there increased risk of heart disease in increases and so now there is a new specialty of cardio oncology in which the issue is how do we assure the prolonged survival of our breast cancer patients who are now at risk of dying of heart disease and Alzheimer's disease exactly yes and that's the opor OSIS yeah so you're right it's it is not something that we can just say well that's a narrow subset of women if you've had breast cancer we're gonna take you off the table because we're neglecting as you said 19 out of 20 of these women or certainly nine out of ten of them are not going to die from cancer is 5 million in the United States now when Avram went to talk to the FDA to secure their approval for doing his study of administering HRT to his patients who had had breast cancer one of the doctors on the committee said to him what do you want to do this study for aren't all your patients gonna die anyway and I remember answer but he said on the committee yeah so actually it was a she hmm we eventually did get FDA approval to do this study which we did for 14 years and reported the results every year what were the rewards were the resistance it was a small study but it fit in with the other 14 showing no increased risk of local recurrence contralateral breast cancer or distant recurrence among the women who took hormones compared to the women who didn't when they were matched stage for stage oh so okay got it well I could go on but

[02:17:42] I mean I think I think the point that think the points been made loud and clear again I want to thank you for writing the book I think this was a this is one of those books where there's a lot of work that went into it I mean frankly I think your 2009 paper is itself a great paper and itself has was a lot of work that's a ton of literature to review and I do hope that that women men anyone listening to this who knows a woman comes away at least thinking if they have a strong point of view on this which many people do that they could at least revisit that and take the time you know JFK said something that's one of my favorite quotes and I'm gonna paraphrase it but the gist of it is we too often enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought he says it much more eloquently but this is one of the case studies for that right there are way too many people that I speak with who immediately believe unilaterally believe HRT is an anthem to life and yet when you ask them why they can't give you a single reason other than though WH

[02:18:49] I said so there you are a quote that I like is the more you know the less you fear very well and on that I want to thank you guys for making the trip down here and I want to wish you all the best as you continue to get this message out there thank you you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog at Peter Chia MD com maybe the simplest thing to do is to sign up for my subjective lean on lame once a week email where I'll update you on what I've been up to the most interesting papers I've read and all things related to longevity science performance sleep etc on social you can find me on Twitter Instagram and
