[00:00:10] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter Atia this podcast my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness . and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level at the end of this episode I'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to

[00:00:42] Peter Atia MD com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode welcome to a special episode of the drive to celebrate our 100th anniversary we have decided to try something a little different the title of this episode is strong convictions loosely held and what that basically comes down to is Bob asking me questions about things that

[00:01:13] I've kind of changed my mind on over the past a year and a half so we definitely go into a lot of areas where I had a strong point of view or a reasonable point of view on something and then after either preparing for a podcast or going through a discussion I sort of came away with a different point of view and it's you know usually changed my behavior for the better so we thought this would be kind of an interesting and maybe even clever way to go about doing a retrospective on the first 99 episodes and of course we also do take a moment to sort of talk about some of the things highlights things that I've maybe enjoyed the most or that Bob's enjoyed the most if you like the style of this episode by the way please let us know because I'd be open to doing it again I actually found it quite fun to reminisce so again if you find this interesting please let us know be happy to to repeat this every 50 episodes or so and I guess without any further delay I hope you enjoy episode 1 of the drive so for episode 100 as I alluded to in the introduction we're gonna do something a little bit different and I can't take any credit for this idea so if you like it Bob gets all the credit if you dislike it well hopefully you won't dislike it but many of you know Bob Kaplan the guy behind the guy behind the guy and one of the things that Bob has had the luxury of doing if you can think of it as a luxury is sort of helping me get ready for many of the past 99 episodes of podcasts and there's a lot that goes into making this sausage known as the podcast once in a while I just get up there and wing it but I think more often than not a lot of thought has to go into who do we want to interview what do we want to talk about what do I need to know in order to have this discussion in sort of a thoughtful way and throughout that process my opinion on things can change and sometimes not necessarily through the podcast per se but just through the evolution of learning and what it means to sort of scour information and test a hypothesis and see data that conflict with your pre-existing way of thinking about things I mean all of these things have led to an enormous evolution over a period of time in the way I think about things and do a lot of things and I think I know that on some levels that might sound like a real cop-out to think that one can change their mind on how things work but I think that when I've written this before I think in politics that may be a cop-out but I don't think in science or in medicine that should be viewed as a cop-out I think one should always be malleable and willing to sort of lean into new information and in fact the title of this podcast strong convictions loosely held is a phrase that exists in various different forms so sometimes it's strong opinions loosely held strong opinions weakly held strong convictions weakly held I've seen many different versions of it but in particular this version of it strong convictions loosely held is something that I remember one of my patients telling me a couple of years ago in reference to one of his mentor's in the investment space or this patient of mine is himself an investor and he came out of a very successful hedge fund and he spoke very affectionately about how he was mentored there and he said that that was sort of one of the things that allowed them to be so successful was they had very strong convictions and they would make bold investments based some of those things but they were very loosely held convictions and they were always looking for ways to change their information so in that spirit I am joined today by Bob Kaplan and I think bob has along with maybe two or three other people around me clinically as good an insight into some of the various things I've changed my mind on and so

[00:05:17] Bob how do you want to do this do you want to just ask me about things I've changed my mind on or point them out to me or yeah I think that works do I call you out on things you've changed your mind but again I think it's really important that's a feature not a bug one of the quotes that I heard or somebody talking about this idea of the strong opinions strong opinions weakly held is it was on a blog actually and it's

[00:05:39] Richard Fineman just to confuse everyone Richard Fineman the other the sunni biochemist who said that colleague at nih said and by the way that's sunni su and why just a really confused it's not the shia richard fineman it's yeah yes so he had a colleague at least he wrote this in his blog and he said what you do in science is you make a hypothesis and then you try to shoot yourself down and I think that that's really succinct and the podcast for over the hundred episodes peter has a lot of hypotheses which is great for me because I think I share a lot of those and I get to dig into them as an analyst and so I think from a selfish perspective what I see in podcasts and and the episodes and why

[00:06:25] Peter so successful other than his rugged good looks is that he has a lot of hypotheses he has a lot of ideas and he's not afraid to just say whatever he thinks and try to find the people who are the apps saluté experts or even to somebody who disagrees with him and his take on something try to dig into it further to see basically to see if he can shoot it down because I think the more hypotheses you can shoot down actually things get a little bit simpler even as much as we're waiting in a lot of this uncertainty but you know a lot of that actually occurs behind the scenes I think I mean I hear what you're saying but I think most of the shooting down is not actually done in the podcast it's actually done in the preparation for it and some of the analyses that come after the fact so I also could imagine somebody listening to this saying well your podcasts aren't really that contentious it's not like you're getting into rip-roaring fights it's not like our podcast is sort of an environment where we're always just trying to come up with a contrarian point of view or an antagonistic point of view I think a lot of the places where my minds have been changed has been in getting ready to do it so and sometimes frankly it just doesn't have to do with the podcast but I do think this is a great excuse as any to be 100 episodes into this thing and say hey two years ago what did i do or what did I think or how did I behave in a way that was different from today so yeah hopefully we've got some interesting ones to talk about I've seen that you and Nick have been comparing notes we have I've got a good mixture here of hard topics and maybe a little softer so we'll see if we can sprinkle them in this might be on the harder side metformin so maybe think about I guess in the context of the episodes it was probably it was summer of 2018 or so you started the podcast since then how have your strong convictions if you had them changed at all since then well in the summer 2018 I was taking metformin I had been taking it for about seven years I think I started in 2011 and that was based on a lot of research that I had seen and read and a white paper we had written internally that looked at the benefits of metformin in people with type 2 diabetes and in people without type 2 diabetes but with obesity which was probably just a proxy for hyperinsulinemia but it's not entirely clear but the benefits were not subtle in particular the benefits were around a reduction in cancer mortality and survival with cancer as well so both a reduction in the incidence of cancer and an increase in the survival of cancer and we certainly weren't the only people to figure this out in 2011 there are people who figured this out long before us but we were sort of I think a little bit early on the cusp of viewing metformin as a drug that might have a benefit for people who were not type 2 diabetic but looking for sort of a boost in longevity and truthfully not a lot of our patients in the practice were taking metformin one because my convictions

[00:09:35] I guess weren't that strong they were strong enough that I was willing to take it because I could also kind of monitor a bunch of things in the background but not strong enough that I felt like it should be dispensed like you would dispense Chiclets or tic tacs to people I don't know why I said Chuck would sir because you just spent some like candy anywhere you go we know the Chiclets intact whenever I don't know the last time I had a Chiclets or had tic-tac they even make Chiclets anymore I think they do I don't remember seeing these things in a grocery store and I know that I've seen tic tacs but I don't think I've seen a Chiclets in a long time I miss Chiclets so that said a lot of patients over time would say hey I've heard about this drug called metformin kind of interested in it what's your take on it and sort of share our whitepaper with them and you know in the end we ended up prescribing it for a number of patients I would say off-label meaning these aren't patients that were hyperinsulinemic or diabetic so fast forward well actually we had an interview with NIR Barzilai who is certainly one of the world's experts on this topic that was a very interesting podcast I learned a few things there that I didn't even know before which again I given that I'd been spending so much time thinking about metformin I think that really speaks to nears depth of knowledge on that front but somewhere along the way something changed and the first clue was December of 2018 so in

[00:11:01] December of 2018 which was when I first became interested in zone to training it was the first time I'd ever been checking my lactate levels under low levels of exertion and it was the first time I'd been just checking lactate levels in awhile since I hadn't been doing much lactate testing since I stopped competing in sports where that mattered and I was kind of surprised at how high my lactate levels were especially my fasting lactate just baseline like not exercising lactate levels and that got me poking and poking and poking and coming to the obvious conclusion that metformin is a weak mitochondrial toxin and as such it probably shouldn't be surprising that you'd have a higher level of lactate in medical school every student learns that one of the potential rare complications of metformin is lactic acidosis I'm sure somebody in an ER somewhere has even seen it so again it's not a huge stretch that you would see elevated levels of lactate but it did get me thinking which is wait a minute what if the benefits of metformin are only going to be most pronounced in people who have otherwise quite defective mitochondria to begin with and/or people who can tolerate a slight hit in the sort of mitochondrial performance because of all the other benefits they're getting and what if that doesn't hold true for someone who's otherwise quite healthy and looking to really maximize mitochondrial health and throughput and basically since that time

[00:12:40] I would say that more and more literature have probably emerged suggesting that we might want to think about metformin different in people who are quote unquote sick versus healthy I hate using a stupid division like that sick versus healthy but I mean I could sort of explain what I mean in a bit more detail but I think people get the gist of it what if this is a drug that still offers a sizable benefit to people who are metabolically ill but that benefit sort of evaporates in people who are not and so I would say that my position today so I've stopped taking metformin after making this observation in

[00:13:20] December of 2018 I then spent the next six months maybe not that long maybe the next four months experimenting a lot with it so only dosing it in the evening but not in the morning reducing the dose like making a whole bunch of changes to see if I notice any difference before ultimately stopping it and then stopping it altogether and then realizing a couple of things one yeah my lactate levels went down and my zone two efficiency as measured by lactate went up but also my glucose levels are a bit higher there's no question it was suppressing glucose levels and that was probably a good thing so I have no way of knowing if the net benefit of stopping metformin has been positive or negative but I now would say I reserved metformin prescriptions for patients who obviously are in need of it from the standpoint of glucose and insulin regulation but I don't view it really as a pro longevity agent yet again very likely we'll be having a discussion in two years Bob and I'll have changed my view again there will be some new data that will have emerged that will have told me that yes despite the elevated levels of lactate it's still a net positive even in someone who's metabolically healthy and we've obviously looked at a bunch of other papers that look at the impact of metformin on muscle mass and training effects though a lot of those studies seem suboptimal because they don't include some of the more functional analyses of the muscle that you'd want to see so I don't think this is not an open-and-shut case we have a lot to continue to learn but as of today I have a really different point of view than for the previous decade and I don't think the jury is necessarily out that in the next nine hundred episodes that you do going forward you'll probably have a few that are on metformin and then you may change your thinking on it down the road

[00:15:10] I imagine yeah I mean I think one big thing that's gonna be interesting is to see if tame which is the study that NIR Barzilai spoke about on our podcast this team actually get funded because again if tame is done correctly it's really not going to be weighted towards people with diabetes it's going to be looking at people without diabetes and asking the question can this extend life indirectly via mid the onset of chronic disease so in the end nothing matters more than that is health span and life span all of these other things that we're looking at such as lactate levels and zone 2 efficiency or muscle mass those are proxies for that so in a large enough study if we could actually go after the thing that matters that would hold great weight okay so I'm gonna bring in a little social media into this on Instagram I think it's pretty clear that anybody who follows you that you recently got a dog you're snuggling up with that pup and along the same lines have you changed your mind on having a dog because I believe in some of the podcasts maybe we've talked about in the AMAs and other times about the reluctance to get a dog and maybe you caving at some point down the road yes we do have a puppy four weeks ago we got her little Molly and you are absolutely correct that remember that scene in planes trains and automobiles when I think it was John

[00:16:29] Candy's character says something to the effect of if I'd woken up with my head sewn in the carpet I would have been less surprised nor that line I think I thought the day that we were gonna get a dog was never I just thought it'll never happen because I don't have the bandwidth to absorb any additional work my wife is already functioning at the level of three wives and it's just like why would we do that to ourselves and even though our daughter was the one begging it's not like she can take care of a dog when she's at school or whatever so I was just like now this is never gonna happen and then I don't know what I just don't know what happened I'm for lack of a better way of describing it somewhere in there the resistance just weakened and I was in Australia and

[00:17:21] I must admit prior to that Australia trip we had gone and looked at a couple of puppies in a dog shelter nearby and I must admit there were some cute little puppies in there but I still kind of came away from that experience thinking we just need a couple more years we just need the two guys to be a little bit older and a little less dependent on us and then somehow they just went to the dog shelter when I was in Australia they

[00:17:51] FaceTime me from there and said there's this little girl little puppy Molly she's perfect and they gave me all the reasons why she was perfect and I actually went out to social media to seek an opinion this was like one of the few times social media was actually helpful because this puppy was the runt of her litter and she was visually impaired and I really wanted to know if we were biting off more than we could chew and so I asked that question broadly and the feedback was overwhelming actually both on Twitter and Instagram and people said she's gonna make an awesome puppy and I will say this a month in it's way more work than I expected and not so much for me but certainly for my wife and for my daughter and for me too but I'm taking on 10% of the additional work but I think people were right that a dog that doesn't see perfectly perhaps coupled with some other characteristics of just being a rescued dog she's amazingly gentle and sweet and kind and I don't know so I don't regret it even though it's harder than I thought it would be and there have been a number of accidents that have required significant cleaning but I think I'm getting the point that people had been trying to make for years when I had been saying why would anybody get a dog which is I think there are these intangible benefits that come from a dog that you don't appreciate if you try to just think about it with your logical brain you guys have a dog right we do the dog has passed we're gonna get another one but yeah I mean I definitely share your your feelings about it's funny it sounds a lot like having a kid where you think you get older I think if you don't pop one out when you're younger and you're older you're trying to think of like when's the right time we need to line up all these things it's just like there's never the right time although probably any time is probably the right time if you don't have a kid and then you you raise that child and they're probably accidents along the way as well whether it's a dog or a person this is completely inappropriate but I thought of it when you're talking about loving a dog this is a joke this is not my joke it says want to know who loves you more put your spouse in your dog in the trunk of a car and drive around for an hour when you open the trunk who's happy to see you I honestly I think like that joke I don't know I turned it recently but I would always be amazed that you just think of like dogs and you come home every single day and it's like you went to Afghanistan a tour of duty for three years and you came back and you get that kind of reaction every single day and it's pretty amazing I'm a big fan so I have a so I'm in the club now yeah I'm in the club it was interesting too I caught one thing which is great is that when people ask you where does Peter Atia get his second opinion so you can say Twitter and Instagram it's just nice when it really counts we're gonna go back to the pharmaceuticals we've got rapamycin however your feelings changed on this one well this is sort of been another area of real interest of mine for many years not quite as far back as the sort of metformin interest which started I think around 2010 2011 for me but but probably by about 2012 and certainly by about 2014 when the first that sort of really interesting everolimus paper was published by John Manik Lloyd clicks teen and others in December of 2014 that was a real real peak to my curiosity that was a paper that showed that the strength of vaccination in healthy subjects who were I believe about age 65 could be augmented by basically a rapamycin analogue which again is counterintuitive right that's the adaptive immune system getting better with rapamycin very counterintuitive because of course rapamycin zon label use is specifically to suppress the adaptive immune system and that's what makes it such a efficacious tool for mitigating organ rejection but of course what that study would show was a couple of things which is there are different ways that you can dose it two of the three treatment arms in that study were only being given rapamycin once a week one at five milligrams one at twenty milligrams by the way I said rapamycin I I almost use everolimus and rapamycin interchangeably but it was not rapamycin and that study was sort of a turning point for me and what it really led to was the next four years just a deeper and deeper look into all of the literature we've had I think two podcasts that have been dedicated to rapamycin and mtor one with David

[00:23:02] Sabatini one with Matt K Beuerlein I feel like we're overdue for another one by the way because I know yeah very you know yeah a little inside baseball but those interviews were I think like in 2017 that's right that was a Sabatini and it was this summer we went over there you gave a talk that's right yeah after some that was not eeks August of seventeen so we're way overdue to go back and revisit that but basically just more and more data both in animals and in humans really got me to a point where

[00:23:35] I felt really comfortable that one I was taking enough because you've probably heard me talk about this before that you always think of two risks when you're taking a medication that you don't have an immediate biomarker for so if you're talking about taking a statin or taking a pcsk9 inhibitor well you have a very clear biomarker that at least tells you if the drug is working and similarly you have either clinical signs or biomarkers that tell you if things are going awry clinical signs might be you know muscle aches and you might see outside of complete breakdown of muscle you might still see significant elevations of CKD or significant elevations of labour function tests or things like that you have some sort of bearing on either symptoms that would cause you to revisit your decision to use the medication or lack of efficacy or other signs that tell you hey this isn't a good idea but with rapamycin you don't have any of that I mean on the symptom side obviously if you take too much you're gonna start to see some of the symptoms like mouth sores and things like that but you don't really know if you're taking enough and you don't know if you're taking too much beyond some of those symptoms and so you really have to be able to triangulate on what the right dose is and so that's what basically took me about four years once I sort of felt like I think this makes sense there was still I couldn't quite get to the point where I could understand what to do how to do it and I think that was sort of the big switch that flipped in well probably about 18 months ago kind of in the fall of 2018 and I would still say that Here I am a year and a half later I'm still really eager to figure out ways that we can have biomarkers that can lend some insight into this probably more so on the efficacy side there's still a lot of questions I have on the use of rapamycin even though I'm using it I sort of cycle it a little bit

[00:25:37] I think there's lots to be asked there is it the right cycling is at the right period is the right on versus off all of those things are we don't have answers yet but my convictions are now high enough on the side of something that looks like what I'm doing right now is probably beneficial one thing interesting to just about the metformin and rapamycin is I think you might have talked about this with near that was like January of last year so about a year ago is him and a few other colleagues I think Steve a stat was one of them they were talking about what is the trial that we want to do and I think there is a lot of debate and healthy conversation around whether they should use metformin or rapamycin and I wish that there was enough resources in the world to try both but it sounded like they had to do one then it was metformin yeah I remember actually having that discussion with

[00:26:31] Steve Austin over dinner about four years ago at the time before tame had been fully formulated and saying if you're only gonna get one bite at this Apple rapamycin might be the more interesting agent to study I think their concern was the monitoring was gonna be more complicated just the economics of trying to understand how the immune system was potentially changing was was gonna make that sort of cost prohibitive study unfortunately on the subject of apples I don't know why this is apples I think of archery and shooting an apple on someone's head but are you still practicing archery I am I practice a lot

[00:27:10] I think archery and and driving are the two things that I really sort of just try to carve out time for every single day that I'm not traveling luckily I travel a lot less than I used to so that means more practice how do you think that goes is just thinking that in terms of getting better the more you practice it is it just do the gains become more and more incremental or do you always feel like you're learning something each session so to speak and I mean just in terms of archery I think it's it's more objective where maybe you can take your score and say on average I'm improving over time with those things yeah I mean I think they're both so different and yet so similar I think that with archery it's so hard to explain how addictive it is if you've never done it but I think anybody who's fired a compound bow I think most people are like oh wow I can see why this is this is really something else first of all there's no ceiling to how much one can improve that's the beauty of something like this is you have so much ability to measure how you're doing that you can never say I've kind of plateaued you know I've kind of hit my limit like there's just always a place to go up and really it's many different sports in one there's sort of there's the indoor target you're shooting at twenty yards and at twenty yards you're expected to be able to hit something the size of a quarter so if you think about that something 60 feet away you have to be able to hit a 60 feet away and in a perfect round you would take 60 shots and do that 60 times how many times you think I've done that so far Bob a hundred zero I did there thank you very nice very nice yeah it's the hundredth episode now so I have yet to score a perfect 300 round like a perfect 360 round which is what that would be so it's meeting all 60 we're in the tiny little X and to be clear there are days when I find that fact infuriating like there's times when I get so close and then I blow it at the end and and then there's times I just blow it in the first shot and I'm like frustrated and I don't even want to finish but you also realize that archery is kind of a great metaphor for life and you can't focus just too much on your target you really have to focus on the process or you're not going to get better so one of the things we do a lot in archery is called blank baling which is taking a shot at a huge target like they're these big bales without actually looking at a target like literally not having a target there so there's nothing for you to fixate on to so that you can just go through the sequence and when

[00:29:45] I'm traveling I take this thing called a shot trainer with me which is like a little string attached to something that sits in your hand that sort of mimics the feeling of the riser and I'll take maybe 20 to 40 shots a day in my room hotel room or whatever that are obviously not aimed at a target are not doing anything but just going through the muscle memory of where my feet where is the pressure on my hands how am I feeling the contraction of my rhomboid all those sorts of things again if you're listening to this and you're thinking oh my god how did that guy just manage to waste the last three minutes of my life telling me that again I don't think you have to like archery to appreciate the notion of mastery and I do think that as people we sort of crave getting better at something and that can be lots of things it doesn't just have to be sort of a physical domain it can be an intellectual domain it can be an emotional domain or a relational domain but anyway for me this habit with archery this curiosity started three years ago and now it's it's something I

[00:30:54] I can't imagine if a day goes by that I don't do it I feel like I'm missing something I think there's something to that process I mean I think about my childhood the intellectual pursuit I just always I had these things uncoupled that I just wasn't very good I was not a very good student 1.44 at grade point average in high school what don't fire me well really hard to graduate with that kind of hard to graduate how do you even get a grade point average of one point four four the secret is not showing up that's how you do that what were you doing having fun at least what I thought was having fun at the time but I was also I guess to the larger point here not to get into my childhood too much way to me you can't throw out the 1.44 without explaining it but okay yeah I was also playing hockey and that's a totally different sport but I excelled at it and

[00:31:46] I went through there like you don't automatically excel to sport like that probably particularly in Massachusetts like you got to really work at it and it instilled a lot of stuff in me and I never made the connection until later in my life that intellectual pursuits and educating yourself and things like that it's not very much different it's like in order to be good at blank you are going to suck at blank if you have a few of these victories Peter you have so many of these things I think you're in a way obsessed with mastery and you have so many different things that you've pursued excellence in that you realize even if you have no idea what this thing is if you put the time and the effort in that you can get better at it and so I would just I would put a plug in for anybody to younger age maybe it's like I never thought about it musical instruments that way but maybe it is like I know Olivia plays the drums and that's something you first start and you're just like you can't keep a can't keep a beat and then check in a few months later and you can see that progress and you just know that work and work an effort in time I mean it sounds like grit those kinds of things but they apply to so many different things and just with this podcast is I mean I think there's a parallel there with all the episodes and all the all the information that goes into the prep with the guests and I think that you have a predilection to guests who have a healthy obsession that's called healthy a healthy obsession with these topics as well and they just they know a lot about these things probably through similar practice with those things it's funny you bring that up by the way I actually had this discussion with Olivia two days ago and I don't know why oh I know how it came up we were sitting there at dinner and I was just sort of complimenting her on how impressed I was with how hard she's been studying this year which was a real switch that flipped in her and it's like you don't have to ask her to do her homework she just wants to do it and she makes cue cards and is always like just going out of her way to really try to learn stuff in a way that I just didn't see her doing before and so I was just saying hey that's so great boa and then she sort of asked me she's like well when you were my age how much did you study and I was like Olivia you have no idea you couldn't have done less than I did I was categorically a in school again there's a fine line there and really what it was was I wasn't interested in what was happening and so my interests were elsewhere but the point I made to her is exactly the point that you made which was the reason that

[00:34:12] I was ultimately able to do well in school was fortunately I had spent all of that time still trying to master something and it was that sort of pursuit of that that became transferable and so I agree I just think I do pity the person who's never found it interesting to try to get better at something and to be clear you can take it too far

[00:34:36] I don't consider archery for me to be the greatest form of recreation because I am very internally competitive and I'm sometimes too focused on the result and not the process so there are days when archery is like meditation to me just being out there just feels so amazing and the sun is shining and the wind is blowing and I can sort of disregard the outcome but that's not often the case and so I when you think about the podcast with Ryan holiday where we talk about stillness

[00:35:13] I would say that archery for me does not constitute stillness because stillness can't really have an objective and I think for me archery carries with it too much of an objective so I still think that one has to have those other things in there this is sort of funny I didn't think of it this way but I think this is one thing I've noticed about having a puppy frankly a puppy is as kinetic as she is it is kind of a form of stillness for me like taking her out and walking her and picking up her poop there's nothing else to be doing and there's no outcome associated with it there's no objective it's literally just a forced reason to be outside and to be observing the completely comical nature of a puppy so yeah I think it's funny even though we didn't pose it this way if you want to ask me about another really big change in the way I think about things over the past couple of years it's a huge appreciation for how essential it is to have something that is not object-oriented outcome based in your life like not everything in your life can be outcome based I've recently gone back to swimming actually this might be a good segue to another topic but it's funny when you were talking about stillness and how some of these little things you don't even realize are stillness or stillness I was gonna use the example of washing dishes and then I realized you've got the forks and spoons and knives came so you turned that into a that's a competition and even a lot of people just watch the dishes and it's like it's therapeutic yeah but but turned it into a competition but things that were once like you know saying even swimming for me now is something that is really a form of stillness so I just started swimming again a couple months ago and I go like once a week and I don't keep track of how far I'm swimming

[00:37:07] I know I'm not swimming too far I'm in the water maybe 45 minutes to an hour and all I'm doing is swimming I'm not doing workouts I'm not looking at the pace clock I'm not doing intervals I literally just get in the water with no agenda other than to get wet and hear the sound of water going by my ears probably I'm not even swimming hard enough to get into zone 2 truthfully I doubt my heart rates above 120 that's the next topic yeah that's where I think this is a good segue all right so if you think about it you can talk about it but I think that's one of the things it's like a governor putting a rate limiter on your performance when you do zone two that it's almost like for a lot of people it is for me doing this reminds me kind of of stillness although I might read on the bike or things like that but can you talk about zone 2 importance and how your thinking has changed on that yeah when I stopped riding a bike with a purpose which was for me a time trial so that would have been late 2014 early 2015 I kind of really just stopped doing any low intensity aerobic training so anyone who does ride a bike or swims a lot has plenty of that activity in them so even if you're training for the 200-meter individual medley which is a race that's very short very quick and very painful you still put in hours and hours a week of aerobic base training similarly if you're training for a one-hour all-out time trial you still put in hours a week of low end aerobic base training but when I stopped doing that I was like well I don't need to do this anymore and

[00:38:47] I went from cycling to rowing and running and I was sort of obsessed with just being as efficient as possible so everything was all out I mean I was if I was running it was gonna be a six-minute mile it wasn't gonna be a 9 minute mile I think especially through the interactions that I had with Inigo who I met about a year before I had him on the podcast which was just recently it was sort of meeting him and kind of going back through the literature on that type of training and the benefits that it could have both from the standpoint of metabolic benefits such as glucose insulin dependent an insulin independent glucose mediated disposal looking at just sort of mitochondrial function mitochondrial health density and then looking at sort of the the sort of neurotropic factors the BDNF secretion that can come from this type of activity I mean all of these things were just pointing towards this was a glaring hole in my training that I needed to get back and so that has been great and like you said I mean one of the things about zone 2 that I really enjoy is it's just not that hard you know like frankly sometimes it's just nice to get on the bike and I probably spend three or four hours a week doing it and that is my time to listen to podcasts and audiobooks and I really enjoy it I can't wait to get on that bike as sort of boring as it seems to be sitting on a stationary bike for that long there's never been a day when I've been like I don't feel like doing this I just I always look forward to it and I think in large part it's because I also get to combine it with learning which you wouldn't be doing if you're out there crushing intervals and not that there's something wrong with that I think each of these things has this time in a place but I think that we can do zone to our entire lives we can do it safely and it just yields enormous dividends what's nice about that too for

[00:40:45] I think a lot of your training is you've got the smart oak so you can tie yourself to the mast that the output whether you pedal faster it's gonna give you the output that you pre desired so you can't start cheating which is what I find myself doing when I don't have it on smart just the ERG that I find myself pedaling faster just unconsciously just wanting to push myself harder but do you use a Wahoo kicker what's your device are you a Waterloo yeah wahoo kicker so you can set it to either smart or set it at a certain level yeah yeah I love my wahoo kicker yeah me too did you ever have a Compu trainer back in the day I did yeah I had it on the old Windows computer I remember that I had that little copy trainer and then it's connected to the to the bike trainer yeah tried simulating the Tour de France one year just in terms of the time yeah so talk about time time over summer I had a bucket my wife now I can't believe she's my wife now I was living in Las Vegas it was the middle of our oats sit in our apartment with a bike trainer and had a bucket with ice of water bottles and things like that and eggs I would think I was doing a ketogenic diet so I was eating eggs at the time but I don't know if that was stillness I wasn't going anywhere whose stationary biking so on this topic moving along the importance of deadlifts as an adult how is your thinking changed on this

[00:42:06] I like your history on this one so maybe even take it back to in school when you were you were doing powerlifting before it might have been in vogue yeah yeah long before it was in vogue one of my best friends in high school who was also involved in boxing and martial arts we would go to the Scarborough campus of the University of Toronto every day and lift weights and it was it's still one of the fondest memories I have of what a gym could be like it would certainly be the it was certainly not the sunny warm

[00:42:38] Gold's in Venice but it had some of those features which was old-school lots of iron nothing fancy of course unlike a nice gym this was like two storeys below ground so there were no windows poorly ventilated so in the summer it was staggeringly hot in the winter it was so cold you felt like you were getting frostbitten by touching the iron and aside from me and my friend there were no kids there we were 14 15 16 years old and it was this group of men who to this day I think back and like can't believe how strong they were and most of them competed in powerlifting and so that sort of got us interested in powerlifting and that's how we sort of started putzing around with it and as most people know who are listening or I guess people who might know who are listening powerlifting is different from Olympic lifting powerlifting is three lifts the deadlift the squat and the bench press and so yeah make a long free short grew up doing a lot of dead lifting a lot of squatting a lot of bench pressing it was always very horrible at benchpress much better at squatting and dead lifting fast forward to I don't know a few years ago maybe three years ago I had an injury where I kind of tore or partially tore one of my obliques I don't even remember how I did it if you remember it was very stupid whatever I did and everything my phone book that would be great possible but everything went kind of sideways after that and I really was never able to fully deadlift again without some discomfort and so again this is now take it back to maybe two thousand sixteen I sort of decided you know what maybe the deadlift has reached its point of futility and maybe I've extracted all

[00:44:35] I'm going to out of that and there's no denying what a wonderful movement it is I'm in terms of being a total hip hinge compound movement but I was like look I could probably get most of the benefits of a deadlift doing things that place me under less load and also again in the spirit of thinking about longevity I thought why does one need to subject themselves to twice their body weight or more in an axial load so I sort of got away from it and then I think all that kind of changed when I started DNS dynamic nor muscular stabilization which

[00:45:07] I started about 18 months ago and we're gonna have a podcast on this topic because it's just there's so much I want to talk about here and so actually I think today we got an email about how we're trying to make some time for this podcast so we'll definitely if you're listening to this and you don't know what DNS is dynamic nor muscular stabilization by all means you should go read about it but we're gonna have at least a one solid podcast on this but it was through that process that I realized actually the deadlift for me was going to be beneficial not because of the metabolic benefits I was not going to be doing Tabata deadlifts like I used to or even by trying to set records for how much I could lift or anything like that but rather because it becomes a beautiful audit for everything working perfectly so I dead lifted this morning so today's a Monday I deadlift it on

[00:45:58] Saturday I dead lifted a few days before that like I deadlift at least twice a week often three times a week both straight bar and trap bar and Bob I don't go that heavy I don't know the last time maybe I've had 400 pounds on one of those on the trap bar in the past year but I you we sort of stopped at about 350 to 375 on the straight bar I'm even lighter maybe 185 I do a lot of slow ascend tricks I film every single rep of every single set and I study it and I send it to Beth Lewis who is my coach and we do so much around making this deadlift perfect and I'd rather take a lightweight and dead lifted perfectly several times a week and I'm not doing like killing crusher sets like I mean it's today was four sets of ten five sets of ten maybe and at no point was I like past my limit so again I can push myself harder doing other things but what I could get out of doing that deadlift perfectly is do I have just the right amount of thoracic extension do I have just the right curvature in the lumbar spine am i activating my glutes am i activating my hamstrings am i pulling back instead of pulling up am i wedging correctly like all of this little stuff translates biomechanically to the activities of daily living that matter to me like getting up off the floor picking up one of my kids lifting a piece of luggage or something like that and so if I can do the deadlift and it feels right then I know I'm ready to do everything correctly and when I'm dead lifting and I feel like hey this isn't correct this doesn't feel right well first of all now I've really learned what that feeling is and secondly I've now learned the steps that I can go back and reconstruct what needs to be done and so one of the things I definitely want to do at some point in the next year is actually put together kind of a video on deadlift and deadlift preparation because I think that there are probably ten exercises that I do as a way to get ready to deadlift and they don't take long like this my deadlift checklist is like 10 to 15 minutes so it's not so onerous it's almost like ketosis the way we were talking about it in the past right which is it's not even clear if it's the ketones themselves that can sometimes be the benefit versus the metabolic conditions that allow you to make them right in other words I'm not even sure how much of the benefit is the actual deadlift versus all the things you have to do to do the deadlift correctly and one of the most exciting things just on this the last thing I say on this is it never occurred to me up until a year and a half ago that you could actually deadlift in a way that puts your spine under traction that's very counterintuitive you would think that anytime you're lifting under an axial load your spine is under compression but it turns out when you learn the right positioning and you understand how to create intra-abdominal pressure and you know how do we long gate your spine you can actually deadlift and create traction in the spine actively and that's why dead lifting is the most important thing I do before I get on an airplane because when you're on an airplane and you're sitting there for five or six hours what you really want to do is not let your spine be compressed and the deadlift Prime's me to then go and sort of maintain that activated form of traction yeah it's a significant investment but I would say it's worth it that you'll bring your hex bar to the gate before your flight yourself up and hang out a few sets I mean I don't know what it is about the

[00:49:48] TSA guys they get so wigged out when you have your hex bar there's a gate overhead yeah if your TSA pre they don't mind as much but if you're not TSA pre they just lose it sticklers they're sticklers yeah separate topic a little lighter maybe have you read any good books lately I am about a third of the way through Andrew

[00:50:11] Solomon's far from the tree have you read that no I have not super interesting it's a long book so yeah it's gonna take a while but I've actually thought it would be probably really interesting to have Andrew on the podcast he's obviously just one of those guys that when you're in the process of writing a book you probably shouldn't be reading their books because they just make you not want to write yours anymore because you're so bad you're like oh how does he do it it's like Sid Mukerji you know it's just one of these people who are just so so exceptional in their ability to write not a word is wasted everything is just perfect so prior to that I reread stillness is the key for the third time

[00:50:52] I know we interviewed Ryan a few months ago that is a book that has just spoken to me probably more than anything else Ryan has written and he's written some really great books in that series and just overall the other two books in that series ego is the enemy which I'm also a huge fan of and the obstacle is the way but stillness is really the one that kind of captivates me and that's why

[00:51:14] I've just finished it for a third time I've also gifted that book probably half a dozen times and so yeah I suspect there'll be at least a fourth reading of that book in my future what about you good question so I was thinking in the context of the podcast and there are so many books I guess it's not recently but for the guests just reading a lot of their books is it's great it's a pleasure actually think of Gary Taubes and and how you read why we get fat and you had a list of questions and you asked him all those questions there's a version of that where I get to read these books and I have a list of questions and I'll ask you to ask the questions or ping them off of you so actually what I'm reading right now it's not it's not out yet but it's really interesting which is Vinay Prasad who probably be right around the time of this episode I guess or now we've recorded around that time and he has a book called malignant which is really interesting it gets into public health policy and cancer it's funny about the books that you reread there's like a tulip quote it's funny he's now like the

[00:52:12] I would say Einstein or Lincoln but you attribute all these kind of quotes to him he has a lot of aphorisms is it better to read five books or to read one book five times I think it depends on the quality of the book asura Raza is another guest on the podcast hasn't come up yet that's right yeah her cell will be with her very soon that looks like a great book

[00:52:35] I'm waiting when you had Sid Mukerji on to he talked about a PBS that they're gonna do another a follow-up which is not a book but for that podcast I went back and I read the Jean and the Emperor of all maladies and the Three Laws which is like I guess it's a Ted book it's almost like a TED talk in a book and that is really really interesting and you went into each law in depth there my thing is I usually go in the sauna about an hour a day and

[00:53:00] I either print out a stack of papers that I want to read for research or just read a book in there so I should probably just write all they put these down in a spreadsheet and see what I'm accumulating as far as reading but a bunch of it has been on the podcast prep I also read that stillness is the key which I found that's definitely worth reading again I've got a bunch of others but we'll move on baby aspirin and the use for prevention of blood clots or thrombosis during a flight yeah so I used to be of the mindset that anybody who was on a flight on a long enough flight should be taking a baby aspirin for prevention of deep vein thrombosis and I just sort of assumed that that was the case I mean it's widely understood that baby aspirin or aspirin in general inhibits platelets and platelets of course are one of the cellular matters in blood that's responsible for clotting so it just struck me as reasonable and then I don't know again maybe about a year year and a half ago kind of did a little digging into this and found that there really wasn't much evidence that aspirin or baby aspirin had any efficacy in mitigation of deep vein thrombosis especially on an airplane and in digging around we sort of found that well the gold standard would of course be heparin which could either be fractionated or ultra low molecular weight heparin but these are not very practical I mean intravenous heparin is obviously not something you're gonna do before a flight and even the low molecular weight heparins have to be injected so we found a couple of supplements online one was called flight tab I think I think it was

[00:54:46] FL ite tab at the time you could buy it on Amazon I haven't looked in a while to see if it's still there but it was a pretty potent agent that actually had pretty remarkable evidence that it prevented DVT and then the other is something that is also pretty easy to get over-the-counter called not a kinase and I think that the natto is a plant it's plant derived I think it actually kind of it's like sort of a sort of stinky odor is sort of the types of foods that it occurs in naturally or certain types of mushrooms or you know cheese's or things like that but but these are things that actually turned out to have far more evidence and they were both things I had never heard of until we sort of really dug into this question so that was a bit of a humbling experience because you think well look on first principles aspirins got to be thinning the blood it's got to be good for this and then you realize well wait a minute when you even something as simple as that when you actually really antagonized the literature it turned out not to be the case and the things that did seem to have some efficacy or things I'd never even heard of so it's a little scary because it makes you wonder how many times is that happening throughout the course of my life yeah this sounds apropos in terms of strong convictions held loosely your feeling on generic drugs obviously

[00:56:01] Kathryn eben was a guest there what do you think prior to that and some of the stuff that you were seeing and I guess the clinic or at least though some of your patients and taking generics yeah I mean Katherine's podcast is I mean it would be hard to say that that hasn't been one of the 10 most important podcasts that we've done in this first hundred if you haven't listened to that

[00:56:21] I suggest you just hit pause on this now and go back and listen to it what number was it you know you can search even EBA N and your podcast player and it'll show up but I think prior to that my view had always been generics are great they're the exact same as branded except they're a fraction of the cost and branded drugs are a scam that was sort of my default thinking all through medical school I'd say in the last couple of years I began to wonder if maybe there are a couple generics that weren't great because in the case of certain drugs where you do have a very clear biomarker for use such as a statin you put a patient on Crestor but of course they don't get crest or they get reserved a statin and you look at their blood level two months later and there's no change in anything that you would expect to see a change in and when you query them they tell you they've taken it every day and you believe them because there's nothing they need to laia they can easily say I forgot if they did you see a couple of those things and you start to wonder if maybe not all generics are created equal but then of course in the discussion with Kathryn I came away thinking oh boy this is a totally different way of doing things and it's frankly it's completely changed the way we do things in the practice now so we work primarily with one pharmacy that will either at our insistence or the patient's insistence only issue branded drugs sometimes even when it is a little bit costly and when we do generics we do it through the lens of looking at the companies specifically that make them and at least taking a first-order pass at cross-referencing that with sort of an FDA list of potential bad actors so I don't think that has completely mitigated the problem but I think it's probably taken care of three-quarters of it another one this one is a omega-3 fatty acids your thoughts on that and obviously bill

[00:58:22] Harris is somebody who came on the podcast recently so Kathryn eben was number 71 just for that was in September of last year and Bill Harris was in December of last year and he came on and talked about omega-3 fatty acids so what's your take on omega-3 and how has it changed this is funny I think I'm still sort of in my evolution on this I mean I think I've Longley held the for a long time held the Veet Longley is that even a word did I just make that up long we have long li held the view I have for a long time held the view that

[00:58:54] EPA and DHA are beneficial obviously had some questions as to again how much of it was the other things that you got when you ate things that were high in epa and DHA versus just the supplemental thing i would say that my thinking has evolved to the point where epa and DHA by themselves are quite potent drugs and we really ought to think of them in that way so that in fact you look at a drug like vez epi' which is just pharmaceutical grade epa at the tune of 4 grams I mean that is as potent as any anti cardiovascular disease drug that we have so clearly EPA has a benefit to it especially in patients that are at risk for cardiovascular disease I think with

[00:59:41] DHA the clinical trials data are still not clear there's a pretty interesting setback on a clinical trial in the fall that was looking at a combination of EPA DHA and it was a trial that was stopped for futilities so there was no harm from it but there wasn't the big bang benefit that we frankly expected to see based on the earlier trial with the SEPA which was just EPA I think the discussion with

[01:00:08] Bill Harris certainly increased my level of confidence in the necessity of EPA and DHA and also probably drove me to a point of thinking about it being a higher level that we should strive for we used to generally look at an RBC or red blood cell membrane level of about 8% to 10% but I think I came away from the discussion with Bill Harris thinking we could really push that up to 12 14 percent without undesirable side-effects and also getting more value or more benefit from it I think one area that bill had a very strong conviction on that I've also I've kind of had the opposite conviction too so I think I'm still in the space of wanting to learn this so so I think my strong conviction had generally been that excessive amounts of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids or pou FFA's were generally not a good thing and the associative data there is not hard to understand but again the problem with the associative data is things that are full of omega-6 poof Azhar often crap so it's easy to see an association with high omega-6 polyunsaturated fat and disease chronic disease but Bill's point was that the omega-6 polyunsaturated fats aren't harmful it's just the diets that are rich in them tend to be void in epa and

[01:01:30] DHA so his real takeaway was don't think about omega-6 apply inside short of fats you just need to add more epa and DHA in that's the issue and so i think you and i have been talking about this actually over the past couple of weeks but i think i'd really like to go back and do a podcast that looks specifically at the omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid discussion and really kind of dive into the whole PUFA literature from an omega-6 standpoint because again this is a very polarizing topic people just on both sides of this the both sides I think have people that I think are quite bright so I'm a bit confused on that and for me it's not really a huge issue personally because I just don't gravitate towards those oils like I find them to be kind of gross and I don't know why you'd want to consume like I wouldn't ever it wouldn't occur to me put canola oil on a salad when I could put olive oil on or in something like that so on a personal level I think the point is somewhat moot because n6 PUFA don't make up much of my diet but I do think it has huge implications for

[01:02:31] Public Health and I think it has implications for our patients when we think about people who are potentially eating a lot of PUFA okay one question here one theme in recent episodes not overly related to medicine has been the idea of saying no my thing Jason freed Rick Elias actually probably Jason's free twice I've talked about this thing and and how you how you viewed this sort of in the past and and now today this idea of saying no how good you are at it when you think it's applicable and if you've improved on this

[01:03:05] I've definitely improved on it in the sense that there was a day when I couldn't say no or wouldn't say no to anything or anyone the pendulum was pretty far off on one side where I was basically on a treadmill of sort of saying yes to anything and everything that was asked of me began to realize that that just couldn't do that anymore and I'm getting a lot better at saying no and I don't think I'm doing it at a level that's unhealthy either I mean you can obviously take these things too far extremes on both sides and you could sort of say no to everything and become sort of dysfunctional in that way it's hard to do it is hard to do and I remember there was a podcast that there was someone that Tim Ferriss had on his podcast god I want to say like a year and a half ago I forgot the name of the person but hopefully we'll find it for the shownotes it was a really good episode on saying no and I remember that was actually the first time I started really contemplating it and I remember shortly after listening to it I had someone who I really liked respected called me and said hey I really like you to be on the board of such-and-such and

[01:04:13] I mean deep down I knew it was gonna be a pain in the ass I knew it was just gonna be so much work and even just the travel of getting to the board meetings was like wasn't in a place where there was easy access and other things and I remember like thinking I just I just got to do this I just got to do this and I remembered one of the lessons in that podcast was don't answer just say can I get back to you so I pulled the can I get back to you on this and then with the benefit of a little bit of distance I realized Peter you're crazy like you can't possibly do this thing you already lament the time you don't get to spend at home so then the next day I just called him back and said hey

[01:04:55] I can't do this I'm sorry but here's why and just like this person in the podcast with Tim said the guy understood it wasn't like I'd committed some Grievous heinous crime and declining this so I mean that's just an important thing to remember and yeah I continue to look forward to refining my no saying skills it's interesting I think it's always hard for ourselves to do it but then when you think in the context of how you work and operate with other people or decision-making you'll very easily say no if it's whether it's like having more patients in the practice if it's not gonna benefit what you have going on then you're usually very matter-of-fact but I think it's almost like a it might be like the ego getting in the way or something where you just you want to tackle everything I mean I think it's this is probably a little cathartic but it's getting into some of this research where you'll have to tell me no as far as the the deep dives and the rabbit holes that I want to go down where I said like we're just we're on a mission I want to give the milk analogy but for a lot of these episodes and a lot of the guests a little bit of the deep diving can help but I'll have oftentimes it's really about the stuff that you say know to help shape the things that you actually are focusing on day to day that matter yeah that's the insight that I think Jason freed brought to his episode really well which was when you're saying yes to something you're actually saying no to something else you just don't know what that something else is yet that's a very important insight then again I would anybody who struggles with saying no I think would benefit greatly from actually both episodes with Jason because I think we touch on them in both yeah yeah it's funny I think a Tim

[01:06:29] Ferriss just himself talking about saying no and his evolution he's probably done his own podcast talking about that I always think of I do a lot of reading on Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett but if you look at their schedules they're like practically empty I think Munger refers to himself as like a book with legs that all he does is he just reads and that's how he gets smarter and so he jealously guards his time he would look at the schedule and you'd say oh it's wide open looks like you know if you're the secretary and say yeah it looks like the schedules wide open nope it's more about saying no and what that schedule can be open to if you have all those vacancies there yeah

[01:07:04] I have great envy for that and I hope to one day get to that point where my calendar doesn't look like it does now and it's much more last-minute things that are being scheduled where you can actually say like hey do I want to have this meeting tomorrow as opposed to do I want to have this meeting in three months so I think maybe one more question if you want to take it I know this one is difficult because it's like what is the thing that's like asking you like which of your children is your favorite but as far as the episodes go to any of them stand out in your mind maybe even just like the style or the the way it's happened or separate question as far as just doing a podcast hosting a podcast and interviewing people and having conversations are there things like going into this that you thought I mean part of it was like you never wanted to do a podcast and now

[01:07:49] I think that you might have a different opinion about that so how about that strong opinion maybe a little more loosely held today as far as doing a podcast yeah you're absolutely right I mean I think the first time the idea of a podcast was floated to me was about 2014 and I mean it was the worst idea I ever heard and it was mostly due to a fear of the amount of work that would go into it because at the time I knew a few people who were doing podcasts and it was sort of the only thing they did was like well that's a non-starter I just don't have the time to do something where it's the only thing I'm doing so it's just not gonna happen and I sort of kind of kept that point of view frankly until about two years ago when we or maybe a little less than two years ago when we'd said to give a try so yeah that was a very strongly held or strong conviction fortunately loosely enough held that I was able to sort of get out of my own way on that and yeah I really can say that I have enjoyed it a lot it is hard it is a little more work than I thought but also we have such a big team that works on it that I have it easier than probably a lot of people who do a podcast in that I have a great research team we have two people that work exclusively on the podcast and Travis and Nick so all the heavy lifting of making show notes and things like that none of that falls on my shoulders so all I really have to think about is having discussions with people and and trying to think of topics that I want to meet people who can speak to those topics so I've loved it and it's hard to believe or hit a hundred because you sort of realized there's not that many podcasts that sort of get into the territory of multiple hundreds of episodes and I mean barring some unforseen thing we're gonna one day be that podcast that's on our 300th episode or something crazy now to your first question honestly I just I've thought about this a lot and I do I get asked this question a lot Bob which is what is my favorite episode and I just it's so hard because they are so different there are some that are I've really enjoyed from a technical standpoint I think the

[01:10:07] Rick Johnson podcast and the Keith Flaherty podcast really stand out to me as podcasts that I have gone back and listened to several times because of the technical content in them so they're probably half a dozen that are like that for me where they're just just so much interesting information that I can't wait to go back and listen to them again which I don't listen to most of the podcasts I think on the other side of the coin there are experiences for me like interviewing Damon Hill was just unbelievable and just to have him be so open and so just available to talk through his own difficulties and obviously everything that went into his career and beforehand that was a really special episode for me as just a fan of his and I was such a fan of f1 and obviously a fan of Senna who was his teammate when he died I thought the Rick

[01:11:03] Elias podcast really even though I knew Rick really well and there was nothing we talked about that I didn't know but I just as it was unfolding and we were having the discussion I remember thinking you know what I think a lot of people are gonna really benefit from this episode I know I was and then we've already touched on some but you at the Catherine ebin podcast which is just an unbelievable opportunity to I think help people with information which is also kind of part of the itch that we're trying to scratch here so the irony of it is i if i sat here long enough Bob I could tell you something special about all 99 that came before this with the exception of the AMAs I could probably rattle off something special about 80 of these podcasts through the lens of one or more filter yeah I'm gonna bring Tom Brady into the podcast I mean it's probably a record as far as how long I've waited

[01:11:55] I think he's often asked the question what's his favorite Super Bowl ring and he says the next one so I think maybe you think about that with the episodes what's your favorite episode might be the next one for me I mean that's how it is for me I like reflecting on these episodes but the research that goes into these guests and I think we just have a lot of similarities as far as our interest so for me for me for you to be creating the podcast that you would want to listen to having Z dog who's your buddy Stanford from Z dog to Marty I'm akari Mac Mac or a is a Macri to Mark

[01:12:31] Messier to say like why hasn't somebody sat down for a multiple hour podcast with Mark Messier and just talk about the oilers one of the greatest teams if not I'm sure you'd say maybe the greatest team ever in any sport I mean that stuff to me is so cool yeah I think about it that way that it similar it's I could talk about each one of them and how great they are but I'm hopefully looking forward to the ones that come to well I mean I am as well I think we're I just I know we're getting better at this and I remember having a I may be mentioned this once before on a podcast whether it was ours or someone else's that I had this little tiny fear when we started that we were gonna run out of things to talk about and run out of people to interview and I was sort of reluctant to start this thing and then realize well after 50 episodes there's nothing left to do and

[01:13:18] I think you can attest to the fact that our list of people we want to have on is growing at the same rate as our am a list of questions like we can't interview people quick enough at the rate that we want to learn stuff so I have a feeling we're gonna be able to do this for a very long time and I do look forward to getting better at it is a craft and it's hard I do try to listen to some of the podcasts to learn from them and I've certainly picked up a number of things I could be doing better and as I think I talked about on Tim's podcast I enjoy listening to other really good podcasts for for some insight into how to do this thing better but anyway I'm excited about it and it's hard to imagine what the next hundred have to hold actually yeah well I'm looking forward to it I think maybe we

[01:14:06] Cheers have some champagne or you can wrestle a centenarian to commemorate the moment I'm sure that's what you probably have it on your schedule anyway yeah I've got a little bit of centenarian boxing this afternoon so yeah well Bob this was a good idea I don't if it was your idea or next idea but maybe both of you guys deserve credit for this but I think this is a fun way to commemorate a hundred kind of looking back and looking forward absolutely thank you for listening to this week's episode of the drive if you're interested in diving deeper into any topics we discuss we've created a membership program that allows us to bring you more in-depth exclusive content without relying on paid ads it's our goal to ensure members get back much more than the price the subscription thought and membership benefits include a bunch of things one totally kick-ass comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic paper person thing we discuss on each episode the word on the street is nobody's show notes rival these monthly AMA episodes are asking me anything episodes hearing these episodes completely access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear everything without having to listen to seals like this the qualies which are a super short podcast typically less than five minutes that we release every Tuesday through
