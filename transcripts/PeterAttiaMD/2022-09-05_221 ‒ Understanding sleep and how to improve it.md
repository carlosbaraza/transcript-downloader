Here's a comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast about sleep:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode compiles key insights from multiple conversations with sleep expert Matt Walker, focusing on understanding sleep's evolutionary importance, optimal conditions, and practical improvements. The discussion covers everything from basic sleep architecture to specific recommendations about temperature, light exposure, and sleep aids. The episode particularly emphasizes how critical sleep is as a foundation of health, rather than just another pillar alongside diet and exercise.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Sleep architecture consists of NREM (stages 1-4) and REM sleep cycling every 90 minutes [00:17:57]
- Brain waves change from high frequency/low amplitude during wakefulness to low frequency/high amplitude during deep sleep [00:17:57]
- Core body temperature needs to drop for optimal sleep [01:00:00]
- Optimal room temperature is 65-67 degrees Fahrenheit for most people [01:00:00]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal recommendations:
- Maintain regular sleep/wake times [00:45:00]
- Create a wind-down routine before bed [00:45:00]

[00:00:03] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia this podcast my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness full stop and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level at the end of this episode i'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to peteratiamd.com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode [Music] welcome to another episode of the drive as we've released so many episodes over the past four years we realized we've covered a lot of topics in detail sometimes it can be hard to kind of keep up and try to piece it together we also realize that there are listeners today who weren't exactly listeners a year ago or three years ago or four years ago so we did a test of this idea back in may of 2022 where we did an episode that pulled a variety of clips from previous podcasts but all on one topic which was exercise the feedback we received from that episode was overwhelmingly positive and people asked for more so this week we're going to do it again and of course we're going to pick a different topic this topic is going to be sleep probably something we get just as many questions on as frankly anything else we put these clips in the order of what we think is the best way to listen from top to bottom but in between some of the clips i'm going to provide a little bit of commentary to set the stage our hope is that this will not only allow you to understand the topic of sleep better but also help identify some of the previous episodes in case you actually want to go back and listen to those in more detail in each of these clips i'm going to be joined by sleep expert matt walker matt has been on the podcast several times including three amas one thing to note is that some of these clips are from ama so if you're not a subscriber you'll actually get a sense of what we cover during those episodes this is still a new concept and this is only our second time doing this so we really do want the feedback if you like this tell us we'll keep doing it if you don't we'll scrap it so without further delay i hope you'll enjoy this special episode of the drive [Music] firstly you know it took mother nature 3.6 million years to put this eight hour thing called a night of sleep in place and within the space of 70 years if you look at the data we've lopped off almost 20 to 25 of that you know imagine coming along and saying you know in the next hundred years i think what i'm going to do is for the entirety of human society i'm going to reduce their oxygen saturation by about 20 to 25 do you think that's a good idea and the answer is no no it's such a great example i'll pause for a moment just to tell a funny story that you you and i have talked about off mike which is up until about 2012 i was in the i'll sleep when i'm dead camp and i i know what led to that it wasn't there was a very deliberate decision at the end of medical school when a good friend of mine with all the best intentions who was a year ahead of me so he was now in at the end of his internship as i was about to begin mine he said and this is in the days when we didn't have the 80-hour work week requirement in residency so we averaged i think about 114 hours a week in the hospital so he said to me look peter you're you're signing up for you know whatever five seven years of this thing if you spent every moment outside of the hospital sleeping you would still be tired the only difference is you wouldn't have any fun so make sure you live every moment that you're not in the hospital to the fullest and so for me that basically meant if i wasn't in the hospital i was swimming i was going out with my friends i was trying to meet girls like and i was doing anything everything such that during that period of my life i i just know because i was pretty adamant about recording how much time like i was very wed to this idea there's 168 hours in a week if i'm spending you know 114 of them here and i spend this many driving i spend this many getting groceries and i spend this many swimming and blah blah blah blah i think i i was about 28 hours a week of sleep so it wasn't four every night because you'd have none and then six and then three and then eight like you could binge sleep from time to time but it was pretty much 28 a week i'll come back to some of the implications of that but fast forward a few years i'm talking to a good friend of mine who's a physician who like you is adamant about you know the importance of sleep and we're having dinner one night and he says he's challenging me on this and he says so let me get this straight you just decided that you're going to sleep half of what is evolutionarily programmed and i said yeah he goes does it strike you as odd that evolution would have designed us to spend a third of our life not mating not watching out for predators not hunting for food but doing this thing for some other purpose do you think that thing must have been important and it was such an obvious argument but it really overnight changed the way i thought about this which was evolution went to great lengths to do this and superficially at great cost to us right i mean you could argue well imagine you didn't need to sleep and you could spend 24 hours a day foraging for food or a mate or some other thing but it didn't so it's sort of it's sort of like there's probably a reason we are not anaerobic to your point about reducing oxygen saturation by 25 you know if you were to think about that you know during sleep just as you said you're not eating you're not finding food you're not finding a mate you're not reproducing you're not caring for your young you're vulnerable to predation on any one of those grounds but especially all of them put together as a collective completely anti-evolutionary it sounds like the dumbest thing and you know often said and it has been said before if sleep doesn't serve an absolutely vital set of functions it's the biggest mistake that the evolutionary process has ever made and we now realize from this constellation of evidence that mother nature did not make a spectacular blunder in putting this thing called an eight hour sort of need of sleep in place it is the greatest life support system that you could ever wish for it is a remarkable health insurance policy and what's great is that it's largely democratic it's mostly free and in terms of a prescription from a doctor it's largely painless so i almost wanted to title the book consciousness is overrated or just sometimes dot dot consciousness is overrated but when you really look at the evidence in terms of risk de-risking just about every disease that is killing us in the developed world it's very hard to look no further than sleep and that's why i don't want to trivialize diet and i don't want to trivialize movement and activity but what i would say is that if you want to put sleep up against either one of those two and kind of play the whole head-to-head game which i don't think we need to do here i would simply say that sleep is the foundation on which those two other things sit it's not the third pillar of good health i think it is the foundation that's a really interesting way to think about it because i typically describe four pillars or five if you include all of the exogenous molecules that you could lump together but another way to think about it which again i don't think is necessarily the right way to think about it but sometimes it makes the point if you deprive yourself of food how long can you survive well we have one person up to 382 days even someone who's as lean as you could survive 30 days with no food how long could you survive without water depends greatly on the temperature etc but you could make the case that deprivation of sleep would result in the quickest reduction of health certainly more than not eating or not exercising for you know a period of time and those studies have been done in wrath and actually we know some of this from humans who have been trying to in fact didn't the guinness book of world records i can't remember if i read this in your work they've actually banned attempts at longest period of sleep deprivation so i mentioned this yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you guys could still try and beat the world record of sleep deprivation and it got up to about sort of i think the last true effort was about 24 days but i i think it was debatable that one but based on the weight of the scientific data the relationship with between sleep loss and mental health sleep loss and cancer sleep loss cardiovascular disease sleep loss and metabolic syndrome guinness started to feel very very uncomfortable and then when suicide came on the table it pulled it so in other words think about this you know there was a gentleman felix baumgardner i think his name was who sponsored by red bull went up in a capsule in a hot air balloon to the outer surface of our planet this was about four years ago he is remarkable he opened the door and then he jumped out and he fell back down to earth at over a thousand kilometers an hour using his body alone he broke the sound barrier and he successfully came down and now guinness says for that just fine however to sleep deprive yourself no much more unsafe right we're not going to let it happen you are allowed just to put it in context you're allowed up to 12 jumps off niagara falls basically but that's okay but no no you're not gonna that's such a great point [Music] so let's shift gears just a little bit and go back to the polysome let's explain to people because we're going to eventually have to talk about tracking these things and i want to bring up some of the sort of commercially available ways that people do that which i think by definition are still not accurate enough for people to you know compare them to their polysome but if i came into your lab tonight and i was willing to go to sleep there and you would hook me up to an eeg what are the different patterns of brain waves and how would you morphologically describe them and then bucket them by these stages you've already sort of touched on a little bit as deep ram deep rem deep non rem etc yeah so upon falling asleep human beings and in fact all mammals will experience two different stages of sleep one of them is called non-rapid eye movement sleep the other is rapid eye movement sleep non-rem sleep has been further subdivided into four separate stages which are unimaginatively called stages one through four thank god yeah i know yeah i think that's all that the sleep-deprived people who are you know experimenting could come up with at that time um so increasing in their depth of steep sleep so stages three and four of non-rem sleep are the really deep restorative stages of sleep stages one and two are the lighter stages of sleep and then on the other hand we have rapid eye movement sleep or rem sleep which is named not after the popular michael stipe pop band but because of these bizarre horizontal shuttling eye movements that occur during the stage of sleep these rapid eye movements so you have these two different types of sleep and they will essentially as you fall asleep here in at the sleep center at berkeley they will go into essentially a battle for brain domination throughout the night and that cerebral war between non-rem and rem is going to be won and lost every 90 minutes and then replayed every 90 minutes to create what we call a standard cycling architecture of sleep or what we call a hypnogram of sleep and so what you will see is that upon falling asleep you'll go into the light stages of non-rem stages before we do that let's say before i fall asleep when i'm just laying in the bed how would you describe my brain waves under the wakeful condition so at that point what we typically see is that when you close your eyes the back of the brain goes into what's called an alpha rhythm so when you're awake your brain shows this remarkably frenetic high frequency electrical activity in other words your brain is going in terms of its brain waves it's going up and down many many times a second and the amplitude is and the amplitude is very small which kind of is paradoxically you think if i'm awake then my brain is active and so the size of those brain waves should be big it's not it's actually very small and here's the reason different parts of your brain are doing different things at different times so those brain waves sort of are all cancelling each other out so the analogy would be if i were to dangle a microphone above a sports stadium what i'm picking up is the signal from the the crowd of a hundred thousand individual neurons that sit underneath it that's how an eeg electrode is now before the game starts that's wakefulness and at that point the hundred thousand people in the stadium 100 000 brain cells they're all speaking to each other at different moments in time so there's a lot of cancellation so there's a lot of cancellation they're not all coordinated but it's very fast and frenetic so i just get this signal that is very desynchronized and it's not synchronous so they're not summing their power together so the size of that brain wave is not very big but that's why the frequency is so high the frequency is high meaning that you're sort of going up and down maybe 50 60 times per second now as you start to fall asleep or actually even before you start to fall asleep as you're lying in bed a week the back of the brain is the first part of the brain that really starts to settle down it goes into what we call alpha rhythm when you close your eyes and i assume that's just because the occipital cortex is in the back and you've closed your eyes brilliant so the back of the brain visual brain if you close your eyes that part of the brain essentially stops processing the outside world and it goes into its sort of default state when it's a wake of slowed frequency it drops down from maybe 50 times per second down to about let's say 10 cycles per second but still relatively low amplitude but still relatively low amplitude then once you start to actually transition when you make that bridge from the world of wakefulness to sleep as you sort of cross through that window from one of those worlds to the next something bizarre happens and if anyone out there is lucky enough to be listening to this and they have a bed partner you can actually see this just look at their eyelids as they're falling asleep and what you'll see is that their eyeballs start to roll in their sockets and they're called slow rolling eye movements now we don't know why the eyes roll in the sockets like that but it's the first sign that you're making the transition from the world of wakefulness into sleep we use it as almost an indicator of the transition into sleep now by the way if your partner wakes up sometimes people will wake up from that state and they see you just looking over them in bed staring at their eyelids if you're in early in a relationship it's usually the end of the relationship just a point of note please don't blame me usually wait till you're married and then start to do that one the divorce usually is harder to come by so then you start to go down into the light stages of non-rem sleep stages one and two then after about twenty or so minutes you'll go down deep into stages three and four and then and in one and two have we transitioned out of that alpha wave i mean where do we start to see the thetas and theta already happening in stage one in stage two you actually go into theta activity which is now down from 50 cycles per second maybe down to just sort of six or seven cycles per second and the amplitude's getting a bit bigger it is getting a bit bigger yeah and then every now and again during stage two the way that i know that you're in this lighter stage of non-rem sleep stage two is that you'll get these synchronous bursts of electrical activity that we call sleep spindles that's the case spindle and that's sort of yeah where you get this actually you get a nice big slow wave like almost like a single slow wave and then you get this burst of a sleep spindle and we actually did this great project here at the sleep center where we did the sonification of sleep and we we extracted brain waves from human beings and then we sort of you know smooth them a little bit with some sort of audio software and then you can play them back and it's beautiful because when you hear these sleep spindles they are these short synchronous bursts of electrical activity that last for about a second and a half and they go up to about 10 or 15 cycles per second so it's almost like that beautiful rolling r in sort of in the hindi language or sort of like a cat pairing so so you get these big slow waves and then you get this ripple of a spindle and when you hear it on the speakers it's just sensational you get this

[00:17:57] you know every time i hear it i mean this is spine tingling stuff when you realize this is going on right now physiologically in someone's brain and then from there you start to go down to the really deep stages of non-rem sleep stages three and four and at that point the brain goes into this incredible synchronous mantra chant of these slow waves so the brain waves slow down you go down to maybe just one or two cycles per second very very slow brainwave activity but the size of those waves crashing on the beach of the cortex as it were they are huge and the reason is this go back to the sports stadium analogy let's say that we're here at berkeley and we're playing stanford arch rivals yeah which hopefully you're gonna kick their butt fingers crossed just make sure there's no band anywhere to be found it always does a terrible descent but at that point they're chanting in unison so it's louder but they're now making the same sound together and you can actually hear what's being said exactly so now in that single microphone you can hear stanford sucks stanford sucks so all of a sudden all of for reasons that we are only now starting to understand the brain coordinates hundreds of thousands of neurons unlike it does at any moment elsewhere in the 24-hour period hundreds of thousands of brain cells all decide to join hands as it were physiologically metaphorically and they all fire together and then they all go silent they all fire together and then they all go science and what i find amazing about that by the way is how slow that frequency is you're basically you could be this could be only happening once a second right that's right and that's why it got a terrible wrap for 20 or 30 years because it actually looked not dissimilar to some aspects of coma that's how slow those brain waves were so sleep scientists were you know understandably fooled into thinking that deep sleep was a time when the brain essentially was just doing nothing now we realize the exact opposite is true because it's during that deep sleep that you get essentially information transfer within the brain it's a file transfer mechanism and the way to think about this is let's say it's like long wave radio if you're in the city you tune into fm which is shortwave radio you can pick up a bunch of signals then the further you drive out into the desert let's say here in california you just lose those channels because the range from the tower is so short that you just lose that range but if you go on to sort of you know the long wave radio stations you can still pick up stations for hundreds of miles why because the carrier frequency of those radio waves is much slower and so the distance over which you can transfer information is much further deep sleep is a brain state of long distance information transfer is there morphologically a difference that you can see between stages three and four which are obviously both delta waves but how do you distinguish those two technically no the way it's defined is that what proportion of a 30-second period of time and that's the way that we score sleep i'll have you sleep for eight hours then i'll chop up that eight hours into 30 second bits of information and for each 30 seconds you'll get a sleep score and then we add them all up and what differentiates stage three of deep non-rem sleep from the very deepest stage which is stage four non-rem sleep is simply what proportion of that 30 seconds is consumed by that deep slow brainwave activity if it's sort of less than 50 percent then it's stage 3 if it's more than fifty percent stage four so morphologically no although if you really look at it morphologically on average yes the waves are typically larger in amplitude and slower in frequency in stage four than they are in stage three and do people always progress monotonically through these or do sometimes people go one two four three rem for example no you have to go through three to get to four you have to go to three to get to four you have to go from two to get to three to get to four with the exception of probably let's see two examples one is pathological if you suffer from narcolepsy one of the things that typically happens is that you go from being awake straight into rem sleep so to sort of finish the 90-minute cycle and this will make sense you go sort of stage one to stage two stage two three three four then after about 70 minutes you'll rise back up into stage two and then finally you'll pop up into rem sleep and then you'll have a short rem sleep period and then you'll go back down again down into non-rem sleep up into rem down into non-rem sleep up into rem and you do that as i said every 90 minutes however what changes is the ratio of non-rem to rem within that 90 minute period as you move across the night such that in the first half of the night the majority of your 90-minute sleep cycles are comprised of lots of deep non-rem sleep and very little rem sleep but as you push through to the second half of the night now the seesaw balance changes and the majority of those sleep cycles are comprised much more of rapid eye movement sleep and almost no deep sleep and that's why it's always dangerous when people say you know i'm one of those who survives on you know six six and a half hours of sleep at night i wake up you know 5 5 30 to get a jump start on the day and you can ask well let's say you're getting six hours of sleep how much sleep are you losing and they will say well according to your definition of eight hours of sleep well i'm 25 percent off because i'm getting i lose two hours at the end of an eight hour night of sleep so i'm sleeping 75 percent i'm losing 25 percent yes and no because yesterday disproportionate exactly so yes you're losing 25 percent of total sleep but you could be losing up to 70 percent of all of your rem sleep because it's the rem sleep rich phase that you are short changing to get a jump start on the day so you've got to be very careful when you try to think of your sleep dynamics but to come back to your point sorry yes you always have to go through that linear progression narcolepsy is a standout case there you'll usually go from wakefulness sometimes immediately into rem sleep very frightening most people don't experience you know logical rational waking consciousness and then go immediately into irrational hallucinogenic consciousness which is what rem sleep is it's very disturbing when you speak to these patients the other is if you are horrifically rem sleep deprived or chronically sleep deprived occasionally you can make the transition straight into rem sleep we see this in people who are abusing alcohol heavily who are alcoholics alcohol and will come onto this blocks your rem sleep you can build up such a hunger for rem sleep that the brain says well tonight i'm going to forego the non-rem sleep i'm just going to go and feast on rem sleep straight away there's hysteresis in the system maladaptively so that's a bad sign when you get hysteresis like that that type of pressure [Music] matt last time we sat down you you talked briefly about the sleep chronotypes and and i've found this interesting for basically two reasons one is just observing probably a migration in my own daughter's chronotrype which is as she's getting older she's sleeping in longer in the mornings and going to bed later and later and i know that as she gets closer and closer to being a teenager that's probably going to increase but also just more cognizant i think of other people uh you've alluded to it briefly earlier which is like there are just people who are gonna go to bed later and wake up later and it doesn't mean that they're there's anything wrong with that or there's anything wrong with the reverse which is people who go to bed early and wake up really early so kind of wondering if there's a way to actually know what chronotype you are beyond just observation because is it possible that the observation is not your optimal state in other words if you have somebody who's sleeping a certain way because their job is imposing it but it's not the way that they're you know ideally meant to do it let me give a better example a student in college could easily drift into a lighter chronotype because everybody in their dorm room is even though they may actually be more suited to be earlier so how can one figure this out so there are genetic tests that will give you a stronger sense of your chronotype so chronotype simply means yeah are you a morning person are you an evening person are you somewhere in between and is somewhere between 25 to 30 percent of the population or morning types 25 to 30 or evening types and then the rest of us are somewhere in between sleep sciences then gone a little bit further we split it into five categories sometimes which is extreme morning types morning types middle evening types and extreme evening types we know that it is under strong genetic control for two reasons first there is a significant degree of heritability so if you are a morning type it's more than likely that one or both of your parents were morning types secondly we now know that there are a collection of genes that will determine to a degree your chronotype and this is why companies like 23 and me will tell you what type you are or they will give you a probabilistic estimation of what type you are last count i think from data from 23andme and this data from the uk biobank there's about nine different genes that we know of right now that will contribute to your chronotype most of them are what we call clock genes this refers to the fact that these genes control the rhythm of your circadian cycle now those genes don't control necessarily the size of your circadian rhythm in other words how kind of strongly active and awake you are during the day and how deeply sort of down you go at night these genes do something different these genes control when that sinusoidal wave of your circadian cycle arrives on the clock face what i mean by that is if you have a certain type of gene complement that makes you a morning type your activation peak your peak alertness is going to arrive earlier in the day and your awesome downstroke of your circadian rhythm will arrive earlier in the evening whereas if you have a different combination of these gene composites then you could be an evening type in other words your circadian rhythm looks very similar in its sinusoidal pattern but when the peak and the trough of that circadian rhythm arrive on the 24-hour clock face is very different to a morning type so we know that there is a complement of genes that you are given at birth that will determine on average once you're an adult are you a morning type or are you an evening type what you alluded to however for your daughter was something different which is that no matter what chronotype you are that innate chronotype rhythm that you have gifted by your genes will change as you develop from a young child to an adolescent teen to an adult to an older adult in other words you go from being much more of a morning type when you're a kid even though you want to stay awake longer you're found on the couch and you're carried to bed and you're fast asleep to them being a teen where your chronotype fast forwards in time and this is a problem for early school start times where you're putting kids to bed at 9pm and saying you've got to go to bed because you have to wake up at five o'clock in the morning to catch a 5 30 bus for a 7 15 start time well there's no point in saying that it's not their fault that they're now in bed and it's 10 30 an hour and a half later and they can't fall asleep as a 15 year old because their chronotype has moved forward in time they want to go to bed later and wake up later nothing they can do about it it's biology and then once they become an adult it starts to shuttle back a little bit once they become sort of you know moderate age 30 or 40 and then as we start to get older we regress that's why in florida there's something called the early bird special where people are going out for dinner at you know 4 p.m or 5 p.m because their chronotype has regressed back and they're in bed by you know 8 p.m so there are genetic tests to come back to your question however you don't need to do a genetic test to get close to understanding what you are there is a pencil and paper method that sleep scientists have developed and you can google it it's called the meq test and maybe i'll send you the link and we can put it in the show notes yeah we'll we'll put it in the show notes and it's a very simple link that you just click and it's a test it probably takes about five or six minutes to fill out and it's called the meq test the morning eveningness questioner test and you go through you answer a list of questions and at the end you add up your score and it will tell you what flavor of chronotype you are and what's nice is that then they've patent-matched this test and validated it against these genes these genetic tests and there's a pretty good correlation it's not too far off so this is the poor man's version of the 23andme test if you want it and we'll do a link in the show notes and you can take it and that's a cheaper way pencil and paper method or an online method so the bigger question is matt what do we do with this information right i mean you you've i think we did talk about this previously at one point that you have a couple who have different chronotypes that can be really difficult they're going to bed and waking up at different times you've already alluded to the problem of children who are i think being subjected to potentially too much early school when in reality they probably would do better with later school is this the kind of thing that should factor into decisions people make about when they pick classes in college like i mean it seems like there seems to be this seems to be one of those things where there might be a bunch of people that go through life kind of miserable when they don't have control over their schedule as opposed to knowing this and so would knowing this by itself provide a benefit to folks i think it would i think it would explain a lot about why you struggle so much where other people seem to be just these energizer bunnies and they've even got time to go to the gym for an hour before they sit down at their office desk at 7am in the morning and you're still on your 4th cup of coffee desperately trying to wake up and you're struggling to make it in by 7 15 having woken up 20 minutes before and i think the second thing that it helps with is realizing that you're not culpable it's sort of non-mia culpa it's not your fault it's you can understand that this is genetic because a lot of night owls have gone throughout life being chastised and thinking well if only i could get my act together and get to bed earlier and stop being what people tell me i am which is slothful or lazy you know i could hold down a better job or and again i think society needs to be much more understanding of it and also then modifying itself in response to accommodated and neither of those things i see in full serving scoop sizes in society right now and i that should change and i think covid is interesting because if there's some positive upside to it it may have given us the chance for people to understand how much better they can sleep when they're closer in harmony with their own chronotype rather than trying to work against it because when you fight biology you normally lose and the way you know you've lost is often through disease and sickness and i think there is a version of that going on here i also think it can sometimes explain incorrect insomnia often i'll hear someone tell me if i'm sort of out in the public they'll say well i suffer from insomnia i get into bed and i can't fall asleep and i'm wide awake for the first hour and a half and i need to take some sleeping pills and then i'll i'll say you know firstly i'm not a doctor but let me just ask you a question if you were on a desert island with no responsibilities nobody fought to wake up for nothing to do and you could just sleep whenever you want to get up whenever you want what time would you normally go to bed and they would say well i would actually like to go to bed at midnight and wake up around 8 o'clock in the morning in truth but i have to get up for my job i have to wake up at six i'm getting in bed at 10 but i still have this terrible insomnia and i say well you know i don't know this but it's possible that what you could have is not insomnia but a mismatch between your chronotype and your working life schedule and you may want to explore some of this and there's a test an meq test and i tell them about this and then go and speak to your doctor so that's the second implication that i think comes from the question that you asked about how it impacts society once you know it what do we do about it and what should we be doing about it those are some of the ramifications i think [Music] i forgot to say in the episodes before and i'd love to say it now is about sleep opportunity versus duration we've constantly been speaking about in our discussions how much sleep does a person need what's the optimal amount and we're speaking about somewhere between seven to nine hours when i say that i'm talking about seven to nine hours of sleep not time in bed where you might lose 10 to 15 of it right and this is the reason that when i think people who say well surely you can get by on six and a half hours of sleep or seven hours of sleep you've got to be very careful because that's a dangerous statement this comes to something that we call sleep efficiency now if you are in your 40s you will probably have if you're healthy you'll probably have a sleep efficiency of what we call 90 in other words of the time that you're in bed 90 percent of that time is asleep and 10 of the time is awake so let's take an eight hour sleep period and you think well i'm in bed for eight hours so i'm good i'm getting my eight hours of sleep that's not true eight hours of sleep is what that's 480 minutes if my math is correct if you get a 10 percent loss of efficiency it's like a heating system you lose 10 percent of this you're down to 7 12. you're down to 7 12. so in other words for you as a 40 year old with a healthy sleep efficiency of 90 percent for you to get eight hours of sleep you need to be in bed for eight hours and 48 minutes even a bit longer actually yeah or even a bit longer so you've got to be very careful that's why i constantly speak about a sleep opportunity of eight to nine hours in bed to get your seven to eight hours of total sleep if that makes sense and this is where i think devices like the aura ring are very helpful because that's where they're very good they're very good at telling you you were in bed this long but you're actually only asleep this long and that's the number we want the patients to fixate on we don't even look at time in bed when we give our patients feedback we're talking about total sleep time and efficiency so if there's a problem with total sleep time and efficiency is low you have to improve the quality if total sleep time is low and efficiency is high you need more time in bed and it's getting people to understand that distinction that's very important and the caveat that comes for people with insomnia though that i'm here saying you need to increase your time in bed your sleep opportunity as i call it to make sure that you get the right total amount of sleep and you have to accept there's inefficiency in the system and you need to extend your time in bed to overcome that slight inefficiency so again sort of 8 hours and 50 minutes to get your 8 hours total sleep the only time i would say that you should not be thinking about longer time in bed is if you're someone who is struggling with insomnia right and you're lying in bed awake a lot of the time reprogramming we actually do the opposite which is we actually shorten your sleep opportunity we crunch that down it's one of the tools that we have in the cb that's right you want to drive the efficiency up by taking the denominator out people have lost their confidence in going into the bedroom and sleeping constantly soundly throughout the night so what we end up doing is actually constraining them maybe down to just six hours of sleep opportunity we put them on a diet of sleep opportunity rather than an extension and very quickly what happens so it's ironic you come to me you say i'm not sleeping well and i say great i'm going to have you sleep less and you see ridiculous it's not what you do is by compressing that window down you're sleeping less and you're building up more of that sleep pressure because as a consequence of the reduction of sleep opportunity time you're going to be awake during the day longer the longer that you're awake the more of that sleep pressure you build up so firstly you're coming into the following night with even more sort of sleepiness on your shoulders and then secondly i'm teaching the brain unlike it's been giving it's been given luxury time to just be awake as long as it wants to at night and maybe sleep some and that's that phenotype of insomnia awake time at night by constraining that time i start to force your brain to realize i'm sorry you no longer have the luxury of having all of this time to sort of be awake and be asleep and very quickly the brain starts to realize and learn that in fact it only has this tiny opportunity at the dinner table called sleep that is six hours and now you start to brute force efficiency the brain starts to realize my goodness i've only got six hours i need to get my sleep into that six hours so efficiency markedly increases when you constrain total amount of time in bed so it's this ironic way that we help treat insomnia we constrain total sleep time you brute force efficiency and a brute force response from the brain and all of a sudden something magical happens [Music] now that we've set the stage for what sleep is and why it's so important the next set of clips will really look at ways in which we can improve sleep these clips will look at the pros and cons of napping proper sleep hygiene and an ideal wind down routine optimal temperature for sleep and how matt changed his thinking on blue [Music] the light now comes down to one of napping which we did touch on in our previous episode but i want to revisit it lots of times patients come to me and say peter you have no idea what a 20-minute nap does for me between two and four o'clock in the afternoon and my historical response to that has been you know gosh you really shouldn't need a nap i mean if you're sleeping correctly isn't that actually a negative thing because it's depleting some of that adenosine based pressure and wouldn't you be better off letting the pressure cooker cook and driving you into a deeper sleep when you first take your sleep so what are your thoughts on that type of an app that that sort of short 20-minute you know late afternoon pre-dinner nap naps really are a double-edged sword and we've done lots of studies where we use naps to study the functions of sleep and we see benefits from naps even naps as short as 17 minutes can produce learning and memory benefits so there does seem to be some some enhancement that you get and you can see that from cardiovascular benefits as well the downside of naps is that it can take away just what you described which is sleep pressure and so the typical recommendation that we have is the following if you are struggling with sleep at night avoid naps during the day because what you want to do if you are already having problems either falling asleep which is what we call sleep onset insomnia or you can fall asleep but you can't stay asleep which is what we call sleep maintenance insomnia you want to build up as much sleep pressure as much sleepiness as you possibly can during the day if you are struggling with your sleep at night do not nap during the day and the pressure cooker analogy is beautiful keep building up all of that healthy sleepiness pressure because when you nap it's like having the valve on the cooker open up and you just just release some of that healthy sleepiness and now when it comes time to go to bed you're not going to feel sleepy anymore however on the flip side if you are not struggling with your sleep and you can nap regularly during the day the advice is naps can be just fine because in fact if you take a step back from an evolutionary perspective and you study hunter-gatherer tribes whose way of life hasn't changed for thousands of years they don't necessarily sleep the way that we do in modernity in fact particularly during the summer months they will typically have an afternoon nap right in the time zone that you just described and this is the very much the mediterranean siesta-like behavior and in fact if i stick an electrode on both of our heads throughout the day and i monitor our physiological brainwave activity it'll stick much better to my head by the way thank you well yeah right now especially because i've got this terrible coveted which uh i look like i should be out of book rogers and anybody who remembers that television show but anyway what we will see is that somewhere between about two to four p.m both you and i will have this kind of drop in our physiological alertness in our physiological level of brain activity in other words as if as a species we're almost pre-programmed to have this enforced dip in our alertness and so many people see this you know in the afternoon meetings around the boardroom table or wherever you sort of get these ugly head nods that start to happen it's not people listening to good music it's just that people have this sort of they're falling asleep they're falling prey to this what seems to be a genetically hardwired pre-programmed drop in our alertness as if maybe we should be what's called biphasically sleeping as a species at times during the year rather than monophasically sleeping which is how we do in most first world nations in other words one single bout of sleep at night versus two bouts of sleep which is how those hunter-gatherer tribe sleep especially during the summer and so matt would they sleep long enough in that two to four window that they would get a full 90 minutes say and get through a full cycle and then if so did that mean when they did their nighttime sleep presumably they would stay up later and get maybe six hours in the evening instead of you know because because people always talk about how well hunter-gatherer studies have always suggested that you know seven and a half to nine is the species required amount of sleep on average but you're saying it was potentially broken into two chunks was that was that afternoon daytime chunk or daylight chunk call it about 90 minutes no it wasn't it was actually typically shorter than that on that basis but you're right they typically are not sleeping what we currently recommend for monophasic sleep which is the average adult should get somewhere between seven to nine hours that's the recommended range that we we all provide but what they would typically do is they would maybe sleep just six six and a half hours at night and then they would make the rest up and they would get into that exact same sort of territory by way of the nap so they would take it in these two chunks now i should know this is very different to something else that's been described in the literature which is first sleep and second sleep that activity does seem to have occurred during our historical past it seemed to have emerged in the sort of dickensian era that was different though that was where people would sleep for the first four hours then they would wake up in the middle of the night they would you know write they would drink they would play music they would make love and then they would go back for another four hours of sleep did that happen yes it seems to of based on historical writings but is that the way our physiology and our circadian rhythms are designed no it doesn't seem to be there's usually one study that's cited that suggests maybe we should do that but overall the physiology that we know of for human beings doesn't seem to suggest that that was that was more sociologically driven rather than biologically driven biologically we may be biphasic but very differently according to this hunt together a sort of tribe hypothesis by the way the other thing that's interesting in those hunter-gatherers and it comes on to what i think we've described before which is this concept of midnight most of us don't think of what the term means but in those individuals it means what the word states which is it's the middle of the night for them midnight because they usually go to bed maybe two hours after sundown and they're asleep you know by let's say 9 p.m in in the evening or 8 30 and then they're awake you know just a little bit before dawn in fact what's interesting and maybe we'll get onto this in later discussions or we won't but what seems to wake them up is not necessarily daylight it's the change in temperature because there's a rise in temperature that seems to happen before daylight starts to break and it seems to be it's the temperature change that they are much more buckled to in terms of regulation of their sleep weight rhythm and so the way in which the structure of their sleep biphasic is different to ours in modernity and the timing of their sleep is different to some of our timing you know for many people midnight is the the time that you think well i should just check facebook one last time or sh you know send my last tags um that's what midnight means but normally for for a couple of uh thousand years uh or hundreds of thousands of years it probably meant that was the middle of your solar cycle and it was the middle of your sleep cycle i'm glad i'm closer to our ancestors if i could go to bed at eight o'clock every night and wake up at four that is a perfect night of sleep for me [Music] matt and on previous episodes obviously we went into some pretty good depth on tricks tips etc inside our practice we have a whole sleep hygiene protocol and we sort of run patients through it relatively early especially if they're having any sleep issues but do you mind just sort of going through where you are now and how you think about this and again i'll caveat this by saying you're not a sleep physician so it is not your practice to be out there treating any one individual with respect to their sleep that's right but also you're infinitely more qualified than virtually anybody to help people start to think through what the parameters are that factor into sleep and that's the way we kind of explain it which is look here are these five or six levers of sleep and here's how you could move each of them in your control but but i kind of want to hear what how you think of it yeah so i think in our past episodes we've gone through sort of the fine five main sort of sleep hygiene tips and i'll just quickly go through them here because we've dealt with them before which is regularity going to bed at the same time waking up at the same time getting lots of darkness at night because we are a dark deprived society and i actually think i've done a bad job of describing to the public the importance of the opposite which is making sure you get daylight during the first half of the day i think that's just as important then temperature we've spoken about that a little bit you need to get cool to get to sleep and it's the reason that you will always find it easier to fall asleep in a room that's too cold than too hot you shouldn't stay in bed awake that trains your brain to be triggered by your bed and force you awake because you have a learned association so if you've been awake for 20 minutes then get up go and do something else and only come back to bed when you're sleepy is the general rule and then finally you know trying to avoid alcohol and caffeine in the afternoon and for alcohol in the evenings as we've said so those are the sort of typical tips but i think if i were to add a few others the other one that's absolutely critical that i probably haven't espoused enough is a wind-down routine because many people in society expect sleep to be like a light switch that we should just jump into bed and it we should just turn off the light and the brain should do something similar and go straight into sleep sleep as a physiological process if you study it it's just not like that sleep is much more like trying to land a plane it takes time to gradually descend down onto that hard foundation of this thing that we call a stable night of sleep so give yourself some wind down opportunity time build it into your routine for some people it's 15 minutes others it's 30 minutes light stretches meditation putting all of your phones and your gadgets away staying clear of any inbound in the last 30 minutes whatever it takes set it up and then maintain it because if you have kids you'll know all about this you know you have a routine for the kids and you've got to try and stick to it if you break the routine bad things usually happen with sleep we're the same as adults there's no difference so i think that's the first thing i would say the second probably tweak is if you are struggling with sleep remove all clock faces from your bedroom it's not going to help you to know that it's now 2 35 a.m in the morning and you've still not been able to fall asleep it's only going to trigger more anxiety and there's been a nice study here from uc berkeley not from my center but from another sleep research allison harvey who looked at this in people who are poor sleepers with insomnia removing clock faces can certainly help the next thing i would say is that try to keep of course all of your technology outside of the bedroom and if you can don't make it the first thing that you check in the morning because for most of us the first thing that we do when we wake up is that we swipe right and this flood of anxiety just washes onto us like a tsunami and that's problematic not just because it's a bad way to start your day but because you train your brain in this pavlovian way that every morning as you're tucking yourself into bed at night every morning what's coming to you when you wake up is this jag of what we call anticipatory anxiety and it lightens your sleep throughout the night because of that expectation so try to avoid that if you absolutely have to and again trying not to be puritanical take your phone into the bedroom one of the other problems is that it causes what we call sleep procrastination which is that you're sitting there in bed you've got your device and you think well i'll just check amazon and order that thing i'll just check facebook and i'll just i'll send that last email and you look up and now it's 40 minutes later the rule of thumb that a friend a colleague of mine michael gradner said i love this if you're going to have your phone in your bedroom the rule is that you can only use it if you're standing up and after standing up for about five or ten minutes of phone use you just think i'm i just want to sit down i just want to get into bed and at that point the rule is you've got to put your phone away so those would be sort of three additional things that i would advise that can really help i like that a lot i would actually add just from a personal standpoint i've maybe maybe three months ago instituted a little policy for myself that i've really enjoyed which is not looking at my phone for an hour when i wake up yes luckily i don't sleep with my phone in my room so that's not an issue but it used to certainly be the first thing i'd go and grab when i got up and if i get up at you know five i won't look at it till usually after 6 a.m and that's interesting i didn't realize that the effect that that could have on my brain as i'm coming into consciousness knowing that i'm not going to be flooded with information especially the type of information i don't like which is generally all the information on my phone yeah i'll just stick two additional pins in that the the first is i think any everyone has had this experience in the extreme which is where you know you've got to wake up the next day for an interview or you've got to wake up for a flight that you have to catch you know for a fact that firstly your sleep is going to be shallow it's not going to be particularly deep and secondly you almost wake up two minutes before the alarm because you're that on edge well imagine a diluted version of that but every single day that's what bringing your phone into the bedroom and opening it up first thing is all about the second thing i would say is you're right and set manageable goals i really enjoy the work of a guy called bj fogg who's a researcher at stamford who looks at behavioral change and it's all about incremental so if you're trying to get someone to floss their teeth for the first time for dental hygiene don't say okay here's how you floss you need to floss before you go to bed you say all you're allowed to do for the first week is flush your front two teeth and you cannot do any more that's it and then we say then to the next then add two more teeth for the next week and then two more the same with sleep if you are accustomed to doing this with your phone which is so understandable for all of the pressures that we understand from society and social media start by saying i'm gonna give myself five minutes i'm gonna firstly not check my phone i'm just gonna wake up brush my teeth and make whatever drink that i have in the morning and when i sit down that's when i am gifted the opportunity to look at my phone and then try to push it to 10 minutes and then try to see if you can get changed have your shower wash yourself up whatever you do in the morning and only then open up your phone and keep pushing it longer and longer make it a manageable goal otherwise don't set yourself up for failure do it for success yeah i think the same advice is great for something like meditation where you know for many people saying hey why don't you commit to 20 minutes of meditation a day i mean that's that's almost impossible out of the gate but if it's hey meditate every day and if you do a three minute meditation that you know you're better off doing three minutes a day than 20 minutes once a week um i think it's the same sort of idea which i which i agree i think it becomes a lot easier the last thing i would say is that none of these tips that we've spoken about which are typically sleep hygiene tips are going to work if you actually have a sleep disorder so the analogy here again from a colleague if i'm an athletic sports coach and i'm giving you all of these tips for improving your performance but you've got a broken ankle none of them are going to make any difference to your performance until we actually get you to a doctor and fix the broken ankle it's the same with a sleep disorder if you have you know insomnia or if you have sleep apnea none of these things that i've been talking about are going to help you if you suspect that you have either one of those definitely go and see your doctor see if you can get some kind of sleep intervention [Music] okay let's shift on to temperature we have a ton of questions on this including one of my patients who has specifically asked me to ask you a bunch of questions on this so i'm looking at all these questions of which there are so many and i want to start at the top rather than so i'm going to kind of mix up the order a little bit on these and this question in particular i think is a great foray into the discussion so the question is did our ancestors get better quality sleep during certain times of the year and or in certain climates so for example death valley in the summer and i don't know how many of our ancestors were spending that much time there hopefully not too many but um presumably there are hot places cold places etc so i think what this question is obviously getting at is there's a general belief that we sleep better when we're colder there must have been a number of times when our ancestors were either in places that were not cold or in places where at least during a season it was warm what can we infer or impute about sleep quality and temperature from that so the best data that we have right now again comes back to some of these hunter-gatherer tribes some of them live at different latitudes and the best data that we have are folks who are very close to the equator and at that point you think well how is this going to answer the question well temperature variation where they're at is still quite significant from summer to winter it turns out it's just more about sort of yes rainy season and dry season but the temperature does fluctuate by some degrees too and you can look at other communities that are a little bit further out but here's what we find in the summer typically yes they actually sleep less when it's hotter which is going against what needs to happen to your core body temperature to get good sleep it needs to drop and it needs to get cold during the hotter seasons they typically sleep less at night and then they seem to try and do some recovery by doing a short afternoon siesta but when they switch over to the winter season where it's cooler it's a little bit darker but not that much but it's really the temperature when they get cooler then they sleep longer at night and the frequency with which they have daytime naps actually decreases so i think that's the best evidence that we have right now from just sort of going back to basics homo sapiens what was going on in terms of temperature the seasons give us the experiment and the data favors coldness for longer sleep when you now bring that question to a laboratory where presumably you can take and someone has done this i'm sure where they've taken subjects and basically developed the optimization curve of all things equal but temperature there must be an optimization there's probably temperatures at which you reduce latency so it's easier to get to bed but maybe temperatures where it's harder to stay asleep for example using myself as an example i actually like to be really cold when i get in bed and if i am it might take me a little longer to fall asleep a minute or two but it almost guarantees i'll sleep in a more uninterrupted fashion throughout the evening there are times when i get into bed and this is again not true at home because i can control the temperature in my home i have more difficulty controlling it here for example like we're in bakersfield it's hot as hades the last two nights and again it could be the excitement of racing but i also feel like i've been waking up a little warm and i don't have my chili pad i don't have that little cooling pad on my blanket i've had no issues with latency but i'm waking up early so if you run through all the permutations and combinations of this can one say there is an optimal room temperature or air temperature or skin temperature or something that we should be driving towards so right now the data that we have is somewhere around about 65 to 67 degrees is optimal for the sleep of most people now there's going to be variability there for sure and we know this we can see this in the data too but it's actually even a little bit more complex than that and they've been studies that people have done where they almost strap you in what looks like a wetsuit but it's got all of these veins that run throughout them and we can percolate this water i think we've spoken a little bit about this before where you can exquisitely control the temperature hot or cold at any part of the body and i'll summarize the findings as the following in terms of temperature it's a three part story for your extremities you need to warm up to cool down to fall asleep then you need to get cold to stay asleep and then you need to warm up to wake up and so the reason that you may be finding latency easier here but quality of sleep there after worse is because it's counterintuitive how do i drop your core body temperature i'm going to tell you i'm going to warm you up but the reason is because if you take a hot bath or a shower all of the blood is charmed to the surface of your skin and it radiates the heat out of the core of your body so in fact your core body temperature plummets it's the reason that hot bath is great not because you're toasty in bed it's because your core body temperature is plummeting once you get out so this is why sometimes having a cold room but socks on or a cold room with a hot water bottle at the end of your bed just to warm the feet because it's the feet and the hands that need to get a little bit warm to bring the blood because they are the best radiators of heat out of your body so when we warm the pores of rats for example they fall asleep faster because you're charming the heat out of the core of the body so the answer to the question really is a little bit more complex keep the room cool warm yourself up a little bit inside of bed to radiate that heat out and get you to sleep quicker that will make the latency you fall asleep faster in other words then the ambient temperature will keep your body cold throughout that middle section and later section of sleep and then if you have a sort of a smart thermostat you can rise that temperature i would say actually quite late in the game in the perhaps in the last 20 minutes or the last 15 minutes and that will try to rocket your temperature out and bring you you will wake up easier and feel less groggy if that temperature is higher now it's hard because the ambient may not necessarily change much of what's going on under the covers but it's the reason that most people when they wake up they would like hot drink even sometimes in the summer because the hot drink for the most part some people are just using caffeine and that's what they think keeps them awake but some of that benefit of the caffeine is actually not caffeine it's just the hot drink itself that is helping bring back up the core body temperature that makes you feel more awake so can we quantify the following someone comes to you and they say matt i'm doing all of these things off my checklist but currently i sleep at a room temperature of 75 degrees how much better would you predict i would sleep if my room temperature went from 75 to 65. so i think the hard part of this equation and some people may face this too if they look at their data from sleep trackers you're going to be sleeping better we know this is using population statistics for an individual so this is always dangerous and i never want to sort of fall into that fallacy but let's go with it on average people are more likely to sleep considerably better at 65 than 75. do you say that in terms of duration or stage quality or what metric so that's where the devil is in the details because some people will see it in terms of quantity particularly the quantity of deep sleep so when we do these studies that's where you see some of the greatest benefits for the cooling down throughout the night that's where sort of the thermal gradient can be beneficial but what's not told is that the largest effect size is not really in quantity which is minutes which is what your sleep tracker your wristwatch or your ring will tell you and you have to be very careful to judge the efficacy of that experimental change on the basis of quantity minutes because if anything when you look at the data where you really see the effect is less so in minutes which is quantity instead it's in quality which is measured by the electrical brainwave signature now your wristwatch or your ring is not going to be giving you that detail so if you assume that the drop in temperature has given you a nominal percentage benefit in terms of your deep sleep time and therefore you don't think it's worthwhile i think you may want to sort of just second check that logic because there we're seeing it's qualitative that's more beneficial and you as an individual it's very difficult for you to sense that qualitative change because you're non-conscious of course and there's no good trackers out there right now that you can wear typically on your periphery that will tell you that metric [Music] so with that said it's not necessarily that hard of a question because i'm constantly trying to run these calculations about all of my scientific sleep beliefs and think about these three buckets i think the thing that i've probably changed my mind on most or had a reversal on is the effects of blue light on our sleep and in fact in the book i spoke about a study at the time that had been done out of harvard which i still think is valid where they'd used an ipad where you read on an ipad for an hour versus you read a book under dim light and they showed that that ipad had this detrimental effect on sleep it had delayed the release of melatonin it had caused a reduction in rem sleep and even when they stopped reading the ipad it had a blast radius to it where the sleep quality was still bad for a couple of days afterwards and it was a compelling study and published in a good journal but over the years i think there's been some research that's pushed back on that and there's been some great work from a university in australia called flinders university and michael gradazar's done some just great work on this at flinders he has changed my mind i'm less bullish now about the idea that these devices that we use are sleep disruptive because of the blue light i still think that has an effect but what i think he's shown in some elegant work is that it's less about the light it's more about the fact that these devices are just so activating that these devices are designed to trigger alertness and what we call physiological arousal in the brain and in other words what happens when we use these devices the reason that they're so disruptive to our sleep is less about their blue light it's more the fact that we are masking our sleepiness with this overriding artificial activation from the devices in other words let's say that all of a sudden it's 10 p.m and you think i'm wide awake i'm on my computer i'm working i've got my phone next to me i'm checking it it's pinging it's dinging all of a sudden all of the lights go out there's a massive electromagnetic pulse that curses across your environment it knocks out all of the devices you've got no phone no ipad no electricity i suspect that within about 15 or 20 minutes you'd start to feel sleepy and it's not because of the blue light effects it's the fact that you are and you were all along sleepy but these devices because they're so activating was creating a competing force that hit a mute button on the sleepiness and it activated you so i've actually down regulated my belief in the effects of blue light and i've introduced this new mental framework regarding the effects of the invasion of technology into our evening lives and our bedrooms and i'm much more now enamored with this idea that they are mentally stimulating rather than blue light emitting forgive my ignorance for this question but has the experiment not been done where you've taken groups of subjects and you've subjected one group to just a blue light so an actual blue light that's hitting i forget how many nanometers that is but the actual right in the shorter that wavelength yeah yeah and then you have another group that is just being blasted with red light and then you have another group that is just being blasted with a regular led and white light so you're getting the same intensity of light but you're moving the wavelength and therefore you're nullifying the stimulatory effect of what's being read or looked at i mean to me that experiment would eloquently demonstrate whether or not blue light per se is the problem has that not been done it has so people have played around with the wavelength of the light and what we believed is that it's the cooler blues the shorter wavelength flight that are most detrimental and the reason that screens were blamed is because they are led based which is enriched in the lower visible light spectrum the shorter wavelength in other words the cool blues and that's why the blame came because it was stamping the brakes on melatonin especially powerfully and those studies were done they were done by chuck seisler and steve lockley from harvard years ago and that led to this sort of belief and i still think there's good validity in that and by the way there was a couple of studies that came out in animals that were now suggesting at least i think it was in rats or mice i could be wrong or if it was in fruit flies i apologize where they actually found the opposite where they found that the warmer color lights had stronger blocking effects on melatonin and it began this sort of controversy had we got it wrong about blue light and then this work from flinders university from michael was coming online regarding this cognitive component and it really sort of made me shift my belief system so yes those studies have been done and they principally looked at melatonin i think they studied less a full night of sleep with polysomnography and really asked the downstream consequences they were just simply saying how does it affect your melatonin which is maybe one step short of saying how does it then affect as a consequence of that change in melatonin your subsequent sleep without necessarily doing a much more sophisticated study which i think are now being done where you do the coke pepsi challenge of same amount of light stimulation so light is standardized right light becomes the variable that's the only independent variable that's right and then you start measuring independent variable at polysome and melatonin for what it's worth and do everything and then you do a second round of studies where light actually becomes the constant stimulus where you maintain the same light exposure but in one condition you're doing something cognitively activating like building a facebook account or checking that versus you're simply just there in front of the blue light but there's no cognitive stimulation to really do the two by two disambiguation of that i think those cities are coming but that's one of the things where i've definitely changed my mind i think and i felt compelled to now speak more about that and less about the blue light [Music] the last set of clips will shift our focus to look at the effect that caffeine can have on our sleep and the dangers of sleeping pills if you found yourself enjoying these clips and want more content we have seven episodes with matt including three amas these are great pieces of content to go back to and listen to if you want to scratch this itch a little bit more [Music] the other place where i think i've changed my mind and maybe even some of my behavior is around coffee and caffeine and the evidence has continued to mount and it's unignorable and now again these are mostly associational epidemiological studies which both you and i know are problematic for lots of different reasons but they're so consistent that if you look at coffee drinkers they reliably de-risk a whole constellation of diseases that you want to avoid and yes there is a dose dependency to it where once you get past kind of like three or four cups then things go in bad directions or the opposite direction at least but for the most part there seems to be this set of very clear associations between low-to-moderate caffeine consumption and de-risking health disease conditions how on earth does this square with matt walker's espousing of caffeine's impact on sleep and the fact that a lack of sleep seems to be associated with many of those same conditions the go-between here is that caffeine of course can disrupt your sleep so i've kind of modified my beliefs a little bit i think caffeine consumption is actually not only just fine but maybe to be encouraged if there is more causal evidence i think you and tim ferriss would speak about this idea that the dose makes the poison and that is true with caffeine but i also think there's a second variable here the dose and the timing make the poison when it comes to caffeine if you're drinking it later in the day then i don't think we would see those same health benefits we would see health detriments and we don't have the data to help to find that but then i've added a layer of complexity to that after listening to a good friend of mine and a writer here in berkeley michael pollin who wrote a book on audible that you can hear called caffeine and it goes into great depths and we spoke about this he interviewed me for the book he believes that the health benefits which are very hard to deny of caffeine are not really due to a cup of coffee it's actually the fact that the coffee bean itself carries with it lots of antioxidants and in fact the reason that you get these health benefits is because the antioxidants take a joy ride on the good bus of this thing called caffeine and his belief is that for americans for many americans who don't get a balanced diet coffee in the morning may be one of their only primary sources of antioxidant consumption and that's why you see the health associations and in fact i looked at a fantastic review from 2017 and what they found was that in fact decaffeinated coffee which carries the same antioxidant load but without the caffeine has many health benefit associations with it which then started to make it all a bit more nuanced that perhaps it's more about the antioxidant benefit rather than necessarily the caffeine benefit but there is certainly an association with coffee that i think makes me more likely to tell people it's fine to be drinking a couple of cups of coffee in the morning please do that in fact if anything there seems to be some health benefits i think it's probably because of the antioxidant benefits but i've changed my mind there too i think i've become more relaxed in fact i've now started to drink decaffeinated coffee in the mornings and is the reason you're not drinking caffeinated coffee because it just activates you too much or because you still fear it will and because you fear it will impact your sleep negatively yeah it's because i still fear that it impacts my sleep negatively there was a study by a good colleague of mine at the university of surrey in england called dirk young dyke published many years ago and they were actually dosing people with caffeine at seven o'clock in the morning and they could still pick up in the signal of subsequent deep electrical sleep that following night a reduction in the quality of that deep sleep so i think again it depends on who you are there are genetic differences in how quickly people metabolize caffeine and i think i'm someone who may be on the moderate end of the sensitivity spectrum so i typically stay away from it but other people i think probably don't have that same sensitivity in morning coffee consumption caffeine is fine [Music] well thank you oren hatch for the supplement industry we owe you a debt of gratitude and i hope you can hear the sarcasm in my voice i think most people now are wise to it and we certainly spoke about it at length in the original episodes about the real downside of things like ambien lunesta these drugs in fact very recently i just saw something in the news that tried to tally up the number of deaths that could actually be attributed to these things so i mean i feel very comfortable telling patients that i would rather you stick your genitals in a grinder than you take ambien or lunesta there's always the point in taping a podcast with peace or tear where it just comes to one of these wonderful crescendos the things that i think about but i have no bravery to say and he just comes out and says them and this is part of the reason i adore him yeah i really hate these drugs i really hate them by full disclosure i still prescribe them on occasion to patients who really insist on having them as a safety net i would not let any patient have those and i can monitor by prescription there's no patient i'm going to let take those drugs every night and maybe if they needed a couple of nights a month as they're traveling and such we work really hard to get them off it but but let's talk about sort of the softer things that people often rely on consistently for sleep aids what about things like benadryl or advil pm i get a lot of questions about that here i don't think we would argue that those are good for sleep i think that maybe we could frame the question as how bad are they for sleep yeah so firstly to come back to ambien and sort of its collection linestar all of those classic what we call the sedative hypnotics in fact you're right i think it was nine days ago from the point that we're speaking right now the fda updated its mortality risk warnings regarding those sleeping pills because of this increased risk of death both acutely for a number of reasons but also this data just chronically risk far greater right cancer we also see in part i think it's probably because of a weakening of the immune system and i think we spoke about this before the irony is that sleep is incredibly powerful in boosting the whole collection of weaponry in your immune system yet when you sleep and sleep long with those sleeping pills you would imagine your immune system gets even better the opposite seems to be true it gets worse and the reason we know this is because there's higher rates of infection in those patients who are taking sleeping pills scales with the degree of use and dosage so i would say trying to use those as a very last resort now there are some patients for whom alternatives don't seem to work and for a short period of time that seems to be recommended right now by the medical community but i should also note that in 2016 the american college of physicians made a landmark recommendation that they said based on the health risks and the concerns together with the nominal benefit of those sleeping pills above and beyond placebo sleeping pills must no longer be the first line recommendation for insomnia it has to be something else called cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia or cbti which we can come back to in a second which i've had three patients go through formal cbti with great success it's a non-pharmacological it's a psychological method you work with a therapist and they try to understand where your sleep problems are at and create a bespoke solution for you the individual so there's lots of tools in the cbti box that we can use to try and help people sleep better and because everyone who has sleep problems is usually a little different from one person to the next you have to create a more savile row tailored suit for that person in terms of that sleep prescription quote unquote but it's just as efficacious as sleeping pills in the short term but what's better is that when you start working with your therapist those benefits can last now i think the last report was maybe somewhere between up to five years that you can maintain that benefit unlike sleeping pills where when you stop them you not only go back to the bad sleep that you had it's usually even worse it's called sleep rebound insomnia how do you recommend people find good cbti therapists because like all things therapy wise the practitioner matters now i've been very fortunate because we work with this amazing sleep doc named vic chain in chicago and wherever my patients are if it's san francisco new york he knows the best therapist and he just makes that introduction plugs us directly in but if you're listening to this and you're thinking i live in st louis and boy would i really benefit from this how can a person listening figure out is it just trial and error you just have to go through people until you find someone who's really clicking with you so one of the things that we can do maybe in post in the show notes there is a website that comes out of the american academy of sleep medicine and there is one page it's not that easy to find but i know the link so i'll send it out and you go to that link and you insert your zip code into this website so this is of course just for people in america and it will return the closest certified centers by the american academy of sleep medicine for sleep disorders including cbti and you can give it a radius and you can give it a distance tell me where is close and they will give you the sleep centers to contact contact them and you can go from there and what should you look for in terms of because we know that all doctors are not created equal all mechanics are not created equal all lawyers are not created equal how does a person evaluate their own individual or is it simply through the results i mean right now it's going to be in part trial and error and i would say have a conversation with two or three potential cpti therapists and just try them on for size see how they work if you can get any referrals right now sometimes you can even go on to places like yelp or other places where you can get some reviews too some people if they're motivated to write it's usually because they had a bad experience so keep that bias in mind but i would say if you can get a referral from a friend or a colleague that's a fantastic way to go too and then speak to these people and ask them about their success rates and ask them also where have you found problems with your patients which patients have you typically had the hardest difficulty with in terms of the profile of sleep problems and if they sound like you then maybe you want to look elsewhere as well but cbti over sleeping pills for sure in terms of things like tylenol pm or benadryl is yeah benadryl is typically used there's a little bit of evidence that benadryl induced sleep also has some of the risks associated with it that sleeping pills have it's less potent in terms of that bad consequence and outcome to sleep but the bad consequence and outcome remains statistically significant in those reports so i would shy away from things like benadryl as well tylenol pm i just don't think there's good enough data yet to suggest that it's either good or bad and what about low doses or intermittent use of benzodiazepines either short acting ones like ativan or longer acting ones xanax or longer acting ones like valium i talk about this in my jet lag protocol when i'm doing heroic bursts of jet lag you know 12 hour time zone difference and i have to put myself to sleep we talked about the entire routine around exercise and caffeine and going to sleep immediately getting on the plane and i use phosphatidylserine and i use the kirk parsley stuff and i'll also use valium to just make sure i am out and what are your thoughts on the short-term use of benzos again paired with these other agents around jet lag i don't think anyone's really advocating to be used in any ongoing manner either certainly not yeah infrequent use i suppose it depends on how infrequent in one of the studies by a guy called dan kripke who was actually emeritus here in san diego he just looked at not only whether use of sleeping pills was detrimental to mortality he looked at the frequency of how often you were taking those and what he was finding is that even anywhere between three to 18 pills per year carried a statistically significant increase in mortality risk and did he put benzos in the same category as the ativan lunestas he did yeah so he sort of has broken some of that stuff down and broken it out too i would say in truth see how far you can really get with all of the other kaleidoscope of possibilities of sleep enhancing possibilities that we've discussed and if those fail then i think you can think about less resources but those drugs typically just are not producing natural sleep so i would think of those medications like that box on the wall that says break glass in terms of emergency if you're in that situation and you're really struggling then it's possible that that's the time to break the glass but those shattered shards can sometimes still if you can still cut you what about ghb or xyrem as a precursor this is a drug that is incredibly potent in patients with narcolepsy xyrem is available by prescription of course unless you have narcolepsy you're going to pay an unbelievable amount it's one of the funniest sort of economic incentives imaginable but several listeners have asked and several of my patients actually have asked about does xyrem actually produce appropriate sleep staging what's the data on that so the data if you look at it almost looks like xyrem is a great drug or ghb is a great drug for increasing the amount of deep sleep that you have mostly because it puts your brain into a more sort of sedated slow rhythm which a sleep technician if they didn't know that you were on xyrem would look at it and say that looks not dissimilar to deep slow wave sleep so i'm going to score it as i'm sort of scoring these eight hour sleep records i'm going to score it as deep sleep so overall in terms of total amount of sleep ghb or xyrem does seem to actually increase the amount of slow wave sleep time that is scored by a technician and i'm being very technical in my language because i want to be precise in this regard however if you look at the electrical signature of that sleep which is now independent so when a sleep technician scores a trace they have a set of criteria that they use to define which stage of sleep each 30-second epoch of time each 30-second window of time there is throughout that eight-hour period and they scroll through a 30-second page by 30 seconds and they score each of those they add them all up that's what gives your sleep profile and sleep score so using the criteria that we've had now for about 60 or 70 years they will score more of your sleep as being quote unquote slow wave sleep when you are on ghb because it seems to produce what looks like slow brainwave activity and by that criteria they have to score it as such but if you unbuckle yourself from this kind of standard sleep scoring criteria and a human and you just let an algorithm process the electrical signature of that sleep it now does not look like naturalistic sleep and in fact if there's anything that we've seen that xyrem seems to be detrimental to it's actually these things called sleep spindles now sleep spindles are these short synchronous bursts of electrical activity that happen during non-rem sleep they last for about a minute or a minute and a half and we know from the work that we've done and other people have done they are critical for things like learning memory and brain plasticity and what we found is that when you take ghb or xyrem the amount of sleep spindle activity is decreased often this shows up sort of at the end of as you're transitioning from theta to delta does this typically occur actually what happens is you usually sleep sleep spindles at the end of a deep slow wave so you've got all of these slow waves that happen during deep non-rem sleep and typically what happens is that sort of once you've hit the peak of that slow wave you will often have a little bit of a spindle burst and in fact those two things couple it's called phase amplitude coupling so at the peak of the deep slow wave on its awesome rise up that's the burst that's when you get the burst additionally of the sleep spindle so if i could convert it to a sound which we've done you would get these slow waves which would sort of sound like and then often riding on top of those slow waves you'll have a sleep spindle so you'll sort of have like

[01:33:00] and that is the sleep spindle it's this burst of faster frequency activity and the coupling of those two seems to be critical in terms of things like long-term memory transfer shifting memories from short-term to long-term so you protect them and make them safe those spindles also seem to have a role in terms of triggering the strengthening of connections between brain cells something that we call brain plasticity or long-term potentiation within the brain and when you are blocking those sleep spindles the idea would be that you're preventing typical memory and brain plasticity events that occur so once again you can see that so it's kind of a lesser of two evils it's you take a patient who's got narcolepsy if the alternative is they're constantly falling asleep at the point where they can't function normally well maybe we have to give up something but again what i'm hearing you say is if you're an individual whose sleep is not fully optimized assuming you can afford xyrem which pretty much no human being can afford it that's just not the solution either we don't have deep sleep in a pill that's right your analogy is a good one no one would say chemotherapy is good for a healthy individual but when you're suffering from cancer it's the less of two evils the same is true in narcolepsy yes you sort of the cost reward equation there is in the favor of taking the medication thank you for listening to this week's episode of the drive if you're interested in diving deeper into any topics we discuss we've created a membership program that allows us to bring you more in-depth exclusive content without relying on paid ads it's our goal to ensure members get back much more than the price of the subscription to that end membership benefits include a bunch of things one totally kick-ass comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic paper person thing we discuss on each episode the word on the street is nobody's show notes rival these monthly ama episodes or ask me anything episodes hearing these episodes completely access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear everything without having to listen to spiels like this the qualis which are a super short podcast that we release every tuesday through friday highlighting the best questions topics and tactics discussed on previous episodes of the drive this is a great way to catch up on previous episodes without having to go back and necessarily listen to everyone steep discounts on products that i believe in but for which i'm not getting paid to endorse and a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue to trickle in as time goes on if you want to learn more and access these member-only benefits you can head over to petertiamd.com forward slash subscribe you can find me on twitter instagram and facebook all with the id peteratiammd you can also leave us a review on apple podcast or whatever podcast player you listen on this podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine nursing or other professional health care services including the giving of medical advice no doctor-patient relationship is formed the use of this information and the materials linked to this podcast is at the user's own risk the content on this podcast is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice diagnosis or treatment users should not disregard or delay in obtaining medical advice from any medical condition they have and they should seek the assistance of their healthcare professionals for any such conditions finally i take conflicts of interest very seriously for all of my disclosures and the companies i invest in or advise please visit forward peteratiammd.comforwardslash about where i keep an up-to-date and active list of such companies
