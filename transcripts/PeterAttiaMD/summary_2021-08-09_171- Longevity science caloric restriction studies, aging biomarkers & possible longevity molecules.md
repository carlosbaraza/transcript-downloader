## Description

Steve Austad is a distinguished professor of biology at the University of Alabama and director of one of the Nathan Shock Centers of Excellence in aging biology. Steve's current research seeks to understand the underlying causes of aging, specifically with a long-term goal of developing medical interventions that slow the age-related decay of human health. In this episode, Steve tells Peter about his unusual childhood and stints as a cab driver and lion tamer. He goes on to describe what led to his focus on studying aging and some of the major challenges and limitations of working with laboratory animals. Steve and Peter talk about the relationship between caloric restriction and lifespan, including some of the most important studies exploring this question. Additionally, they hypothesize what might explain the sex-related differences in longevity between men and women, explain the importance of finding longevity biomarkers, and discuss the most promising molecules as potential longevity agents.

About:

The Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking…and a few other things. With over 30 million episodes downloaded, it features topics including fasting, ketosis, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, mental health, and much more.

Peter is a physician focusing on the applied science of longevity. His practice deals extensively with nutritional interventions, exercise physiology, sleep physiology, emotional and mental health, and pharmacology to increase lifespan (delay the onset of chronic disease), while simultaneously improving healthspan (quality of life).

## AI Summary

I'll help structure a comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast with Dr. Steve Austad. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focused on longevity science, featuring an in-depth discussion with Dr. Steve Austad about caloric restriction studies, aging biomarkers, and potential longevity molecules. The conversation covered the Wisconsin/NIA monkey studies, laboratory versus wild animals, and the challenges of translating animal research to humans. Key topics included sex differences in longevity, the limitations of current aging biomarkers, and potential therapeutic interventions for aging.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Laboratory mice are genetically very different from wild mice, affecting research validity [00:15:00]
- Female humans survive better than males at every age except for Alzheimer's disease [01:15:00]
- Wisconsin/NIA monkey studies had different outcomes due to diet composition (28% vs 3% sucrose) [00:45:00]
- Rapamycin shows different effects based on sex and dosage in mice [01:30:00]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Even late-life interventions can have significant health benefits [01:00:00]
- Dietary quality may be more important than caloric restriction [00:50:00]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Medications discussed:
- Rapamycin (most promising longevity drug in animal studies) [01:45:00]
- Metformin (most human data support) [01:46:00]
- SGLT2 inhibitors (showing promise) [01:50:00]

5. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Current epigenetic clocks may be too volatile for clinical use [01:35:00]
- Need for better biomarkers to assess interventions [01:40:00]

6. **Notable Quotes**:
"The worse the diet, the more beneficial the caloric restriction" [00:48:00]

7. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What would be the ideal biomarkers for measuring aging?
2. How can we better translate animal studies to humans?
3. What role does mitochondrial compatibility play in sex differences in longevity?
