## Transcript

[00:00:00] Whenever I think of the brain, I I I I think of GBMs, right? I think of these awful tumors. Uh which I guess for the listener, we can explain what that is. Um so so maybe tell folks what a GBM is, why a GBM is um truly one of the cancers that gives cancer a bad name. And and I guess my real question for you is given that traditional surgery has historically never worked for this tumor, you simply can't resolve it. And you think about the transition away from cranotomy big open procedure. Is there anything on the horizon for for GBMs to to render them less lethal? >> Yeah, it's a great question. So GBM stands for glyobblastoma multififormy and it's a mouthful of word but um if you break it down um what it's referring to the gal part of that word refers to the cell origin. Um the brain has different types of cells and if you look in the big buckets there's neurons which are the ones that primarily are the ones that allow us to do thinking and function and then there's a large population of support cells that we call ga and that's that first part glyopblasto originates from those support cell population. Multiforme refers to you know these original descriptions hisystologically of the tumors that really showed um um multiple form multiple hisystologology. Some of the key features of it are the necrosis. The tumor grows so quickly that it outstrips its blood supply and in its wake it leaves cell death what we call necrosis.

[00:01:37] So like you alluded to, it really is um you know a terrible kind of disease and condition. Um we are making progress and specifically around understanding what causes. So >> you know just 10 years ago uh you would remove one of these tumors and you send it to the lab and you could get the diagnosis of that this is a global.

[00:02:03] Now uh in most academic medical centers you'll also get a genetic profile of the tumor. So nowadays we actually know specifically what kind of mutations are involved in the tumor and that's going to be really critical for this next chapter which is using those genetic alterations actually to um to tailor and personalize you know uh chemotherapy and more. So um this has big implications because um we're now moving from an era where we use a visualization of the hisytologology now to this molecular profiling which is more mechanistic. Um the new chemo agents are really going to be targeting mechanisms as opposed to general things like cell cycle um and metabolism and things like that. So um these are the things that are changing you know and we need it to change faster. Um, there are also really exciting things that we're seeing around new ways to train the immune immune cells to to target things. It turns out that glyopblastoomas actually suppress parts of the immune system. So they they're kind of like growing in stealth and they activate, you know, molecules and cells in a in a cloak way that can't be recognized by immune cells anymore.

[00:03:17] And so if we can basically allow the tumors to be recognized by the immune system, that could be something that really unlocks therapy in the future, too. Um but um the things that we do know that work pretty well right now at least in terms of prolonging survival for patients and really meaningful survival actually still is around the surgery. We do know that the more extensive the resection um the longer the survival is and that's been really well characterized now but it's not curative like you said >> we can remove 99% or even 100 and beyond what we see on the MRI. Um, unfortunately there's usually microscopic cells that go beyond what we can see on the MRI that are still there and over time will repopulate, you know, um, the tumor. And so it is a really complicated and and and tough disease, but we're working really hard on it. >> Do we have any idea what predisposes an individual to this from a risk perspective? >> Um, short answer is no >> because it afflicts young, it afflicts old. I mean, I've watched children die of this, teenagers, people in midlife, people at the end of life. It seems to have no apparent pattern. >> Yeah. And part of that has to do with its mechanisms. It's not something that we consider as a heritable >> kind of risk. Um, but what it does rely on is a set of mutations and it's never it's rarely the same set. >> It's a very polygenic condition. >> Exactly. And that's what makes it, you know, really tricky to treat. Um, when we talk about glyoplasta, we're actually not talking about one thing. We're talking about a system of genetic alterations that together have cascaded in into the form that we see. >> And I suspect we'll we'll come back to this, Eddie, but you've alluded to chemotherapeutic agents that can be used whether it's to treat glyobblastoia or anything else, including METs of other epithelial cancers that spread to the brain. Um the bloodb brain barrier poses a challenge for treatment. Do you think the future lies in treatment within the

[00:05:21] CMS the C the CSF? So treating directly inside I don't know intratheally or directly into the central nervous system uh or do you think it's designing drugs that cross the bloodb brain barrier? I mean what do you think the future looks like? I think it's going to look like all of the above actually. And this is a situation where we do need to look at all possible options. This is not like the kind of thing where we're thinking like um non-invasive or minimally invasive like really something that will work as the first priority. Um one of the technologies I'm I'm really um interested in following how this develops and we're doing research on this at UCSF is using focus ultrasound.

[00:06:03] So most people know about ultrasound to diagnose, but if you change the energy profile of it, you can actually use acoustic energy through an ultrasound to uh actually open up the bloodb brain barrier and targeted parts of the brain. And so there is a lot of development on using that as a way to do delivery as opposed to putting a catheter or something directly in the brain. And then um with that a set of new agents that can be really molecularly specific to get to targets once you open up that bloodb brain barrier. >> Yeah. >> I want to back up and just have people understand how you even do a wake surgery because the traditional way that surgery is done requires general anesthesia. >> And general anesthesia typically requires three things. Um it requires one type of medication uh to to blunt pain. Yeah. >> Another type of medication to block memory and another type of medication to paralyze you. >> Now of course if things go wrong and things have gone wrong sometimes patients are paralyzed but they feel pain but they can't communicate it. And these are these catastrophic but fortunately very rare events that occur in anesthesia. But but correct anesthesia is done where a patient has no sense of time or memory of anything.

[00:07:20] They can't feel anything and they can't move, which means they're actually safe, right? It's it's to that's to save them as well. So, help us understand how it is that you can do surgery without all three of those conditions being present. I'm Peter Atia.
