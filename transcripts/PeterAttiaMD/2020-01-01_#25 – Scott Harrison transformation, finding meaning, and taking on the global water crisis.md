## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD com hi everyone welcome to this week's episode of the drive my guest this week is a gentleman by the name of Scott Harrison who I suspect many of you have not heard of which is not uncommon for this podcast but my hope is certainly that by the end of this episode you'll be glad you've heard of him and heard him

[00:00:57] Scott's the founder and CEO of charity:water which we'll talk about in great detail charity:water is a pretty unique charity not just in that the work they're doing is remarkable but I think the efficiency with which they do it in the transparency with which they do it and this sort of financial model that they've built is really interesting but truthfully the real reason I had Scott on was not so much to talk about charity water and we do get to it probably at the end of the podcast but it's more to actually talk about his personal story and even though Scott has you'll learn in this podcast is religious and I don't find myself to be a religious person in any way shape or form I am really moved by not just his conviction but this sort of incredible sense of purpose he's found in life and it's really his life's story and transformation that you know

[00:01:44] I'm really moved me the very first time we met which was about four or five years ago and to this day whenever I speak with Scott I come away feeling on some level like kind of a lousy person who's not good enough which is probably okay but more importantly just inspired and I'm convinced that you will you'll come away also feeling inspired by Scott who never once is the kind of person that leaves you feeling like why aren't you doing more but Scott has really dedicated his life to helping people in a way that I think many of us can only dream of I would go so far as to say honestly that Scott is one of two people that I consider the most remarkable people in the nonprofit space the other one being a woman by the name of Katherine Hoch who some of you may have heard of she's been on Tim Ferriss his podcast and I'm sure to have her on here at some point as well but you know between Kat

[00:02:34] Hoch and Scott Harris and I find them to be two of the most inspiring people who have really chosen to dedicate their lives to the public sector in this way part of the stuff we talk about in this episode has been covered in his book so Scott is now a New York Times bestselling author that book is called thirst

[00:02:50] I don't know that he'd want me to publicly disclose what the advance was there was a very sizable advance and he gave every single penny of that to his charity and all of that goes directly to the work that they're doing he's an amazing speaker and he's just kind of a magnetic personality so I would invite you to take a chance and listen to this even if it sounds like at the surface and this isn't what I'm really interested in but I think you will definitely get something out of this and you'll definitely get a sense as I did of how we can get a glimpse of happiness and how Scott on one level you know in the first chapter of his adult life seemed to be living what many of us might think that sounds pretty cool and interesting and I can see how that would make you happy but how he ultimately found something totally different and now I think Scott is probably one of the happiest people I know so without any further delay welcome to this episode with Scott Harris hey Scott get the happy here man nice to be here thanks for slumming on the Upper East

[00:03:50] Side with me take the train up it was pretty quick it's actually a nice day so it's beautiful it's the Falls my favorite time where do you live you live in Tribeca okay actually Battery Park City also we had kids and moved across the highway Connor so we met in kind of one of the funniest ways imaginable and that's been what three or four years ago yeah you get a tell them well no no it's just it's I mean you can tell I'll tell the story from my end and you can illustrate from your end but will not name the name of the person who we met through but we met through one of my patients and we were all at this meeting called dialogue which I've enjoyed and I've gone to probably for them I didn't go this year this my first you're not going in a while and it was a weird day but I had arranged for my family to come to meet at the airport and then we were gonna fly together on his plane to New York and as we were leaving the hotel he said hey I met this really cool guy he's gonna hop on the flight with us do you mind - which I said how can you ask me if I mind it's your plane of course but yeah awesome and so we basically you and

[00:04:56] I met in the you know for the first time and the car ride on the way to the airport because dialogue is big enough that it's easy to not meet somebody there so we didn't actually sit in any sessions together yeah so that's that was how we met it wasn't at your birthday it was it was just by coincidence that happen to be my birthday and the funniest part is we somehow got talking about watches and pretty early in the conversation you mentioned look I'm on a budget man I run a nonprofit I can't I can't be rolling with the high-level watches and I think you said sort of what is your best what's your favorite watch you know on a certain price point and I said oh this is a no-brainer man Seiko it's the Seiko cocktail yep and I remember on my phone

[00:05:40] I pulled up a picture and I showed it to you and you like that's gorgeous and and then and then we you know we spent seven minutes talking about that and 23 minutes talking about your story which was really captivating but then if I remember correctly your wife had been surprised you at the end of a flight with that specific watch that's right this is the only time my wife has bought me a watch because she generally doesn't like to support my watch habit but she also knew how much I loved the Seiko cocktail so when we're on the plane she whips out the watch which I couldn't believe it not only that she had done this even ordinarily I would have been very surprised but how could this have happened a few hours after we had just talked about it and then you gave the watch to me which was which was a wonderful surprise and and nice and then

[00:06:28] I think that surprised your wife even more well I asked her I said you know hey I know this is gonna sound strange but and I love the watch so please don't assume that like I'm asking you this because the watch but I think giving this watch to Scott would be like it's almost it's meant to be it's sort of he's meant to have this watch because it's what we talked about and I told her the whole story and she was like yeah you're right you gotta you gotta give him the watch which I'm very grateful for I actually heard someone in California who's a family friend say once that on his birthday he would give gifts to everyone else he would give gifts to his children and then later his grandchildren so he would look at his birthday as the time that he could lavish extravagant gifts on all the loved ones around him which I always thought was so nice well and you have kids so I think you understand what all of us understand who have kids and

[00:07:18] I'm sure there are people who have come to appreciate this even before they have kids which I guess in some way I did as well but it is really much more enjoyable to give than to receive and it was probably two years before I went out and finally bought myself a cocktail and it was funny I kind of forgot that I'd given it to you and then about a year ago I remember somebody on

[00:07:36] Twitter said Peter please tell me best watch to get under 500 and I said Seco cocktail here you go and you just chimed in on Twitter and made a comment that nobody else would have known what the context was but I was like oh my god I totally forgot about that that's fun and birthdays have been significant for me and for the organization so that was just a fun really fun thing so thanks for that well more importantly let's talk about the real stuff that we talked about because we had you know obviously that car ride and then we had like a five hour flight to New York when we got to really kind of talk about your story which which I was just blown away by and at the time my day job was running a non-profit and unfortunately for me that's a single it's very in the worst professional experience in my life I really hated running a non-profit

[00:08:23] I probably vented to you somewhat about how much I hated fundraising which sort of became the only thing I was doing but I was really blown away by not just your work but the efficiency with which you did it and once you're in the nonprofit space you start to understand what metrics matter and look I mean a lot of nonprofits are doing great work but some of them are doing it with staggering efficiency and you know I'm gonna want to hear all about that but actually the part that really gripped me was your background so let's if you don't mind can we start at the beginning sure where'd you grow up I was born in

[00:09:03] Philadelphia and my dad was he had been working for Arthur Andersen he was kind of on the big accounting career trajectory would would hope to make partner one day had me and then started traveling he was traveling all the time and said look I'm actually going to jump off that track and I'm gonna I'm gonna take a smaller job which what one not to be a transformer company you know selling power supply to the Navy into municipalities so we moved to get closer to his new job which would have him not on the road and allowed to just be a dad they wanted a bigger family in my mom and she was a writer so she was working for the Philadelphia Inquirer and the local newspaper and at four we pick up from outside of a suburb outside Philly moved to South Jersey and to this I remember it was a very gray drab four-bedroom house not their dream house by any stretch of the imagination but it was 22 minutes from his job which he just had 22 minute commute I remember he just kept saying well and it was a good school it was on a cul-de-sac so I could walk to school elementary school and what we didn't know was that the gas company had installed a faulty heat exchanger in this house and there was a carbon dioxide gas leak so we move in in the dead of winter and it's an energy-efficient house so the whole thing is just locked up tight and we all start breathing in these invisible fumes

[00:10:32] I get a little sick you know headaches and just some kind of allergy spring up my dad gets a little sick but we were only doing nights in the house and we were doing upstairs my mom unfortunately was doing all 24 hours in the house unpacking boxes fixing up the house fixing up the basement actually and on New Year's Day in 1980 she walks across the bedroom and she collapses unconscious and after a series of blood tests they finally identify massive amounts of carboxyhemoglobin but this took a while to come it was a period of months yeah yeah yeah there was this was a real I mean I in your book which we're gonna get to because obviously the listeners I think would really enjoy your book this was something I didn't even know from meeting you this is something I knew only from reading the book but that was a really really complicated diagnosis I mean that was not obvious to the doctors what was going on with your mom and and I almost it's not even clear you're representing in as much detail just how sick she became yeah and what happened again from my you know non-medical perspective was my mom's immune system died so it was irreparably destroyed and she went from flying around the world with my dad I mean they before they had me they were flying to Paris and to to Rome and you know vacationing in the Bahamas in

[00:11:50] Bermuda they were they were completely healthy she was a tennis player just as vibrant amazing wife and then later amazing mom from this moment effectively anything chemical begins to make her sick very sick perfume soap car fumes the ink from books would make her sick the print the smell from a new book and you know she goes from clinic to clinic and they wind up isolating her and they find that by isolating her from all toxins she can be ok so that the healthiest they can ever get her is drinking spring water eating one organic food on a rotation diet every six days so breakfast would be cashews lunch would be lettuce dinner would be a piece of cod because she had a slew of food allergies that came along with this and bringing her back from the clinics with this diagnosis of multiple chemical sensitivity or they called it environmental illness at the time and at one point if I recall she did a five-day fast they put her on water only to try to sort of detox her and and then try foods one by one in reacted negatively to almost every food so I think she had maybe it was 20 foods at the end after testing over 100 so what I remember as a kid was there was a miscarriage that happened around this time and then family planning stopped so I was an only child growing up and I go very quickly into a caregiver to help dad take care of mom this started when you were four or five four it happened very quickly we then prepared a special room for her that would be her safe room in the house and

[00:13:30] I remember it was a tile bathroom made a little bathtub and we put an army cot in there for her to sleep in and then we washed we used to wash everything in baking soda baking soda was just there was everywhere in the house so we would wash our clothes ten times and making so much to get any odor out we washed this army cot that was made out of cotton you know at least 10 times to get all the smell out and the member my dad covered the door with aluminum foil because there there might be the slight smell from the varnish stain used years ago so this then became her room and she always wore these charcoal masks which would also help just filter out there were years where oxygen you know played a part and she'd be walking around with oxygen tanks tell me how high her levels were so the diagnosis of carbon monoxide needs to be made through blood and you measure a byproduct of it and once you cross OH so most of us walking around should be at zero yeah what was her level funny I actually wrote about in the book I don't remember i remember it was way it was shot it was 20 or 25 times than the upper limit of what we would consider toxic yes and and way more than a smoker you know it was it was in the upper room we never tested dad and I it was interesting because we we were also exposed and I remember bouncing back so the food our just kind of went away the headaches went oh so you had food allergies as well I did too and I would I would have headaches I would have nausea my dad eventually ripped out the heater so he found the leak and then yeah threw the thing on the driveway it was a really sad story because my dad had actually suspected that maybe something was wrong with the stove or the heater so he called the gas company out a couple times they checked everything checked the hose and said no everything's fine so it was a plumber friend of his that said hey let's go down on the basement and they ripped out the thing and they found it themselves and this you know this really destroyed our lives and the gas company wasn't terribly accommodating if I recall no and and I guess most people would have expected my parents to sue for negligence I think a couple things happened one they had just become Christians they'd become people of faith right around this time I think I was 2 and they had a doctor friends you know from their church that said hey I don't think you should sue I don't think this would be good for your family to be in a long protracted angry bitter battle you've got healthcare and it was an accident it actually was an accident it wasn't like the gas company was trying to kill my family this was an accident this was a faulty piece of metal that was installed so I think my parents took a settlement check for 1,250 or $1500 from the gas company and he said you know ok and I can relate to that I had a really bad back injury in medical school which I've talked about in the past but a lot of things went wrong with my care including a surgeon that operated on the wrong side and I lived a different life for about a year including 3 months where I I couldn't even feed myself and when it was all like so now obviously I'm fine right and

[00:16:35] I was fine we done a relatively short period of time within a year I was completely functional and within I would say three years I was as good as before and whenever I tell the story people are always like oh you must have sued for a lot of money and it's fine it never crossed my mind and I always kind of joke about it and say oh I think it's because I grew up in Canada and we're simply not litigious people in Canada I don't know but I also realized that in the moment the only thing you want to do is get better and a lawsuit generally doesn't accelerate that now I'm not for a moment saying there shouldn't be litigious action and lawsuits certainly have their place but I think most people don't come to the conclusion that I think your family friend came to which is my brother's a lawyer so I see what lawsuits look like I understand from friends and family what that process is it generally results in more pain before there is a remedy certainly stress yes and you know I mean we talked about it and it sounds touchy-feely but stress really matters and especially in the case of what your mom was going through I suspect stress would have been a far greater impediment to her recovery the think about your story about your mom's story that blows my mind just as a doc is people like your mom often fall through the cracks in medicine because they're viewed as crazy so we have a bad habit in medicine of dismissing patients when we don't know what's wrong and they don't fit into an obvious bucket so you say well look she was totally healthy and now she's a wreck it's it's got to be in her mind you know she's got to be having a nervous breakdown there's got to be something going on and it's it's you know I see this a lot and I I'd get approached a lot by people who are in that situation and it breaks my heart because I don't know how to fix it I mean that's just I don't you know there's a real narrow lane that I play in but deep down I know like I just have a hard time believing that there's that many people who are sort of crazy and that in reality I remember something one of my med school professors said which is we use this term in medicine idiopathic idiopathic means we don't know what the cause is so you have idiopathic fill-in-the-blank idiopathic pain and he says you know what it really means is probably eighty otic like but referring to the doctor not the patient so I guess you were not old enough to recall but in discussions with your mom since I mean did you get a sense of how difficult it was for your mom and dad during the period of time when the diagnosis was unclear and it was this huge mystery of what the heck happened well I remember a minute right about this in the book people thought dad was crazy at work so or the mom was crazy so they would say oh this is just in her head and you know I remember the the term psychosomatic thrown around so so much as a kid and I was never a suspect of that until I became a teenager and then I joined that camp briefly just thinking it's just not possible I mean some of these things that she said made her sick just just seemed to defy logic to me to a 13 or 14 year old boy you know that there's this remember this is seem that I write about where there was a period of time where electromagnetic radiation was making her sick TVs and radio waves and I thought she's just trying to rain on my parade and make sure I don't watch TV or you know listen to the radio so that I'm read all the time up in my room I gotta try this with my kids anytime they spend more than 30 minutes on the iPad I start getting sick I gotta get sick start twitching so this one night you know I'm very very clever and the little teenage boy you know climbs up the stairs and I've got a radio in my hand and all the lights are out and I'm patting very softly and there's an outlet right outside the door so her doors closed the tinfoil door and

[00:20:24] I turned the radio I plug it in but the volumes all the way down and I turned the speakers so that they're aiming right at the cot where she's sleeping on the other side of the door and I'm like I'm just gonna I'm gonna nuke you all night mm-hmm with the radio waves you're gonna wake up fine and I'm gonna have a big ah-ha

[00:20:43] I mean I'm gonna drop the mic on this and I'm gonna listen to all the radio I freaking won from this point on well the opposite happened you know the morning she woke up she was terribly sick I don't remember the specific symptoms she had that day but she was really scared because what had gotten to her in her safe room I mean this is the room that she would go to recover from exposure to things and actually don't remember feeling that much kind of shame or you know feeling that bad as a kid but it did cross that off the list you know I believed her and that was a really important moment for me to say wow okay she's you know specifically with this she's not crazy and that was one of the the crazier ones I mean you can understand how car fumes you know or a diesel truck going by it's probably not great for our bodies well mom would have a migraine within 30 seconds of that exposure or often would even break out you know her body would just start reacting so it was weird it was a weird childhood I remember you know you just have these glimpses and these scenes that the books was just this illustration of how far she'd really gone and mom being a writer she was also an avid reader and she still wanted to have books in her life so my dad's and my solution to this was we would we'd bake them we would open up the oven and we would just start baking over you know the period of a day or two on low you know maybe 200 250 and we'd be moving the pages just to try to al Cass it to get that smell of new print out through the heat we would also put him out in the

[00:22:16] Sun so I just recently was home and I came across a family photo in an album of a hundred books out on the grass baking in the Sun just out out gassing so that was a there were these words you know outgassing reacting you know these are words that getting pure that would just here you know countless times growing up so I wanted mom to be like other moms but I'd say in the first part of childhood I was really taking care of her I felt bad for her I would go sing her songs or I would go and sit with her

[00:22:48] I was always getting pure so if I came in from the outside world I would have to wear special clothes that had been washed in baking soda and there were clothes trees out in the garage where I'd take off the clothes that might have I don't the whiff of smoke on them or you know my dad was always giving me the sniff test like a bloodhound do you know

[00:23:08] I'd walk in from the outside and you know you know oh I smell this or I smell that because I never wanted to change my clothes I'd say I'm fine I wasn't around anything I went for a walk you know there's they would always smell something so then you know I would I would I was constantly getting pure so that I could be around her and it was it was it was weird I did a lot of the cooking for her I did the cleaning did the washing up and then I think is that moved towards as it moved into teenage years I just began to really resent it and resent her last thing just I'm going back a minute you know the what was really helpful for my parents was finding other people like mom who had been sick and I don't remember she was the only one I remember that had been sick because of a gas leak but I do remember a couple people in our family friends that had been completely normal and then one day a pesticide company came in and did all the lawns in the neighborhood I think was called

[00:24:07] Chemlawn and then they just snapped and they were like mom the next day so there was something in their body that just couldn't take massive amounts of pesticides you know throughout the entire neighborhood on their lawn and their front lawn in their backyard and you know that made sense to me at least there was an event pesticides are probably not good for any of us but you're you know your body and my body we we can fight that off so I remember that really helped me too because saying mom is not alone there is a community of environmentally sensitive patients and my dad was just this hero through the whole thing he doesn't leave her I mean they slept in separate beds for almost ten years because that was a period of time well she needed to be in this special room and there was a period of time where he would make her sick the candida I mean it was just always always something making her sick and he just stuck stuck by her me it was very loyal tried to do the best he could with me and take me to baseball when he could and soccer and gave me the most normal life that he could but it was far from normal you know you and obviously there's many kids that go through variations of this but in many ways you were sort of what we would call a meshed the enmeshment meaning you you were forced into an adult role too soon and I guess it's not surprising to me that as a teenager you'd start to kind of rebel against that because you sort of you missed that period of life when you have absolutely no responsibility and you had responsibilities I mean it's hard for me to imagine what you're talking about based on a personal experience but but I can try to extrapolate that you know look you you were forced into a caregiver role you were sharing care with your father of your mom and so do you remember when it started to sort of become frustrating to you and you know my guess is the combination of adolescence and puberty by themselves are enough jarring disruptive change coupled with the you know the soil of of all you've experienced I think you know there was a hope as a child maybe that this would end and when you hit adolescence and you know I realized this was never gonna end there was no cure and you like could you bring friends over after school and hang out or was that just too disruptive to the house only if they stayed outside so there were signs keep out on all the doors chemically safe sensitive patient so no they couldn't come in you know there were periods of time later on in high school where if they did get pure and mom was in a different part of the house then you know we could open up the windows and you know air out that room so they were there were some exceptions but the general rule was you know everything and all life had to happen outside of the house you know this is terrible for her to you know to not be able to you know play video not video games play board games or I mean she'd be watching out a window as I played soccer in the back but she couldn't really meet my friends and see what they were like she couldn't invite them into the kitchen and bake brownies all these things that she really wanted to do so there was a lot of pain for her feeling like she wasn't able to show up as a mother or as a wife how'd your mom cope with that pain emotionally pain well my parents there's there's one answer she had this unwavering faith she would read the Bible she would she would try and stay positive she would thank

[00:27:30] God for her symptoms and believe that through these trials she was getting closer to you know to to serving you know closer to kind of having this pure hearts so really I mean just a remarkable extreme version of stoicism really yeah if you think about it I mean I I think you know the Stoics Marcus Aurelius and Seneca of course they don't talk so much about religion but there's still this belief that these these challenges make us better these struggles this pain without it you know you you can't sharpen the knife without a shot without you know a blunt object and for Mom I think that was you know it sounds like no she was describing it and in the picture of Jesus he was suffering and you know there well there's all these stories that she would find in the

[00:28:13] Bible of people suffering and it being for a great purpose you know there being a reason for it all so I just remember she would if she would walk around and she would say like praise God for the fabric softener that just made her sick you know she was just trying to stay positive well throughout all of this so you know kicking up into the teenage years - I start to rebel against the role of faith the role of the church the rules the religiosity I didn't like going to church anymore you know it's more fun as a kid when they're telling stories of Jonah and the Whale and the flannel boards but not as a as a teenager when you just realize you're not allowed to swear you're not allowed to sleep around you can't drink you can't smoke it was there a lot of rules there's a lot of can't Deus you know I remember I have this vivid memory of coming home after school and mom there was a period of time where mom then lived out in the yard a friend built a lean-to so she found that in times where the pollen wasn't too bad or the mold wasn't too bad there were seasons where she would feel better sitting outside than in her safe room and she would have this little igloo cooler next to her she would have a chair she would have her mask on and she would just protect herself from the wind so she would be on one of these four corners depending on which way the wind was blowing and I would come home from school and she'd hear the car pull up in the driveway and she'd yell my name and I'm just pretend not to hear and I'd walk in the house which you know that that to me feels like the kind of the picture of this just got old this was tiring you know I didn't want to go and find out what she wanted me to bring her and I can only imagine that on some level that produces some guilt and shame within you but at the same time it's sort of a protective thing that you're doing because of all the sort of the pain and the trauma that that you've been you know it's been inflicted on you since you're 4 years old and so I've always find like stories like this to be so tragic in a way and I mean I think in many ways your story has a happy ending but for many people these don't have happy endings because nobody's at fault here these this isn't about like blame or fault right people get sick bad things happen and yet families can get ripped apart by these things in ways that aren't entirely obvious and I think what comes next in your story to me is it makes much more sense after I read your book than just knowing a couple of snippets along the way now you're a pretty musical guy right Briana growing up you know I remember my grandpa taught me at 4 taught me on an Oregon and I always played so then in high school you you transfer to a new school if I recall yeah I got to talk about the first high school so that yes this is also rebellion so I had gone to public elementary school and then they put me in a Christian kind of Baptist middle school which I actually liked but then ninth grade freshman year of high school they put me in the basement of a church school and there were nine people in my freshman class and they couldn't afford enough teachers so we would be taught by

[00:31:20] VHS video so they would wheel in the cart remember those old gray metal carts and I had kind of the ribbed trays and they'd pop in science and we'd sit there for 45 minutes which felt like it was a hundred hours and it was just terrible and we had to wear these ugly uniforms and it was just everything was wrong for a fourteen-year-old kid I going to school in the basement of a church buy video and and I was surprised this was accredited how it's amazing to me they did their best and and it's funny because I know a bunch of people that came out of that school that did all four years and actually became very successful I just at that moment I wanted to explore the public high school and they couldn't be any more different there were 4,000 people Wow in high school I think my parents saw something in something simmering maybe in my personality that really scared them you know throwing me into this worldly high school were undoubtedly there would be drugs and sex and drinking and ungodly things going on and I remember just saying look I'm gonna run away from home or I'm not going back to this school and they said you know and I was smart enough to say look I'm not being challenged academically challenged I was an avid reader growing up I remember getting a job when I was I think I was 14 writing or 14 and 15 writing for the local county newspaper so I was a pretty good writer I was an avid reader TV was just TV made mom sick so we did have a tiny TV but it was in a in a room that would they made really uncomfortable and maybe I watched a couple hours of TV a week growing up so reading was really my escape and I move into the big high school and exactly what they had feared happens almost immediately fallen with the wrong crowd I fall in with a crowd who's older and is not really interested in going to high school but was in a band so I then joined the band which was a alternative rock band so it was kind of counting crows meets Pearl Jam meets live and I was gonna be the keyboard player what was the name of the band it's called Sunday River mm-hmm just random it was like a ski resort in New

[00:33:34] Hampshire we'd heard of and nobody'd even been to so I joined this band and I grow my hair as you start growing my hair out so it hits my shoulders and I become the band's and I self appoint as the band's manager and I am going to get us a record deal so you know the keyboard guy and the manager manager so

[00:33:52] I'm sending our demo tapes into New York City and for some strange reason people listen to our tapes and say hey we'll book you so we start playing CBGB's the wetlands it's just like what mid 80s late 80s this would be let's see you know 75 93 okay okay 93 to 95 yeah and we're driving my parents Ford Taurus station wagon you know I'm throwing all the gear the keyboards and the guitars we're driving into New York City we're driving into Philly we're playing not that interested in going to school so I'm c- student at best in this new high school and I'm not jumping into the drugs so the band was doing and I'm not jumping into all the vices yet but they made it look good and they made it look cool so what prevented you from joining them I don't know I think I was still holding on to yeah the virtue I was still trying to stay pure I guess you could say so what was the what was the best part for you in that moment prior to going you know further into you know drugs or all those other things was it just a sense of like community and tribe with these guys yeah and play music was fun playing music in front of you know 300 400 people driving into New York City to the legendary CBGB's where you know I don't know all these great bands had been discovered and been been found and then talking with a and our people at labels that were interest being pursued by real managers this was a moment in time that felt like we were we had a shot at getting a record deal and in record deals back then they were the thing no you know there was Atlantic

[00:35:33] Records and BMG and virgin you know it was a really exciting possibility how close for you to the other guys in the band they know about your story at home they did they did I wasn't that close they were in a way they were they were other they were more worldly they hadn't been sheltered they you know had been sleeping around for years they'd been smoking and experimenting with with drinking and drugs for years they were older maybe 2 to 4 years older so I was the the baby the band but it was it was a sense of community it was it was fun being together playing music and driving to have these experiences it felt dangerous it felt edgy so I barely graduate high school I remember up until the very last day neither my parents nor

[00:36:23] I knew whether I would actually have enough attendance credits to get the high school diploma I mean I was on the brink it was one day I thought shy of actually passing and I would have to repeat the 12th grade and I think I probably Oh I probably got a doctor or something to lie about you know something I mean I I managed to pass but certainly you know high school was not a a person you were a senior were you applying to college I wasn't because I was I was delighted to announce to my parents that I would not be going to college I would not be pursuing further education because I would be getting a record deal Peter that's what that's what bands steal right all bands in New

[00:37:05] York City and we get I would be getting a multi-million dollar record deal I announced my parents so who would need a college education when you had a multi-million dollar record deal and you were touring not just the country but the world and your parents had worked pretty hard to put money aside for you to go to college they had so there was a little over $100,000 sitting in an account since birth you know he'd been putting in probably couple hundred bucks a month or whatever he could my dad was very middle-class they they didn't spend money thinks they'd run their cars 15 20 years and you know they'd buy a Toyota Camry and keep it for 20 years would go to you know the diner when it was two-for-one special so he was a saver I need save for college so this was really an affront to them and and I think what made it even more difficult was that when I was a child I wanted to be a doctor so I was talking about Johns

[00:37:57] Hopkins Medical School that was if you'd ask me probably up until 1314 what I was gonna do it was doctor to help sick people like mom I was going to be in the meta you know and I obviously didn't have the grades to do that in high school and took a different path so yeah I moved to New York City by myself I'm the only band member that takes the leap but I said well the band's manager me needs to be in the heart of things I moved to an apartment in Greenwich

[00:38:25] Village I was paying six hundred and fifty dollars a month it was on Christopher Street and 7th and it wasn't too big if I recall it was it was hundreds of square feet it was tiny it was a sixth floor walk-up and it just felt amazing I mean I was living in the heart of the West Village alone that's the dream it was the dream and I start working at Samuel so you was at 96 95 said this would be were you here for the big snowstorm in January of 96 do you remember that I was yeah this would've been 94 so I was 19 and you know I I start working at Sam Ash music cuz I wanted some some pocket money alongside you know the very little money that our bands would would make gigging and you know I then realized that so I actually met a manager for our band who says well

[00:39:17] I'm actually a real band manager and I'll take you guys on and we we signed a contract and I remember him finding out that my dad had saved for college and he said well you're in New York City you're crazy to squander that money I'm he's not gonna give it to you for anything else so I want you go to NYU part-time you might as well get a degree and there's Tisch you know School of the Arts I mean it's it's you're in the city of might as well you have the time and he'd been an NYU grad so I then call my parents and say okay you can start paying NYU so I've got another scholarship I mean you know I picked one of the most expensive schools in the country and I do wind up getting a degree again you know without any sort of colors I mean see student really just putting in the minimum amount of work to make dad happy and where did you study communications because it was easy I could write and communicate mm-hmm so the band breaks out which by the way does does come back there's a lot of there's a lot of this it's so funny I mean I've now gotten several awards from

[00:40:20] NYU they invite me in to speak I just made a video for the like commencement ceremony so now I'm like you know celebrated by NYU many years later and every time they've interviewed me probably six or seven interviews now I'm like okay so here's what really happened don't ask me these questions because I can't lie okay I can talk about the city being a great campus I could talk about you know the diversity of New York and the community but don't ask me what it was like for me because I would know I was not your good student so okay so I'm living in the village I'm working at Sam

[00:40:53] Ash the band breaks up months later and there was a lot of drugs and we we just didn't like each other that much I mean it was we didn't like you said other outside of the time that we were on stage but I've already made the leap to New York I've got this NYU opportunity and I'm making pretty good money selling high-end stereo gear I remember one night Stevie Wonder came in and I got to sell him 50,000 dollars of gear and make a commission on that you know words and modules and all this stuff so I was I won some favor with my managers that I would get to do a lot of the big clients

[00:41:28] I then almost immediately start dabbling in nightlife so you've got all this stuff going on a minute NYU part-time I'm working at Sam Ash and then the guy that booked out my band convinces me just by way of watching him that I was always on the wrong side of the equation because our band would turn up we'd bring a hundred people to the club paying customers and they might throw us a twentieth of that or a thirtieth of that and say hey here's a couple hundred bucks go split it up six ways you know wasn't even enough to pay for a guy sir you know the guitar strings hmm but

[00:42:04] I I love the idea of the nightclub owner you know the person on the other side of the rope deciding who got in and who didn't so I I try my hand at that and I joined this guy and say you know he starts throwing me 100 bucks a week or 200 bucks a week and I'm just his sidekick and what's your actual job the job is to fill the venue with beautiful paying customers and then you get a cut and how do you go about figuring out who's beautiful and paying and get them into said club is it literally going out to a lineup on the street and trying to identify in the line who should jump up that's a great problem to have now you got actually you better get the line you gotta get the line so that a lot of that is just networking it's being out meeting people getting their phone numbers you know later getting their email addresses but if you were a club promoter today starting at zero you'd have to be out seven nights this week and you'd be striking up conversations hey how are you I'm Pete what do you do you know I'm in New York City and I'm living in a couple different places oh hey would you want to want to come to a party sometime I've got this amazing fashion party we're gonna be doing for

[00:43:13] Prada during Fashion Week and you'd say that sounds great I'd say oh cool I'll put you on the list all email and you might say well I won't actually put together a group of friends great I'll sell you a table you know it's gonna cost a couple thousand dollars but I'll give you prime seating in the club and I wave this amazing deejay flying in from

[00:43:30] Paris and you know he throws parties at hotel costs like you know you may not have even heard of any of this stuff but we make it sound so great it's a party you have to be at so we're promoting we're constantly out there promoting and now I have Peter on the list and maybe you come and you bring a few friends so what did you do before email was around because this was fun awful all just dialing but I don't even have cell phones like Howard was home phones

[00:43:53] I was office it was voicemail it was beepers we'd beat people they'd call us back email believe me the minute that took off we embrace though right away and then we started building you know one of the first email lists in clubs and open rates were 100% I mean it was it was extraordinary meaning everybody I dreamed of everybody would open an email even a forum email like shut whereas your day what would that open rate be five yeah you know maybe I don't know so imagine the next time you know Airbnb or you know Google sends out an email or Apple ok apples a perfect example right Apple sends an email new event coming new iPhones maybe five to eight percent mmm-hmm would actually open it yeah your delete it or I'll see it later or just sits there so back then you know imagine apples and something and every single person is like oh my gosh I got an email so we start a list and you know I just get good at this and I leave my partner

[00:44:53] I go start producing a live arm be open mic night add pretty legendary club called Nels on 14th Street that you know is in Bret Easton Ellis books and you know place that Mick Jagger used to always hang out so I'm I for somehow you know this this skinny white kid from Philadelphia New Jersey winds up helming this really impressive R&B show so

[00:45:20] Stevie Wonder would come and perform Chaka Khan would perform Prince used to come in and perform for a prince yeah I used to I have some fun print stories he's to always this was a kind of dark lounge almost Victoria setting Victorian era setting so they're the old mirrors and when the little sconces on the wall you know with but almost a candle lights and whenever Prince came in but I would have to go and unscrew the lightbulbs he liked to sit in a very specific area but he wanted it dark mm-hm and you know then his bouncer would just he would sit alone and then his bouncer would block off he would he would sit backwards in a chair and kind of just tell everybody they couldn't see him or he couldn't docked him and he would just sit there taking in the music and then sometimes he would actually jump up and perform that's so interesting so he really was there for the music you know you get that you get the impression a lot of celebrities like they like being there because they want to be the celebrity but it was the opposite yeah and I remember we would say at the time you I don't even know that I was that insightful as you were you just were we're like why would the guy come to a club if he doesn't want to talk to anyone if he doesn't want to be seen and doesn't want to talk to anyone well of course it was the music because we had these unbelievably talented keyboard players and drummers and a lot of them had gigged with Brian McKnight and Stevie

[00:46:42] Wonder so that's how the people were coming you know if your drummer has a residency at Nell's at Tuesday night your drummer is like hey what are you doing on Tuesday and you'll come by and you recognize people and you just it's fun to jump up so I got to actually play piano for Stevie Wonder onstage a couple times I remember I was playing overjoyed and Stevie wasn't even playing he was just standing up singing well I'm playing keyboards and it was a raise it was an amazing experience it was called voices ed Nels moved from there over into the more fashion model scene of clubs because there's more money to be made there we would call it models in bottles so this was the advent of bottle service when I guess a few of us promoters and club owners realized that instead of charging people eighteen dollars at the bar for a vodka soda you could take the same $18 price point and charge them five hundred dollars for a bottle of Absolut Vodka at their table and they wouldn't have to keep going up and getting refills and oh by the way the 500-hour bottle of Absolut cost you what sixteen dollars yeah sort of amazing to me when you look at like the high-end clubs like one oak and things like that like what you'll pay for a bottle there relative to the wholesale cost it's there can't be a bigger margin in any business at history of civilization but but the value if you actually figured out how many drinks you could get out of a bottle of Stoli let's say and then how much you'd have to pay at the bar its commensurate alright cuz it charging you twenty bucks for a vodka soda at the bar anyway so 30 drinks and you're at a 600 ollar bottle yeah wouldn't you rather have it at the comfort of your table yeah so yeah the whole thing was just kind of crazy models in bottles so the way that the scene worked is we would have to figure out how to get beautiful girls inside the nightclub and then very wealthy guys would pay for the pleasure of sitting around beautiful girls so you'd have all your finance guys you know the Goldman guys what there amx black cards and they'd come they'd weed off him at the door you know we'd swipe the card for 5 or 10

[00:48:46] G's and then try and they would buy tables and then we would populate the tables with cool people you know often models who would drink for free and we party for free and I mean was there any interest in knowing or did it matter if these were professional girls or meaning professional girls meaning women that we're gonna basically take you know money for sex it wasn't like that it actually wasn't like that and there was no official kind of process it wasn't like that no we would does that because I feel like today that's sort of pretty normal

[00:49:20] I have a lot of friends who are single and they talk about this they're like where they will get paid were the women get paid yeah we never did yeah the women are paid to be there and you know it's just understood that like there's a way to plus up on what you're gonna pay to go home with her yeah that's that was foreign to us I mean this is many years ago no we we would make friends with the modeling Booker's and the heads of the modeling agencies we would give them a great experience and then they would come out with the girls so a Booker from a modeling agency might take out 12 of his models we would make sure they had a great time you know everything was free from the food to the booze but now you have 12 beautiful girls in a club so it's like they're bait to get these guys in who are basically like the Sharks right for their Chum for the guys who are sharks but a lot of these girls would love to date the Goldman guy living in the 12,000 square-foot Soho loft you know who might be a gentleman let's go with best-case scenario right right right so you've got the so everybody's potentially winning because this is a matchmaking service basically where you're doing the first layer of screening based on wealth and beauty exactly but that's all we did so then the rest would just happen and if you got a guy who was a jerk or was too handsy he just wouldn't let him in anymore so we would be blacklisting the bad actors all the time and at the end you wind up with a group of really cool young rich guys who are fun the girls love being around them they're funny they're spending money they might be even good-looking you know

[00:50:56] I mean they're they're kind of the life of the party and the next thing you know you know you're in st. Barts with the same people or you're in Milan with the same people or you're in Paris like the party would travel around the world so the way we got paid as nightclub promoters we would just say that the beauty of the business at least for a while is that your asset light so you just take a cut of the total business of the night so it might be 15% let's say let's say it's 20% so you walk into a nightclub and what were what were the best clubs back in so we're now talking kind of late 90s right so I can only speak to my experience the first night I went out was it Club USA and there was this famous slide their earliest clubs I worked at there was the limelight and I worked for Peter Gatien there was the tunnel there was the Roxy there was Twyla Lotus was a big club for us I was there for many years Pangaea halo I mean I you know some of the names

[00:51:54] I know people will say them and I'm like oh my gosh I actually worked there so I worked at 40 different venues over this almost 10 years how many of those clubs are still around today none so what's the half-life of a pot New York Club maybe five years now some of the clubs exist because the liquor license is so valuable but they'll just get reskin or repurposed so some of the same your licenses are there in the same building but it's now just a new look new feel new name and there might have been six of those since I left mmm six change of brand or even ownership so that's kind of a blurry time to be quite honest yeah so we've done what we've skipped over is band in high school you're still not doing drugs you're not drinking you're not de botching by this point as a nightclub promoter have we slipped into some of that for sure smoking was first in drinking then lots of sex then gambling then coke started with coke then marijuana the next to see

[00:52:59] Special K MDMA you know anything short of heroin that we could get our hands on as pure as we could why did you decide to draw the line at we'd seen people OD and I you know that was and I'd seen it firsthand my business partner snorted heroin once by mistake and almost died you know emergency room he was out cold unconscious on a floor inside a you know the kitchen of a nightclub so I just I'd seen really bad heroin trips coke you know I never seen anyone die of coke or die from you know ecstasy so I I pick up all the all the dark habits of you know what you might imagine would come with the territory our lifestyle wasn't a picture of health we'd go to dinner at 10:00 you know so the very late dinner at the trendy restaurant we'd head over to the club around midnight 12:15 to the restaurants comp you guys as well yeah because we're bringing beautiful people so it made the restaurants look like a scene you know it was the beautiful and they would do this for a few tables I mean it's the it's the eye candy sometimes we'd bring in guys who would who would just bounce to the whole dinner he depended on the model and the dress guys you never had to buy a dinner

[00:54:09] I wasn't pay for dinner during this period of time how often were you going home to check on mom and dad for that matter every couple months every couple months and I would do a quick 48-hour trip and I same as always I'd turn up with my clothes I'd walk into the garage I would strip down naked I'd put on the clothes that they left out for me there was a period of years where it was medical coats these gowns that they had gotten from you know a hospital that were sanitary and people walking around like lab coats hung hospital scrubs in the house you know my parents parents concerned they were I mean I was living out their worst nightmare I was the prodigal son that had flipped them in church and you know all shred of morality virtue the bird and said going to New York City I'm gonna make it rich and famous okay the band didn't work I'm gonna be the biggest nightclub promoter in New York City and I'm gonna sleep with every hot girl that I can get my hands on I'm gonna do every good drug get my hands on and I'm gonna live it up

[00:55:14] I'm gonna party I mean it was so opposite of the if you think about the basement of the Christian school with nine people and the uniform right this was living I'm on him I'm out of my own I'm flying to Paris for Fashion Week I'm dating girls that are walking in the shows I'm staying in the nicest hotels you know drinking the best wine going to Paris nightclubs that better I mean it was just it was amazing were you happy I thought I was for a while because I was collecting the markers of happiness so you know just take most promoters you know one of the first things you need to do is you need to get the top model girlfriend so you have to figure out how to do that so you know collected that so kind of check bark then you know I got the car the BMW and you know then I got the Rolex and then I got a nice loft and rented a grand piano and the great speaker system and so I was kind of you know as we would have a little more success I would buy the things that I thought came with success and there was always an emptiness in that I think the more it just got really old the the banality of having to do the same thing over and over again and I guess what I mean by that is you would change clubs but there were periods where we would hate emailing and then getting on the phone because the email was one way to get people to turn up but if you called them in a much better shot right if I actually say hey Peter you got to come tonight it's gonna be amazing we would still have to call hundreds of people to every week to invite them to the parties and I remember just hating so what was it so did you do that was was basically seven nights a week you're trying to get people working three nights a week and then you're out networking the other you know three or four so you're almost you're out most nights a week but I would only be doing three parties maybe a Tuesday night of

[00:57:17] Thursday night and then a weekend a bridge-and-tunnel kind of Saturday night party let's say and you you've got to this a moment ago before I interrupted you but dinners at 10:00 so by the time I'm going to bed you're having dinner yeah then what then the club at 12:15 til 3:30 and then yeah maybe home by 4:00 and then half the nights here at after-hours but hey let's keep going let's go back to somebody's loft with a bunch of coke to stay up because then you need that just you're tired because it's for the morning and cokes not good for sleeping as my recollection correct not from personal use actually I've never used coke but just from the pharmacology of it I reckon it probably isn't too good for sleep that's right so then but if you start doing cocaine or if you were doing it all night you're amped up so high that at some point you will you have to come down so then you might take an ambien you know again so it's not exhausting not actually good for sleep believe it or not despite the fact that the FDA seems to think so yeah and you might be trying to go to sleep you know on a hard raging night that included after hours or a party at somebody's loft you're you're stumbling home and you really are stumbling home because you've been drinking all night and it might be vodka redbull if you're trying to stay up it might be coke it might be you might be on ecstasy which would have a you know maybe a 3 to 5 hour run maybe even longer and you know it's 10:00 or 11:00 and you're walking home in broad daylight you've been up since you know dinner at 10:00 was was your starting point and you're looking at all these healthy people just going about their business and see you're watching the runners at 7:00 in the morning feels disgusting actually it feels and you know you're not a doctor or surgeon on a midnight shift doing noble work you know you've just been thrashing your body in the bodies of all those around you so it really started to take its toll on me emotionally on me physically am i right about this actually in the first chapter in the book I just go numb half my body

[00:59:19] I lose feeling in it inexplicably and I start seeing neurologists and getting MRIs and tons of diagnostics and they can't find anything actually wrong with me it's sort of interesting yeah the irony of this after all your mother's gone through and you know my business partner says well why don't you lay off the three packs of cigarettes I mean I was I was such a fiend when he came to smoking I smoked bread's to was the baseline but if it was a long night I'd smoke 60 cigarettes in a day it's amazing I'm even here and

[00:59:48] I start trying to knock back all this stuff and and then now this leads into really the the Epiphany and the change so the first thing that happens is I have a physical full-on numbness that is not diagnosed and I remember running my left hand under boiling hot water I remember exactly where I was in my lofts and I couldn't feel it it was terrifying yeah I thought something was very very wrong with me this then leads to a internal to an internal conversation about my immortality and my belief system and the life that I'm living so I imagine that I have a brain tumor and you know or some some horrible disease because why else would have my you know have my body the paresthesia was it's never good you know if you go online and start looking at you know half her full body pairs these are like it's bad stuff so interesting you know now with perspective perhaps this was more I don't know if spiritual is the right word but I think there was more going on than just the physicality of you know maybe the drugs had caught up with me I don't know the smoking the drinking around this time couple months later I go to Punta del Este for New

[01:01:01] Year's Eve and we would always spend about two weeks every New Year's fleeing New York City we hated New York around New Year's it's just the whole you just didn't like the tourists the Time Square the tourists this everything was wrong I mean anybody that was fun or interesting got the heck out of town they went to the Caribbean they went to you know they would go anywhere warm so warm for us was typically in Brazil we could a place called buzios we'd go to Argentina this year we went to Uruguay to Punta del

[01:01:30] Este only rented this amazing house and remember the house came with servants who would cook and follow after us picking up our towels and my girlfriend came down who I was sure was the most beautiful girl on the compound she was on the cover of fashion magazines in Europe at the time you know it was 6:1 and Danish just beautiful and I just remember we said all right let's go to the fireworks store let's spend a thousand dollars on fireworks and then we blew them up next to the pool and let's buy all the magnums of

[01:02:01] Dom Perignon that weekend and then there's just champagne flowing and then there was a party that wouldn't end and it started on two thousand three two thousand two this is yeah 2004 January 2004 so it's the turn between oh three and oh four we have a New Year's Eve party this has to be the last day it's a 2003 and you know as a DJ that's come in and it's gonna be on our compound so we rented the sound system and people from the town people from other houses that we knew we're gonna party on our pool and you know I remember just getting lit that night and taking actually went to sleep for a few hours woke up popped an ecstasy pill ether at nine or ten in the morning and sometime in the afternoon I really wanted the party to stop I wanted all these people to leave it's not a good look when a party goes on for a day it'll look pretty ragged including myself and it just you know I started having these realizations that this is not how life was to be lived this actually wasn't how a beautiful compound like this was supposed to be enjoyed I mean we had wrecked the serenity of the place you know the the furniture was strewn all over you know glass bottles broken by the side of the pool I mean this was just kind of just gross and I just started doing some when everybody eventually did leave I started doing some soul-searching I realized that I you know I certainly wasn't in love with my girlfriend and I don't think she was in love with me this was almost a relationship of convenience you know my

[01:03:41] I started reading a deep theological book called the pursuit of God that my father had given me at Christmas and you know my parents for ten years had been trying to get me back in church get me back on the right track preaching at me sending me different translations of the Bible I mean this was all just falling on deaf ears but there was something about this moment the paresthesia that just really caused me to take stock of my life both spiritually and morally and just begin to kind of say where am I and what have I done in a way and I realized that there would never be enough as I looked around the interesting thing was almost everybody at the compound was richer they were older they had the plane they you know had the better car they they had more money and they they weren't that happy either

[01:04:35] Peter I mean this was there was so much brokenness there was so much wreckage I mean many of our top bottle buyers the guys who would spend ten or fifteen thousand dollars paying for the booze you know they'd run off on their wife sometimes their kids didn't talk to them because they were they were dating models younger than their kids and there was a lot of brokenness so this week for me I remember just having a change of hearts saying I'm not on the right path and I want to find my way back to the spirituality the virtue kind of my heritage you know the the moral foundation of of the way that I grew up this isn't working anymore this sucks this feeling sucks I feel dirty I feel degenerate I feel like a like a hedonist and something needs to change did you think of that in sort of a moral way or did you think of that more in just an absolute way and I don't know if that's the right way to describe it but because you know I think you could objectively say all those things without applying a moral judgment - right yeah I mean I think it was through a spiritual lens you know I I was trying to find my way back - to God or what I believed that meant for me and that was that was virtue that was purity that was blessed are the peacemakers you know blessed are those who look after the poor and who give of themselves in the service of others you know loving your neighbor I mean I wasn't doing any of this stuff so that was that was the the sacred texts that I had been brought up with and I think I started - which isn't really the way a lot of you know a lot of religion has lost that and a lot of religion has you know we don't want to go down that rabbit hole because like we could therefore more hours on that but you know the virtues you mentioned are sort of the virtues that I think people would uniformly agree are wonderful with or without religion yeah yeah and you know we were talking about this I mean I guess as a 28 year old adult at the end of myself I came to see Jesus very differently actually as someone who was challenging the establishment who was fighting against the religiosity and the oppression of the leaders of the you know the church in quotes I guess at the time and preaching a very different message of purity of service to the poor of absolute love I mean I remember he called basically all the church leaders the worst names that you could ever call anybody at that time so I I just um I rediscover kind of my faith or softly now this is still so you get back to New

[01:07:07] York in January it's still partying in the clubs yeah so yes that's what's gonna so you come back to New York you're you're back to day job you're I really have a heart change so I start trying to go to church again and I start trying to do less of it all so I quit coke for a while for example and I'm you know I try and cut down to one pack a day and then there's times where I just okay I'm gonna quit smoking and you know

[01:07:29] I go into the Nicorette and you know or the patch and so there's a my heart has really changed the intention has changed I know that I'm gonna have to break up with my girlfriend and you know have a heart like there's who were you able to talk with about this this is a huge internal struggle no one as an avenues for your yeah I was just about to say you don't sound like you have real friends you have a lot of acquaintances but they're not they're not in the heart of your soul right in the way that a great friend would be and I wasn't gonna give my parents the satisfaction of letting them know that I might be turning back around change of heart or you know god forbid that I read dad's book on theology that he sent me you know I mean that would just be I had too much ego at the time so this is a really solitary experience I'm going you know at 10 o'clock on a Sunday morning and sitting at the very back pew of a church on my own not telling anyone that I went to church I'm wrestling with all these demons myself what's interesting is coming back from that trip even your girlfriend does realize what you're going through we do really shallow a relationship we didn't talk about all things we didn't talk about hopes and dreams or or suffering so around this time I remember it was interesting coming back a couple months later the incidents of numbness they just stop they stop as quickly as they started and that was great I didn't have anything to correlate them - I mean I had ratcheted back all the partying but

[01:08:55] I was still drinking and you know still smoking just less of everything so you know I remember throughout this whole period of time you know it's clearly I mean I was praying so I was like god I need to get out of nightlife this sucks you know it's it's not it's not for me anymore and you know I remember just hating the fact I remember feeling like I couldn't my day job kept me in the way of the life that I wanted to build for myself so it'd almost be like if you wanted to stomp gambling you probably need to stop working in a casino right you probably can't be a blackjack dealer if you're also a degenerate gambler even though you could do your job right and you're around gambling all day and maybe you don't go to the sports book that night but it's just like the environment was was still so unhealthy if you're struggling with that so that's how it felt for me and you know I remember there was just like this cry for help and the only person was - God like God get me out of this show me what I'm supposed to do show me how I'm supposed to to live differently there's a scene I write about in length of the book but something happened one night at a club and it involved a gun and involved a bouncer and a threat and I had this been a really clear opportunity to take a couple weeks off and I remember renting a cobalt blue Ford Mustang and telling my business partner look I'm out of here for a couple weeks you handle the clubs and I remember riding north like that's where I was going he's like where you going I'm like North I mean maybe I wind up in Canada you know in Montreal or

[01:10:26] Toronto I grab on that trip I pack my you know iPod I bring a bottle of Dewar's and I bring a Bible and in in some ways you know there's just I was kind of wrestling like hmm with the faith and virtue piece but I'm still drinking and smoking and I start driving north I wind up in Vermont to New Hampshire I eventually wind up on Maine and I'm having this conversation with myself again there's just me and I'm saying what would it look like never to go back what might the opposite of my life look like what's the clean break look like like what could I do and it almost like hit me the opposite of your life would be to walk away from all of these vices and go serve others instead of yourself go serve the poor you know which is something that I'd never even never even conceived up before I hadn't given a single gift to a charity I wasn't a giver I wasn't throwing parties for charities something compels me from an internet cafe on

[01:11:33] Greenville Greenville Maine on Moosehead Lake it was a dial-up internet cafe I remember there a bunch of gray Dell computers there and I start filling out applications to volunteer at all the Amana terian organizations I'd heard of and I just you know they're 10 page applications and I'm willing to consider going anywhere doing anything to completely change my life so it's UNICEF it's the Peace Corps it's

[01:11:59] World Vision and it's anybody had heard of and I go from there back to my parents to tell them that I'm gonna do a year of humanitarian service and there's a there's a kind of biblical concept that I've been brought up with ABBA tithe where you know my parents had always given 10% of their money to the church and to charity growing up and for me I saw this almost as a time type like

[01:12:22] I'd spend 10 years living for myself what does it look like to give one back and completely give it to others so to donate 10 percent back so I go to my parents and I tell them this and then there's this place in one of my first club partners was a British guy that had a very popular band in the 80s and he took all the money that he made they were called transmission vamp and he bought this beautiful mace home forest da house in the Pyrenees Mountains of

[01:12:50] France in a little village maybe of 60 people and I had been there over the club years maybe 15 times taking girlfriends there it was just like my happy place and I knew where the key was you know I wouldn't even need him to be there I knew how to open up the house and lock the house and deal with all the water and the electricity and all that stuff so I asked him around this time hey can

[01:13:12] I just go hang out in France while I'm waiting for these applications to be processed and and figuring out my next move and he says of course you know you know where the key is which was in this little rusty saucepan in an outbuilding so I go to this town it's called leopard elk wheeler almond sits near Jing Clah and I'm alone again and the rejection letters start coming in so maybe this isn't a surprise but no boom will take me actually it is a surprise to me I mean I I can't imagine though either that many people that are lining up to offer a year of their life free of service

[01:13:48] I think the resume scared him Peter I mean what did I done for the last 10 years I've gotten people drunk so basically they're worried that one this is not real and two you're gonna show up in two weeks leave and you're gonna have taken a spot from somebody who could have stuck it out sure like who wants a party boy on their mission you know I wasn't a serious person serious people don't promote nightclubs for ten years do they right I mean if you're if you're the the person reviewing the application at HQ mm-hmm so nobody has a spot for me or anything good to do and you know never forget it actually didn't have I didn't write about this in the book but

[01:14:25] I'll never forget this one moment where there's no cell phone reception in this village and I was riding my bike maybe ten miles down the mountain from where the this little house was and I'm going through the main town and my my Nokia phone rings which kind of dates this and I pick it out the brick that I was like the little one yeah that with the you know the junior brick junior brake a little LCD screen on the top square oh I love that phone they were kind of contoured right yeah yeah indestructible

[01:14:57] I mean the QWERTY yeah just grateful so I specifically remember yeah this thing was in my pocket and I almost fell off my bike cuz I know he had called me and oh my gosh my phone is ringing and it was one of the organizations called mercy and they said hey and we've got your application here and I'd applied to be their photojournalist and this is kind of wonderful how this does come full circle because I dust off for this one i dust off my nyu degree and like I have a communications degree from New York

[01:15:25] University and let me come on your ship I will write stories about the amazing work that you're doing was a hospital ship and I'll take really good pictures so I put up pictures on my blog of like my girlfriend's over the years and beautiful buildings and in Prague like my Labrador Retriever and you know they're like decent photos you know my travels around the world so they call me on the phone I'm in this village and they say well we're a little worried you might not be a culture fit for us but we've agreed to beat you and I said where are you guys and they said well the ship is in Germany I'm like well I'm in France I'll see you tomorrow or the next day so the ship was in Bremerhaven and quite a wide took me two days to get there on the train but I I said I mean this is amazing so I take the train all the way up and I remember walking aboard this 522 foot hospital ship this huge hulking white ocean liner that had been converted gutted effectively and turned into a state-of-the-art hospital and I have a meeting with what would be my future bosses and I convince them that

[01:16:29] I'm in this for all the wrong reasons I believe I'm talented I believe I can do this job I am NOT gonna throw wild raves and corrupt the rest of the humanitarian staff like I'm in this I've had the life change I've always been pretty good at getting people to like me that's it that's a skill in nightlife you you know if you're building a list I was a good host I was I was always trying to make people feel comfortable inside the club and who do you want to meet Peter oh no problem yeah come with me you know hey is everything okay he's your drink okay you know I would know people's names I was so I was turning on all the charm basically what I'm saying so I'm up in Bremerhaven on the ship saying I will be your best photo journalist that you've ever had oh and by the way guys I also come with a built-in list

[01:17:13] I've got 15,000 emails you know I have a list of 15,000 people I had been a drunk 13 years 15,000 wealthy but some of them were influential I mean Mick Jagger was on the list president of Chanel writer or people in fashion and publishing and entertainment so they say okay they say well take you and I said when's the mission start in three weeks you report for duty so I go back I remember going to the decathlon in France and buying flashlights and you know whatever I thought I would need for

[01:17:42] Africa because we were sailing into a country called Benin and then shortly we'd be going to Liberia which was a country I'd never heard of actually I've never heard of either these countries if I'm honest but I'd learned that Liberia had just finished a brutal civil war that had lasted fourteen years and was led by the evil evil dictator and warlord Charles Taylor who had used children for a decade and a half to slaughter an extraordinary amount of people so I report for duty actually on the island of tenerife so the ship was going from Germany to pick up people in

[01:18:16] Tenerife and island off the coast of Africa and then we would sail into West Africa so I joined the ship a couple weeks later in Tenerife I get there first I know that the ship is sailing in the next morning and I'm gonna walk up the gangway I'm gonna surrender my passport and I'm gonna officially join this mission I mean I'm gonna have a boss you know I'm gonna effectively lose my independence because I've been self-employed you know for this whole time I guess outside of the you know the music store ten years previous and you know I just was thinking about the ship and this idea of sailing I guess it was five days to Africa sailing away to a new continent that I'd never been on sailing away into a new life and I realized that the best way to do that would be to go all-in and just try and quit everything in one go to figure out how to quit gambling and well I mean I imagine you didn't have a choice you weren't gonna be able to gamble drink and drink you know I probably wasn't gonna get you know illicit drugs mm-hmm well I mean I could always gamble online which I used to do I mean I used to gamble on women's soccer games in you know Czechoslovakia that I couldn't even see televised just because I needed the rush of winning or losing so I have this moment I was I was staying at the

[01:19:33] Sheraton in I think it was Santa Cruz the town of Tenerife and the night before and I just sat in my hotel room alone and I drank seven or eight beers Amstel lights smoked well over two packs of Marlboro Reds and I'm like this is it I'm just gonna go out with a bang and I woke up the next day with a brutal hangover and

[01:19:55] I walked up the gangway of the ship and it's funny and doing some of the interviews for the book people actually remember me reeking of alcohol feel like did this guy just come from a bar at 7:30 a.m. and I didn't actually didn't be aware - so that is so funny you know I'm sure they were saying did we make a mistake and and now is it like there was something about you know the gangway was gonna come up and I was gonna leave all of this stuff on land and sail away away from it and and it was a clean break so from that moment this is now 14 years ago I've never had another cigarette I've never touched coke or extra any of that stuff I've never gambled again I haven't looked into pornographic image in 15 years like I walked so far away from my former life I drink a little bit

[01:20:46] I like craft IPAs and you know red wine what was the withdrawal like from the nicotine in particular so hard so hard and I'd had failed attempts at smoking I mean there was there was I think a certain grace of being around medical professionals which probably made it feel like the new norm was not smoking the new norm was being healthy and helping people I used a bunch of the gum at the time and I think I used the patch but I just did it and there were by the way there were the engineers that would smoke yeah I was gonna say I'm guessing the word yes sure sure there was still a ship subculture of the people that worked in the engine room and they'd all be you know having a cigarette on the deck or they were authorized smoking places for them but that was it for me and that allowed me to it really felt like a do-over it felt like 28 years you know I could close that book and I was starting on page one of a new blank book and I got to really create a completely new life and I'm a new story for myself as a humanitarian of all things so what was that what was that you're like I mean in terms of did you develop relationships or friendships that where you could start to share the stuff that had been previously just completely an internal monologue yeah it was an amazing place Peter and someone asked me recently during an interview they said look so many people you know struggle with these addictions and they can't get out of it what do you think it was that allows you to walk so cleanly I think the environment had a lot to do with it

[01:22:17] I went from an environment where all that was the norm to an environment of like Christian doctors you know who were helping people get well the best surgeons and nurses in the world that had given up their vacation time to use their skills in the service of others so that really helps and I loved the new norm like I embraced the new norm the new norm was healthy it was up early it was saving people's lives I mean it was in the most profound and visually evident way possible so we max we specialized in maxillofacial surgery so these doctors would look for people with tumors with cleft lips with cleft palates we did a lot of cataracts and people who were completely blind and you know we can remove the cataracts and put it on the furniture beds yep there were there were three or four operating theatres I remember when we sailed into

[01:23:13] Liberia it was the only the only CT scan in four neighboring countries the only working CT scanner organization so you had these and even better the quality of the medical staff was so extraordinary because you'd have these doctors flying in from London or Berlin or New York or Los Angeles who would do I don't know three weeks often three months and they would just say I can do this you know I could go to the Maldives and stay at the four seasons or I could fly to Liberia and I could operate on 46 cleft patients and get 46 people their lives back so is and my job the amazing thing is that I have the best job on a ship of 350 volunteers I would say my job is better than the chief medical officer or the surgeons because I get to document all of the life-saving wonder that is happening it is my job to photograph every single person that goes through the operating theatre and document that transformation so the way that we would find patients in some ways not unlike how some club promoters would feel clubs we fly 'red the country we made thousands of fliers the fliers had the pictures of the facial tumors the cleft lips the lot of the the burn reconstructions that we were doing and seeing after the war stuff like flesh-eating disease canker morris no Noma these really horrible diseases which I later learned some of them were caused by water and it was like a casting call we'd say if you look like one of the people in these pictures or if you know someone with these afflictions turn up on this day and our doctors will see you and we'll triage you so the profound moment for me was my third and this happens quickly so we sail in support I've been in patients screening the triage day is three days later so everybody's prepping and I learned that the government has given us a football stadium the soccer arena in the center of the city and it was called lays all days art and I know also that we have 1500 surgery slots to fill so in a best-case scenario we are gonna hand out 1500 hey come on this day at this time and we'll run 1,500 people through our surgery hospital over four months and then we'll pick up and we'll sail to

[01:25:29] Liberia where we'll spend eight months in Liberia so actually we'll spend a year third day there I remember it very vividly it was 5:00 in the morning you know I couldn't sleep the night before I was so excited to see who's gonna turn up I mean is it possible that there's 1,500 people in this country with these radical crazy afflictions and conditions and I grabbed my two Nikon cameras you know my wide-angle lens my portrait lens all my batteries and put on hospital scrubs and I jump in this convoy of Land

[01:26:04] Rovers maybe 20 Land Rovers all heading towards the stadium and as we turn the corner to actually see the stadium I see the parking lot there's 5,000 people waiting to get in in the early morning 5000 people have gathered and you know it just hits me look we're gonna turn thousands of people away you know the need is so much greater than then our response we don't have enough doctors we don't have enough money are their local doctors there that could be trained they are and that's that's something that the organization is done but there aren't the medical facilities of the cuantas so I'll give you an example in Liberia Liberia has one doctor for every 50,000 of its citizens at the time I believe our number here is one for 300 so for every 300 Americans there's a there's a doctor for every 50,000 librarians there were two surgeons that we'd heard of in a country of a few million people but no were to operate to the surgeon you know even if you were a surgeon like you'd have to operate on the bush there was no working medical facility or operating theater so we had the best Hospital going you know on our ship so just that was a really really hard moment for me throughout that first triage day I felt like I wept 40 percent of the day because the stuff that I saw I just wasn't prepared for kids choking to death on four pound benign fleshy tumors people with their faces completely rotting from disease people who had been burned so badly by rebel soldiers often who had poured you know oil over their bodies or the bodies of their children it was that I was in no way prepared to see I'd like to smell rotting flesh and have to take a photo of someone six inches from their face I mean it felt like I was violating them but these were the medical photos these were the befores that hopefully would have amazing after story so my first friend I write about in the book was a little boy named Alfred and he was choking to death on his face with an emilio blastoma big fleshy pink tumor that had just grown and grown and grown and grown over four years and his mom had actually taken him to which doctors and they had cut him with knives and with sharp stones they'd put pastes and concoctions on the tumor they had chanted - you know spirits and the doober just keeps growing that's what tumors do how did you guys triage was the if he only had 1500 slots for 5,000 people was it based on medical need nurses were just rolling through the line I will say some people came with conditions that we couldn't treat some people just came to see doctor they heard the doctors were coming some people came with broken feet some people came with terrible cancer that had metastasized all throughout their body and we were we weren't able to help there was a member there were some boys that came with them Burkett's lymphoma you know we didn't have a good way to treat that you can't operate yeah there icicle treatment yeah you know we weren't in the business of chemotherapy we were in the business of operating you know on the benign stuff so you know poor Alfred you know it's just this terrified little boy and and I just determined that he's gonna be my first friend and I'm gonna see his story all the way through and he's gonna be the first story that I shared with the 15,000 people from my former life of what we're really doing here so thankfully for me he was I think he was first in line that day and he gets a surgery date three days later so we just get to work triage two days and then the next day surgery starts and people start turning up and the operating theatres are just scheduled out and then the recovery Ward had 42 beds this is it was a proper hospital so

[01:29:46] I'm there as Alfred walks up on the ship you know his father basan brings him and I'm documenting his surgery so I'm in the operating theater all the time I just love I love the blood I loved like just the visceral like change you know seeing someone seeing a surgeon open up someone's face and then fix it and then put it back together so it was the most fascinating thing so I probably documented 50 surgeries in scrubs you know with my cameras right there they would they would allow me to get sterile and then just be there documenting it so

[01:30:17] Alfred's was my first and they just take this giant tumor and they cut it out and they put in a titanium plate because his jaw had been completely moved blown out really by the tumor and a couple weeks later I got to take him home to his village and I'm following behind him with my camera and he's in you know his best clothes and I'm watching the village surround this little boy that they thought was cursed that they thought was written off for for dead and they're looking at him and they're touching his face and you know he's like a celebrity in the village and that was my first kind of all the way through oh wow we're gonna be able to do that 1,500 times we're gonna we're gonna so transform people's lives when you write a book after two years you see some of these little parallels you know as a radical as my life change was you know from the dirty degenerate you know drug addict to you know this like humanitarian photographer trying to tell stories of these incredible doctors and patients you know we were I remember a woman soon after name Marguerite and she had gone blind in her 20s so she she could see her whole life and then exposure to the equatorial Sun with no UV she had these huge cataracts I mean you could see them they were jumping okay and so she'd gone completely blind she couldn't see her family couldn't see her kids so I remember being in the operating theaters as this one of the surgeons guy named

[01:31:47] Glenn price makes a little slit from what I remember he like two sticks tweezers in and he pulls out the cataract and then he pops in the new lens the bank took like 15 minutes right I remember thinking I could totally do that like you could train me to be a cataract surgeon right now I mean it just seems so simple you know a scalpel make the slit pop it out pop it in and then put a bandage on and did this probably some surgeons now that are like if there's a way more to it than that but it felt so simple as a document you know terian did this sort of rekindle that thing that you had when you were 13 and you wanted to go to Johns Hopkins and you wanted to become a doctor did you now find yourself saying wait a minute I'm definitely I don't want to go back to being a club promoter I want to be a doctor well I almost got to be a doctor I was living vicariously through all the doctors all the time you know in a way I felt like I was a part of all these patients stories and the doctors would come and go and I was the constant this one woman made such an impression on me because I think was actually a it might have been two days later we were gonna remove the bandages and you know there's a little bit of healing that took place so I just I saw the moment that I wanted to capture because I'd met her blind that interviewed her I'd seen the surgery and documented that so I go down there when they start taking off the bandages and I'm just snapping it stills like lick lick lick lick lick lick lick and she starts screaming just the flash she tackles me dancing screaming you know glory glory like tackles her sister that she can now see and it was just this euphoric moment I mean there's new you you know going from being blind to being able to see um it's hard to imagine it's all right I can't imagine what that would be like like I can still I can just put myself in that tiny little room where it all happened and I think Peter I wanted to share these stories with people in the same way that you know that was a period of time where I wanted to share a story that if you got past my velvet rope and spent thousands of dollars on booze and you were seen with the beautiful people or maybe went home with the right beautiful people than your life had meaning this was real meaning I mean this was life transformation this was real sacrifice and generosity by these doctors by the donors that were paying for these surgeries and I think I wanted to I just wanted to share every story so

[01:34:14] I just start blasting my club list with Alfred story with Marguerite story with the picture of the five or the three thousand people that we tell it turned away when we closed the doors of the stadium and the triage was finished and these people who are getting these emails they don't know what's happened the last thing they remember is Scott was our hook up and then Scott kind of vanished because I I don't imagine you sent a retirement I actually did I sent a I did send a retirement letter I went back and saw it recently it was you know was a little high and mighty like I'm leaving nightclubs behind to go explore a humanitarian journey you know I mean definitely some eye rolling now back on an email but I did announce what I was doing and I you know you are all gonna come along for the ride I mean I teased that you're gonna come on the journey with me and what I see you're gonna see so what they started seeing was giant fleshy two MERS and some you know leprosy and just some crazy stuff and you know of course there's a few unsubscribe some people said take me off this list I enjoyed the

[01:35:16] Prada party but you through once but I'm not down with the tumor party I don't need to see someone's face eaten by leprosy but the response that I got from most people was this is amazing I didn't know that this ship existed I didn't know that there were doctors who cared so much that they would they would even do this how do I get on the ship how do I give money how much did the surgery cost about $40 how do I send in foreigner dollars well here's how you do that so I remember this one woman writes me and she says it's the middle of the day

[01:35:48] I'm sitting here at Chanel headquarters I'm in a brightly lit office and tears are streaming down my face I can't believe what I've just seen in what I've read I need to do something I need to be a part of this and so I have this immediate feedback loop that my stories are moving people the photos the images are moving people I think what I've learned there that it wasn't just the writing it was actually the images I saw

[01:36:15] I came across a quote this week that I loved so much that I have never had never heard of before until this week but it's from Carl Jung and it says transformation can only take place in the presence of images and I think there was something so arresting or disrupting about these photos you know perhaps the extremity of a huge tumor and then the tumors gone of cataracts like saucers that you can see and then gone that really worked along with the stories that I was writing if I just said hey alfred's is 14 you're a boy and he spins up getting on his you know face with a big pink fleshy tumor there's one way to do it but when you see it when people saw it it really it moved them so I do this for a year and I'm just telling story after story my list actually starts to grow a little bit the other thing I forgot to mention is that I had pay five hundred dollars every month to volunteer so this was you talk about the if the dream or the prayer was to create the opposite of my life I actually wound up in the poorest country in the world paying money to volunteer and this was how Mercy Ships helped support the organization they got all the crew to raise their own support for room and board and you know for food and that was a big income stream for them so I'm basically going broke on the ship not only am I not earning an income it cost me money to be there and you're learning back to a point we had earlier you're learning about what a really efficient nonprofit can do sort of pieces both positive on the negative side sure sure

[01:37:52] I'm getting an inside look at a at a non-profit and and for sure the medical work was amazing and transformative but I also got a look at a little bureaucracy you know you know how a big charity you know might work in some of the blockers and one of the one of the amazing things for me was that my boss on the ship he did not handle me he didn't know how to handle this New York

[01:38:14] City crazy guns blazing eighty hour a week worker so he just gave me an incredible amount of rope I mean I took over a photo office and I made that my own and I was I was really like this lone ranger you know he would initially assign me to take the photos and then someone else to write the story I'm like no I'm doing it all myself I have to be a one-stop shop and you know I think gosh that drove me I think he just knew that I needed some element of autonomy to feel like I could own the whole experience and I worked around the clock

[01:38:51] I mean there was nothing else there was no dating there was no it was just all work when did the pangs start to go away I'm sure at some point initially when you got on that ship you were still missing the the sex the girlfriend the booze the drugs the cigarettes I mean was there a day when you sort of woke up and realized like actually I'm I'm happier now than I was back then it felt almost instant Wow because I was so busy in a different direction every single intention every single task every in everything I was reading it was the whole community everything changed you know it's like I went from being on the Death Star - I don't know being around the people of light well it's a very good point you brought up earlier I used to have a slightly different way of explaining that to patients when I was at Hopkins we would see a lot of folks in the ER who were using IV drugs so heroin was a pretty rampant in Baltimore at the time it might still be actually and whenever we'd get a patient in there usually it was to debride a you know an abscess or something like that you you sort of had to explain to them look you don't get an infinite number of shots on goal here this is gonna kill you really soon you're gonna get endocarditis you're gonna get an infection that's not going to be it's gonna kill you before we get to it you can't just go back to where you came from look to kick a heroin habit you need a new life you need a new group of friends you need a new place to live and so it's a year later do you come back to New

[01:40:24] York so I do come back to New York and that was probably the hardest part because then all the temptations are there exactly the old girlfriend was still around and hadn't moved on yet the party was still there I would say look I felt during sue when I come back I put on an exhibition of my photos in order to raise money for Mercy Ships and I can hear that we were gainfully unemployed at this point now I'm in the crashing with my olds club partner and you know kindness of strangers really at this point cuz nightclub promoters okay I can only speak for myself I was not good at saving money

[01:41:03] I was fantastic at spending a little more than I made every single year so I came back broke I'd been giving all my money to Mercy Ships the people that I met along the way many of these patients you know I'd wind up supporting afterwards I mean Alfred I'm actually still supporting 15 years later because you know I helped him become a plumber and it's been a joy to be able to do but yeah I was definitely broke so I come back and I said well what could I do that would be useful I could put on I can bring people into this story in a got a gallery donated in Chelsea it was a milky white gallery so it felt like a hospital and I hung up these sheets and created different rooms almost like operating theaters or the ward and then I put a hundred I think was 108 images together creating light boxes and

[01:41:52] TV installations of patients morphing back and forth and at the end of the gallery show I asked people to donate the cost of one surgery if they could it was three hundred eighty bucks or whatever they could so my goal was to raise as much money for Mercy Ships as possible and then go back and follow the money so I actually come back to New York on a mission which is great right the mission is continuing it's just the venue has changed the context has changed and I remember my friends thought that I wasn't as much fun you know I'm not doing coke with them I'm not staying out late but I still was in the clubs trying to raise money and trying to get people to donate catering for the exhibition or donate printing I'm still working the network and I guess I just felt like look they're gonna be all these opportunities for me to slip back into my former life especially now and there would be grace for that but what if I didn't in some ways the analogy so I love personally and love this parable the prodigal son from the New Testament where the son basically you know flips everybody off takes his inheritance goes very very far away and winds up gambling drinking sleeping with prostitutes and he kind of winds up in a bad place at the end of himself and he says I want to come home and he said actually that the servants in my father's house are living a better life than I am now so he comes home and what I love about that is the the father in the story sees his son across a distance and runs out towards the Sun and in that culture like a man would actually never run and reveal his ankles in the way so it shows the passion and he throws his arms around his son and he he there's no admonishment you know imagine the lecture that's been 10 years in the making you prostitutes really drugs three packs of cigarettes like there was no lecture and he puts on a robe I love that detail in the story he gives his son one of the finest robes in the house and then he throws him a party I love that like he's as my son as home my son who was lost has been found let's throw a party I love the idea of the the change of clothes so you got a sense of this this kid who had just soiled his clothes far away you know like with the pigs and in some ways I felt like I had changed my clothes and I almost had on like like imagine if the robe was white I didn't want to get it dirty I could get it dirty right I could stain it and then you know

[01:44:25] I'd go to the dry cleaners or you know and maybe I maybe I couldn't get it all the way clean but I had gotten a new set of clothes and why not keep them clean so I just kept coming back to that idea that what if I did keep him clean like how would this story continue to play out what if I didn't you know get back in a relationship and start sleeping with my old girlfriend what if I never you know what if I just stayed completely pure or clean so I was I was actually able to do that so how did you decide to start your own charity which is really the cherry on this story right which is it's one thing to realize that you can do amazing work for an organization that's already up and running it's quite another thing to say

[01:45:10] I'm actually going to take all that I've learned and create an organization to affect change sure so the next part of the story goes I learned something because my exhibition is effective and I raised about a hundred thousand dollars for Mercy Ships Wow so I tap into all my old relationships PR companies are donating

[01:45:31] Geoffrey chowder I was donating the food I mean I just went you know Prada and Gucci or donating handbags that we auctioned off and we raised a hundred thousand dollars through the gallery and through an event for the closing night all that money goes to Mercy Ships and I then go back and follow the money because what I realized was that a lot of my friends were really skeptical when it came to charities and I was I could be this guide they they had trusted me certainly not before but through all of the communications in the photos and the stories I was so prolific over that year you felt like you were living in my head if you were reading it and you were taking it I mean I wrote oh maybe fifty thousand words I was just turning out content like meet the patient of the day she's amazing let me tell you her story you know or I'd be going into these villages and staying overnight and documenting video snippets of the welcoming so you I think a lot of people felt like they were really along the journey so raise the money I'm like okay well I can actually raise money for the cause not just be a passive documentarian it's a very strange thing

[01:46:37] I mean most photo journalists would only they would never get involved right you're just telling the story I'm like I'm gonna get involved I'm gonna take pictures and I'm gonna use those photos to raise money to effect change so I realized that I have a gift for that and then I go back for another eight months to Liberia so this is year number two still volunteering so we're now until like middle to late oh five yep exactly and I come across the water crisis so which you alluded to a little earlier yeah this time this time I got off the ship and I you know back in Liberia you know most of my time had been the first time I'd have been spent in Monrovia you know on the ward now I said I want to understand a little more of the context of this country and I bought a motorcycle from a deckhand and you know that bought me some autonomy and some freedom again my boss was great he would let me stay in the bush you know overnight I would have to sign you know kind of permission slips so I start exploring the country I mean going up to the the Guinea border and the Sierra

[01:47:35] Leone border and the more time I spend in these villages I see the water that people are drinking and I had never it just never occurred to me that people would drink out of swamps or brown viscous muddy rivers and I learned that fifty percent of the people living in Liberia didn't have clean water to drink so half the country was drinking contaminated filthy water and I started taking pictures of it you know children drinking from swamps with algae and bugs and you could actually see you know fish and worms and some of these swamps and like little kids are just drinking straight from them and my mentor on the ship was a guy named dr. Gary Parker and I just started sharing some of the images with him like look at the pictures and I'm taking out there you see what's going on out there like the war zone you know the water war zone and the doctors and the surgeons that I show these photos to

[01:48:33] I'll just start saying you clean up kid water makes people sick dirty you know we know that so much of the disease that we're seeing is caused by unsafe water and lack of sanitation and hygiene and I get encouraged by the doctor that I'm most respected this guy named dr. Gary Parker who had a personal back sir if I pause for one second just to tell his he was a California surgeon that had signed up for three months just like many and when I walked up the gangway the ship for the first time he'd been there 21 years he became a lifer he's never went back to his practice so another real peace so I now have a guide mentor that kind of like me right I'm gonna tie the one of the ten years but he never went back to his former life so what might that look like for me so he encourages me he says well you seem pretty passion about this water thing and if you really wanted to bring health to the world if you really cared about impacting the health of millions or the time of billion people you would make sure everybody had clean water and that would be a great issue you know you want to play doctor to the world don't help raise money for another sixty million dollar hospital ship they can do a few thousand very effective surgeries go get go make sure everybody in this country has clean water maybe we wouldn't even need to pull into port here so I started thinking about this and at the time I actually wanted to continue working for

[01:50:02] Mercy Ships so I'm thinking about water and what I might do on my own but I finished the second year and I try and work for them I'm like hey what if I did my exhibition model all around the world Berlin and Prague and in Paris and in London and you know let's raise huge awareness let's make your organization and your doctors famous let's raise millions and they basically said no thanks which

[01:50:27] I don't blame them I mean this was a very conservative organization based out of a dry town in Texas lyndale Texas and some new york club promoter wants huge budgets to fly around the world putting on huge exhibitions of tumors and light boxes and hyena the stuff the ideas I had but we're just crazy so the door closes and they say thanks but no thanks you know you've really helped us it's amazing I think I helped them get 20 or 30 media items you know I got my photos published in the Wall Street Journal and the independent in London so I thought

[01:51:00] I'd i brought a lot of awareness and money to them but that door shut and I said all right well I'm not going back to my former life two years in what if I just take everything I've learned and start the water thing let me go work on water and what would it look like if I dedicated 2030 maybe the rest of my life to helping people get clean drinking water what kind of impact could I mean so I just started and that was I had my issue like let me try it people need clean water so I was living at that time on a walk-in closet floor on spring and

[01:51:34] Mercer in Soho New York my club partner had taken me in it was an unidentified

[01:51:45] male ivi room and my couch is your office and I did have you know a spare bedroom and then the closet floor when I got bounced from the little bedroom in the back and I was on a mission Peter I like from from day one I'm like I'm gonna be the clean water fighter I'm gonna fight for clean water and therefore I'm gonna be potentially the most effective doctor that the world has ever seen if I could get millions ten to millions maybe hundreds of millions of people the most basic need for health and I'd be working right alongside Mercy

[01:52:17] Ships and eliminating the need for you know a lot of those conditions that we were treating so I have how did you get smart on this topic like there's it's one thing to take sort of what I would call the first-order observation which you can see people are drinking a bunch of dirty water dirty waters making them sick that's bad but then there's like the second third fourth order insights that are necessary which is like what's at the root cause of this what are the nonlinear implications of this how do you actually fix this problem in the most leveraged way and the most gala like I mean obviously today you know they answer all of those things but that's an overwhelming task for some guys sitting in a closet and Soho to figure out thankfully it didn't feel like that at the at the time I started flying around meeting with water organizations started reading everything I could on the global water crisis then I started traveling around to Africa but on one game you don't have any money so I I file for a 501c3 and I'm raising money then on the idea that our organization is so this is sort of like you're taking angel 6vc early dollars on air charity you got it it wasn't even tax-deductible and a lot of those early dollars were buying me a 872 dollar coach flight to

[01:53:37] Ethiopia where I was very inexpensive to you know run around for two weeks and often I'd be hosted by the local partner you know who's covering room and board and food so I'm both trying to fundraise for my organization which has a very clear mission we're gonna bring clean drinking water to everybody on the planet okay we're gonna figure out how to do this as we go along but we are getting clean drinking water to everybody in need I have a huge observation at this time and I realized that this isn't gonna be easy because the lack of trust that I had sniffed out a little bit during that first exhibition when my club friends were coming in and giving surgery money to

[01:54:17] Mercy Ships it was real meaning the lack of trust amongst the donors yeah they don't have donors the donor faith that you're actually doing what you say you're doing or at least you're doing it reasonably well people didn't trust charities I would hear stories of I don't know where my money goes charities are big black holes that eat money you would hear stories of high overheads I don't know the impact you know charity

[01:54:41] CEO is probably paying himself millions of dollars I mean everybody seemed to have a scandal that they could readily pull out of their back pocket to say this is why don't you know the big philanthropy the big charities and I actually found data behind that so USA Today had polled Americans and found 42% of people said they didn't trust charities and this is this is probably actually shocking to some people that are listening because who is more generous or philanthropic than Americans we have this heritage is cultural reputation of being some of those generous people in earth if not the most generous certainly my research when I was in the business of fund raising was that not only were Americans the most generous but New Yorkers were the most generous amongst all Americans people always ask me why am I in New

[01:55:26] York now and I say in many ways they could trace it back to my days of fundraising there's a Willie Sutton quote right why do you rob banks that's where the money is weird why do you raise money in New York because that's not just where the money is it's where the people are who are the most generous and I I remember being really surprised by that but also felt like you know New

[01:55:48] Yorkers really get a bad rap sometimes people sort of think of all these sort of wealthy people in New York or even you know whatever just the average person in New York is sort of a hard person and you know sort of fast living in Bulova but in many ways I again I don't take knocks at people but I just would have expected at the outset that other parts of the country would have been much more generous mm-hmm and I was constantly amazed at the generosity of

[01:56:13] New Yorkers well there you go so I in and that's where we started really from you know that closet floor and from the couch of the drug den and Soho you know known ideal conditions I guess but so to combat that cynicism or that skepticism I'd come across a guy called Paul Tudor Jones who was a hedge fund billionaire and he had started the Robert Rico's

[01:56:35] Robin Hood yep Robin Hood Foundation and you know in what I understood from his story he also realized that donors didn't trust charities and he said cool tell you what I'm rich enough I'll pay for all the overhead of the charity so that a hundred percent of anything you give to my charity goes directly to the programs which was education in the inner-city him to this day of the entire board of Robin Hood doesn't know it's him in his board it's gotten too much probably for him but you know initially you can imagine an idea of that impulse I'll fund it ok now what's your Excuse what was your next excuse of why you wouldn't give to help the poor here in New York City if you knew that all your money was going so I write him a letter he doesn't write me back nah man I guess why would he but I wondered it just felt so clean so extreme so elegant two bank accounts what if I open up two bank accounts and

[01:57:27] I promised the public that all of the money they would ever give to charity water and I had I wasn't very creative in the beginning the charity that helps if you get water charity water what have all the money that they give goes directly to fund water projects that directly help people get clean water and in bank account number two somehow I'm gonna figure how to raise all the overhead separately no idea at the beginning but I love the model two bank accounts audited separately and this this public promise that whether someone gave a dollar or a hundred dollars or a thousand dollars or a million dollars it would all reach to a hundred percent programmatic one hundred percent so then

[01:58:05] I interject one thing on my high horse here hmm I applaud you for doing that but I also want a listener to understand something overhead is not a dirty term absolutely not and there's a great TED talk Dan vallata young charitable that's right and we'll leave everything you said yeah and after two things one his talk really impacted me which is probably five six years ago and then my own experience of realizing the same thing you did that what my wife and I have decided going forward we support only 100 percent overhead so every dollar we give we give directly to salary supportive people we believe in doing charity and we do that because we know it's much easier to raise money on the programmatic side it's much easier to say give me a thousand bucks to go and build a well but my interest is well who's paying Scott's salary cuz I'd much rather pay Scott's salary we did the same thing you know we maybe seven years ago my wife and I just decided hey we're gonna write on the cheque you know use this percent overhead yes Muse's for this you know or even use something what nobody else wants to passively say that's what we say well right and say you know I mean go fix the roof for the building go pay the phone bill go take the extra trip home from the orphanage to go be with your family around the holidays right don't have the orphan write me letters that's the easy thing you're gonna go get somebody else who doesn't trust to do that you know so okay so I'm totally with you and I know

[01:59:34] Dan pelota and and really like what he's saying however it's been an uphill battle yeah he's been preaching that message for 10 years you know and the data hasn't showed that it's moving people so I was like I'm gonna fight a different battle I'm gonna go and raise all the overhead separately I'm gonna go find Peter and his wife you know a different set of donor a builder an innovator you know who actually gets or could get excited about the salaries the office many ways what it comes down to in my opinion which you've already figured out is you have to find people who believe in you versus a mission and there's those are two slightly different things they can often go hand-in-hand but in the end of the day when I think about the sort of salary support that we provide to people it's because like yeah it's I believe in that individual and I trust that individual and all I want is their life to be easier because indirectly what you realize is their life is easier they're doing better work and what I think is elegant about the way you've done it is you've literally separated the financial stream you get audited separately yeah different numbers that is so brilliant fungible no that is so brilliant and we took it a step farther than Robin Hood because I just I love like black and white before and after like I just I don't do well with grey so I said well if we're gonna be out there that is the theme of your life Scott you do not despite the fact that you're sitting there in a grey sweatshirt right now you do not do well and gray so you like this I say well I can't be up there talking about a hundred percent unless we also pay back all the credit card fees so from day one and to this day if you went online right now you pulled out your American Express and you go to charity water can you give a hundred bucks

[02:01:14] Amex it's three percent oh you got it so I get 97 but what did you give 100 so what you expect 100 dollars to go to the field so in the other bank accounts and I can talk about how we do that later and all the try a nap but we actually pay back that three dollars and we send your hundred dollars your intended hundred dollars to the field so that was pillar number one pillar number two was then when you have two bank accounts

[02:01:39] I just realized okay we've just created a non-fun jabal non black hole scenario so why can't we use technology to track these dollars as they go out and just show people where they landed so if we were gonna build a well in Malawi you know we could say your money went here or to Bangladesh or to India or to

[02:01:58] Cambodia or to Bolivia and you know I lucked into meeting the Google Earth founder when I was starting in charity water I met him in a conference and they were building Google Earth and Google Maps and I just realized I was gonna be able from day one to geo locate every water project using their free platform and all it was gonna cost me was fifty dollar handheld GPS devices I think they were garmin device at the time you could go buy a Best Buy and we would be able to fund a water project that helped people get clean water turn on a GPS device take a picture of the GPS take a picture of the project and then upload it and say this is proof but you'd be able to see a satellite image of your well so if a hundred percent was the first pillar proof then became the second pillar and proof would look very different in many different ways all we would have hopefully myriad ways of being creative and connecting people to what their money did the third thing that I wanted to do differently was I wanted to I wanted the brand to feel unlike any other charity that I'd ever encountered I wanted to build an epic brand a beautiful brand and an imaginative inspiring brand and when I saw most charities

[02:03:15] I saw marketing that I didn't want any part of I saw shame and guilt and almost toxic marketing and you may remember the commercials from the 80s and the 90s with Sally Struthers and the flies that land on the kids faces in slow motion as they look up and lock their sad eyes with the camera and then the 800-number slowly creeps across the screen and you give and you give out of yeah you give out of likely shame often or guilt for feeling that you're in your comfortable living room and these kids in Africa flies crawling on their face and dude that is so amazing that you brought that image up like I remember the commercial you're talking about I would have I would have never pulled that out of my the recesses of my brain had you not mentioned that that's literally 3540 years ago I just wouldn't watch them recently to make sure that they were as bad as I remember they're worse so to me the vestiges of shame and guilt and even the word the language by the way this this is still pervasive today the language giving back this is unhelpful if I snatch the mic from in front of you you know you'd say give it back as if I've taken it from you and the language implies we have you know we've pillaged and plundered to such extent we should probably throw a few scraps back to the poor let's give a little back that we've taken and it implies giving out of debt or obligation all unhealthy things without and I come across a quote by Nick Kristof in the

[02:04:49] New York Times and he said toothpaste is being peddled with far more sophistication than all the world's life-saving causes charity brands suck Doritos will spend hundreds of millions of dollars cleverly marketing you know stuff that kills us and our children but the most important life-saving humanitarian efforts often have an anemic brands are they guilt and shame people into giving to them and by the way this comes back in some way to the overhead problem and this is sort of one of the challenges in the nonprofit world that I think is really toxic which is we have this belief that we shouldn't be able to pay people in a non-profit talent should be free people should be willing to work for under market the reason Doritos can sell Doritos like you can't imagine the reason they can push these things on you is not just because well they taste great it's because they can afford the best talent to figure out how to a B test all of these different things and I think a lot of nonprofits haven't really figured out that there is a bit of a war for talent and nonprofits are generally losing it in a big age demographic and my nonprofits can do a really good job getting really young people fresh out of college who want some experience before going to grad school and they can do a pretty good job getting you know really talented sort of Greybeards that are you know at the end of their careers I'm looking to quote-unquote give back in the respect of time but it's pretty tough to get an ultra talented 40 year old to go into a non-profit when the alternative for many people even those who are mission driven is to go and serve a mission in a for-profit setting versus a not-for-profit setting absolutely and that that is a real challenge even to this day you know give you an example that though we had posted a job for receptionist at charity water recently and 1,300 people applied so that's great yeah young yeah it's it's a really young talent pool but you're right the executive hires have been have been much harder and people like their charity people poor and you know Dan has been fighting this for a long time you know I joke all the time that even now you know

[02:06:52] I'm 43 years old I've got a wife I've got kids I could drive a $60,000 Toyota and not a $20,000 Mercedes because of the perception forget about the cost of the current run we're totally happy with me in a you know what's the baby the Toyota Highlander right I got out of like load that thing up I could probably have a $70,000 Toyota SUV or a GMC but not a $24,000 BMW oh he's reaching that's why we were even talking about the watch I mean I'm not wearing a watch today all this stuff matters you know the perception becomes reality so okay let me go back just to that bit so the brand so our brand would feel different it would be imagine if it I'm inspired be hope based the last analogy

[02:07:31] I just want to make I think Nike is such a great analogy if Nike were a bad old charity their marketing might go like this hey Peter you're fat and you're lazy turn off the TV put away the junk food once you go for a run once you exercise now instead of verify our stuff ya know so Nike for years has been telling inspirational stories of people overcoming adversity overcoming impossible odds right Nike believes that if you've lost your legs you can complete a marathon and get over the finish line you know you your arm you can still be a shot put her cred having they kind of for years have said we believe there's greatness within you right and and then you want to buy the shoes and then you want that symbol next to your heart that says you know just do it because the company believes that about you in the marketing so charities you know don't do that so we wanted ours to be like we believe you have a mind-blowing capacity for compassion for empathy we believe your capacity to be deeply generous and to extend your arm across an ocean and help people you don't have to help you don't have a debt or an obligation to help but you can end the suffering because you choose to and you'll be blessed in the process and you know you might even find yourself redeemed in the process of moving from selfishness and accumulation to helping others so there were there was a lot of soft stuff I mean now I have language to it years later but I just I want to charity wanted to feel very different I wanted to feel like

[02:09:10] Apple or virgin and have a personality and have a brand and then the fourth pillar was I was not gonna send anybody that looked like some white guy from New York City to Africa to go drill a well or to India or to Southeast Asia I believed in my travels just what I'd seen in banana and Liberia and Uganda and Kenya as I traveled around looking for water partners I just believe that for the work to be sustainable and culturally appropriate it had to be led by the locals so our job would be to find the local organizations who could go and build these water projects our job would be to scale them maybe buy them more drilling rigs or trucks or help them hire the hydrologist they need but they would be the ones getting the credit I just I love that idea that our role could be let's raise awareness for this important issue let's build a movement of people who say we can and will bring clean drinking water to everybody on the planet and let's raise money as efficiently as possible in his transparently as possible and then let's have all the work be done by the locals leading their communities in their countries forward yeah and the irony of that is when you understand these problems as you do you realize that is the better solution that's the sustainable solution of course in the flip side of that it potentially deprives someone of the experience that you were so fortunate to have which is your volunteers I assume you don't have that same body volunteers last me all the time can I go drill a well in Africa now I didn't drill a well so I wasn't the doctor you know working in the rural area or the welder or I was the documentarian I was the storyteller so when I do take donors and I've taken about 350 people including 50 kids over the last 12 years they are there to learn they're there to listen and then come back and become advocates not to drill a well I just don't need them in the ground you know and them standing on the drilling rig you know pretending like they're doing something right the local liabilities potentially yeah exactly so yeah we are not a good volunteer organization if you want to go and get your hands dirty so you know it's funny when I say this stuff like give away a hundred percent and just build a hyper transparent money flow you know prove to people what you do with their money and show impact build a an inspiring hopeful brand and then work through locals this all sounds like common sense I mean you know but this was so unique 12 years ago that we exploded I mean people were throwing money at us you know and I think we were two million dollars in our first year from that couch I mean it was just it was just working and there was a flurry of activity we were shooting public service announcements we were convincing luxury retailers like Saks Fifth Avenue to give us their windows for a week and get their employees involved and their vendors involved and their customers involved we were doing outdoor exhibitions showing putting dirty water from the East River in the Hudson River in ponds in these big plexi tanks and getting people to sponsor these exhibitions and getting em TV set builders to donate it with their time and it was just it was startup what could we do to get people to care about this issue to know about it and then raise money you know Scott I know we both decided before we got on this just doing this interview that we we sort of had to stop at a certain point in time which I know we've now gone past I there's so many more questions I want to ask you about charity water for the listener let's wrap this thing up in the following way if somebody wants to learn all of these details about charity:water besides going to charity water.org are there other talks that you've given that we can be linking to other places where they can learn obviously you've got a book that just came out yeah I know and there's so many amazing stories of 100% model definitely came under trial and there were moments of you know almost insolvency and you know the organization's now raised three hundred thirty million dollars from over a million people around the world and there are so many stories of of heroism encourage from the community and failure and yeah so there's I think that's that's one place to start yeah there certainly are some talks online that we could we could link to all right so we're gonna make sure we have lots of links you've given a TED talk as well not specifically a TED but similar oh okay I thought was it TEDx or no wasn't

[02:13:28] I might I might do TEDx this year yeah well you should be giving a TED talk that's for sure so we'll link to that so your book is called thirsty just thirst thirst yep little double entendre there maybe yeah yeah and all the proceeds all my proceeds go to the organization's I won't make a penny off it and I was telling you I just found out yesterday it's a New York Times best seller in the first week so that's fantastic congratulations my wife was you know planning on that money to go towards our kids college funds but like oh this is this is not the right thing to keep and I want this book to go out and and really spread the story and hopefully inspire inspire a lot of people maybe to start their own causes maybe to join us maybe to give them the courage and the inspiration that no matter what they have done in their past they're probably not as bad as me where can people find you on social media I'm just my name Scott

[02:14:17] Harrison and charity:water any books that you recommend when you talk about your journey not just maybe what you went through you know 15 years ago but even today like what give me three books that have been not necessarily transformative but but have moved the needle for you in some way in terms of how you've thought about either what you're doing today or how you got here there's an interesting book on the subject of poverty an approach called

[02:14:43] Whiteman's burg guy named bill easterly at NYU the kind of talks about approaches to aid you know in good and bad aid and that's that's one of the beauties of doing clean water is nobody tells you to stop we know what is saying that taking a human being from a swamp or a dirty river you know to providing a sustainable source of clean water is is harmful in any way but that's that was a really good read for me you know on a personal level and when I got on the ship I was reading this tiny little book written by a monk called practicing the presence of God which was just this kind of idea of surrendering yourself to others and trying to live a pure and virtuous life and this guy lives a very simple life he was cutting carrots in the kitchen and was just talking about that really a life of virtue you know with kids now there's a book I really love the name escapes me right now and just I'm on my second time around

[02:15:38] I think it's letters to a god son by this guy Stanley where of us and he talks about he writes a letter to his godson every single year teaching him a different virtue so I'm trying to build character about teaching about kindness teaching about generosity teaching about integrity and it's really it's a really beautiful thing as a father as I just think about and to book more for us as the parents with my kids everywhere but just thinking about how he conveys this and you know knowing that the child will age into these letters this is called letters to a godson Scott you're one of the people that I think even I remember by the time we got to the airplane you know that on that drive back that day which again was only a 30-minute drive of which we wasted seven minutes talking about watches

[02:16:28] I remember thinking my god this this is not a normal dude and dialogues a pretty impressive crowd of people I mean by definition everybody a dialogue is kind of cool kind of interesting has done you know they're not just selecting the smartest or the richest or the most whatever they're they're trying to select people they're trying to curate people who are really really interesting and so even after three days of being around those people I remember thinking this guy stands out you're a real inspiration so thank you for whistling thanks for having me Italian time flew oh my gosh we didn't even we didn't talk about probably half the stuff we want to do I it's funny cuz I read most of your book before we spoke and it was like I remember thinking yeah we're never gonna get through all this so but look I want people to read the book too so we got a we gotta leave some stuff out cool thanks for coming by thanks for having me you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye
