## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD com in this episode I interview my friend Tom bill you Tom is the co-founder of quest nutrition many of you have undoubtedly heard of this they make obviously quest bars and a number of other products but

[00:00:52] I think quest bars are sort of what put them on the map and keeps them on the map Tom is one of three co-founders and I know two of the three quite well including Tom he's also the host of something called impact theory which Rick should we spend quite a bit of time talking about I knew a lot less about impact theory and his work there than I knew about quest now his mission in creating this was to create this sort of idea of what he calls an empowering media based platform for accelerating mission based businesses Tom is incredibly driven and I think that comes across in this discussion I've sometimes been accused of being a little too hyper but when I'm around Tom I actually sort of feel like I'm on quaaludes or something given how much he's just sort of salivating and just you know so passionately jumping out of his seat to basically tell you about something that is generally really interesting and really really helpful he's just a completely driven mission guy and I learned a lot about Tom on this episode that I didn't know I've known Tom for probably five years maybe six years but one thing I didn't know was that in the history of quest he basically interviewed virtually every person that was hired and this is a behemoth company and I'm not just saying that he was interviewing people who were applying for jobs in the c-suite I mean he if you were applying for a job production-line Tom wanted to interview you and he would always ask people the same sorts of questions and there was one question in particular that he asked everybody I was actually kind of surprised by the answer but in this sense his time at quest became a little bit of a laboratory for what he ended up doing later on and we're Lee what what he's doing today and where I think he's going so in this episode we're gonna talk a lot about Tom's history with dieting and how he changed his views on fat and fasting and he had quite a radical transformation there his quest for immortality which if you've ever heard me talk on this subject I am not convinced that that's desirable or plausible but I certainly love hearing about others talk about it his background and what led to the co-founding of quest probably one of my favorite stories because it really speaks to following your bliss versus following the dollars which I think many great entrepreneurs will tell you is their secret what he describes as a growth versus fixed mindset I think this is a really important concept and I think it is worth paying attention to that why he would interview everyone he talked to or hired at quest and again I was surprised by that that was a completely new fact we talked about why he started impact theory and we talked about what fulfillment means to Tom now you'll be able to find a lot more information about Tom and some of the things that we talked about on this show inside the show notes which will be at

[00:03:27] Peter attea MD com forward slash podcast so without further delay here is my discussion with my friend Tom Billy [Music] thank you so much for inviting me to your lovely place my pleasure man I have wanted to get you on my show forever so I am I know I feel like a real kind of jerk because you've been asking me for so long and I've been saying yep yep yep and then I pulled the bait-and-switch and got you on would that's good I promise you if you still want me I'm already in a Harvey it would be amazing well just before we started I met your wife for the very first time which I'm shocked by I still can't believe we've known each other this long and you've never met my wife and that's what prompted me to remember that it was about five years ago that Dom D'Agostino and I came up to meet with I think at the time just you and Ron well the first meeting I think was even with just Ron I remember coming back and he was like oh were into fat now like that just seems crazy because at the point I was truly truly rabbit starvation and had had massive success with it and I did that because I was legitimately fat phobic I was one of those dumbasses that was like well it's fat dude obviously it makes you fat but that was me like I already had a nutrition company at that point that's the crazy part so when I came back and remember where I was and he was like oh yeah we met with this guy Peter at T

[00:04:49] Adan D'Agostino and they really made me believe in fat and I saw whoa like what a strange new world I have walked into and then it ended up changing my life it's interesting because I've heard Ron's say that many times I've never heard you say what you just said but I've seen video clips of Ron talking about this and I I can't believe that the meeting that DOM and I had with you guys could have had such an impact on a company that was already on quite a trajectory yeah when you seek out disconfirming evidence like when you actually want to know how you're wrong and you meet somebody that is really a smart and B just so well educated on a particular topic it's like a fireworks moment you long for those things cuz it's like look my sub-optimal life has gotten me this far like I've already achieved all of this living like a fool in some way that I'm as of yet unaware of if I can become aware of that thing and then make different choices then can my life be different so the reason that it had such a big effect is because that's how we look at the world it's like I want to know how I'm wrong I want to know in what ways I'm suboptimal and so you guys coming in and and making such a compelling case for fat I ended up trying it really soon after you guys came because the thing for me and I'm actually super curious to get your beat on where this is still but at the time you guys are saying look there might be some anti-cancer properties and so I am obsessed dude I don't know if we've ever talked about this I'm obsessed legitimately with living forever and what's the Woody Allen quote I want to live forever by not dying not by having my works to go on so I really truly want to live forever that's something that's captured my imagination since I was a little kid so when you guys were talking about anti-cancer properties I said alright I got to give this a shot and I did it and I hated it in ways you can't imagine I was doing a four-to-one I was in therapeutic range so my what ketone bodies were north of three and my glucose levels were like low 60s if I remember right and I felt so sick like it was crazy and I was warned hey there's the same called the keto flu so when it was happening I was like well hey found it and I just thought I just need to get through you know I forget how long I was staying therapeutic but like let's call five days I'm gonna stay in that therapeutic range for five days it's total misery but like I can get it out and I made it through and I was like

[00:07:05] I'm never doing that again it was so miserable but in that time I went from chronic wrist pain I'd been icing my wrists up to two times a day every day for 15 years and I had like these little burn patches on my wrist from where the ice touch cuz they I was just icing so frequently it was crazy and that was like to just get to the day but I had lost all this weight dude so I was 230 pounds I go on a rabbit starvation diet which I'll define is ultra high protein probably north of 80% of my calories were protein and then just as little fat and his little carbohydrate as I could possibly intake so I was doing basically a lot of steamed chicken breast with nothing but salt on it and that was it and I would eat basically I don't know I was probably I would oscillate between 1200 and 1500 calories a day and and I did this for roughly two years and I went from 230 to about 170 and lost 60 pounds and it was pure insanity and I looked so good dude

[00:08:05] I was shredded best optical shape of my life and I just wanted to stare my abs all day it was amazing so I'm walking into this whole fat thing with that right like 50 cent said I came into the game humble can't nobody tell me [ __ ] now it's like when I got lean I was like I've got this figured out like there's nothing left and I just I thought I had it dialed in knew what to do and never once did it occur to me that that was making my wrist 10 times worse and so when you guys came and said his anti-cancer properties I do it I hate it but in the middle of all that I realized my wrists don't feel better they feel perfect and I remember coming into work going this is the worst experience of my life it is so unpleasurable to be in therapeutic range ketosis not knowing how to supplement but guys it is like a drug like effect on my wrist I'm this is crazy and it's just eating so I said I'm never taking fat out of my diet again I was like there clearly was something to cell membranes anti-inflammatory like there were all kinds of things about the importance of fat that I just wasn't appreciating and now I'm experiencing it so from that moment whatever that was back in 2013

[00:09:10] I've been now some variation of high fat low carb or true ketogenic and when you were at 2:30 that was a relatively fit 2:30 I was working out hard I was strong as an ox I would have had no stamina I wasn't doing any cardio it was purely about strength so like it wouldn't be something that would impress me today and when I see pictures of myself back then I'm like a little grossed out cuz it's like I got so myopically focused on getting bigger they didn't realize how much of it was fat and really went through a bit of bigger wrecks yeah during that phase where it was literally if I saw food I ate it I just I never wanted to miss out unlike anything conceivably anabolic I was all about it and then I'd put a similar amount of obsession to losing the fat and so then

[00:09:57] I lost a ton of muscle and so wasn't nearly as strong anymore but I looked awesome so I went from thinking only about strength to thinking only about aesthetics and now I think about performance and it's it's just changed everything so you said something a second ago which is pretty interesting and I'll pose to you a thought experiment so you said you want to live forever now what if I said to you Tom it is your lucky day because once in my life I get to bestow on one individual immortality and I offered it to you here right now would you take it yes without question all right now you have kids no but you're married I am the lovely wife yep you have you have wonderful friends definitely and they're all going to die that's right would you still want to live forever knowing that everyone you know is going to die definitively and that to me is such a psychological trap that you of all people you have kids so

[00:10:50] I'll if I granted you your children not your spouse just your kids would you want to do it it's a very interesting question because so the short answer is I don't know the answer I'm not convinced it's achievable so I don't put a lot of time in thinking about something that I don't think is achievable though maybe you'll talk me into thinking it is achievable I take a little bit of a job see an approach on this which is there is something reasonable about death in that it's just closing the loop on the carbon cycle and it forces a little bit of urgency there's a sense of you have to get something done now that said I hate the thought of saying goodbye to life I mean I hate the thought of so I'm 45 let's assume I've got 50 more years left on this planet I know how fast the last 30 went by like I remember being 15 like it was yesterday and I know that the next 30 and the next 40 will feel quicker because they will occupy a smaller percentage of my relative timeline so I realized that very soon I will die so what when I think of it that way I think God I just want one more year one more year one more year but do

[00:11:57] I really want it to be immortality would I ever want to bury my children when they were old no you won't want to bury your children right so that and this is the the legacy fallacy trap for me so people talk a lot about legacy so I've decided not to have kids right so people are like oh my god but what about when you're older and on your deathbed you're gonna work so much won't you think I wish I'd spent my time differently and the answer is of course of course every time you change your phase in life your point of reference is now that phase and so on your deathbed you will instinctively see your life completely differently but my thing is why'd you live your life the way that you did because in that phase of your life that was the only way to live that made sense so even if you're acting out of fear you're in the middle of the fear so the fear makes sense so everything that you're doing has a logical movement to it and so to live your life out of sync with where you're at in that moment to try to hit a target which is to feel good on your deathbed to me is crazy because what that presupposes is that all along your experience of life was awesome because you were living for that moment on your deathbed my thing is optimized for the moment you're in now I'll optimize for my deathbed when I'm on my deathbed and I will try to do all the things that make being on a deathbed as as acceptable as possible or maybe even as beautiful as possible to suddenly recognize the imminent death that is upon me and the transience becomes the beautiful thing that I railed against for so long but I know that I will have the frame of mine to find the beauty in it I won't spend a lot of time lashing myself for all I wish I'd done that differently or now with this frame of mind I can see things so clearly I should have had kids but right now in this moment I [ __ ] love my life and so this morning after two hours of sleep

[00:13:45] I couldn't fall back asleep because I'm so [ __ ] excited to get up and keep working on a project now I forced myself to go to bed because I knew that after 2 hours midday I'm just gonna crash but that's the level of excitement I have for the things that I'm doing that I call work so if you can build that into your life then you're gonna be ok and here's how I think of kids I want kids dude I really want kids would you take one of mine if they're amazing absolutely something tells me you've raised them well so you've gotten past a lot of the hard stuff I would the only thing I want more than I want kids is to not have kids so it isn't one is undesirable and the other desirable it is that they are two very desirable things and by a slim margin one wins out so what I think people need to focus on is construct your life around things give you energy and fill you with joy like a deep sense of fulfillment that's why I think a lot of people actually made the right decision to have kids kids to me from the outside seem like pretty instant biological fulfilment you have a kid and there's a feeling that you get about having that child you just can't manufacture any other way and that's beautiful and for people that either just want that kind of fulfillment or don't find fulfillment in anything else kids seem like a really good plan but for me I just found that I could build fulfillment into doing other things and it was incredibly gratifying and I had big brothers for a long time and that informed a lot of my decisions about the realities of the day-to-day of having a kid it's amazing but it's such a time-consuming endeavor yeah sometimes I

[00:15:17] I realize I don't remember what it was like not to have kids I think it's great when people like you can articulate that hey like not everybody has to do this thing it's interesting that it's almost think people have to opt out of instead of opt into it's sort of like become a default thing like you're sort of you know if you don't have kids like people are looking at you like why don't you have kids and but I think I understand what you're saying for sure now going back to the other question about immortality so you obviously have a great sense of urgency and purpose about what you do and again I don't wanna spend too much time on theoretical fun questions but do you worry that if you knew you could live forever some of that urgency would go away not even a little bit so there's a book I read dude read this book it's called Einsteins Dreams and in that book it's a bunch of short stories that explore the nature of time and one of the explorations is a planet where everyone lives forever and the world just breaks into two camps naturally you've got people that do nothing because there is always time to do it tomorrow there is no sense of urgency whatsoever and then you have this other camp of people that do everything because they know I can actually stack all of these passions on each other and that's sequentially one by one I can get extraordinary at everything I've ever wanted to be extraordinary about and when I read this as like a 12 year old I was like oh my god that is so me like I knew to the like visceral core of my being that that's how I would be given that opportunity and then I was given that opportunity at least in the financial sphere of you know hey what would I do if I never had to work again and what would my life what life look like would I want to be one of those people that just you know buys an island retires said my ties or would I really go hard and to me the answer was so evident like when I finally had the money the the resources to do whatever I wanted knowing I would never have to work again ever even if I lived for 200 years I started moving faster because now I could do more of the things that I wanted to I could delegate more I could solve some problems just by throwing money at it and so did I earn that state of being which I like to think I earn all of the things about myself that I value but maybe I didn't earn it and maybe that's why at twelve it resonated so hard with me was just I'm not one of those guys that's like oh man I don't know what I want from life and there's nothing I'm passionate about like there's so many things I'm passionate about let alone just really interested in let alone knitted by so for me the the battle is eternally I don't have enough time and encountering things that you really love doing that really really truly you're just excited and it doesn't matter like

[00:17:54] I'll give you an example so impact Theory my new company where a narrative company we tell stories and one of the stories that were about to put out it's a comic book I'm so into writing this book and to telling this story and the World Cup is on and the team that I support because America didn't qualify is England they were playing today and the games going everybody here is having a great time and I stepped out to go work on the comic and so I'm choosing between these two things both which fill me with joy and passion and was so much fun and I thought this is a good sign when the thing that's technically work that is moving me towards a business objective is so much fun that I actually

[00:18:33] I find myself like pulling away from this truly just a celebration in a game to go work on that thing so structuring my life around things like that make it very easy for me to say definitively if I could live forever I would live forever now it wasn't always rosy right I mean I think I've heard a little bit about how quest got started and what you guys were doing before and how you guys all knew each other but what were you doing before quest and what brought you you Ron and Mike together yeah it depends on how far back you go so I went to USC film school was studying film that was gonna be my stick and I had cheated all the way through high school

[00:19:08] I believe that was smart but didn't really have anything to back that up my own mother when I left for college she finally admitted this years later when I left for college she just quietly assumed I was gonna fail because I didn't show any signs of like being the guy I promised myself when I went to college I would never cheat again because I thought this I'm studying now what I actually care about I'm taking on tens of thousands of dollars of debt it just doesn't make sense to cheat so literally as an incoming freshman I said a RF sink-or-swim I'm gonna do all my own work and it's just gonna be what its gonna be because I need to actually learn this and so go there my SATs were 990 I took it twice so like you can imagine I'm like barely getting into school the film school wanted a 1,300 I didn't have it I go to the admissions committee I'm like what do I need to do to get in they say look SAT just tells us how you're supposed to do in school so if you apply as an incoming

[00:19:55] Jr we're just gonna look at your transcripts and we don't care about you SATs so I thought okay cool for the next two years I have to get good grades so I didn't date I didn't drink I didn't Hardy nothin man dude all I did was work and I got extraordinary grades and I think probably about the time that

[00:20:09] I applied for film school again I had a 4.0 I mean it's just absolutely murdering it remember no cheating nothin just all me [ __ ] hard-ass work and I get into film school and I start crushing it and I'm doing great and I'm like oh my god I'm the man like I am so talented this is crazy and you know my dad's telling me I'm talented like and I get to film school and I'm just proving it everyone's like you're never gonna get into film school I got in and only four people in your entire class get to direct a senior thesis film and I was chosen and I was like dude this is my life I'm gonna graduate with a three picture deal I'm gonna be the next

[00:20:42] Spielberg this is insane like it's all working exactly as I planned and then my senior thesis film I [ __ ] up so badly that I stole the master because it was that embarrassing and people were cutting clips of my film together and to like these joke reels to make fun of it to make fun of me and it was emotionally devastating because I realized the truth and I'm not saying this to be humble the truth was I didn't have talent and that film made it abundantly clear I didn't know what I was doing I was in way over my head and finally this film was I'll just elaborate enough to expose that I actually didn't know how to tell a story and that was crushing because I had a fixed mindset so I believe that you're either naturally talented or you're not to me filmmaking was like seeing either you can sing you can and all the training in the world is only gonna refine whatever talent you already have so I was like wow well I guess this is it I'm not talented I crashed and burned

[00:21:32] I am now flirting with depression I've graduated my parents aren't helping me financially I'm taking remedial jobs and he's just like and it was the period of my life I called the king of remedial jobs period where I would only interview for jobs that I thought I would be smarter than the person interviewing me because I needed to feel smart and I just believed my talent intelligence were fixed traits and life is about making the most of them so I never want to be in a situation that made me feel badly about myself and so that puts you in stupid places so I'm a college graduate selling video games retail that was my life and then I got a phone call and somebody was like hey you should come teach filmmaking we need some people that help and I went and taught and through teaching and I'm truncating the story but there's a lot of suffering in this part that I'm skipping over but I end up teaching filmmaking and realize well I'm actually able to help make their films better and if I can help them make their films better why can't I learn and make my own films better and so that became the seeds that would ultimately grow into a growth mindset but at the time and it had those words I had some Tony

[00:22:29] Robbins I was clinging to that for dear life and the thing that really changed my life was kind of you remember this this would have been back in like 99 people were really debating brain plasticity and one side was like it's total [ __ ] your brain done capped out 12 13 somewhere around there it starts a pruning process after that you're not gonna learn anything major new I was like oh god that would be dire and then the other side was like no no no new science is coming out guys I'm telling you the brains plasti can learn anything at any age and I said all right

[00:22:56] I'm gonna make a decision I choose to believe that the camp that's saying that it you can change is right and so I started reading and reading and reading about the brain voraciously to try to understand how it could change what I needed to do what the process of getting better at something what the neurological process of that was like what are synaptic connections how does the myelination process work so and all of that stuff filled me with so much excitement that I could change so okay I stuck today I don't have to suck tomorrow I can just pour myself into this and get better and push and work and so that's what I started doing right about that time I encountered these two bodybuilder meathead guys and of course immediately write them off as like a bodybuilders are dumb and then they open their mouths and I was like Jesus these guys are smart man and they were like look we're starting a new technology company and we need a copywriter and I was like well you know hey that sounds amazing cuz their pitch to me was dude look you're coming to the film industry with your hand out you need to get rich control the resources and then you can make films away you want to make and I'm you know whatever 2324 and so I'm like that sounds amazing let's do that and so they thought it would take about 18 months I was gonna go help them build this technology company they were gonna sell it and then

[00:24:10] I would have the money I needed to make films and of course it doesn't play out that way and I go into first an amazing period where I'm learning to be an entrepreneur in a startup environment in an ultra grueling like hey don't be a [ __ ] idiot get it done kind of move faster or like that kind of doggy dog environment but I ended up thriving in that and really getting strong which was

[00:24:30] I needed to toughen up I'm just gonna be really honest and it was exactly what I needed at exactly the right time I believed I could change and grow and I met guys that help me to a high a standard and push themselves and wanted to grow and get better and they knew a lot about business and so they just brought me into this pressure cooker environment and made a very similar offer to dozens of people and they said look this is a startup you can have any job in the company you want you just have to become the right person for the job now for me it was all about fighting to become a filmmaker I just needed that money so I went hard hard and just fought and clawed my way up and and ultimately was the only ones left standing and what did that company do specifically awareness technologies made data loss prevention software so if you had a company and this is all timing right so this is the early 2000s so it was like you have a company and you're worried your employees are taking HIPAA data out because your health care or you're worried that they're taking customer data out because the credit cards are still sort of the Wild Wild

[00:25:26] West at this point and people could just pop in a USB and take it out or they could email it out so we made software that would allow you to say okay if it has you know this type of information credit card data whatever flag it and don't let the attachment leave not by a USB port not by email or whatever and I assume you're talking about Ron and Mike yeah yeah yeah so you guys exit this company when so that we started wrapping up around 2009 so in 2010 we launched quest 2009 we bring on a new CEO who bought the company and it was sort of a staggered exit so he and I the new CEO and I didn't see eye to eye he didn't think I was very good at marketing and I thought he just didn't understand marketing so I said look I'm gonna go start our next company which we actually offered him a percentage in cuz we didn't want him to sweat us working on it in the background and he turned it down whoops and so he goes on this firing binge fires a bunch of people and I said you know I think there's one more person we need to fire and he's like who's that and I said me and he was like okay why and I said I don't we don't see eye to eye you think marketing and spreadsheets

[00:26:30] I think it's storytelling so we've got this new company that we told you about and I want to go be the first full-time employee and so I was respectful and phased myself out and made sure that they were you know standing but he agreed to let me go and let me out of my contract Mike and Ron stayed behind on contract for again it was staggered but for a year I was operationally on my own building the company up and that's how I exited that and then they finally exited it was like a year later for I think Ron came first and then another six months and Mike was there what was the impetus for starting quest what hitch were you guys scratching so I can only speak for myself on this one and I'll say that when we were building awareness technologies in the beginning it was learning so much about being an entrepreneur it was insanely empowering and it was just giving to me giving to me given to me and then I sort of was hating what I was doing so much that whatever knowledge I was gaining I was still being eroded and I used to tell my wife it's chipping away at me like I'm just not having fun like this is so miserable and so it was taking more energy than it was giving so it's getting drained every day I never wanted to talk to my wife about what I did so

[00:27:39] I'd come home she'd be like what we up to today and like I don't want to talk about it like I just didn't want to think about it anymore it was just soul sucking because I didn't care about the product there was no us in the product like we were just trying to make something we used to joke it was a company that was born to be sold into slavery like we just wanted to get rid of it like from the jump it was never something that we believed and we actually did VC pitches where we said don't worry you guys can get rid of us we don't care we don't have an ego about this like this and I quote this company was meant to be sold into slavery we actually said those words multiple times not realizing to a VC that makes you sound like an [ __ ] who just wants to get out of the company I'm not gonna trust you with my money wisely so so just couldn't get it for a long time couldn't get any money raised so anyway it's robbing for me and I'm by this point they've given me 10% ownership in the company the company is worth like 22 million at its height so I'm like I'm a multi-millionaire on paper and I'm just like I am so unhappy I'm living the cliche of money can't buy happiness so I go to my wife and I said look I know I promised that I would make you rich and I'm going to but

[00:28:39] I'm gonna need to go backwards for a minute so we can go forward and I said I need to do something that makes me feel alive like I just can't keep doing this it's so miserable and so she was like yeah I haven't seen you this unhappy in a long time like do whatever you need to do so I mean I'm in quit and now when the story it sounds kind of cool because of how it ends up working out but at the time I was ashamed because I was like I just can't do this anymore I'm so unhappy and I had told them anything within my code of ethics I will do to build this company period and I realize it's just not true like when it's stealing my life from me it wasn't worth it anymore so I went in

[00:29:11] I said guys here's your equity back I'm not gonna cross the finish line I don't want to get anything for this you could sell the company tomorrow for a billion dollars you will never hear from me of sound mind and body I am walking away from this and I'm leaving you in the lurch and that's exactly how it feels to me and so they were stunned and taken aback and I drove home and I'm literally pulling into the driveway I'm on the phone with my wife I did it the hard part the two guys who I love they are my brothers and I just said I'm leaving and the phone rings and it's them and I'm like hold on ones like let me take this and I click over and they're like come out to dinner with us I go out to dinner and they're like look you caught us by surprise the reality is we could do this without you but we don't want to and not let me connect to something other than the money up until that point it had just been like we're doing this for the money for the money for the money I'm gonna make money I'm gonna get rich I'm gonna go make movies and then it was the thing I really care about in this I care about the Brotherhood I care about the camaraderie I want to build something of value I want to build something I'm passionate about and so I'd already done the hard part

[00:30:10] I'd already quit so I was like if you guys want to work with me then it would have to be fundamentally different and have to be a different company we'd have to be building something we care about something we're passionate about something that the mother Teresa quote or at least it's attributed to her no one will act for the many but people will act for the one so I was like I can show up every day thinking about my mom and my sister who are morbidly obese and they're gonna die far too soon if we can't solve this problem because Ron was like a nutritional freak at this point and he was just into it and he'd help me transform my physique this is like in the middle of me losing all the weight and I think I got to figure it out and I thought whoa with what he knows about human metabolism and nutrition and my passion for marketing and I've got this whole new vision that's gonna leverage this thing that is now called social media but wasn't called that back then and I just saw this vision [ __ ] your boy Tim Ferriss who I read his book and he introduced me to Kevin Kelly's notion of

[00:31:01] I wasn't your fans so I became obsessed with this notion of a thousand true fans I'm gonna find a thousand true fans and I stopped reading email thank you again Timothy Ferriss for that one I haven't read email in any meaningful way since that book and so I was like I'm gonna go off I'm gonna mark it this way I pulled Mike and Ron into a conference room I gave this whole pitch it's easier just to explain the way I'd say it now this these weren't the words

[00:31:23] I was using back then because we didn't have these words but guys look social media is gonna change everything it's going to allow people to build community all it is is a megaphone if you give people a reason to say something good they'll say something good and if you give them a reason to say something bad they will say something bad but if we can build a company around value creation about building community not trying to hock product actually bring these people together help them cuz most of them want to lose weight help them lose weight make the mission of our company to end metabolic disease like all the sudden we can really do something people know who we are as people I was obsessed with that it was like I want to be me today I would say I wanted to be authentic back then I was just like I want our personalities to shine through I want people to know who we are company shouldn't be nameless faceless organizations it should be real people and you should really feel them and the copy on the website in the content that they put out night I know how to tell stories let us tell stories to these guys so we started building just a totally different infrastructure than any company out there we made our own content studio we were creating all of our own content we were essentially telling stories what is the brand mean what should it mean to you and that ended up because we were so early in the the game of social media we just exploded yeah it's kind of amazing and I remember the first time we met which I guess would have been 2013 so you guys were certainly you would see a quest bar here and there in a store but nothing like you do today of course but I really remember you explaining this at the time and me sort of not getting it which was and I don't even remember back then like what were your main social media channels was it mostly Facebook was

[00:33:00] Instagram around I didn't even exist I remember that came out wow so this was all through Facebook all through Facebook a little bit of Twitter and then probably your to Instagram started to be a thing and then we started putting more and more resources and then exploded an Instagram really carried a lot away in the fitness community because it's so visual mm-hmm so that was a huge win for us when did you realize that this thing could work this thing being quest well I knew it could work from the jump for what I wanted which was I wanted to love what I was doing every day I wanted to feel like I was sort of going to battle a righteous battle with my two brothers who I care deeply about and thought they had just amazing skills that would just be incredibly valuable in what we were doing and I felt ready as a marketer I felt like I understood something that nobody else understood I felt that we could move fast and I felt that we could serve our customer well and that was it and I believe because we always talked we were a food company we didn't look at it as a supplement company or a bar company we were a food company and we were gonna end metabolic disease we wanted to to make meaningful contributions to the world of how food is made source process understood eaten like all of it and even just looking at the kinds of imagery we were putting out there we went so against veins and chains right so the bodybuilding industry up until that point was literally guys with massive muscles huge veins wearing chains and that was everywhere everywhere had that image and we thought oh man we're gonna focus on food I became obsessed with this certain color blue which I thought was appealed to men appealed to women it was like this beautiful optimistic creative color

[00:34:35] I did all this research on what blue means to people on how it hits the retina and literally it became like an actual stress point cuz it was hard to get the right color but then it becomes his iconic color the whole industry starts copying it it was bananas but like going contract like I heard I don't remember where I heard this but they said if you really want to be successful you have to be a contrarian and you have to be right and we were a contrarian and we were right and so because of that it's just everything went nuts and so looking at everything differently and building a company that we were excited about in a new way taking care of customers it was just yeah it was crazy and you've been now doing impact theory for two years just under yeah so talking about that transition and tell me a little bit about what impact theory is I mean I think I have some idea but my guess is

[00:35:20] I'm probably missing a few of the details and also the understanding of when you decided hey it's time to go do this other thing full time because this was obviously a passion for you always yeah so to understand impact Theory you have to understand rashon Jackson and when I was in college and desperately trying to get good grades I had a teacher offer extra credit to go tutor inner-city kids and so I said yes and they of course give you the most problematic kids you can imagine so they gave me this young probably drug and alcohol impacted hyperactive kid who was hyperactive on a level I had never seen the kid was bouncing off the walls all over the place was crazy and my job was to get him to do his homework and so for the first hour he would cry and scream and freak out and like run around and get in fights and just go nuts and then when I would say alright hours up I gotta go then he would become so sweet and sappy and he would cry and just beg me to stay and help him and so like a sucker I would stay so he'd get me for two hours and so around like week 4 week five I realized this kids trolling me like he knows he gets an extra hour if he ignores me for the first hour and then his sweet and sweetness and light the second hour so that starts getting really annoying for me because I've got so much work to do and on week six you're supposed to tell him hey I'm only coming for two more weeks cuz it's an eight week program so week six I tell this kid I'm only coming for two more weeks just so you know and he flipped out he nuclear is eight at this point and just just goes bananas and he was he was really small because he was on Ritalin or something and so stunted his growth so it's just tiny tiny for his age and he went up and just slugged this kid who was like no joke three times the size I just never seen like pent-up rage like that and I was like wow I finally get him under control I get him back and I'm like is this because I said I was only coming for two more weeks and he says through sobbing hysterical tears yes so

[00:37:13] I said look cuz now I'm fed up with the whole just like drama routine and I said if and only if you do your homework the moment I get here as long as I live in Los Angeles I will keep coming and helping you with your homework and so we agreed and that turned into an eight and a half year relationship and I end up becoming far more than just a tutor and he becomes an integral part of my and I his and I didn't know it at the time but he was being abused at home and he ends up getting taken away by the police and he makes me the guardian of the court and I have to help him through the court system and into foster care I mean like that's how intertwined our lives became and then I'm young and poor at this point and they move him farther and farther away and I never really felt like I was able to help him because I was so young and stupid and the only thing I really knew how to do was to show him that there's a life he'd never sees so I would take him to see movies in Beverly Hills cuz I was like movies cost the same but I can at least take him to a beautiful neighborhood that left a really lasting mark on me and my personality and it planted a seed and then flat for 10 15 years later I'm at

[00:38:19] Qwest I now 1,400 employees and about a thousand of them grew up hard just like this kid rashon and I realize I have an opportunity to help make their lives better but how and so we start thinking of a saying Called Quest University and it was meant to be making protein bars your tuition but really learn the things you need to learn to go and have a better life and so I write the 25 bullet points which are the 25 things I had to do to my mind to go from laying on my unfurnished apartment floor flirting with depression not knowing how I was gonna do anything with my life feeling totally out of control hopeless and lost to building a billion-dollar brand I knew exactly what I had to do the changes in beliefs the thought patterns everything that I had to do and so I started giving that to people and trying to help them and people would come to me and like these are thugs dude like tattoos up the neck teardrop tattoos grown men coming to me in tears you care more about my success in my own mother I have hoping for in my future for the first time ever like people moving up one guy comes off the line and ends up working in our tech department cuz I showed him how to like learn Tech on the side my I mean just crazy like so many stories like that absolutely extraordinary and I was like when I'm at my most honest I love helping with the body but when I'm at my most honest helping with the mind is what I'm meant to do and so I thought we're doing all of this for the employees let's create a show we'll call it inside quest and I'll interview coz what I feared and I remember when I did it I said my big fear in writing these 25 things down they hung on the wall it was like a whole thing my fear and writing them down is that you'll memorize them but you won't live by them and so I wanted to bring other successful people in that I knew just because their universal laws of success

[00:40:02] I knew would say roughly the same thing over and over and over and these guys would see okay it's not just dad it's all these people that are saying the same thing and so that became really important and so I'm pouring myself into making that great in an effort to really do something amazing for the employees and then at this time we end up having just the incredible financial windfall at a personal level that you know we'd all fantasized about since the day we got into business and I realized all the sudden you know we're in a very fortunate position where the three of us have the financial wherewithal we don't always have to agree on everything we don't always have to move in the same direction the company would be very stable now without me they didn't necessarily they being Ron and Mike didn't necessarily have my level of excitement for doing the mind and our consumer base was asking why the hell is the protein bar guy talking about mindset so it was a total brand disconnect and I looked at it and thought given enough years I can get people to change the way that they think about this brand but are my partners gonna want to share in that horrific cost as I shift the brand to fit what I want to do I mean it didn't seem like a fair thing to drag them through so you know I said look this is something that is important enough to me that I have to do it in my life so we agreed to part ways at that point and build things the way that we see fit and so I took the studio that we had built inside of quest and spun it out into a standalone company that's now impact theory we create both what I call nonfiction content stuff like this interview shows and then fiction content so we've got our first comic book coming out that we hope to turn into film or TV so how much of what you learned in film school figures into what you do today a lot a lot so film school is psychology with and put the camera here for best results once you understand that that your job is really to take the audience on an emotional and ideological ride that at the end they're entertained but at least from my perspective also enriched and look most films don't worry about the second part that's an obsession of mine but when I think about the things that really shape my life it's the stories I tell myself about myself and it's the stories that I with and make the dominant metaphors in my life Joseph Campbell said if you want to change the world change the metaphor so I have lofty visions of what can be impacted through art I heard a quote the other day though that is very sobering and definitely keeps me thinking about ways to really impact people and he said if what 300 years of Shakespeare hasn't stopped genocide then what hope does art really have and I think that's a fair point but I think that we're living through a time today where you can marry the nonfiction the direct the explanatory with the metaphorical because I think the big problem is that the belief in the metaphor is dropped out and Joseph Campbell again talks about this and says part of the reason that you get these stunted adolescence is because there's no ritual driven by belief that the ritual has deep meaning so people aren't different from you know childhood to adulthood without those transitional rituals and same with divorce and he said you know I think a big part of the divorce rate is that people don't have these transitional rituals and so I took that really seriously and when I got married I went through ritualistic scarification because I wanted to be a different man the day before my wedding than the day after and I can't tell you how many times that's really like reminded me going through something painful that was difficult made me think of myself as different and begin telling myself a different story that I'm married now so say more about that what did you do exactly when I put it into normal terms it won't sound as cool but I got a tattoo now for me tattoos were not something I wanted I don't like tattoos don't have a thing for tattoos I have exactly one and that was the one that I got as a ritualistic scarification I was deathly afraid of needles at the time deathly afraid so for me it was facing my biggest fear doing something that was painful with this thing that held some sort of mythical like element of terror in my life they give you an idea I was one of those guys that when I had injections in my wrists at one point I almost fainted and I wasn't even looking because the thought of a needle penetrating my see and freaked me out that much so that's where I was when I got the tattoo it was just it was the scariest thing I could think of within the realm of reality right in and go swimming with great white sharks okay that obviously would be far more terrifying but within the like the plausible realm of this isn't potentially actually dangerous it was the worst thing I could think of and so doing that having to face that fear having to do that ended up being really important for me transitioning out of being single to being married

[00:44:24] I've heard you talk before about money and it's something that I've certainly asked a number of my patients one of the privileges of medicine I think there are several but but one of them I think is that you form relationships with people where you can ask very intimate questions and sometimes they're not just about their health it's about their happiness and even though my patient population is quite small given the affluence of some of my patients I've had interesting discussions with people about how wealth does and doesn't impact their lives so I guess even though you're not my patient I'll ask you basically the same sort of question which is did you feel different the day after your liquidity event no and that's the weirdest part here's exactly what it was for me and I think this is near-universal when I looked when I was poor and all through my childhood I looked at people that had money and I had adoration for them it just seemed so cool and I thought that in some way they were better than me or certainly in a better place than me and that that made them in some ways better certainly more desirable to be like that and so looking at them you meet them with a bit of reverence and so in the back of your mind somewhere is the notion that when I get money I will have that adoration for myself and I will have that sense of reverence for myself and you think that somehow like all the insecurities that you have will be washed out by that reverence and adoration and it's not and you realize that you feel exactly the same the next day and the easiest way I can explain it is to say that it's like losing your virginity before I lost mine

[00:46:02] I legitimately thought like colors would be brighter I would just be somehow a fundamentally different person and then I had sex and was like oh that was rad I loved it but I'm not a different person and that was exactly how I felt with money it was rad dude money is better than people think it's more powerful than people think to be certain but it's not at all what people have been told it's not going to impact how you feel about yourself it is merely going to extend your capabilities you will suddenly be able to facilitate a things you wouldn't be able to facilitate money is essentially inert right there's a bit of heat energy to a dollar bill that you could release by burning it but short of that the money in and of itself is inert but it can facilitate things now if you have a clear vision of what you want to facilitate and it's a problem it can be addressed with money something money becomes insanely powerful and if you really want to think about how powerful money is think about how much of your own life is determined by what you get paid to do now imagine controlling that money and you realize that you're able to aim incredibly intelligent capable people at problems you want solved it's not even necessarily the problem they want solved so that gets really really interesting and then if you can help them fall in love with what they're doing if you can give them a supportive environment if you can make sure they know that we're all equals here we have different roles but we're all equally important that their voice is desired that they're there because you want to hear from them then it's like holy hell I know I only get their attention because I'm willing to pay them but now that I have their attention and can create this ecosystem this environment for them to thrive in we can do some pretty extraordinary things it seems like one's motivation around money can change because certainly I'm guessing when you were young or when you were let's say right out of college right you you're sort of at a low point it sounds like we didn't go too much into it although that's the kind of stuff I enjoy talking about it's the pain and the humiliation of that experience and at that moment my guess is you would have thought give me a bunch of money and my problems go away and maybe I'm wrong but I don't get the sense that at that moment you would have realized that that wasn't true and at best that money would have given you the opportunity to go back and do what you loved that in those Ehrman those are different things right very yeah yeah unfortunately back then I I was chasing money all out because I thought it would solve all of my problems and I thought it would make me cool as hell I just thought it would be so cool dude I thought I'm gonna be the man I want a fast car I want a Lamborghini like I want the every blingy like thing that you can imagine I wanted it all and

[00:48:29] I fantasized about it and whenever I thought about money the only thing I thought about was what it could buy me that was it and how cool people were gonna think I was how cool I would think myself yeah that was the nature of money to me do you consider a role model in people who have taken great wealth and put it to maximum impact Elon Musk no question he's probably I really want to think about this he's probably one of the few people that legitimately makes me feel badly about myself and like makes me sweat when I think about like oh could I really do that like I like to think I can do anything Peter but Wolff spinning that many plates at one time yikes I don't know that I process raw data fast enough that's the God's honest truth and so let's consider one of those things which is SpaceX there used to be an engineer so I'm pretty impressed by the kilo $2 ratio of payload sometimes I still can't believe it's happened I mean what they've done have you ever been to see a launch no have you I have not I have a couple of friends who have odd loves you yeah it's I mean there's some really cool videos out there yeah I've seen the videos the videos are amazing how do you think landing it and you've seen the videos where like you have to wear the correct headphones to be able to actually know oh yeah there's a guy on YouTube maybe we can find it for the show notes but there's a really cool video where you can actually hear you just get an amazing auditory experience basically yeah yeah it's it's um yeah it's actually not that recent I feel like it was in the last three or four months mmm yeah pretty impressive yeah I've heard people talk about how SpaceX could be a trillion dollar company which is is pretty interesting

[00:50:11] III don't know that you know it's funny when I went to college I wanted to be an aerospace engineer so I'm obviously pretty interested in that stuff but and this is gonna sound like a complete sort of poopoo on the whole thing but I'm so much more interested in like what's happening on earth and what's happening in space and I don't know when that transition took place but as interesting as I think that stuff is intellectually

[00:50:32] I just think emotionally I feel much more curious about what's happening right in front of me and now I'm also equally amazed at things that we don't know that are so close like you know because I used to spend so much time swimming I'm kind of amazed by the ocean which is like you know if you think about it at its deepest point it might be what 12 14 kilometers deep like that's a trivial distance you could walk that and afternoon but when going straight down that's a depths of unknowns like we can't even fathom new types of organisms that don't even require sunlight that kind of stuff so by selecting elan as your example it's sort of like saying look there are lots of incredibly wealthy people Bill Gates Warren Buffett many of these folks who have you know and people who are less well-known like

[00:51:19] John Arnold who through philanthropy have done remarkable things but Elon has done it through building companies that are kind of paradigm shifting I mean that's an overused term but I think it's safe to say that for his stuff so what is the paradigm you want to change I want to make sure that no human being on the planet fails to encounter an empowering mindset that's what I'm all about and so meeting kids in the inner cities and and I'll tell you a story so

[00:51:50] I used to interview everybody if you got a job a quest I interviewed you whether you were the EVP of global sales or you were the janitor you interviewed with me and so that meant that I I went through a phase where all I was interviewing was people working for the production line which naturally draws people from lower income brackets and I started asking just because I wanted to really understand like what motivates you because my thing was I never wanted to hire somebody into a parasitic relationship where there I was gonna get their time and essentially gives them very little money when you really think about it in exchange for that time and so I thought wow they're gonna spend 50% of their waking hours with me and I'm gonna give them not enough money and I didn't feel good about that relationship now you can't build the business just by throwing money at everybody so what else could I do to add value to people's lives so it was like one thing I can hire people who there's a secondary thing that they can learn from us and then they can go on and do that thing so they can build their skill set up the example I gave earlier of the kid who wanted to learn technology awesome came in busted ass made a lot of protein bars but also we helped him get a job in tech within our own company and then goes on to start his own tech company it was crazy so I was looking for people like that I wanted to know what's that next thing I know that you don't want to spend the rest of your life working a protein bar line so what's the next thing you want and if I if I really believe that I can help you get there then selfish desires are aligned we can work together to make something amazing happen and I would rather have you for three or four years and you believe that

[00:53:17] I'm making your life better every day than to have you for 20 years and you hate every bit of it the way that those two people will work is so dramatically different just to be clear part of your motivation is also selfish right it's like I'm gonna get way more out of you in four years on a per unit basis a Productivity basis than twenty years where you're you know you're gonna stay here forever but you're not happy and then part of it is sort of altruistic yeah I'll even say it's all selfish so I don't think selfish is necessarily a bad thing I just think that we all live life from our perspective were motivated by certain things I like to see other people win I'm wired for it so I remember when I was like six or seven in an Easter egg hunt I pretended not to see some Easter eggs because I knew winning meant a lot more to my sister than it did to me so I pretended not to see them she found them and she wanted she was very happy so that's just me I just like to see people that I care about happy and having a good time so that's part of it I'm wired for that so

[00:54:11] I know that I'm gonna be stoked if I see that they're having a good time and then I want to build a big company make a whole lot of money and the only way I can do that is by convincing extraordinary people to come work for me and then make it a great environment where they don't want to leave so yeah I don't mind people saying that it's entirely selfish fine if it's good for people I'm okay with that this became your lab I mean I didn't realize this you interviewed every person you hired so I've interviewed north of 1,500 people which doesn't sound like a lot when you think of all the things you do 1,500 times until you go to interview 1,500 people and you realize Jesus this is a lot of people so yeah years of my life were spent interviewing that we were going back what did you learn from that process that surprised you the most yeah this is a punchline to the question that you actually asked in wanting to find out what is your real desire I started doing this magic Genie question so you can ask for anything that you want anything at all got to be something self as though it can't be to cure cancer or bring somebody back from the dead and you can't ask for more wishes so what do you wish for and I wanted to just get like that truest thing that they really want and Peter to a person remember I interviewed hundreds of people - a person they all said the exact same thing what are the odds that like let's just say that that particular question I asked 300 people what are the odds that every single one of them without exception will give you the same answer well if you're not leading them or asking the question to each of them had a point in the discussion that was equivalent so you're priming them I would say the answer is the probability is incredibly low okay so I'm leading them just enough that we narrow the world down for sure otherwise this really would be like a magic trick because almost to a person this was less

[00:55:52] Universal but almost to a person the first answer was I want a job which I know is [ __ ] they're saying that because they are there for an interview so I would say okay I get that a lot of people give that to me as their first answer so this is now me leading them and I say why do you want the job and they would say for money okay rats so is it fair to say you would ask the magic

[00:56:10] Genie for money yes so none of this is weird to me the weird part is when I say give me a number and every single one of them every single one I never once got a variation gave me the same number and the number was a million dollars million dollars Peter what the [ __ ] are you gonna do with a million dollars you can't buy a house in LA for a million dollars let alone be set up for a life it's a magic Genie now I've thought about the magic Genie question a lot and if you're asking for money you've already wasted your ask but fair enough like I spend a lot of time thinking about the magic Genie but the fact that they all asked for a million dollars was crazy to me and the first time I heard it I thought well that's weird the fifth time I thought man how is it possible five people have said the same thing around number ten I actually thought my team was [ __ ] with me and that they had started telling them ahead of time to do it just to like mess with me by the time we got to 25 I realized something about humanity that you only dream as big as you think and you only think as big as what you see so if what you see around you is that everyone's wishing and thinking about a million dollars because that seems like an impossibly large amount of money you never go my dream in life is to terraform Mars okay you never think that big you're stuck at a million dollars it would never occur to you that you can terraform Mars because your thinking is so limited by what you've seen and I thought whoa if I could just give them my mindset overnight because I'm I'm interviewing people that are smarter than me and I'll define smart as the ability to process raw data quickly okay does seem like a reasonable definition it seems like one component but I I don't know the definition of smart I would certainly include that in it but but let's grant that that's the definition we use for the moment so I would come across people that blew me away they could just think faster than me they could see all the different permutations of a given problem and come up with a solution that was well thought out more intricate than I could and so I thought okay well my success isn't predicated on intelligence it's definitely partly hard work but I work hard because I have a certain belief and a mindset that I can that my efforts will be rewarded so I started thinking okay humans lead with belief it's because I believe that I can get better at something that I'll pour myself into it but they don't believe that they're gonna get that result so they don't they don't believe that they could ever get 100 million dollars a billion dollars a hundred billion a trillion let's just uh not real to them so even though we're talking to a magic

[00:58:29] Genie they don't think that big so it was crazy and if you push him and really ride them they they'll work their way up to ten million but nobody ever goes a billion a trillion there's none so I was like wow I became obsessed with how do I codify my mindset what I've done over the last at that point like twelve years of just training myself to think a certain way how do i impart that to people and that is still my obsession so that's what I'm hoping can be done through story and when you read Homa

[00:58:59] Deus and sapiens is just really understanding how narrative is so massively influential and that the dominant narratives that we use are all religious and then you look at how I think the bottom is falling out in terms of belief in a lot of the religions for a lot of people and you just go okay well what's the ultimate punchline when people no longer have a metaphor that they put any weight in they have no belief in then it really becomes a documentary and my life is what my life is I know it because I see it and that scared me because now if you can only envision what you're living you can't even turn to the Bible to see extraordinary acts you can't the Koran that whatever to a movie something to have some vision of something that's bigger than what you've done and I thought could we use storytelling to give people a way to think in the way that the matrix gave me a way to think and so that became the obsession it's funny I was thinking about it while you were explaining what would I ask for in the genie question and it's so interesting that I wouldn't think to ask for money which is not to say that I wouldn't love to have more money because of the reasons we described it would be amazing to be able to amplify the things I want to do the first thing that jumps to my mind is like the type of laboratory I'd want to have and how I hate the fact that all of the best scientists that I interview for my book and you know for the podcast and just folks for my friends I mean they spend fifty percent of their time fundraising and I imagine a world where like you could create like a true Institute where you're going after high-risk translational problems with infinite resources so let me tell you if the genie would give me the dollars I'd be happy to take him but I actually think the first thing that comes to my mind would be some form of fulfillment because at least money you sort of know it can be got but fulfillment strikes me as one of the hardest things to find again maybe I'm biased by what I see clinically which is people who have more money than they could ever spend I've actually had one patient say to me it's almost impossible to spend more than six hundred million dollars in your lifetime that was the number that was the I remember that was like you know anything over six hundred million is just a waste like you can't possibly spend it that is a failure of imagination like even just a poor six hundred extra million into each one of those three companies well III think this person was saying through like expenditure on you know like willy-nilly stuff but interestingly fulfillment seems to be something that's missing I certainly don't think I know fully what it means I think I've had moments where

[01:01:33] I've experienced it but it's interesting if it's a real magic Genie can you imagine what that would feel like yes can I give you my secret formula it's a fulfillment I would love to hear it so one fulfillment is a neurochemical state so it there's no possibility of a flatline there's no way you're just gonna have it forever I think that it abscent flows with the movements of a day but having said that I think that fulfillment comes from becoming someone that you're proud of building a skillset that was incredibly hard to build that serves not only yourself but other people so you're doing the hard things you're not doing things that would be deeply pleasurable and in building your identity around not doing things that are pleasurable in order to become extraordinary in order to serve other people I think that's the name of fulfillment when I think about the times where I feel just [ __ ] awesome it is because I did something really hard while other people were playing it made me more powerful in the way that I define it which I can't believe Power has become a dirty word power to me is close your eyes imagine a world a better world the world you want to create open your eyes and have the ability to manifest that that's power so mother Teresa had power she was able to do things that is what leads to fulfillments what the Greeks called techne it's not enough to go ladle soup at a kitchen right that should that's pleasurable feels good but it isn't fulfillment because you didn't earn any special ability to do that now fulfillment is the guy that worked at

[01:03:06] Toyota that came into the soup kitchen and said I'm going to improve their efficiency some more people get fed and he increased their output by like 40 or 400 percent I remember had a 4 in it but it was like massive and I thought that's fulfillment he worked his ass off I'm sure there were a ton of days at Toyota where he was like what am i doing why am

[01:03:23] I doing this but he gained this set of skills it was insanely powerful and he put them to use in soup kitchen now that feels good that's fulfillment so getting people to a place where they can learn that the cool stories are the stories that while you're in it suck like when I heard your story swimming around Catalina Island that sounded like actual madness to me when I heard that you swam from Catalina back to the mainland that sounded crazy and the same thing with doing the one in

[01:03:54] Hawaii I was like this is Critias are my greatest fears open waters my greatest fear and I thought but that's why he gets to feel good about himself because he did those things it's in the hard stuff it's not the easy stuff that is interesting I certainly agree that it's very hard to be fulfilled if you are not in the service of someone else at some point you know in other words I think obviously you have to be in service of many things and others being only one of them in surgery you know for many people I think that might be part of the relational joy that they experience in having kids is for a great period of time you are in service of those kids in fact sometimes it seems like you're in service of them too much and you don't get a break from that but you don't have to have kids to obviously be in service of another person yeah I I don't know I I really find this question of fulfillment and true relational joy to be interesting in it you know we're in sort of a weird time right because I was talking to a friend of mine who's a psychiatrist I actually hope to have him on the podcast at some point because this is a discussion that it's probably gonna be a controversial discussion but

[01:04:55] I think it's an important one which is is there any evolutionary basis for suicide so that's question one and the question too is do we believe that we are seeing on an age adjusted mortality adjusted basis are we seeing suicide at a greater extent today than we were before or is it just that we are paying more attention to it now there is less but I do wonder is is there any part of civilization that contributes to society and my intuition says yes that's about the extent to which my knowledge would go on this topic but I want to talk about this with somebody who really thinks broadly about this because something that is so against our DNA like our DNA is pretty geared towards survival if you think about it maybe at the risk of oversimplifying what pain could be so great that it could override arguably the single most primitive Drive that our species would have and so I think the prevalence of suicide is such that virtually no person i knows life hasn't been touched by it which tells you how ubiquitous it is and it's sort of you know you alluded to depression I mean I just think when people really are honest with themselves like if they haven't thought of killing themselves they've certainly thought life isn't that much fun and that's that's kind of a sobering thought I've become obsessed with this topic

[01:06:13] I'm unfortunately not the person you're looking for that has like the real deep knowledge but I will I will say this I'm not the right person to take any advice from on this topic but follow my logic I think that there's something terrifying happening with the microbiome and I think that the potential effects of the microbiome being one of the massive contributory factors in what feels like and again I don't know is it just we're paying attention to it more maybe but man it feels epidemic right now it's crazy you had Anthony Bourdain and Kate Spade kill themselves in the same week I mean it's like we can just accept money doesn't solve the problem fame doesn't solve the problem and so I just start thinking okay well what are we going through right now now I am particularly obsessed with the microbiome because of what happened to my wife which I can't remember how much you and I've talked about this no no I don't think I know a nice so three years ago we are on our way to Vegas packed the bags baby I'm on my way and my wife goes not feeling well

[01:07:14] I feel funny and I was like what does that mean she's like I know I just don't feel right and then an hour later she's like gosh I'm feeling kind of nauseous I think I need to go home and I was like whoa so she leaves and then she calls me from the parking lot crying and she's like I just projectile vomited everywhere I was like oh baby like wow this crazy like I can't remember the last time that she threw up so I was like alright we'll go home I'll come down I'll deal with that don't worry just go she goes home and I think okay stomach bug bad timing bummer but it didn't go away and it became she wasn't vomiting anymore but she couldn't hold on to food and I was like ooh this skin a little scary and it's one of those where like how many people does diarrhea kill you know so I was like really getting paranoid and just non-stop non-stop non-stop everything she ate nothing like would stay and I was like whoa this can really scary and so we have her microbiome tested and they're like you basically don't have a microbiome they're like it's been so decimated by overuse of antibiotics it's my wife used to get chronic chest infections and so she took antibiotics just in the time that I knew her probably I don't know 12 times so and who knows how many before that so I mean she just absolutely murdered it and then of course the sends her into if she wasn't clinically depressed she was getting real close and just really really strong emotionally struggling physically unable to like maintain a physique like just it was crazy and so in building it back up and seeing how complicated it is seeing how much it affects the neural chemistry knowing that what 95% of serotonin is stored in the gut I mean it's crazy so it just started being this whole thing of like whoa I think this is wildly underappreciated we started doing a lot of microbiome testing at Quest and it was just like man people's micro biomes the diversity is just absolutely atrocious it's pretty crazy so whenever

[01:09:10] I hear something that has to do with neuro chemistry I immediately go to this is a microbiome problem so what's changing it then so in her case antibiotics might have played a role massively restricted eating so we both had really restrictive diets so remember the whole rabbit starvation she was doing the same thing so just over restriction over sanitizing hands over washing hands like never getting anything that's dirty yeah I mean just making literally every mistake that you can make with your microbiome that would suggest because again the microbiome in that situation would be a facilitator of an environmental issue right the environmental changes being nutrition overuse of antibiotics sanitation things like that I also wonder if there are sort of psychological emotional cues in the environment that exacerbate this problem what do you mean like stress I mean I hate that word because it's such a sort of loaded term but I wonder if people feel more alone today than they felt a couple hundred years ago you know one of the things you talked about earlier that you were very passionate about was even though you didn't use the word was kind of your tribe you know it's funny people ask me if I'm ever talking about you know my training in medicine they're like you know residency sounded really horrible because you work about 110 to 115 hours a week you probably slept about I I remember I slept about 28 hours a week so it was pretty miserable and it's really funny I look back at it is one of the fondest five-year periods of my life and it's despite all of those things of course not because of all those things but part of it was just a camaraderie I mean just Brotherhood and some sisterhood right I mean there was just a amazing male and female residents that you were in the trenches with and it was a shared sense of purpose a shared sense of mastery a shared sense of suffering but

[01:11:10] I wonder if outside of places like the military and residency and start-up companies which are places where you see a lot of that camaraderie are we losing that more broadly and was that something we were wired to experience that's really interesting and another thing that really interests me is the way that culture stacks so if you had X amount of expectation on your shoulder to succeed then you give that to your kids plus some and then they give that to their kids plus some and when I think like how much my parents drugged me around and that seemed crazy but then I see how much parents drag the kids around now that's one of the reasons I don't have kids I was like if that's the expectation I'm not prepared to be a chauffeur so it just gets crazy the amount like the the level of sort of and

[01:11:54] I look I'm a freak for efficiency but the level of like clinical efficiency that people work into their lives where there is no more play like one thing I will tell you that my wife and I are really good about with each other is reminding ourselves not to lose playfulness because look when I came into business I needed to toughen up I needed to get harder that's just true my personality and so as I did that and became more powerful more self-assured like it was amazing but I started to harden like everything about me was just harder like my wife would be telling a story and I'd be like get to the punchline which is a terrible thing to do in your marriage by the way and she was like you've just gotten harder like you need to be playful like loosen up you used to be goofy and so yeah that's interesting like how much of that stuff is as we shape each other and we shaped the society and we talk about things like terraforming Mars but then all of a sudden like [ __ ] you've got to give your life over to terraform Mars like if you want to be the next Elon Musk he set the bar so high that it's like where where is that breaking point where there's there's no more natural off switch you've got your phone all the time there's no natural break where it's like well there's no electricity so when I'm in the cave like there's nothing left to do or it's the weekend there aren't phones there is no email so everybody's gone home so there's no work to be done so there were all these natural sort of kill points that don't exist anymore and look I'm the biggest violator of all I love to work my problem is people apply this stuff when they don't even love it that much and so now they're just working around the clock it's something that drains them that gets scary fast what routines or rituals do you have around protecting yourself to you know maintain a creative environment I mean do you have forced downtime or forced time away from work I'm guessing exercise is still very important you I mean what sort of routines do you enact to make sure you can function at your best longitudinally well the make sure that I function at my best i optimize cognitively so my diet is like thing number one I don't [ __ ] around with my diet my diet is on point and I work out five days a week and that is hugely importantly hate the gym but it's critically important to strength longevity and cognitive optimization why do you hate the gym it hurts is the honest answer that's part one part two is dude remember the whole thing I want to live forever because there's so many things I want to do that

[01:14:16] I love that every minute I'm in the gym is a minute I'm not doing something that I would really intrinsically love like in and of itself the moment is fun in the gym I love the result I love being able to say I do hard things but in the moment it's just pain it's lactic acid building up it's heavy weights it's the disappointment of not being able to lift away that you've been trying to get it's like everything about it is meeting my limitations even if it's just the limitation of I can only do so many reps in a given set for a given weight and it's like I've literally failed to do this thing so the act of being in the gym for me is anathema to the things that I love it's ugly it's not even beautiful so it's like iron and weights

[01:15:00] Oh God like I'm always surprised that I have to explain that to people do you enjoy the gym me yeah I do you know my wife loves the gym you're both crazy to me like whatever endorphin rush you're getting I'm not getting like it is everything about it in the moment is unpleasurable it's interesting I wonder why I enjoy it I guess we all get the thing that are easy for us and for me fortunately exercise comes easily in terms of it really requires no discipline now sometimes it's a bit of a challenge as far as time management and sometimes I don't feel like exercising but it's always for the reason you just described which is I've really got this other thing to do and it's really pressing but let's be fair if you said to me Peter I'd like you to go swim the

[01:15:42] Catalina channel next year that I have no desire to do again I have no desire to spend you know what probably amounted to 20 24 hours a week in the ocean swimming whoa as part of the training I mean that I don't have a desire to do but but I really do enjoy deadlifting which is not to say it's not unpleasant and it's not to say that it also makes me upset when I can't do it so I certainly understand all of those things

[01:16:08] I mean so I have this thing where part of my schtick and longevity is rule number one is don't get hurt right so it's like exercise matters but like don't be an idiot and so you know one of the things I've been fortunate to develop over the years with the help of a lot of great physical therapist trainers and such is a really good sense of the cues that tell you something's not right that day so I'm getting pretty good at knowing when my glutes are not firing and when I'm dumping the weight into my sacroiliac joint or into my lumbar spine and so even to this day about one out of every five times I go to deadlift I abort really yep that's smart so I'll go you know I warm up bar 135 185 225 to 75 315 is always the warmup and if on the way up that ladder

[01:17:02] I don't feel perfect like perfect all glute basically doing the work nothing loading into my lower back if I don't feel that we're done and honestly I think at least out of yeah probably one every five sessions we just abort and that pisses me off I mean truthfully I get really pissed for like another couple hours I'm like I can't believe I didn't get the deadlift I gotta wait a whole week to try this again buh buh o

[01:17:29] Allah and I have the same rule with squatting you got a can it if you can't do it but now go back to nutrition tell me about what what is dialed in for you me so I'm on just whole foods whenever humanly possible so I try to vary my sources so I'll have a wide variety of vegetables constituting a very diverse color array I eat a lot of eggs I have a lot of fat in my diet primarily from olives and olive oil those are the the big fat and then I do eat a fair amount of red meat that would be I guess philosophically some people believe it to be a higher carcinogenic meat I'll say this I'm not the right person to take advice on it but I have no fears about that I get a lot of my fat from that as well and then yeah that's it like whole food cycle between beef chicken some lamb a little bit of pork and just try to keep it quote-unquote clean high fat low carb and I never cheat not never but wow it's rare twice a year maybe and then it's not like some debaucherous day it's like a meal what do you do as far as meal timing fasting things like that yes I also do a lot of fasting so I do a lot of intermittent fasting but then also at least once a year I'll do a five-day fast and that's water only it's not like a Ramadan style water only fast fast fast for five days that's been big what do you feel when you do the five-day water only first anger a lot of hatred no the the big thing yeah to be fair what I love about fasting is that it's hard as hell and I know that I'm gonna stick with it so there's like so much just like juice that comes from that but the reality is the first two days are easy by day three the problem is mostly boredom and what I've realized is I get a lot of dopamine hits from knowing oh I'm gonna eat like here comes this meal I love this meal it's gonna be awesome and there's none of that so your day doesn't have those like excitement markers in it so for me the big problem is and then also by day four I do start slowing down even though I'm fully keto adapted I'm posting awesome numbers I'll get into the threes when I'm doing a five day fast so it's like my machineries there I usually do a cycle of keto leading up to a fast so I'm already primed to burn fat so it's not that it's just I do feel less energetic so and I don't know if I just am NOT a great fat burner or if I'm able to I don't use the ketones as official I don't know but by day four I'm like yeah I'm 20% off my normal like I I go go go now it's not like anybody around me notices

[01:20:06] I just know that it take I have to push my energy out more it's not just naturally there for me how does your body composition change in that five days I'll lose fat for sure how much weight do you lose almost um I'd probably I've never weighed myself I know better exciting get super myopically focused on the scale I'm gonna guess call it like three to four pounds probably that's it yeah that's interesting I lose more than that just doing a five-day FMD really so that's like the you know 750 calories a day it's a thousand the first day and then 750 for four days yeah I can lose now that said it depends on the nutritional state I enter so if I come in relatively carb fed yeah I'll lose ten pounds in five days but of course much of that is water so each gram of glycogen is carrying around four grams of water so as you if you take your glycogen stores down to 50 percent of baseline you think about how much glycogen that is plus how much water it is plus the plasma reduction it's interesting I mean I think it probably speaks to the fact that you're entering at a pretty lean state if you're only losing three or four pounds and a five-day fast yeah and

[01:21:12] I don't do I never carb load ever unless it's like Christmas and you know I have a snack or dessert or something there but you know it's so interesting people assume because of all the time I've spent in ketosis and all of the stuff I've written about it that I don't like carbs but it's like you'd be hard to find a person who likes carbs more than me I think I've never really met a carb

[01:21:30] I didn't like I just freaking love them like I can eat plain white rice like I could eat a bathtub full of plain white rice no I just I was gonna challenge you because I love me some carbs but yeah not I'm not gonna eat plain white rice I hand the crown filling and then when you do if' how often are you doing that if I'm in a ketogenic cycle I do I F the entire time so let's say I do one week protein one week keto that's pretty typical for me so and I just bounce back and forth because I find if I do too many consecutive weeks where I'm actually posting ketones in my blood that I do start to notice the softening of my muscles and so I just don't feel as hard so I tend not to stay ketogenic for long but I'll bounce back and forth so you're saying you'll go a week of ketosis which is obviously restrictive and carbohydrate and protein correct and then in your protein week do you mean you're adding both carbon protein back in or mostly just pro just protein and so on you're on protein week how many grams a day of protein are you getting so while since I counted now I just steer by my blood and how I feel I probably throw in I'll add from what I'm normally doing I'll add 40 grams of protein it's about right that's really interesting cuz that's not that much so let's say in ketosis you're walking around at a hundred grams you'd go up to a hundred and forty correct which would be enough to knock you out and do you reduce your fat intake during the off week sort of unintentionally yeah when it yeah when I'm high-protein it'll come down just because the calories are being replaced with protein and okay so yeah what I'd asked you was where does your

[01:23:05] AF fit into that Rui effing during the ketone week but not the non-key to correct correct correct because I find it so easy to intermittent fast when I'm ketogenic and I find it a little more distracting I always do like I never eat in less than a 12-hour window so but I don't consider that intermittent fasting

[01:23:24] I only consider intermittent fasting if I go all the way to 16 hours without food my average day even I don't consider it if' I eat my last meal at 6 and then I eat my first meal at 8 that's typical for me so it's at 14 hours yeah so my typical day is a 14 hour gap and then how deliberate are you about your sleep very I'm a psycho about sleep so

[01:23:45] I'm in bed by 9:00 p.m. every night like it's a religion Monday through Friday on Saturday I'm a little looser but yeah I get to bed I don't use an alarm I sleep as much as I need I wake up when I wake up it is what it is and I have been doing that now for like 16 years so that's critical I do being tired is a

[01:24:02] Niq form of misery you were worse at everything you do and so for somebody who's trying to optimize cognitively like I'm trying to get as much done as humanly possible if I don't get sleep then I'm just slower so I'm like I was better off spending the time sleeping and then just being more efficient with the time that I was awake that's a hard thing to explain to some people because you know certainly theoretically what she described makes sense but I think a lot of people say look at the end of the day if you're gonna give me four more hours to work and I'll sleep for hours instead of eight how can that be worse there's a study that was done at the

[01:24:36] University of Chicago a couple of years ago it's a pretty good study very small study but was very well controlled study they took a group of healthy volunteers and did you glycemic insulin clamps on them which is of course the gold standard for measuring glucose disposal so they did the study they are they did the usamin clamp and then they restricted their sleep to four hours a night for 14 consecutive days so basically they did for two weeks what we did in residency for five years and then they controlled what they were eating during that experiment so it the result

[01:25:06] I'm about to describe was not simply the result of that they ate more during that time but when they repeated the you glycemic clamps their glucose disposal had fallen by 50% so they became about twice as insulin resistant with getting four hours of sleep a night for just two weeks whoa this is but one study there are other studies that have looked at other elements of this and I I sort of assumed that the extra fatness I got in residency was just due to my dietary deterioration but I now believe that it was also in large part due to the lack of sleep the other thing is it's very difficult to consolidate memory with sleep deprivation the hippocampus is very sensitive to this and of course that's where we consolidate memory so

[01:25:51] I'm kind of amazed at the gaps I have in my memory from that period of my life yeah when you said that that you look back on it as one of the you know best peers of your life I thought how do you remember it like when I get that fatigue and the funny thing is I'm the same with film school it's the same thing you just no sleep dude it's ridiculous and at the end of that like the bonding is intense because all going through this hard thing you're having to help each other you're all exhausted but you find a way through it's amazing and then in the end I was like Jesus they're just patches where

[01:26:24] I'm like I don't remember man cuz you're so tired it's crazy so do you meditate do you have a practice might be retiree oh it's interesting you think of meditation as spiritual so I meditate like a fiend it totally changed my life and I don't know where I would have been in my more stressful years without it I am so grateful and for a long time because I'm a fool

[01:26:47] I didn't meditate and didn't want to didn't want to hear about it sounded so feminine like I was a guy really needed to toughen up which is weird this come up like three times in this and so yeah I just resisted it and then I met Navy SEAL named Mark Devine I don't know if you've heard of him amazing dude and he was like stop being a jackass meditate and so I went and watched his videos and

[01:27:07] I thought alright if it's you know a Navy SEAL a tough guy let me give this a shot and I was like whoa once I understood its taking me out of the sympathetic nervous system into the parasympathetic and that diaphragm breathing actually causes that trigger to happen that it's mechanistic I was like okay all of a sudden I get this this isn't woo woo this is like some hard biology and allowed me to really begin to train down because I am incredibly anxious by nature and when I was in business and constantly out of my element and learning and I was always behind I developed just massive anxiety and so I had to find a way to like figure that [ __ ] out and so meditation has been just inhumanly helpful so now if I'm like about to go on stage or something guaranteed if they're like doing the announcement I am meditating diaphragm breathing getting into a nice calm state like it is crazy to me how well it works and now like I'm an evangelical for this like I want to bite the microphone so people will listen if they have that tried meditation like it is such a game-changer such a game-changer because it gets rid of what

[01:28:11] I call the background radiation like all that just sort of residual stress now you're sure what you're stressed about you just feel uneasy something something's looming and so meditating even on my worst day I can get to absolute zero where I am totally stress and anxiety free just from breathing it's crazy do you have a mindfulness component to that in other words are you doing a breath meditation where while you are breathing you are focusing on a component of the breath or is it more a concentration thing where you have like you know sort of a mantra and the BAL breath all breath 100% I don't remember who said this it might have been Sam

[01:28:47] Harris but it might have been somebody else and I reflected on it and realized it's it's very interesting and it's quite true that if you ever consider a negatively valence to motion so the reason I throw in the word valence tis because some people get all bent out of shape when you say an emotion is positive versus negative so just so no one gets bent out of shape I'll just say negative versus positively valence none of them are really rooted in the present so depression sadness anxiety fear when you think of all of the negatively valence to emotions they are virtually all rooted in the past or in anticipation of the future and I think it was the realization of that and the desire to sort of drown out some of those things that got me very interested in mindfulness meditation which was this notion of being as present as possible and I even took it to really interesting depths of I don't think Sam made this point but somebody made this point which was even pain physical pain that we endure is actually more about the anticipation of worsening pain or progression of that pain or non cessation of that pain than it is the actual moment and I was like that can't be right so Josh is my body worker so one day josh is working on me and there's this one move he does on me that is quite literally upsetting that's when he gets into my serratus and my subscapularis and it's unbearable on many levels definitely there's some nerve impingement going on when he's getting in there he's probably like yanking on some of the hairs on my armpit or something they just the whole thing is unbearable and one day when he was doing it I was like alright try the exercise focus on your breath and focus on the pain at exactly that moment but don't think about how much it's gonna hurt in two more minutes just think about it in that moment and I was totally amazed by that experience and it was like a very interesting tool that I have since continued to experiment with any time I find myself in extreme pain especially pain that sort of lasts for a long period of time and it definitely makes me understand that there are probably people out there who can have total mind control over pain speaking of mind control I remember the first time you came over for dinner you guys came all the way down from LA down to San Diego we all had dinner and I remember you talking about mind control you were like

[01:31:17] I want you to come and work for quest because I just have mind control over you there's some [ __ ] like that so how do you think about that have you refined your thinking around mind control yeah I think that really comes down to energy output I think that you really can it's almost distressing how much you can move people in a direction you want them moved if you're willing to put in the time and the energy but you really have to play a super long game and oftentimes not worry about what's their best interest and that just does not suit my personality so I found that far better to think about like who are the people that are resonant with what

[01:31:59] I'm doing right here's what I'm doing put it out there tell people get them excited show them my excitement let them understand my vision where I'm trying to go and then go okay of these you know 20 people that I would love to do something with who's the one that steps forward and says I want to do that with you that to me is far more interesting so I used to say and this is what you're thinking about on a long enough timeline I can get anyone to do anything and I just don't even think about it like that anymore even if that's true and maybe it is like if you give me a hundred years like maybe nobody can resist you know my wily charms but it just stops being interesting it's like I want to do stuff with people that want to do it I want to do it with people that are excited about it and so yeah I take a really different approach now and my thing now is about sharing the vision here's what I'm trying to do embody the excitement's I know how infectious it is neurologically

[01:32:51] I know that it we really do share energies and if you're around somebody and you're amped up like they're gonna pick up on that they're gonna get more energetic and I just know that people like to be around people that make them feel more alive that make them feel better about themselves that feel energized so finding people like that and then I'm just really not a fan of having to be a rah-rah leader like I want to play my part in the creation of whatever we're creating as well so I would much rather do that like create the environment create the enthusiasm show people we're trying to do this and it matters and you're gonna be able to get that fulfillment that we talked about it's gonna be hard as hell but we're gonna be able to do it like I want to create that environment and then go and fight - so that's far more interesting than having to type you know Jedi Mind Tricks and [ __ ] and like trying to really understand what you want and make sure

[01:33:38] I'm setting things up so that you're getting that I'm always just thinking about you man far better to say this is the environment this is what we're doing who wants in but I'm sad that you never came to work request I did really want that bad I did yeah like I know people are listening to this podcast right now because they believe in you but I'm just saying that belief is well-placed you are one of the most intriguing human beings I have ever met the way your mind works I almost stopped you earlier cuz you were saying something is so [ __ ] interesting that I was like just the way you think through a problem captures my imagination so they're just some people dude I have a total man crush on your brain it's amazing well I appreciate that very much
