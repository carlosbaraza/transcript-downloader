## Description

Original release date: 2/24/20

In this episode, Mark Hyman, M.D., director of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine and the author of Food Fix, discusses that if we can fix the food system, we can solve many big problems—namely the chronic disease/obesity epidemic, the rising costs of healthcare, as well as the big problems facing the environment. Mark first briefly lays out the health consequences of processed food with a focus on the gut microbiome. From there, Mark discusses the environmental consequences of industrial farming and lays out how we can affect change on the individual level, through policy and regulations, and perhaps most importantly through regenerative agriculture. Additionally, Mark talks about the potential health risks of consuming GMO foods, herbicides, and other chemicals used in industrial farming as well as the environmental consequences, such as the loss of soil, caused by those same fertilizers and methods of farming.

We discuss:
-The negative consequences of the existing food environment [3:25];
-What makes processed food so unhealthy? [9:00];
-The gut microbiome: Inflammation from gut permeability, and how to measure gut health [18:30];
-Steps to fixing a bad gut—The Five R’s [24:30];
-Some staggering health statistics, and which races might be more genetically susceptible [27:15];
-An argument for government regulations and policies to fight back against a massive food industry with unlimited resources (and what we can learn from the tobacco story) [29:00];
-Industrial farming and climate change: The degradation of soil and use of fertilizer [41:45];
-Regenerative agriculture: Could it be the answer to food waste, our health problems, and the environment? [51:45];
-Comparing the “Impossible Burger” to regeneratively raised beef [1:06:00];
-GMO and Roundup—The potential health risks of consuming GMO foods sprayed with Roundup (glyphosate) and other herbicides and pesticides [1:08:15];
-How the livelihood of farmers are being affected by big ag companies and the current industrial farming system [1:16:30];
-The loss of biodiversity in our food, and what “organic” really means [1:19:00];
-What can people do on the individual level to protect themselves as well as affect change to the toxic food system? [1:25:00];
-What role does the USDA play in this “toxic” food environment? And how do we fix it? [1:30:15];
-The top 3 changes Mark would make if he was “food czar” [1:35:15];
-Mark’s rebuttal against the argument that it’s best for the environment if stop farming animals and move to a fully plant-based diet (and his argument for “agriculture 2.0) [1:36:30];
-What is Mark’s overall mission with the work that he’s doing? [1:40:30];
-Bread in the US vs. Europe: Why does bread (and wheat products) taste different and potentially cause less health problems in Europe versus the US? [1:42:00]; and
-More.

Mark Hyman mark is a family physician a New York Times best selling author and the director of the Cleveland

[00:00:58] Clinic Center for functional medicine it turns out we're going to talk about pretty much none of that today we talk almost exclusively on his new book which is due out tomorrow called food fix how to save our health our economy our communities and our planet one bite at a time and if that sounds like a mouthful it's because it is a mouthful this is a kind of staggering topic and even by the standards of this podcast it's probably too much for one episode mark basically lays out a thesis that if you fix the food system you fix a lot of problems so it's not a one for it's not a twofer it's like somewhere between a 3 4 and a 4 4 we don't spend a lot of time talking about the health consequences of fixing food although we open our discussion with that talking about the health impact of food we talked a little bit about gut health but we spend more of our time probably speaking about some of the social consequences and the environmental consequences and of course it ultimately does come down to health at the individual level we do get a lot into agriculture energy usage around food we talk a lot about the impact on climate we also talked quite a lot about gee oh the strength of the evidence for and against it we go through a lot of the policy ideas around how one might fix the food system and actually we close with a nice anecdote of an explanation that I thought mark provided that was pretty interesting around the difference between food in Europe and North America many people myself included have commented on this which is why is it that when you go to Europe you seem to be able to eat with impunity things that in the United States just feel like they're about to kill you anyway this is a really interesting episode I learned a lot in kind of preparing for it and truthfully I still feel like there's a lot I just don't understand in this system there's probably a lot I need to go back and get smarter on there are so many big numbers in this type of a discussion that the scale sort of doesn't make sense at times when you start to think about what it means to feed the world and how making changes in that system can have enormous knock-on effects for both good and bad so without further delay please enjoy my discussion with Mark Hyman and we may end up revisiting this topic with other guests should people find this interesting mark thanks for coming over man no I'm so happy to be here it's beautiful chickens running around everything then is it in the freezer my kind of place yeah yeah it's in keeping with a lot of what we're going to talk about today I think mark a lot of people would associate you with other topics that we might get into functional medicine the role of toxins in the environment certainly food but from the standpoint of health what to eat but what we're talking about today is actually something that when you first mentioned to me you were working on this book actually at the time you were putting the finishing touches on it about a year ago I was like wow that's definitely something I want to understand more so I can't wait to kind of have this discussion with you today and that is basically how food is made how food is delivered and how food is consumed and what the impacts of that are I mean what made you decide to tackle a problem of this magnitude which is not just a scientific problem but it's a political problem modally it's a religious problem if we're gonna be brutally honest I mean the nutrition religion yes exactly and so it's about as complicated as a topic as one would go after it is and I think as a doctor seeing patients day after day for 30 years is a functional medicine doctor my focus is on why why are my patients so sick and not always but the majority of them it has some relationship to food and then it began to wonder while I could sit here all day bailing the bucket and the boat with a hole in it but I have to figure out why they're eating the food they're eating and then you're gonna think about it and go upstream and well food they're eating is caused by the food system I'm like well why do we have the food system we have well our food policies and I'm like why do we have our food policies it's the food industry that influences our government policies through lobbying and other other influences that they do across the spectrum of society to drive their products to the market and sell them which are predominately killing us

[00:05:22] I mean there's 11 million people that die every year from eating ultra processed food and not enough for the good food and I think it's an underestimate so basically answer your questions I realized I couldn't treat my patients in my office or in the hospital the clinic I had to go to where the source the problem was yeah yeah and I want to sort of put this in context which is the evolution of this the domestication of crops the institutionalization of

[00:05:47] Agriculture has for we're gonna demonize it a little bit here but the reality but it's been kind of a remarkable transformation it would certainly be akin to the printing press when you think about step function changes in our civilization when we went from hunter-gatherers to an agricultural society so I want to be careful that we're not just sort of saying the answer is agriculture is know the end of it the agriculture is a solution if we do it right yeah so let's start with what you see as the sort of main pillars of the problem how did we get to a point where the food environment is toxic because that's effectively what you're saying right is if you eat undie fault you're gonna probably eat the wrong things yeah it goes deeper than that the food system as a whole is I began to dig in this rabbit hole I realize it was just causing chronic disease but it was causing most of the global crises that were thinking about in silos that are all connected and I just so quickly lay them out and be good to go over them in detail as we go through the podcast but clearly food is the biggest driver of chronic disease affecting six out of ten people it's clearly the biggest driver of economic stress in this country in our 22 trillion dollar debt one-third of all Medicare expenses over diabetes alone and one-third of all of our federal budget is Medicare if it was a company it would be the biggest company in the world at a trillion dollars annually it's also driving climate change a food system end to end and one packet is the number one cause of climate change more than fossil fuels it's causing massive environmental degradation including loss of biodiversity plant species animal species livestock species it's driving social injustice in many ways through how it affects our kids cognitive development and ability to learn and there's huge academic achievement gaps it leads to massive health disparities because poor communities are more affected by these foods and are more targeted by them and effects even behavior violence conflict we see such a divisive society today why do we have that forty years ago wasn't like that and I think our diet has changed so radically not just in the last ten thousand years but in last forty years with the advent of massive amounts of ultra processed food and that's driving cognitive behavioral issues violence suicide conflict and even threatens our national security because 70% of military recruits are unfit to fight and are rejected so we've got these global problems that are affecting us and of course that leads to massive political instability because of our food system of climate refugees because the food system is driving climate what is that going to do I mean think about it we had a million Syrian refugees and that created a global crisis the UN estimates that within a decade or three decades we're gonna have 200 to a billion climate refugees that's unimaginable so how do we begin to sort of grapple with these problems and think about the solutions and the beauty is since they're all connected by food they can all be solved by going to the root and fixing our food system and that's the leverage we have which is so exciting to me because it's not oh doom and gloom the world's ending it's yeah we identify the problem how it's connected think of it as a system and then be able to solve the problem by going to the root and dealing with these issues collectively so which one of those would you like to start with would you like to start with sort of the impact of processed food on health which is probably not one that we need to spend a lot of time on I don't think there's many people that would debate that are there it's I mean there's 12 billion dollars spent by the food industry on nutrition quote research that confuses people's muddies the waters declares that Gatorade is great sports drink and that sugar doesn't cause obesity and that I mean I could go on and on people are confused and it's certainly our political leaders certainly don't get this and I think when you think of our health care system it certainly doesn't get that food is medicine do you really think that political leaders I know you've spent some time interacting with said folks do you really think they don't get it or do you think that they're just in a difficult position which is how do you appease all of these constituents on the one hand a lot of the bills get paid by the entities that endorse these agendas and on the other end they probably have empathy for the damage that's done I mean do you actually think there's a lack of a way I do I mean we forget about politicians academics doctors health professionals have no clue how powerful food is to heal disease I mean they get that if you eat too much you're gonna get fat right but that's about it or have you too much cards maybe now maybe I'll get diabetes but not even that I mean the American

[00:10:16] Diabetes Association is still telling people to eat a lot of carbohydrates I think we have a real lack of understanding of the power of food to cause disease and the power food to cure disease and so there's a real gap in that I think it's starting to become in the public awareness that food is medicine that there's a food as medicine working group in Congress Cleveland

[00:10:37] Clinic where I work now as a food as medicine initiative there's hospitals around the country they're talking about this it's more the exception than the rule so I do think people don't understand the magnitude I mean if you say to a politician what is the biggest killer on the planet they're gonna go smoking or lack of exercise or maybe they're gonna get this being overweight but they don't get that it's the ultra processed food that kills more people than smoking violence Wars everything else so I mean I think if there was a disease like Ebola or Zika that was killing 11 million a year I mean people would be talking about it and it's just not in the conversation that's happening even for example Medicare Medicare for all has anybody said the reason we have so the trouble with Medicare is because people are eating bad food and that we need to fix the food there know saying let's get

[00:11:22] Medicare for all let's repeal Obamacare I mean those aren't the solutions it's like that would be a disaster if we had Medicare for all because everybody's sick and it's gonna bankrupt the country unless we fix why they're sick in the first place what do you think it is about processed foods that are particularly difficult metabolically for our species historically we ate eight hundred different species of plants a lot of roots and tubers 100 grams of fiber a day now on the average American eats about eight grams it's nothing and we had you know a very complex diet which was very difficult to obtain sugar you got lucky if you found a honey thing

[00:11:56] I mean I remember this reading this article about these Nepalese honey hunters or they have to climb up 100 feet in the trees with a burning bush and scales like if you had to climb a tree with a burning bush to get a cookie you probably wouldn't eat something and I think it's just become so easy for us to have this abundance of sugar and flour and refined foods and but good intentions that were there in the post-war period that led to the development of industrial agriculture were to provide a lot of starchy abundant calories to feed the hungry and solve real hunger issues around the world and I think that was a good thing but there was unintended consequences of the intensive chemical agriculture that we're using intensive fertilizer use and the commodity products which are wheat corn soy and rice in some other areas of the world that are driving this obesity epidemic so our biology isn't adapted to eating highly refined foods which essentially is most of what we're eating now it's 60% of our calories and every 10 percent of your calories that's ultra processed food your risk of death goes up by 14 percent so it's not it's not something every body's alike it's not something you're adapting to and then of course there's all the other stuff in there that maybe problematically refined soybean oil or food additives or chemicals that are in our food that have all sorts of metabolic consequences like

[00:13:09] BPA or other metabolic toxins that are consumed within the food we're eating so it's complicated is sugar and starch and flour the big drivers but there's all these other components and then who knows what's happening with pestis glyphosate affecting our microbiome I mean it's such a complex web of different factors that alter our metabolic pathways that drives disease and just kind of digging into this a little bit more how much of it do you think is the energy balance and the dysregulation of energy balance that comes from these processed foods so there are certainly people out there that would argue that part of the trouble with processed food is it sort of hijacks our energy homeostatic systems so if you put a human in an environment akin to what our ancestors evolved in there was enough Auto feedback and regulation that you sort of maintained energy balance you would eat more when you needed to eat more you would eat less when you needed to eat less one of the drawbacks of processed food if not the biggest drawback is it sort of hijacks that system and if you cut the feed back out of that loop they're eating when they don't really need additional energy do you think that's the biggest issue or do you think it's the void of nutrient that then creates sort of an abundance of junk calorie as the body search for nutrients do you think it's this loss of fiber

[00:14:24] Notley both I mean kids who are iron deficient eat dirt it's called pica and it's well known if you're looking for nutrients there's gonna eat anything so I that may be part of it I think the main part of it is then you've talked about the salaat is the ways in which these refined starches and sugars affect your biology they raise insulin which has a cascading effect of fat storage in your belly which is a dangerous fat it leads to increased hunger affects your brain chemistry it actually locks the fat in the fat cells so that can't get out so that gets like a one-way turnstile that gets in but can't get out and it slows your metabolism so you're in this cascade of vicious cycles so you talk about energy balance anything most people they hear that think about calories and calories out I think you know I both understand that it's more complex than that that there's different effects of food on your biology independent of calories in a lab all calories are the same seven hundreds of coke fifty calories of coke is the same as 750 calories of broccoli but to get 750 calories of soda you'd have a big gulp which is 46 teaspoons of sugar and 750 calories of broccoli is 21 cups of broccoli with 35 grams of fiber and no sugar profoundly different effects on your biology same calories but we don't really appreciate that medicine and most of our current thing in my weight loss is focused on calories and calories out it suits the food industry because they go well it's all about moderation there's no good or bad calories it's exercise more eat less like that's their mantra and it serves them to sell more their junk food as long as it's part of a balanced diet but the truth is that these foods affect our brain chemistry and create all sorts of metabolic issues that are incredibly difficult I was chatting with my friend David Perlmutter who just wrote a book called brainwash where he's talking about he's a neurologist Werth the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala are uncoupled with an inflammatory diet which is what we're eating most of us in America and around the world what that means is that the adults in the room the prefrontal cortex which is the decision-maker that understands the consequences of its behavior is not talking to the impulse part of your brain the the fight-or-flight part of your brain the pleasure-seeking party brain so there's this disconnection and your decisions are not in your best interest and that's why we have so much bad behavior and conflict and so forth because we're eating this inflammatory diet that's literally just regulating our brain so the adults in the room is asleep say a bit more about that what is it about the diet that could be inflammatory and how could one measure the consequence of that because is it possible that two people could consume the exact same subpar diet and have very different inflammatory responses yeah sure I mean there is a listen if people are eating junk food and processed food their metabolism whatever they look like whether they're overweight or not it's not going to be as good as someone who's eating a Whole Foods unprocessed diet but there is a lot of genetic variability but you can actually measure inflammation in response to diet through various biomarkers there's there's new panels of sort of looking at the inflammasome which is really cool it's more than just a CRP or sed rate which are blood tests you can do to look at inflammation and the ways in which it caused it particularly was talking on insulin it also drives this visceral belly fat which is a basically metabolic fire that starts in these cells and it spreads inflammation throughout the body so just the nature of eating sugar and processed food drives up inflammation if a patient has normal biomarkers through the lens of all of those things there interleukins and c-reactive protein fibrinogen if all of those things were normal would you still think that there's potentially an inflammatory response that's coming through their diet the question is how sensitive of our our current tools for assessing the immune response to food and I think they're pretty crappy and I think there's more and more lab diagnostic measures that are coming about that are gonna help us look at that I was talking to someone from the buck Institute of Aging last week and he said yeah there's a whole new panel of inflammatory biomarkers that are much more specific and much more sensitive and enable us to really look at the inflammatory response that's happening the body related to aging or diet or anything else how much of that inflammatory response do you think is mediated by permeability and the gut specifically versus because I have to be honest with you mark this is an area that I've never understood it gets talked about a lot there's lots of hand waving sometimes I see it certainly in patients I mean when we see subtle elevations in fibrinogen and/or c-reactive protein or at least two of the interleukins we usually put patients on elimination diets till we find out what the culprit was and we're trying to basically titrate symptoms versus these biomarkers but I find that to be staggeringly crude and to your point I don't know what we're missing and I don't know what's true true and unrelated and then of course it gets back to the question of what's the mechanism of this and so one potential mechanism is that the permeability of the gut is altered and if bacteria that could normally not translocate across the lining of the gut do so that would certainly be a reason for inflammation hey do you think that that's a prevalent huge I mean our guts are messed up and there's a whole phenomenon called metabolic endotoxin has been well described and studied and the fact that your gut microbiome plays a huge role in regulation of weight independent of calories so they literally can take the poop out of a skinny rat into a fat rat and make them skinny and vice versa they've done in humans I think the way in which it works is that your microbiome is regulated by what you eat out of fiber prebiotics the phytonutrients the phytochemicals the polyphenols all affect the quality of the garden you have growing inside of you and you can get a lot of nasty weeds in there when that starts to happen they start to disrupt the gut microbiome they disrupt the lining of the gut they cause what we call leaky gut on top of everything else which is our low fiber diet high sugar processed food increases bad bugs in the gut antibiotics acid blockers and inflammatory drugs hormones all screw up our gut and of course toxins environmental toxins glyphosate is super toxic to the microbiome and so all these things that we know and those things we don't know are disrupting the microbiome and when that happens the lining of the gut becomes slightly damaged the biofilms get disrupted and you end up absorbing bacterial products spectral toxins as well as food antigens things that we should normally tolerate and start to create an inflammatory response and 60% of your immune system is in your gut and you know what's really striking to me Peter is in a sort of the discovery that many of our metabolites in our blood probably a third or more maybe from microbiome in other words when you check your blood test for checking human analytes but when you actually start to do some more sophisticated metabolic testing and metabolomic you find all these things that aren't human they come from bacteria that are regulating your immune system that are activating your your mitochondria that are regulating your DNA that affecting your brain chemistry affecting your mood affecting all sorts of diseases so this is like a really exciting area and I think getting people's microbiome sorted often happens when you shift to a whole foods plant rich diet not plant base but plant rich how can one measure these things I mean one of the things that I've found difficult is finding valid commercial tests that can enable patients or physicians to understand if they're in this sort of regulated state I mean I to me the black box is when someone comes in and says I have got dysbiosis or I have poor gut health and they may be right but it's very different than someone who says I have type 2 diabetes where we have really clear ways to diagnose it we kind of have some understanding what the pathophysiology is here this is much more squishy and frankly there's an enormous disconnect between people like you and sort of the stuffy upper lipped gastroenterologist who makes his or her living in the gut but doesn't necessarily sort of see the problem this way right they're looking at different problems you know honestly Peter the evidence has become so overwhelming that mainstream medicine is bought into this little microbiome story and Cleveland

[00:22:39] Clinic for example they're sitting with microbiome and heart disease and arthritis and cancer and it's like they just got a twelve million dollar grant from the NIH to study the microbiome and heart disease which is pretty amazing and yet and yet if you go to your doctor and say is there any evidence that I should be on this probiotic or yeah I don't know the clinical translation is challenging so I'm somebody who's been practicing motion medicine for thirty years and the gut has been the number one focus of our ability to really move diseases in a powerful way and needs to call me dr. C every poop because I've done literally tens of thousands of stool tests and looked at all the different ones and you're looking at a moving target you're looking at an ecosystem and so we look at a lot of different biomarkers to assess what's going on in the gut is there adequate pancreatic enzyme function looking at pancreatic last days are their absorption issues looking at fecal fats are there inflammatory markers in there for example calprotectin aureus and of a protein X which are standard markers to look at inflammation in the gut what's your I G a levels or anybody levels and then we look at indicators of dysregulated gut microbiome such as short chain fatty acids which are essentially produced by good bacteria that are the fuel for the gut and have anti-cancer properties anti-inflammatory properties and those can be low like butyrate and we can see that then we look at sort of different microbiome characteristics using DNA or PCR analysis through the micro RNAs and that allows us to see for example if there's low lacquer Mencia which is a very important bacteria that regulates your biofilm the regulates immunity that's linked to autoimmune disease and cardiometabolic diseases cancer treatment therapy risk so we can modify those things and then we look at culture we look at other kinds of testing for parasites it's PCR testing so there's a lot of things we look at and get a gestalt it changed over time but you can see if someone's got a good good or okay good or a terrible gut so if you take a patient who is both symptomatic and by some consolation of tests has a quote unquote bad gut what percentage of those are quote unquote fixable by subtraction so you take things out of their diet or addition you add more of certain food to their diet or the third choice would be intervention based where you have to use sort of supplements and yeah antibiotics or probiotics or things like that so that's an oversimplified look at this but if there's three levers you have which means take something out of their food add something to their food or add a different type of food or then use a bigger gun like a supplement how do those tools fit into this treatment well if function medicine is a very organized framework for addressing gut dysfunction called the five hour program the first R is to remove remove things that shouldn't be there whether it's foods that are triggering a problem like gluten which affects permeability or dairy grains for some people remove bad bugs so if you have a parasite I mean I just had a patient who had a common parasite she had stomach issues for twenty years she was always waking up feeling like crap I gave her Alinea which is an anti-parasitic medication six days she says she's never felt better so sometimes just need to do that and maybe bacterial overgrowth you have maybe there's yeast overgrowth you need to address that and so that's the first step the second step is to replace what might be missing so fiber prebiotics enzymes various things that may be needed to support the system and sometimes that's just through food but sometimes that's also supplements you can take prebiotic fibers and prebiotic foods like plantain and artichokes and all kinds of different foods and then reenact you late which would be provide probiotics where necessary and that can be through foods like fermented foods or can be through probiotic supplements and those are that's still sort of a Wild

[00:26:26] West but there are things that up there that really work and then to replace what's missing so maybe there's nutrients that the body needs to heal things like glutamine vitamin A fish oil maybe even things like butyrate and replace things that might be needed for healing they got like polyphenols are a wonderful thing you can get from food pomegranate cranberries green tea etc and a powerful great effects on the microbiome that we didn't really appreciate so we saw this prebiotics and probiotics it turns out the polyphenols in plant foods are super helpful for the gut microbiome and then the last R is to restore which means to sort of restore your nervous system because you need to sort of deal with the way in which your stress level and everything affects your gut and your gut microbiome you can get a leaky gut just from stress for example so working on all those in a systematic way that's personalized is really the approach there's no sort of Oh take this or do that it's gonna work so bringing it back to what you started this point yeah we got down the rabbit hole well it's such an interesting topic you've laid out basically the enormous health consequences of eating poop 6 out of 10

[00:27:28] Americans have a chronic disease 4 out of 10 have two or more and 10-years 83 million Americans about three or more which is bankrupting our country and one in two Americans has pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes the statistics are staggering 75% of us are overweight most states now have 40% obesity rates I mean when I graduate school there wasn't a single state that had a 20% obesity rate now everybody's got 30 or almost 40 these are massive things that are happening at a scale we've never seen in history that we haven't been equipped to deal with that we haven't Lee thought of how to address and is like we're trying to scramble it fix it and you certainly in the book talked about how there are racial differences in terms of the susceptibility to the bad policy which we'll get to down the line is there also sort of racial variability and discrepancy in the actual physiology and response to this there's clearly economic health disparities there's health disparities or results of targeted marketing from the food industry that are driving various problems or obviously the food swamps and the food deserts and food apart that all that is true but genetically there's certain segments of the population that are much more likely when they are in an abundance of sugar and flour to get diabetes and obesity and that includes

[00:28:43] Native Americans probably the worst african-americans Latinos and of course the people from the South Pacific and even Indians from India try and Asians oftener much higher risk even at lower body rates so this is really a global problem and that's why we're seeing 80% of the world's type 2 diabetics in the developing world is there any country or government in particular that seems more attuned to this problem than the American government many in fact most Chile for example was seeing massive obesity rates and kids and adults health care cost staggering for that country and again we're inundated by all the processed food from the food industry and soda industry and it took a doctor who was elected to the Senate who was vice president Senate and a doctor who was elected president Michelle Bachelet was a pediatrician to stand up and say enough and put in a set of regulations to try to stop the onslaught of these conditions on their population driven by the food industry so they did a number of things one they put in an 80% soda tax - they put on warning labels on the front of bad food so when you're frosted like cereal box there's black warning labels they eliminated any cartoon characters from all the kids food so no

[00:30:03] Tony the Tiger no - can't say I'm on Froot Loops they eliminate any prizes from schools and they made the school lunches healthy they eliminate any advertising on junk food from 6:00 in the morning all 10:00 at night so the kids wouldn't see it and then they measured these outcomes based on that and they seen tremendous improvements and it was surprising to me I talked to

[00:30:23] Barry Popkin who's from UNC who worked with them on developing these and they're Michael Bloomberg I think gave him 30 million dollars to assess the impact and so forth so they're studying this and even more than 80% so detects the restriction of food marketing and the warning label and so forth had a four-fold increased benefit compared to the soda tax which is being heavily fought here there's incredible opposition to any limiting of marketing to kids and you know the saying it's the breach of the First Amendment and free speech and so forth the First Amendment doesn't abdicate our responsibility to protect our children if a foreign nation was doing to our kids what the food industry is and our government is to his policies you know we'd go to war to protect our kids and we just sort of sit back and let this happen it's interesting not a constitutional expert which would be such an overstatement I know nothing about the constants the Constitution I know my understanding of the First

[00:31:18] Amendment is provided the advertising is quote-unquote honest it is constitutional is that is that yeah and that's a gray area because yes what cut if you say fruit loops are part of a healthy breakfast how do we know that's honest I can't help but think about the analogous situation which is tobacco and what I think most people don't know and it's possible I'm wrong but I believe everything about to say is correct because at one point I knew this story well when the Surgeon General came out with his declaration of the harm of tobacco which was in about the mid 60s and that was the peak of smoking in the

[00:31:54] United States I believe something to the tune of 50 55 percent of people over the age of 18 smoked cigarettes at the time the Surgeon General came out and said definitively cigarettes are causing lung cancer a number of things took place that got us to where we are today which is somewhere below 20 percent of people last time I looked it was about 18 percent of adults smoked yeah a lawsuit is what worked well they here's here's a big one a big one was the removal of advertising mm-hmm but here's the part that I was surprised to learn it was voluntary on the part of tobacco in other words the tobacco industry was not banned from advertising what the policy makers said is the law is now that every time a tobacco commercial airs it must be followed by an anti tobacco commercial so they didn't ban tobacco they added and every time you have a

[00:32:48] McDonald's commercial you say how bad the food is it's gonna kill you right I think what's interesting is the anti tobacco ads were so devastating that the tobacco industry voluntarily withdrew its ads they were getting hurt so bad by the anti tobacco ads that they said enough is enough and that's to this day we don't have tobacco ads on television so eh someone needs to fact-check that to make sure I have that story correct but I believe it is correct and secondly if it is it at least suggest another angle to this problem which is rather than go down the first amendment fight maybe great okay I love that idea keep all the commercials you want on but we're gonna come up with something different now of course it's like it's like a drug ad you can eat this soda but it's gonna cause obesity diabetes cancer dementia and kill you early fine that's a good idea yeah and of course tobacco is the easiest thing to demonize because you just show somebody a hole in their throat after they've had throat cancer or a black lung or a corpse I mean there's so many grotesque ways that you can make the point that are more difficult with food when it's cigarette yeah but nevertheless I've always found that to be a very powerful point because it's true that eventually taxes were introduced into tobacco and they turned out to be quite powerful and additional measures in 1989 was also a big step when second-hand smoking became well enough understood that they banned tobacco in airplanes and things like that but I wonder how much of a playbook there is there on tobacco to copy well there is but guess what the food industry is copying tobacco's playbook to slow or stall or stop this and one of the most egregious things was something they've picked up recently which is from the tobacco playbook there have been soda taxes that passed predominately in the 2016 election in California and other states and the soda industry has to be at me and opposed to this the past in California they they spent about thirty eight million dollars avoiding these taxes against these taxes that

[00:34:51] Bloomberg and the Arnold Foundation spent about 20 million and it didn't pass I mean it did taxes did pass and that freaked out the soda company so the American Beverage Association essentially went and tried subversive tactics so they went to California where the most least tax were passed and they put in a ballot measure which was designed to prohibit local taxes unless it was a two-thirds majority meaning you couldn't fund your school your police department your fire department your clean up road clean up unless was a two-thirds majority that would hamper local governments dramatically and they spent millions of dollars pushing this ballot measure even though

[00:35:30] I had nothing to do with food and at the last minute before the election they went to Governor Brown who's probably the most liberal governor in the history United States governor Moonbeam and they said look we'll pull this measure but you have to put in place a pre-emptive law that prohibits any future taxes on soda or junk food and it happened all behind closed doors completely co-opted the government and pressuring them to do something that they didn't want to do and they're doing this in state after state after state and this is exactly what tobacco did so we can say oh they're not bad actors or trying to do things that good they're making water they're making low sugar beverages they know exactly what they're doing they don't have an existential threat and they're trying to fight it in every way possible that's just one example there's another funny example which is an initiative called the global energy balance Network gern or something like this really on a hot O'Connor I believe played a pretty important role at the

[00:36:26] New York Times exposing this for what the Sham it was do you want to tell people a little bit about the global energy balance Network so the whole idea of this is that energy balance is the mantra of the food industry and what that means is all calories are the same so two calories broccoli calories no difference so it's just a matter of balance calories and calories out moderation etc etc and so they essentially Rona Applebaum who was one of the top bps at coca-cola put together a strategy because she saw the vilification of soda and all these horrible out cries against sugar that were unmet by enough aggressive force from the sugar industry in the soda industry and she said look what start to something called the global energy balance Network she found a bunch of scientists who she could co-op paid them lots of money funded the research to actually promote the idea that all calories the same like James Hill for example who was part of an NH study legitimate scientist but completely co-opted and they funded about 20 million and they built the website they organized this messaging and the talking points and they did it all sort of behind the scenes and when there was discovery and so a FOIA Freedom of

[00:37:31] Information Act was a public university we got all the data it was really clear how they were behind he's manipulating all this to fund totally millions of dollars of corrupt research to prove their point and tell a different story and as soon as the New York Times article came out overnight it was disbanded saying it's run out of resources I mean come on coca-cola has what billions America itself is it's chaos over here no plenty of resources and and all think laps because of st8 of journalism but it just goes to show how these food companies are co-opting scientists co-opting professional associations co-opting social groups co-opting the government putting forth front groups and spinning all kinds of misinformation in a very coordinated strategic strategy to disrupt public opinion to confuse the public and to allow their shenanigans to keep going is the opposition to this industry that you can't fight this at the individual level in other words it has to be solved structurally because of the economic disparity and let me ask the question another way why not focus all of the efforts on helping people understand so they can make the informed choice which is if you have to have a coke make it a diet coke that may not be as good either yeah but using that as an example right but in other words do we really believe that this has to be solved at the level that seems almost unwinnable which is fighting an unethical opponent with infinite resources I mean that's a very dangerous combination yeah we're gonna happen in tobacco I mean think about this country but you don't need tobacco to live right the advantage that you would have as an anti tobacco crusade person is the ground is not muddied by the notion that tobacco is part of a group called food that you need to live although it depends how you define food our fruit loops food I don't think so I mean they're a highly industrialized processed product that but they still fit into this bucket of things and therefore they sort of they ride a little bit of the coattails of they're still riding on the hey we're putting B vitamins in these things and they're fortified and that that that that they'll this other sort of nonsense so you're asking is do we need just a grassroots effort to focus on individual choice in action or we need a public policy change well and

[00:39:52] I wouldn't even ask it as either/or because the obvious answer to that would be you could do both I guess what I'm getting at is would you be better off putting more effort into sort of the grassroots campaign it's complicated when you think of the big changes that happened in policy in this country the abolition I mean they were a few people running people on the Underground

[00:40:11] Railroad and pushing for abolition back in their early 1800s and it took decades and decades for change but eventually our entire agricultural and economic system collapse that was founded on slavery and it was reimagined and rebuilt and I think look at women's rights same thing gay rights civil rights all those things are are things that were really starting on the periphery through grassroots movements but had to push Congress to make different laws and I think that's what has to happen but I think we have to be smart about it as well I mean yes consumers make a difference that's why we're seeing General Mills commit a million acres to regenitive AG it's why we're seeing big companies like Nestle reformulating their products and why there's sustainable regenerate initiatives it Danone I mean these companies are starting to see that the consumers want different things and they're starting to ship their product lines starting to shift their focus on how their supply chain works and where they get and source their products to regenerative agriculture so I do believe that the individual has a huge impact through their vote with what they're eating their fork with their wallet and of course even with your vote and their voice and I think we don't use a ladder enough that has to all happen I and unfortunately I do believe that individual choice matters yes we can all have compost piles we can have community gardens we can have a garden in our backyard we can choose to eat we generally meat we can be like you Peter and go hunting our wild deer I mean I'm like I'm jealous but that alone is not enough because there are structural problems that are not solvable unless we change how we grow food what we grow how we process distribute market sell eat and waste it and if we don't deal with every aspect along that food chain we're really not gonna solve this problem and

[00:41:51] I we haven't really talked about it yet but things like climate change are an increasingly important part of the conversation about food and that is something that's just not in the radar like how fixing food fix climate it does it's actually one of the only ways to really reverse climate change let's talk about that some people don't think climate change is real they call it weather I mean whatever you call it there's stuff happening we're having a million acres flooded in the Midwest cropland that's destroying farmers livelihood we're seeing increasing weather patterns of hurricanes and wildfires in Australia in

[00:42:23] California we're seeing melting of three trillion tons of ice from the Antarctica these are just undeniable facts you can I give you my two cents of yeah I think the term climate change global warming were sort of in retrospect not the best ways to describe this phenomenon and climate volatility would have been a better way to have explained it because one it's actually more accurate and two it provides a better explanation for what you're describing because when you say global warming is a problem well then how do you explain a record cold year it's the high highs the low lows and the frequency with which they're cycling both through you know hurricanes fires things like that so I wish we could have gone back in time and said look there's the problem is climate volatility and stability 20-19 was the hottest year on record other than 2016 in human history so it all this can feel we know it and I think so the question is why is it happening and what's the cause of it and clearly most people think it's fossil fuels and picking up all the carbon that was stored in the Earth's crust and burning it and releasing that carbon through fossil fuels and that's a big part of it maybe a third but half of it comes from our food system through all sorts of different mechanisms one deforestation you lose the carbon capture from the trees the soil destruction from destructive agriculture which we have which essentially is a method of industrial growing of food that tills the soil which disrupts the normal organic matter causes soil erosion releases carbon the environment heat also when you look at the soil is an issue itself it's probably the biggest cause and the biggest solution to fixing climate change and most people don't think about that I think about oil not soil but a third to 40 percent of all the carbon in the atmosphere today that's causing climate volatility is from a loss of soil that's a staggering amount so explain how that's the case yeah well the soil when it's alive and has living matter and carbon in the soil organic matter which is carbon it can hold three times the amount of carbon that's in the atmosphere today which is a trillion tons of carbon it can hold three trillion tons the UN estimated that if we take two million of the five million degraded hectares of land around the world and we intensively use regenerative agriculture which I'll explain in a minute and restore the soil we could stop climate change and delay the progression for about twenty years and it would cost three hundred billion dollars which is essentially what we pay every year for diabetes in America through Medicare and it's basically the amount of budget for the total global military spend for just two months or sixty days so this is a solvable problem and the reason that the soil is such an issue is that it basically takes when the grasses are on there and the plants are on there it sucks the carbon out of the environment can you explain that it between soil and dirt yes soil is alive soil has all kinds of bugs in it mycorrhizal fungi it has all kinds of bacteria it has all kinds of carbon in it from the plants and it holds a huge amount of water can hold for example for every 1% organic matter can hold 27,000 gallons of water which would prevent floods and droughts which it does and creates more resilient farms explain that again when you have soil it's like a sponge so when it rains instead of the rain running off or running through gets stored like a sponge in the soil so that you don't need to irrigate that you don't to worry about floods and droughts now the reason we had so much of these floods and these flooded farm fields in the Midwest was because these soils are just dead and the if there was be more and more fertilizer so we're killing the soil by using fertilizer by pesticides herbicides tilling not using cover crops not using crop rotations not using animals in an integrated way to actually create more soil and everything we're doing is just destroying the soil when you have a live soil when you have the ability of these plants to suck out carbon dioxide because they breathe carbon dioxide that's what plants do they breathe out oxygen which we breathe and it's a vicious I mean a beautiful virtuous cycle the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere gets pulled through the plants into the soil and stays there and you can build soil simply by using this technology and integrating animals that poop and pee so

[00:46:39] I don't think I was aware of that I'll put my ignorance on full display I always assumed that the majority of the carbon that came in that the plant brought in through the photocell was for carbon fixation which was creating bio matters so in other words carbon and oxygen are coming in the form of carbon dioxide that carbon is being fixated to other carbons that's how we make hydrocarbons within the plan yes carbohydrates that's right and then and then the oxygen is being released but I didn't realize that there was any carbon dioxide stored in soil yeah and if you look at the mechanism is it goes into the plant but it also goes into the roots and so you've got this incredible root system and you've got micro aysil fungi that are I see so you're just saying the hydrocarbon within the roots of the plant yeah is the storage yeah but not in the soil per se not in the actual dirt and back well no no then it gets eaten by the bacteria eaten by this massive micro Raizel fungi and it creates a lot of necrotic dead but like actually organic matter it's an incredibly rich living organism and dirt is just dead dirt doesn't hold water it doesn't have much carbon in it it doesn't have much nutrients and in order actually to extract the nutrients from the plants you have to have organic matter which allows us and bacteria and all these mike rizzo fungi which make the nutrients in the soil available to the plant and since we are growing food in dirt we see 50% less nutrient density of even healthy food like broccoli has less minerals and it did 50 years ago so you have all these complicated factors that are driving the destruction of our soil fertilizers another one I don't think people really understand this fertilizer story there's 400 billion pounds of fertilizer used everywhere in the world it's a sevenfold increase over the last 40 years because they're 2/3 as effective the way you make fertilizer is a chemically intensive process that uses energy it's one of the biggest utilizers of energy and the number one utilizar of fracking produced natural gas which I didn't even know so when you look at the these more natural gas and Exxon and in order to make the gas I'm sorry they use more fertilizer than Exxon produces so they use more energy natural gas produces yes these more natural gas and then Exxon uses so the yarra and mosaic these big fertilizer companies are making fertilizer using this intensive energy process that needs natural gas when you frack you actually release methane from these methane leaks that come out of these fracking wells recently there's one in Ohio that you could see from space and in that actually is about a quarter of all methane release of gas in the environment today which is as much as factory farm cows and that's from growing plants do you know what percent of I don't know the numbers anymore but there was a day when the United States was consuming twenty million barrels of oil and oil equivalent per day it's probably a bit less than that today do you know what what amount of that is in the production transport assumption of food one-fifth of all our oil consumption is for the food system it's more than all cars planes boats transportation combined so it's a staggering amount of oil and part of it can't be combined though because of the line no combine all the transportation combined is less than one-fifth of our total oil consumption mm-hmm it's a lot its industry and other things so yeah it's pretty staggering and so the fracking can 20% of our energy utilization is to make fertilizer deliver seed yeah harvest yeah pesticides herbicides all come from fossil fuels so the fertilizer story gets even worse because once you have all the the gas you're using the methane relation that when you put on the soil it kills the soil and sorry the purpose of fertilizer is to provide generally nitrogen phosphorus right nitrogen yes nitrogen to the plants so again just taking a step back for the biochemistry understanding of this

[00:50:33] I think plant biology better that's so incredibly because I don't think people appreciate the significance of carbon fixation how complicated a chemical reaction it is to take carbon and join it to carbon like a plant can do so I mean it's very energy intensive which is why it requires sunlight so you've got this photosynthetic thing but basically ants need carbon which they're getting from the air they need nitrogen and phosphorus which they're getting from their soil and they need energy and water which they're getting from the environment and then they make biomass yeah exactly so the fertilizer is where we give them the nitrogen and the phosphorus yeah correct yes but most of the fertilizer that was growing plants historically came from either nitrogen-fixing plants like the legumes or from the animals the reason we have 50 feet and topsoil in some areas in this country 150 years ago was because of all millions of bison running around there was like bison and elk and all these ruminants that were running around in big herds chomping things down moving on to the next spot peeing and pooping digging the thing saliva makes the grass grow so is this beautiful symbiotic system that built literally tens of feet of tops well and it's not that we have too many cows it's how we're growing I mean

[00:51:46] I think it's worth pausing for a moment to explain for folks I'll try to do it quickly there was a day believe it or not like 10 years ago when I was obsessed with understanding agriculture so everything I'm saying is ten years old so you can correct me if I'm wrong but basically if you use corn as the model system and you look at the only metric that really matters which is bushels per acre per year yield it all comes down to yield basically from the

[00:52:11] Civil War to about the end of World War two if you look at crop yield and you see the plot it was about 20 bushels per acre per year so every acre could produce 20 bushels of corn per year obviously it fluctuated quite a bit from year to year but it was a largely horizontal jagged line from about the end of the Civil War to the end of World

[00:52:34] War two and then something really interesting happens at the end of World War two that line just turns up and just almost in a linear fashion rises to two hundred bushels per acre per year and I think what a lot of people erroneously assumed is oh it's the goddamn GMO well actually no not at all GMO didn't even kick in until that number was a hundred and sixty it was nitrogen-based fertilizer crop rotation industrial farming meaning the ability to actually use machine to not just have a farmer out there doing something it was selective breeding crossing so it was a bunch of things that came and then basically GMO has put like a 10% plus up on that from a you a much like maybe that's debatable so yeah anyway the point here is this process really began in earnest about seventy years ago and prior to seventy years ago it's been remarkably flat so of course this goes back to something you said earlier which is post-world War two we had to figure out how to feed a bunch of people and 20 bushels per acre per year was not cutting it we're now 10 times the yield as you're pointing out at quite a cost quite a cost yeah so the question then is I mean you talked about in your book how we're wasting a third of the food produced so we don't really need 2200 bushels per acre per year if we stop wasting have you figured out or at least calculated what you think the sweet spot is which is if you were to back off the aggressive yield measures not waste how much of the benefit could you recapture that was there when for example we used animals as our fertilizer that's right there's sort of a fallacy and the idea that we can't produce the same amount of food using regenerative methods I think that's been disproven do you believe in other words there is 200 bushels per acre per year using regenerative methods well let me just share a quick story now I want to share the story and I'm gonna come back to the fertilizer and talk about the rest of the different aspects that are causing climate change I think people need to understand that there's a guy named Gabe Brown who was a North Dakota farmer 5,000 acre farm devastated by hail devastated by weather and was about to go bankrupt and then decided he wanted to try regenerative agriculture and many years we started it and now he says he's built 29 inches of soil he uses no chemical inputs makes his own fertilizer from the animals and the plants that he plants the nitrogen-fixing plants he produces more food better quality food and makes 20 times as much money as his neighbor so in terms of productivity a rajendra farm is far more productive and I think there's this fallacy that we need Green

[00:55:18] Revolution we need industrial agriculture to feed the world that's really been disproven and I think that's the mantra of big AG it's too much of Monsanto and and now which is bear and a lot of these big agro chemical companies that are trying to push their products on the marketplace and so I think we have to sort of be smart about going wait a minute it's not just about trying to sort of go back to some old form of

[00:55:40] Agriculture that isn't gonna produce the yields no I think this is not what was done this is a sort of a new way of thinking it combines organic and it also goes beyond that and the reason is it sort of interrupts all these problems that are actually driving climate change so we talked about the fertiliser once you put it on the soil it damages the soil and it releases nitrous oxide which is 300 times more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide so you're getting all the fracking you're getting the destruction of the soil on top of that here's like a it's like a triple threat has a back end side effect all that runs off into the rivers streams and lakes and goes in into the oceans and it's created dead zones and 400 areas around the world the size of

[00:56:19] Europe there's one the size of New Jersey in the Gulf of Mexico that kills 212 thousand metric tons of fish every year it's a lot of gumbo and sushi and there's 400 of those around the world that are feeding 500 billion people so this is what fertilizer does alone and then of course you have the four station the soil erosion so forth and why is that not a problem when the fertilizer is coming from an organic nitrogen source versus an internal person right so an organic nitrogen source poop goes in there and nitrogen-fixing plants and it stays in the soil as opposed to running off through this degraded soil into the river stream so is the issue the fertilizer or the nature of the soil that can't hold the phone line sir both in order to get dirt to produce plants you need to put on huge amounts of fertilizer like I said the increase in the use of fertilizer is Sevenfold compared to 40 years ago so if I'm understanding what you're saying the problem with fertilizer is it allows us to be lazy and rely less on healthy soil and because you can dump fertilizer under and eventually grow beating a dead horse but if you actually want the healthiest soil possible you will get your nitrogen contribution from an element that stays within the ecosystem of the soil because it's a part of it and therefore you're not gonna have the runoff is that accurate exactly and so you've got the part station you're not damage the soil and all the ways we talked about and you've got transportation refrigeration processing distribution those all cost energy and then food waste which is a big cost so how do you estimate that that is a staggering number that a third of our food is wasted that is just what the sort of conventional assessments are around around food waste in the world it's not my opinion that's what the UN says but I mean what's the methodology by which one calculates the question I don't know the answer the question but that's a good question but I think it's a generally accepted thing it's between 30 to 40 percent it's different in for different reasons in the developing world versus here we throw up food in our kitchen they have lose food in the food chain because of lack of storage and transportation refrigeration so you've got all these causes of which add up to about 50 percent of climate change and by shifting how we grow food and focusing on regenerative agriculture which specifically means regenerating soil and ecosystems in other words increasing the amount of organic matter in the soil increasing water retention using crop rotations using cover crops so there's no bare soil so the soil doesn't grow using animals and very specific grazing patterns that mimics nature to actually intensively graze the land and move the enols around to actually stimulate the growth of the plants stimulate the soil and so forth so all those techniques could be easily applied and are done in literally millions of acres around the world with great benefit and high productivity and mitigating climate at the same time what's the obstacle to it the obstacle is you know you've got a 15 trillion dollar food industry that's dependent on the products of industrial farming and is actually selling the seeds it's selling the fertilizer it's selling the pesticides and herbicides it's selling all the is it the convenience like for example when you talk about the gentleman you alluded to earlier who basically switched it how many acres does he have 5,000 5,000 acres and he switched over to fully regenerative sounds like he's increased his profitability dramatically and climb and resilience and has that increase in profit come through higher price higher volume or lower cost I mean these farmers lose an average in this country about $1,600 a year that's their net is minus $1,600 per acre no per farm like if you're a farmer the average farmer according to the USDA and other statistics loses money every year he's making money because of subsidies what do you mean like it's the only reason he can make a living because of the subsidy this guy in North Dakota no no no no the per farmer who's losing $1,600 is yeah I mean they em right off some subsidies and so forth but I mean Trump just bailed them out for twenty billion dollars which is almost as much as all the subsidies that exist in the country annually which is a lot of money and the farmers struggle and they're caught between basically the big AG and the government the government's saying you need to produce these foods here's the money to support you to do it but that money then goes to buy the seed from

[01:00:31] Monsanto or the glyphosate from Monsanto or the other agrochemicals and fertilizers were from Yarra so they're taking they're just sort of the pass-through of the money from the government to big AG and in the industry and that's the problem whereas this guy game Brown in North Dakota he doesn't to buy seed he doesn't to buy fertilizer he doesn't have to buy glyphosate he doesn't to buy pesticides he doesn't eat a lot of irrigation because it's oil holds so much water he has a diverse ecosystem of animals and plants that he can grow and sell and make a profit that's more than the others and how long would it take someone like him to make that transition so it's about three to five years depending so we need a massive effort for supporting and transforming our agricultural system to regenerative AG and there's groups that are working on this like kiss the ground and carbon underground that are consulting with governments around the world to help them understand this and the UN gets this there's a huge report called climate change in land use that came out in August 2010 August 2019 which laid these problems out and how we are degrading our land that's contributing to climate and the solution is multifaceted but includes and restoring these degraded lands and people say oh you know we can't do this at scale it's too expensive the truth is if you look at all the conservation land in this country if you look at all the conservation land in this country if you look at degraded lands that aren't being used properly if you look at land that's used to grow corn and soy for factory farm animals that could be converted and we can literally double the amount of cows we produce every year I'm regenerative farms than we do now not that we should not that we need all that meat but I'm just saying the argument that it's not scalable that's not cost-effective it's just not true and the truth is you can say you can be vegan fine but we should all grow more plants but there's a lot of land on the planet about 40% of the arable land you can't grow food for humans so these animals upcycle inedible food and put it into a form that we can eat this extremely nutrient-dense there's a beautiful symbiotic ecosystem here and you don't have to eat the animals you don't want to I don't care but they're needed for the regeneration of soil who has done the most comprehensive lifecycle assessment on this transformation as you described it so how many acres are there of agricultural land in the United States approximately oh good lord I should know that I don't it's a lot of millions it's a lot really so if you take that number and on a per acre basis do the calculation of over five years everybody transitions to more regenerative appropriately rotated covered AG position how many tons of co2 can be sequestered per acre under those scenarios a lot so the book called drawdown is a wonderful explanation of the top solutions that exist today that don't need to be invented that can draw down carbon out of the environment and collectively the food solution of the author Paul Hawken yeah he's a good friend of mine yeah I actually I'd like to interview him I he looks like someone who'd be interesting to interview on this topic yeah he's coming with a new book called regenerate which is how do we regenerate our health regenerate the soil and so forth he unexpectedly found that the food solutions were the top solutions to fix climate change that aren't really being implemented and it's been estimated at this much investment in billions real results and this much value in trillions and it reduces carbon by this many Giga tons and it's all in the book so the calculations have been done the analysis have been done and I think it's been estimated by some that we could draw anywhere from thirty to a hundred percent of all the carbon and we that's been released since the

[01:03:56] Industrial Revolution if we can scale this up what's the biggest counter-argument to this there isn't any I mean I think the argument is we need to have industrial agriculture to feed the world it's the mantra it's like calories are all the same it's that same mantra that isn't science-based but that suits the needs of agrochemical and agribusiness but there's no one that's got a pushback argument that says no these calculations are overly optimistic and you would introduce a new problem if you're this of course there are there are people all the time who were trying to refute this and whether it's agribusiness or even the vegan community has come out and said regenerative agriculture is not going to solve a problem people I can pat brown from impossible Foods has been really clearly stating that we need to get rid of all meat that even regenitive meat doesn't work in terms of protecting the environment in quotes various studies that were I do analyzed in my book food fix talked about you know how they're flawed and actually miss a lot of the data so I think does take time to create regenerative agriculture it does take effort but once you do it there's an incredible value chain that gets put in place and you know there are countries that are understanding this you know we take out of the earth a lot of natural capital about 125 trillion dollars a year resources and soil and everything else that we steal from the earth we don't put it back and it's running out and how much did use 125 trillion and the global GDP is probably 80 tonight I would say that's more than the global GDP yeah which is about 80 infinity right it's more than that every year and there's a lot of people working on this for example is a private equity company called farmland LP that's buying up conventional farms converting them to regenerative agriculture and moving those farms from single-digit profits to high double-digit their first fund had a 67 percent return and when they look at the benefit they provide to the environment we call ecosystem services that's the hundred twenty-five million dollars of ecosystem services the natural capital we borrow they add 21 million dollars of value on their farms versus a similar amount of conventional farms would actually steal eight million dollars of value from the earth and countries like Costa Rica are paying for ecosystem services for their farmers are paying them to produce more soil to actually conserve water to increase biodiversity which we haven't even talked about what's a whole another topic I want to get through it let's see talk to me a little bit about you know it's funny Pat Brown was one of my professors in medical so jeez okay so I mean I don't know if a lot of people realize what a prominent scientist pat was and if you look at the type of work Pat did in the 90s I mean it's not inconceivable he could have gone down the path of a

[01:06:29] Nobel Prize I mean a smart guy but the challenge is you don't have to vilify people wanting to do regenerative agriculture I don't know anything about Pat I know very little about their philosophy around why they've created the is it the impossible burger what is it there's two of these out there onesie on beyond burger beyond meat and impossible burger okay and I can ever get the two of them straight but I mean one is P based which is a B on meat and one is GMO soy based which okay and that's off the GMO one must be Pat's if you look at the light you last about a lifecycle analysis Qantas which is an independent life cycle analysis company did an analysis of the impossible burger compared to we generally raised beef burger and the impossible was far better than a conventional factory farm burger but it added three and a half kilos of carbon for every burger you ate which one did the impossible burger so say that again so the impossible burger was better than a factory farm burger by far but it still added three and a half kilos of carbon to the environment for every burger we generally raised burger including methane everything all the inputs took out three and a half kilos of carbon meaning you'd have to eat one we generally raised beef burger to offset the carbon emissions of a impossible burger so I'm not against plant-based means but I think we can't overstate the importance of and what by comparison what was the factory farm burger do you remember how much carbon was added three and a half kilos of carbon were removed no no sorry the factory oh it was a lot it was like 50 or it was a lot it was it was significantly less but still it's not the only answer when you think about scaling up impossible burgers on a GMO mono crops I filled using tons of glyphosate which has all sorts of harmful consequences causing soil erosion to the way we farm damaging the waterways damaging everything else I mean just it doesn't even add up right so let's do it right so let's talk a little bit about GMO this is a loaded topic again I think people don't understand what it means and that sort of I want to talk about it but I also want to just put it in context for people so that we understand what GM means and why it came about so we go back to the 1940s we had growing old Maison you know 20 bushels per acre per year well we got to remember that used to be something called tea assente that was like this little tiny silly crop that was the size of our finger and it had like four little kernels on it that's where corn came from so I was explaining this to my kids the other day because we were my kids are obsessed with gardening and stuff and I was saying look there's four things about a plant that really matter if you're planting crops yield matters how much do you have product profile means a good deed or not yeah or in the case of tea assente it had a lousy product profile because it just had four kernels on it harvest ability the other problem with tea assente is that little kernels would always fall off it you actually wanted the kernels to stay on the thing so you could harvest the whole plant and crop protection can you keep it away can you keep the critters away from it so GMO has had by far its greatest impact in crop protection the BT insertion is basically what allowed Roundup Ready crops to be resistant to glyphosate we'll use the terms like EC is that is for the cotton right oh yeah yes so there's a glyphosate resistance that and we'll use like I said we'll use glyphosate and roundup interchangeably but if you could basically genetically modify a plant to be resistant to the thing that you use to kill the pests you can use that thing liberally right yeah

[01:09:57] I mean for all the promise of GMO but basically the only two inventions have been the b2b side yeah does it and and that's led to massive increases in the use of pesticides the first point to make here is most of the yield gains came long before this so obviously you do get some yield gain with crop protection so there's an overlap but virtually all of it came before this all of the harvest ability to my knowledge there's been no GM addition to harvest ability and no GM addition to product profile although some might argue that it's low-hanging fruit for example I know Monsanto was very aggressively looking at trying to engineer Tomatoes that could grow in brackish water and that way you would obviously open up the ability to grow it in areas where you don't have fresh water okay so with all of that said the next question for the person to be thinking about that you're gonna take us through is there are at least two things about GM that could be problematic the first is it could be problematic that you are eating an organism that now has a gene that looks different from the gene that we evolved to consume it in other words it now makes different proteins that it didn't make that are foreign and cuz food is information so how is that different information affecting your biology and how is it regulating the different body functions I don't think we know much about that the second thing that could be harmful about GM is that by its very success it enables the use of chemicals in a higher concentration than you would be able to use them in the absence of GM and we'll use roundup or glyphosate as the poster child for that can you talk through both of those and what the state of the evidence is for the harm of GM because it should be noted that what you're about to say is that the backdrop or stands at odds with what the USDA would tell us what the

[01:11:55] National Association of scientists would tell us which is GMO is safe feel free to consume it liberally and so tell us where you think that might be questionable well there's a bunch of issues there first is it's a large uncontrolled experiment on humanity just like Crisco was invented in 1911 as this great new invention was in our food supply for I don't know 80 or 90 years more before people were like wait a minute this isn't good for us since killing hundreds of thousands of people a year let's get it out so we don't know

[01:12:24] I think there's animal studies that looks concerning there's various issues I think in terms of the use of these chemicals there's two issues there one is the plants are increasingly mutating to be resistant to these substances so you need more pesticides and more glyphosate to do the same job so there's all these weeds that are becoming resistant to glyphosate that they're trying to fight and then that's a problem because we're using more and more of these chemicals Europe followed a different path it didn't allow GMO foods didn't allow any of that and so what the compare of analysis of agriculture in US versus Europe was no difference in yields and far less used to pesticides and herbicides so that didn't fulfill its promise of yields and decrease use of chemicals it was transient I believe there was a transient reduction in pesticide use until we started to see resistance is that correct yeah and we're using more and more these chemicals and glyphosate is 70% of the agro chemicals used on the planet it's increasingly being linked to harmful human effects so forget about the insertion of the gene is an issue we know that these chemicals are harmful to just do we know this this is an important point yeah I mean aside from you know the litigation which is not a scientific judgment it's the traditional judgment but there's 14,000 lawsuits around glyphosate has been billion-dollar settlements a friend of

[01:13:41] Mines and lawyers involved with those laws since he told me that on discovery they found that the Trump administration said to Monsanto now bear we have your back and the EPA recently is trying to shut down any further lawsuits on glyphosate which is fascinating because is that have disclosed emails and I think the effects on animal studies are really clear I just read a study on epigenetics and glyphosate where they looked at interventional studies on rats where they looked at giving the generation zero glyphosate and infected their grand rats in multiple ways through prostate disease cancer various things but we've seen this before mark I mean we've seen lots of things where in the lab they're using doses that are significantly higher than the human exposure and or laboratory animals behave differently than human okay fine but are we willing to take that risk I know at some other study where glyphosate disrupts the microbiome in significant ways and animals and the dose that's in one impossible burger is a hundred and ten times the dose that was used in the animal studies to totally disrupt the microbiome of around but do we know how bioavailable it is and how much it remains well it's in the on the food I mean I I try to eat organic I try to eat non GMO like I travel I'm not perfect and I did my urine test I look at my glyphosate levels and I was shocked I have a 50th percentile glyphosate in my urine how do we do this test you could pee in a bucket and you send it into the lab Great Plains lab has this test available and you can check your glyphosate levels I was shocked and I think most of us are sort of walking toxic dumps and if you looked at a verge fat biopsy of a human that's full of DDT dioxin pesticides it's like it's pretty bad so I think we are still in an uncontrolled experiment so your view is basically to take the precautionary principle which is look we may never know this definitively there's enough suggestion that this could be harmful through animal models or other things like that I mean for example I mean again I'm just I'm pushing back not because I don't necessarily agree with you on a personal level and make a lot of the same choices myself you're not sprinkling glyphosate on your salads you know I stopped a couple things but again I always think it's important to sort of at least let people understand when something is where our level of confidence is very high vs. modest but there's a precautionary approach to take out of in other words I feel much more comfortable saying tobacco is causally responsible for lung cancer then I feel saying glyphosate is causally responsible for human disease I just don't I just haven't been convinced by the day if it was the only way to grow food fine we deal with the risk it's not it's not the best way it's not the most effective way and there is potential risk and there's real concern about our industrial agricultural system on the earth and so on biodiversity and also I sort of interrupted you when you're about to make a point about biodiversity that was something I learned recently yeah it's an important issue before a good times when a finish has thought about how this industrial system has sort of usurped small farm holders which are the majority of farmers that feed the majority of the world and these farmers are getting squeezed by these big AG companies are coming in and saying they're going to improve their livelihood but then forced them to buy their seed forced them to buy their chemicals and there's increasing suicides and terrible economic consequences from these farmers around the world because there they're not able to maintain a livelihood doing what they're doing so it's not just that it's a it's an issue around health it's also issue around squeezing a lot of the people who do grow most the food in the world so it's another issue I talked about in the book before we leave that then do you know what the median farm is in the United

[01:17:18] States in terms of acreage I don't I did know but I don't I can't keep all the facts me that's and what is approximately most farmers in the world's like less than five acres is most of the farmers in the world that feed most of the world does that include the United States no we're more industrial yeah more industrial yeah for sure I mean there's less and less farms for you and for our farmers decreasing all the time bigger and bigger farms I mean Earl Butz set it under Nixon go big or go home in doing the research for your book mark did you spend any time with these farmers and did you sense in them a degree of dissatisfaction or let down with this promise of big AG that came about twenty years ago my god yeah I think the more and more farmers are thinking about this it was a an article in Time magazine where all the

[01:18:01] Democratic candidates in Iowa are going out of the farms and the farmers are like look our live leads are being destroyed that we're having floods we're not able to grow food the system isn't working we want to explore regenerative agriculture so it's definitely happening not because they're hippies who want to go back to the land it's happening just from an economic imperative and the way to restore and save their farms but do farmers feel captive now to Monsanto and pioneer and these other companies they do they have a system and they don't have a way to get out of it so they're in a vicious cycle they've got all this capital and their equipment they're stuck in this vicious cycle of growing the same crops and they have no way out so we do need a bridge for these people and we do need mechanisms through government and private equity and others to actually help fund the transition I think like I said you know the UN said 300 billion dollars when we could solve the problem of climate change and give us 20 years more runway to solve the bigger issues so it's a massive effort that could actually transform our quality of our food to quality of our soils save our water increase biodiversity which we'll talk about and and so many of our global problems just starting at the seed so back to my Oh diversity so what that means is that we talk about extinction of species but it's not just some frog in the Amazon we've lost 90% of our edible plant species basically 60% of our calories comes from corn and we in rice and soy and mostly from 12 species we've lost 90% of our edible plant species half of all our livestock species you know there's a lot of weird animals all over the place and you travel to foreign countries see these weird cows and weird pigs and weird goats and they all look different now they're all the same that we produce in this country and we have lost 75% of our pollinator species from which our agriculture depends which

[01:19:43] Einstein said if we lose bees from the face of the earth humans have four years left to live which may be true or not but it's an existential threat butterflies pollinators all damaged also by these pesticides and chemicals that indiscriminate and what they kill they were basically nerve gases that were produced in the world war one and two that were factories retooled to produce agrochemicals that's what the bombs were nitramene now Timothy McVeigh bombed in

[01:20:10] Oklahoma that building was through going to an a like a farm store and buying nitrogen fertilizer and turning into a bomb that's where it actually came from so these chemicals that we use in the soil the methods of farming destroy the ecosystems both from all those but also the biodiversity of the soil the organism the soil they're so critical the micro eyes'll fungi the bacteria the nematodes the worms all these different animals that live in the soil that are necessary to actually create food and to create sustainable agriculture and so I think we're we're sort of asleep to the idea that we're sort of running out of soil running out of these bad diverse animals that are essential for our health and our survival

[01:20:48] I mean coral reefs I mean then with climate change we're destroying all the coral reefs and again 500 billion people depend on these coral reefs for food so how would one go about moving the needle on this well I'm trying I'm trying so I wrote the book food fix how to save our health our economy our communities and our planet one bite at a time in order to lay out the problem and lay out the solutions and they're multifaceted they're what citizens can do then what can happen in business innovation like I mentioned bring come back and talking about an example around food waste and they're what policymakers need to do and there needs to be the political will but it's really tough so can we start at the bottom of that and let me ask you another couple of questions what does organic really mean when it comes to plant or meat if a person says okay mark you've definitely convinced me that I want to be more mindful of what

[01:21:35] I'm buying let's just assume that this is a person who has the economic flexibility to make the food choices that might even increase their their budget on groceries so first of all what does it mean when you go to the grocery store and you see two boxes of strawberries one's organic one's not well Organic is a certification that's delivered by the government that means no antibiotics no pesticides no herbicides and pass it to be certified that it's clean of all of that however it doesn't certify the method of growing the food so Michael Pollan it's become

[01:22:07] Moore's lemma talked about Industrial organic so if you have these massive mono crop lettuce fields you're doing tillage you're not doing cover crops you're not doing crop rotations you're also not super helping the soil is better than industrial farming but it's not fully regenerative regenerative is the method of farming that actually includes organic but goes beyond it and there is now a regenerative organic certification which you can look up and

[01:22:31] I talked about my book but the chemicals the pesticides that we consume have an impact on our health it's been estimated that pesticide exposure just in children is responsible for an average loss of seven IQ points or 41 million IQ points in kids so there's a lot of brain power that's killed and not to mention how many per kid I think it's like 7 IQ points there's literally a millions of pounds of these pesticides and herbicides that are in our food supply in our water and some plants have more than others so I'm on the board of the

[01:23:01] Environmental Working Group and they produce a really great guide called the Dirty Dozen and the clean 15 so you can look at that list and if you're having economic issues or whatever you as well strawberries are the worst thing I could buy if they're not organic whereas you know banana or an avocado maybe not a big deal if it's not organic so you can look at that list and go I'm gonna save money by buying organic of the things that are the worst contaminated and I can cheat on the other ones that are not and as part of that because in the case of banana is an avocado you're eating what's inside not outside whereas in the strawberry it's like got this surface yeah collects it all celery's terrible never have any anything about organic celery for example in meat besides not using hormones and the animals and not giving them antibiotics is there anything else that comes in the distinction of organic meat again it's not using the inputs that are chemical inputs that are on the corn they have the soil of a house so that's good but again it doesn't mean that they couldn't be fed organic corn it's still growing a ways that are destroying the soil so we really have to sort of think more nuanced about what that means that's why regenerative is sort of organic plus you know it's like a whole next level how ubiquitous is that regenerative it's not identically it's not it's not it's not even a label yet there's just a proposal for a regenerative organic certification and there are farms who are doing this and there's ways to regulate it and measure it and I think the government's gonna be able to sort of put out field serviceworkers to measure soil to measure these things to look at is it regenerative and place like Mariposa ranch in California you can buy half a cow with a bunch of friends and it's eight bucks a pound which for a four ounce serving is less than you'd pay for

[01:24:43] McDonald's hamburger so you can with little ingenuity and effort you can actually start to find how to get these things but it's the demand that's going to increase and that's why for example General Mills and Danone and Nestle and Pepsi even are looking at how do we get our supply chain to be more regenerative and how are we going to move that needle it's kind of exciting to me is there anything else a consumer can do absent the types of bigger changes that you're pushing for and hoping for I mean I think being really focused on what you eat and where it comes from buying at local farmers markets joining a community supported agriculture looking for regenerative sources online buying things together with friends what are the resources people can use to find those things I'd be centralized in any way yeah there are my book food fix and they're on our website what's the URL food fix book calm and there's a video in there and five steps to heal the planet in yourself and there's an action guide that is good for citizens businesses governments and so forth so that it says you know what can you do and so yes you can you vote with your fork and all as I just mentioned you can be active in your community maybe you should have a compost pile we'll talk about that but you can be active to sort of have community gardens if you know my son for his fifth birthday it's like okay what do you want Reese he wanted a compost box all right then you how hard it was to find one you couldn't go to Home

[01:26:04] Depot and get one you couldn't go to local garden store like it took really they have a lot of Amazon you can buy them and have them shipped to you I think ultimately sounds silly I think ultimately we did that but I was I think with kids sometimes it's fun to take them to the place and get the thing I was amazed how hard it was to get a big company you don't even need that I just put a little fence little kind of some two by fours and built a little box and you just throw it in my backyard and just throw it in there year after year and I've got like tons of feet of this dark rich soil like a human that goes on the garden and it's great if you're want to be politically active you can go in your municipality and say Oh to your local government say look let's have a composting law let's make it mandatory like San Francisco did and you can't go it and throw your garbage in San

[01:26:47] Francisco anymore and for example in I just don't know if I want to do anything San Francisco's do I mean France if you have mandatory composting there and if you don't you get a fine you go to jail in Massachusetts they passed a law that if you if you make a ton of organic waste every week you can't throw it out in the landfill and they actually created innovation there there's people coming up like dairy farmers are making less money struggling the stereo farmer create these anaerobic digesters which gets food waste they get about a hundred tons of food waste every week in this one farm from like Whole Foods and other grocery stores they put in their manure from the animals it basically combusts in this digester produces electricity for 1,500 homes and makes the farmer an extra 100 grand a year and it's a win-win-win for every I see it to me I always feel like that's the better weather the that particular example works at scale or not I have no idea but it seems to me the we're gonna put you in jail if you don't compost approach is the wrong approach versus the let's economically incentivize you to do this thing differently and I worry that there's there's too much emphasis on the punishment side of things

[01:27:54] I don't think humans work that way and it's also a slippery slope because the government doesn't exactly have a track of great competence so for everything that they do right they're probably doing three things wrong and therefore if I mean again I don't want to sound like a too much of a libertarian anti nanny state guy but I feel like I kind of need to sound like the libertarian anti nanny state guy when it comes to these things because the government as you point out is a big part of the reason we got in this mess and to quote

[01:28:25] Einstein again and I might be bastardizing this quote but the same level of consciousness that produced these problems will be incapable of solving them that's true but we do have a lot of regulations that protect citizens right we have seatbelt laws and commission control of laws and cars we have baby seeds and all sorts of things that we mandated that now people will accept and we have airbags which the industry didn't like and seatbelts which they hate and we just sort of accept that and I think there's a role for government in actually helping incentivize the right thing and I think the lawmaking is not OK for big companies to throw out all their waste in a landfill and the reason to sort of back up a little on that is food waste incredible problem like we said 30 or 40 percent of all food produced is wasted if it was grown on land mass it would require the entire country of China to grow all that food that we throw out the average family throws out about a pound a day or about $1,800 a year of food and if it were a country in terms of the greenhouse gases that could produce when you throw it in landfills and it rots and emits methane it would be the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases after the US and China and it's about two trillion dollars of resources that we waste in throwing out all the food and it's because more than a food for 10 billion people on the planet it's just not eat I could have ly distributed it's a big problem to solve and nobody's foreign even trump administration has created a food waste initiative with the EPA the FDA and the

[01:29:47] USDA and they basically like notice the FDA the EPA and USDA to actually deal with the food waste issue so I think each of us can stop that that's the easy thing to do and there's a lot of other things we can do to get involved in our political process through being involved in communicating with your congressmen senators or something called the Food

[01:30:04] Policy Action Group which is food policy action dot whoring that rates your senators and congressmen on their voting records on food and AG policy so you can see and they can they've literally unseated congressmen who are doing bad things and voting the wrong way around food and policy issues that people care about so there's a lot of things we can do as individuals the USDA what's their role in this oh my god you have another couple hours I go through all this in the book but just at the high level the USDA is responsible for a number of different food and Ag policies that are the majority of the things that are going on our dietary guidelines which were messed up our school lunch guidelines which are messed up our SNAP program or food stamp program which is seventy-five billion a year it's on our biggest government programs that feeds 46 million Americans including one in four kids who are food insecure great idea but there's no nutrition guidelines in that so there are seven billion dollars a year just in soda that we spend about thirty billion servings a year you can buy soda with food stamps oh yeah of course you can buy anything except alcohol and cooked food so you can buy a two-liter bottle of soda but you can't buy a rotisserie chicken in the grocery store and 75% of the food stamps is junk food or soda that's about a 730 billion dollar program which is massive over a period of ten years and so there's no nutrition guidelines in there and so you've got all these government programs plus the crop insurance and agricultural supports that support an industrial agricultural system and those are harmful and cents so if you have a big soy and corn farm and you want to grow a whole bunch of veggies you can't even if you want to because you will get penalized and not get your crop insurance so farmers are distant sent divides from growing fruits and vegetables if the government tells us on the one hand to eat half of our plate as fruits and vegetables but less than half a percent of industrial supports of kangra cultural support from the government are for fruits and vegetables so it's like basically if we were eating what the government actually funded in agricultural supports we'd be having a giant corn fritter deep fried and soybean oil you know and it's like that's not exactly what we should be eating that's a very powerful image mark is that not that necessarily the USDA's recommendations on nutrition are correct but even if you took that as an aspiration it's interesting to note that the funding doesn't align with that so how does the USDA respond to that especially because it's not a subtle they're not off by a little bit they're off by an order of magnitude 1/4 of less than a half a percent versus 50% so what is their response to that I don't know I just like I think it's just the right hands not talking the left hand and so there's all these disparate policies I was working with Tim Ryan and my friend

[01:32:49] Irish mother firing from Harvick Tufts to get an analysis by the Government Accountability Office to look at what our disparate policies were doing to our public health and to our economic health as a nation because they're all cross-purposes we say don't drink soda eat healthy diet so forth with Dietary Guidelines but then we pay for 75 billion a year and junk food for the poor how does that make sense and so I think we have all these government agencies which the FDA that has confusing food labels or that allows antibiotics in our animal feed or that allows substances that are banned in other countries to be they're toxic to be in our food supply like AIDS or die carbon amide which is basically a softener for flour products for bread I mean if you use that in Singapore you get a $450,000 fine and you go to jail for 15 years I mean Singapore is saying it more but still like it's not even allowed and we have the the FDA the FTC which regulates the airwaves allows all this unrestricted marketing to kids so you've got all these different agencies that are working across purposes that aren't coordinated aren't creating a coherent food policy so we need a national food policy we need activism to change some of these food policies and and support regenerative AG and to reform food stamps and dysfunctional policies to reform school lunches and and to actually help advance in health care food as medicine all these things can be done and I'm actually working on a campaign with some extraordinary people who are launching a non-profit and an advocacy group otherwise known as a lobby group for the good guys to start to work on these issues in Washington because well it may seem like nothing can be done I think behind the scenes a lot can be done and I think there are a lot of these issues our bipartisan issues I just think people are ready for this there's a movement and a readiness around the country and even in

[01:34:33] Washington to address these issues I mean I just gave a talk at somewhere and someone knew one of the senators from Maine and they called me the next day and it's like what can you help and I say most 70% of the military recruits are unfit to fight and 70% of the evacuations from Afghanistan in Iraq were not for more injuries but were for obesity related injuries so for in the soldiers and then they want to figure this out so I am hopeful because I see that despite all these issues people are waking up to these problems I see these big food companies like Nestle to know and Unilever and so forth General Mills actually starting to take on these issues I mean they still are part of the problem but they are trying to move their super tanker ships and it takes a while but I do see room for hope I see business innovations food and act tech companies are billions and billions are flowing into these areas for innovation which is all a good thing what do you think are the top three changes if you or foods are in a rank order sort of the biggest are there 3 things that could make 70% of the difference yes I would immediately transform healthcare reimbursement to focus on food as medicine through paying for food for those who are food insecure for reimbursing for in vegetable prescriptions for making food essential part of the government and that would include having all government is probably the biggest food purchaser in the country have them only purchase food that is going to promote health and not disease I would then secondly perform these dysfunctional food policies that would transform Snap transform school lunches transform the Dietary Guidelines to be science-based and lastly I would actually support

[01:36:09] Rajinder back in every way possible through government policies and through business innovations incentives and other things so those three pillars you know one fixing food is medicine into the health care system and reimbursement policies and in every government institution reforming dysfunctional government food policies and supporting

[01:36:26] Rajinder bag and that's really the whole agenda of the food fix campaign we've sort of glossed over it a little bit but it has no discussion on this would be complete without coming back to maybe some of the confusion that exists around a plant-based diet exclusively as a solution for and let's put aside the health issues for a moment because there's obviously lots to debate around whether animal based products have dilatory as health consequences and let's put aside also this sort of egregious cruelty to animals that takes place under farm conditions and factory farming should be banned period full stop yeah I don't think anybody that spent any time actually going and watching how animals are harvested in that way would disagree with that so let's instead focus on specifically the environmental concerns you've already talked about it a little bit but can you say a bit more about it hey you know the interesting report came out called the eight Lancet report which was very well intentioned and had a lot of great science in it that talked about how we linked climate and diet and food and what is a healthy diet and how do you define that there's a lot of great science in there there were challenges though because some of the language in there was really driven through the food industry and a lot of the sponsors for that were big food and big AG one of the for example messages is we need to grow more plants or grains and more beans through something called sustainable intensification or climate smart agriculture these are buzzwords sort of like clean coal which sound good but when you look behind the curtain who funds those organizations 60% of the members of climate smart agriculture are the fertilizer companies sustainable intensification means using more and more chemical inputs on farms in developing world to grow more grains and beans that's not the solution and lastly without animals integrated into regenerative agricultural systems you cannot restore soil in the way we need to restore it as fast as we need to restore it it's just a scientific fact so what is that based on the need for the basically the transfer of nitrogen through the enemy who Pingping digging the saliva makes the plants grow it's a whole symbiotic ecosystem and when used properly not over grazing but proper management which is called holistic management or managed grazing or adapted multi paddock grazing there's a science to it you can dramatically increase soil so it takes like I think a thousand years to get three centimeters of soil naturally Gate Brown in North Dakota it got 29 inches of soil just through these methods that are sort of supercharged methods they're like sort of aggregate 42.0 it's not about going back to old ways it's about inventing new ways using all the science to actually grow soil because a lot of I mean through human history we were destructive I mean we would grow food on land and we would deplete the land we'd moved to the next plot of land tom is now running the land there's no more place to go so I think we absolutely need to actually scale this regenerator culture model in order to solve all these global issues can regenerative egg be superimposed on fallow land yeah then people are basically taking degraded land which is almost desert and turning it back into lush fields and lunch agricultural practices so when those people say we have to be vegan to save the planet it's actually not accurate whether you eat meat or not as a personal choice a moral choice if you think it's a health choice fine but whether or not you believe in eating meat or not from an environmental from a regenerative from an e climate standpoint we must have animals integrated into the process in order to restore soil which is the biggest carbon sink so the take-home message here for people is there a lot of ways to fix climate change but the quickest fastest and most effective and scalable way and using ancient carbon capture technology that is more effective than anything this today is free called photosynthesis it's may see Sun and carbon dioxide in the air we can solve a lot of the global issues we have so mark how are you spending your time today you wear a tux yeah I mean you know you're involved in the education of functional medicine at the Cleveland Clinic you commute there and back from your home in New York you're obviously very involved in this initiative what does the pie graph look like of how you allocate your time well

[01:40:48] I'm always doing the same thing in my mind I'm trying to handle being the suffering through the power of functional medicine systems thinking and sort of restoring communities and behavioral change through that and this is just part of that story like I said there's so much suffering that's unnecessary whether it's chronic disease or poverty or mental illness or kids struggling with learning in schools or violence these are all needless suffering if we had the solutions then we need to focus on them and as I began began at the beginning talked about as I sort of went down the rabbit hole of why my patients sick came to this bigger conclusion that unless we deal with the systems issues unless we go upstream we're just gonna be treading water or bailing a sinking boat and the acceleration of these problems is so big that I feel like I'm focusing more and more on these bigger issues in order to solve them so yes I write books and I feel like it's my last one for a while but like the right books and teach and speak and do all these things have clinics but at the end of the day this is an existential threat and once you've seen it you can't unsee it I just were researching the book for the last two and a half years I just sort of was shocked by a lot of things that I learned that are not really common knowledge and even with really educated people by going a room of highly educated people and say what's the number one source to climate change they're not gonna say food but when you actually unpack it that's the biggest threat well mark thank you very much for making the time today and more importantly of course for doing this work and bringing it to our attention this is an area that I have become increasingly interested in and my views are kind of constantly evolving I mean I think there was a day when I didn't question the health of GMO I'll just share with you an anecdote which is when

[01:42:33] I went to Europe a year ago I just made the glib observation which was sort of the bread the pasta all of the food that I ate in Europe which I actually went out of my way to eat did not seem to produce the same effect as it did here and that was actually kind of a thin into the wedge in my mind that said what's going on what is the difference between the crops that they are using in

[01:42:59] Europe and it's funny because it I can give you four reasons yeah that's true yeah well that wood reminded me of my childhood because when I was a kid we used to go to Egypt every year and because my parents are from and I've go with my mom each year and usually spend two months there and I remember the way bread tasted there I had had a very distinct taste that you'll never taste even if you buy like pita bread or other

[01:43:22] Middle Eastern bread here in the US it tastes very different and I remember sort of having those neurons tickled again when I was in Europe going out of my way cuz most the previous times I'd gone to Europe I kind of don't eat that sort of stuff but on this trip I was like hey I'm gonna in Rome right so yeah tell me about what you think those forces are you're talking about wheat products right so what's happened to wheat is that we've hybridized the wheat to make it extremely drought resistant and Hardy and it's called dwarf wheat and the guy who invented Norman Borlaug won the

[01:43:53] Nobel Prize and increase in yields but what was sort of the unintended consequences is the starch in there it's called amylopectin a it's a super starch to raises your blood sugar more than regular sugar so one it's basically just like eating sugar or worse - when they breed plants it's not like humans you get 23 pairs of chromosomes one from your mom or your dad 46 chromosomes in plants is 46 plus 46 was like 92 and so there's extra proteins that are formed and there are many more gliding proteins which are inflammatory and more active in terms of causing disruptions in the gut so they're more likely to cause a leaky gut inflammation a third thing is they spray wheat even though it's not a

[01:44:34] GMO food plant they spray it with glyphosate at harvest why because it D foliate s-- the plants it gets rid of all the sort of leaves and stuff so it makes it easier to harvest so right it harvest they spray this with glyphosate and your Cheerios have more glyphosate than vitamin A and vitamin D they're at in their per amount of weight so even if you buy organic wheat mechanic we know organic we could still be the dwarf wheat and then lastly this is interestingly because it may be five reasons when second-last the calcium propionate which is a preservative is added to the wheat in this country and it's known to cause toxic neurological effects behavioral hyperactivity and even linked to autism in fact when you give babies breast milk it increases butyrate which is an empower for chain fat in the gut that makes sure got healthy when you have formula it causes high propionate levels which can cause neurotoxic effects and in animal models has caused autism if you put propria nating in rats brains and then lastly in europe they have different methods of making the bread here it's like quick quick quick quick they want it to leaven and rise on a couple hours there it can take overnight 12 hours 14 hours and it tastes very different it's a very different structure and it does different things to the gluten and so forth so there's a lot of reasons that that happens but I would say over and over I see this happen with my patients who can't eat this stuff here and they go over there and there's no GMO over there it's a complex web of thing and one make bread here in the US on their own using wheat like an actual wheat that comes from

[01:46:02] Europe sure you could or you could get heirloom wheats like einkorn wheat which is very different or now there's new forms of wheat like turns a wheat by Wes Jackson was developed in Midwest it has incredibly deep roots it's a perennial weeds super nutrient dense really amazing amazing product so there's an incredible grains out there that guy was talking my friend Jeff bland the other day who's told me his company and he's working this guy to develop these pseudo phytochemical rich foods super foods and he got a bunch of things from the USDA a bunch of seeds and 1 packet came in it was like four three two one six or somebody's like what's this I don't know what this isn't it I sent to my accident and it was this Himalayan buckwheat which apparently is one of the most protein rich low glycemic phytochemical dense Hardy superfood on the planet and they're now they have this sort of seed because then they're not selling and distributing it but they couldn't give it back so he's like what are they taking this packet a season turning it into a whole business which is really amazing so there's a lot of stuff out there that we could use it's much better for us but we just kind of homogenized our food supply and were taken out all I guess we eight hundred species of plants before I'm your hunter-gatherers and our bodies need all those different phytochemicals and nutrients and minerals and so forth and vitamins to actually run itself and we're now just in this sort of nutrient devoid diet even if we're eating organic stuff if it's not grown in good soils if it's hybridized plants it's just not great I was they eat weird food so I would try to eat weird food don't you gotta say
