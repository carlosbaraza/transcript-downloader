# #01 – Tim Ferriss: depression, psychedelics, and emotional resilience

**Channel:** Peter Attia MD
**Upload Date:** 2019-12-16
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgJTzkRg3cA
**Duration:** 156 minutes

## Description

Original release date: 7/2/2018

In this episode, Tim talks both experientially and from his own deep dive into the literature of psychedelics and mental health. Tim is shifting his focus from investing in startups to funding experiments that he hopes will establish more reliable knowledge and therapeutic options for those suffering from anxiety, depression, and addiction. If this topic even remotely interests you, I can’t recommend Tim’s podcast with Michael Pollan, author of How to Change Your Mind, enough. (You should definitely read Pollan’s book as well.) Even if you’ve never had any exposure to psychedelics or their potential applications, I think you’ll find this subject matter really interesting, and I was very grateful for Tim to be so open and honest about his experiences. Tim also shared his short list of acquired wisdom he returns to most reliably, which might be worth the price of admission alone. 

We discuss: 
- Tim’s history of depression and his TED Talk on his close call with suicide; 
- The type of thinking that triggers Tim’s downward spirals;
- Tim’s transformative experience with ayahuasca; 
- How Tim’s experience and research has led him to focus on furthering the science of psychedelics and mental health; 
- What some of the meditation modalities, and meditation apps, are out there, 
- Why can meditation be so hard to do, but also worthwhile to stick with; 
- Why Tim made a big commitment (more than $1 million) to funding scientific research, and to psilocybin and MDMA research, in particular; 
- From all the habits and tools that Tim has learned, the five things that he returns to most reliably; and 
- More.

## Description

Original release date: 8/20/2018

Matt is someone who is deeply interested in understanding the biology of aging. Why do we age? What happens to us as we age? What are the things we can do to slow the aging process? How can we delay or prevent the onset of age-related diseases? These are all questions that Matt thinks deeply about, and explores these questions with his research at the University of Washington. He is currently investigating many of these questions through the Dog Aging Project and the compound rapamycin—the only known pharmacological agent to extend lifespan all the way from yeast to mammals—across a billion years of evolution. We talk about cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease, healthspan, lifespan, and what we can do to provide longer, healthier lives for both people and dogs.

We discuss:
-Matt’s early years and his aha moment on aging [4:00];
-Studying dogs [6:30];
-Dogs, rapamycin, and its effects on lifespan and healthspan [15:30];
-An unexpected finding in presumably healthy dogs [36:00];
-Rapamycin in cancer treatment [50:00];
-Why isn’t there a rapamycin trial for Alzheimer’s disease (AD)? [1:01:30];
-If Matt could do a definitive study on life extension in dogs, with resources not being a concern, what does that experiment look like? [1:16:00]; and
-More.

This episode features an in-depth discussion between Peter Attia and Dave Feldman about lipids, cholesterol, and cardiovascular disease risk. The conversation centers around Feldman's "energy model" hypothesis regarding lean mass hyper-responders (people who develop very high LDL cholesterol on low-carb diets) and whether their elevated LDL represents increased cardiovascular risk. Attia challenges several aspects of Feldman's model, particularly regarding mass balance and the source of increased cholesterol in these individuals.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- LDL particle half-life is approximately one day under normal conditions [1:40:42]
- About 40% of LDL comes directly from the liver [40:27]
- Oxidized LDL testing can measure escaped particles from the subendothelial space [55:43]
- Three factors necessary for atherosclerosis: lipoprotein burden, endothelial function, and inflammatory response [1:07:25]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Monitor both LDL-P and LDL-C, not just standard lipid panel [19:05]
- Consider advanced lipid testing before starting low-carb diet [20:20]

Context-specific recommendations:
- For lean mass hyper-responders: consider reducing saturated fat while maintaining ketosis [2:19:22]
- Monitor oxidized LDL as a marker of cardiovascular risk [55:43]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Medications mentioned:
- Statins [1:24:59]
- PCSK9 inhibitors (Repatha) [1:03:59]

6. **Notable Quotes**:
"LDL is necessary but not sufficient for atherosclerosis" - Peter Attia [1:07:25]

"The body of evidence implicating LDL as having a causal role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is on a different level from the body of literature that gave us the food pyramid" - Peter Attia [2:31:00]

7. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What is the exact mechanism of cholesterol synthesis upregulation in lean mass hyper-responders?
2. How does exercise type (resistance vs. endurance) affect LDL particle dynamics?
3. What role does liver glycogen status play in VLDL secretion?
4. How can we better measure remnant lipoproteins clinically?

This episode provides valuable insights into the complexity of lipid metabolism and cardiovascular risk assessment, particularly in the context of low-carbohydrate diets.

# #42–Avrum Bluming, M.D. and Carol Tavris, Ph.D.: A compelling case for hormone replacement therapy

**Channel:** Peter Attia MD
**Upload Date:** 2020-01-08
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njBS3s8ex24
**Duration:** 140 minutes

## Description

Original release date: 2/25/19

In this episode, Avrum Bluming, hematologist, medical oncologist, and emeritus clinical professor at USC, and Carol Tavris, social psychologist and author of Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me), discuss their collaboration on their recent book, Estrogen Matters. Their book takes on the very polarizing and confusing topic of hormone replacement therapy for women suffering with symptoms of menopause. In many ways, the story and history of HRT is in striking parallel to the bad science that led up to the dietary guidelines being set forth in 1980. Carol and Avrum make a compelling case that most women benefit greatly from being on postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy, and can do so without increasing their risk of breast cancer. We also cover the history of HRT, the impact of the Women’s Health Initiative, and take a deep dive into each of the clinical conditions for which HRT should be considered, such as cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disease, and osteoporosis, to name a few.

Dr. Bluming has graciously offered his email to take questions directly from fans of this podcast: avrumzbluming@gmail.com

We discuss:

This episode features Dr. Jason Fung, a nephrologist specializing in using fasting protocols to treat type 2 diabetes and metabolic disorders. The discussion centers on two main themes: a new paradigm for understanding insulin resistance (reframing it as hyperinsulinemia) and the clinical application of fasting protocols. Dr. Fung challenges conventional medical wisdom about treating type 2 diabetes and presents evidence for why fasting might be one of the most effective interventions for metabolic disease.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Hyperinsulinemia is proposed as a better framework than insulin resistance [1:01:36]
- Fatty liver drives insulin resistance and fatty pancreas leads to beta cell dysfunction [1:07:00]
- Type 2 diabetes reversal is possible through fasting protocols [2:04:32]
- Bariatric surgery results can be replicated through "medical bariatrics" (fasting) [1:52:26]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Consider time-restricted feeding as an entry point to fasting [2:00:14]
- Monitor electrolytes during extended fasts [2:22:36]
- Start with shorter fasting windows before attempting longer fasts [2:08:06]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- Phosphatidylserine for sleep during fasting [1:20:48]
- Magnesium supplementation during fasting [2:28:31]
- Bone broth for electrolyte support [2:28:31]

5. **Nutrition & Diet**:
- Time-restricted feeding (16/8 protocol) as entry point [2:00:14]
- Extended fasting protocols (3-7 days) for severe cases [2:03:36]
- Importance of breaking cultural eating patterns [1:45:44]

6. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Albumin-to-creatinine ratio for early warning [1:27:04]
- Insulin levels more important than glucose levels [1:04:14]
- GFR monitoring for kidney function [1:28:41]

7. **Notable Quotes**:
"The problem is not insulin resistance per se, it's actually the hyperinsulinemia" [1:13:42]

8. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What is the optimal protocol for transitioning from time-restricted feeding to extended fasting?
2. How does fasting affect various inflammatory markers?
3. What role does cortisol play in fasting success/failure?

This analysis captures the main points while maintaining the timestamp references as requested. Would you like me to expand on any particular section?

Full title: #64 – Zol Kryger, M.D.: Navigating the sometimes shady world of plastic surgery—understanding potential complications of common procedures and how to reduce your risk by choosing the right doctor and asking the right questions

Original release date: 7/29/19

In this episode, board certified plastic surgeon, Zol Kryger, enlightens us about the frighteningly loose laws regulating the industry of plastic surgery, paving the way for a majority of cosmetic procedures being performed by doctors that are not board certified plastic surgeons. We talk about some of the very serious complications that can occur even in “minimally invasive” procedures, where the incidence rate is only increased by the flood of non-certified doctors who want to offer these procedures to augment their income. Fortunately, Zol provides listeners with a very specific list of important questions to ask a surgeon when considering any of the many cosmetic procedures available. We then go into the specifics of the most common procedures and the risk of complications for each of them, including breast augmentation, tummy tucks, liposuction, Brazilian butt lifts, botox and fillers, facial peels and lasers, and more. By the end of this episode, you’ll have a really clear understanding of what these risks are and how you can go about reducing those risks by choosing the right physician.

We discuss:
-Why Zol chose plastic surgery [7:30];
-The shockingly high percentage of plastic surgery being done by non-board certified doctors, and the laws that allow it to happen [11:20];
-10 Questions to Ask Your Cosmetic Surgeon (PDF Download) [21:00];
-Complications: Why you must ask your doctor about potential complications and how they would deal with them [24:20];
-Zol’s first complication, how he dealt with it, and how having a partner to check your work is great for the doctor and patient [32:30];
-Breast augmentation: What you need to know—types of implants, complication rates, and Zol’s summary of the safest and most effective way to do it [39:10];
-Breast reconstruction following a mastectomy [1:06:30];
-Tummy tuck: how it’s done, biggest risks involved, scarring, and how it can address hernias and diastasis [1:13:00];
-Liposuction: How it works, the potential complications and risks involved, and the importance of choosing the right doctor in the “wild west” of liposuction [1:26:45];
-Butt lifts: Rising popularity, major risks, the frighteningly loose laws regulating the industry, and how the butt lift industry is eerily similar to the subprime mortgage crisis [1:37:00];
-What is it about plastic surgery (and not other segments of medicine) that compels (and allows for) untrained doctors to offer these procedures? [1:49:45];
-Peter asks Zol if he ever feels emotionally conflicted working in an industry that sometimes can feed off the vanity and insecurity of people [1:56:25];
-Does Zol ever turn down patients? [2:02:45];
-The risks involved with botox, fillers, facial peels, and laser treatments [2:07:45]; and

## Description

Full title: #60 – Annie Duke, decision strategist: Poker as a model system for life—how to improve decision making, use frameworks for learning, and apply ‘backcasting’ to boost your odds for future success

Original release date: 7/1/19

In this episode, former World Series of Poker champion and author, Annie Duke, explains how poker is a pertinent model system for decision making in the real world, a system which blends imperfect information with some unknown percentage of both luck and skill. We go through the decision-making matrix, and how we spend most of our energy focusing on just one of the four quadrants at the expense of the learning opportunities that come from the other 75% of situations. Annie also shares how this evaluation of only the bad outcomes (and our tendency to judge others more harshly than ourselves in the face of a non-status quo decision), leads individuals, leaders, and teams to avoid bad outcomes at all costs. This avoidance is at the cost of the types of decisions which lead to progress and innovation both personally, and societally, across many realms from poker to sports to business to medicine. We also dive deep into a framework for learning, and the levels of thought required to rise to the top of a given domain. Finally, we talk about something that resonated deeply with me in terms of how I think about extending healthspan, which is the concept of “backcasting”.

We discuss:
-Annie’s background, favorite sports teams, and Peter’s affinity for Belichick [7:30];
-Chess vs. poker: Which is a better metaphor for decision making in life (and medicine)? [12:30];
-Thinking probabilistically: Why we aren’t wired that way, and how you can improve it for better decision making [18:15];
-Variable reinforcement: The psychological draw of poker that keeps people playing [25:15];
-The role of luck and skill in poker (and other sports), and the difference between looking at the short run vs. long run [38:00];
-A brief explanation of Texas hold ‘em [47:00];
-The added complexity of reading the behavior of others players in poker [53:15]
-Why Annie likes to “quit fast”, and why poker is still popular despite the power of loss aversion [58:30]
-Limit vs. no limit poker, and how the game has changed with growing popularity [1:01:00]
-The advent of analytics to poker, and why Annie would get crushed against today’s professionals [1:10:30]
-The decision matrix, and the ‘resulting’ heuristic: The simplifier we use to judge the quality of decisions —The Pete Carroll Superbowl play call example [1:16:30]
-The personal and societal consequences of avoiding bad outcomes [1:27:00]
-Poker as a model system for life [1:37:15]
-How many leaders are making (and encouraging) status-quo decisions, and how Bill Belichick’s decision making changed after winning two Super Bowls [1:41:00]
-What did we learn about decision making from the Y2K nothingburger? And how about the D-Day invasion? [1:46:30]
-The first step to becoming a good decision maker [1:48:45]
-The difference between elite poker players and the ones who make much slower progress [1:55:30]
-Framework for learning a skill, the four levels of thought, and why we hate digging into our victories to see what happened [1:58:15]
-The capacity for self-deception, and when it is MOST important to apply four-level thinking [2:06:15]
-Soft landings: The challenge of high-level thinking where there is subtle feedback and wider skill gaps [2:16:45]
-The benefits of ‘backcasting’ (and doing pre-mortems) [2:19:30];
-Parting advice from Annie for those feeling overwhelmed (and two book recommendations) [2:28:30]

Original release date: 7/8/19

In this episode, radiologist/engineer, Raj Attariwala, explains how he was able to apply his engineering background to create a unique MRI scanner that is capable of constructing whole-body images with a resolution that is unmatched in the industry. Peter and Raj discuss the implications of such a robust, radiation-free imaging tool on the early detection of cancer. They dive deep into cancer screening and define terms such as sensitivity and specificity that are necessary to really understand this complex space. They then describe the biggest risks involved in this type of screening (false positives) and how Raj’s unique technology and process might drive down this risk substantially. But before that, they discuss all the common imaging technology from X-ray, to CT scan, to PET scans, to ultrasound, to MRI, and more. They touch on the history of each, how they work, the usefulness and limitations of each of them, as well as the varying risks involved such as radiation exposure. If you are interested in cancer screening and/or you’ve ever wondered how any radiology tool works, this episode is for you.

We discuss:
-Raj’s road from engineering to radiology [7:45];
-How X-ray works, the risk of radiation exposure, and the varying amounts of radiation associated with the different imaging technologies [18:00];
-Computed tomography scans (CT scans): The history of CT, how it works, and why we use contrast [27:45];
-Ultrasound: Benefits and limitations, and a special use for the heart [40:45];

## Description

Full title: #70 – David Sinclair, Ph.D.: How cellular reprogramming could slow our aging clock (and the latest research on NAD)

Original release date: 9/9/19

In this episode, David Sinclair, Ph.D., a Professor in the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and co-Director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biological Mechanisms of Aging, returns to the podcast to discuss the content of his new book, Lifespan: Why We Age – and Why We Don’t Have To. This conversation focuses on the biological mechanisms involved in what David terms the Information Theory of Aging which provides insights into the “clock” that determines our aging and to what degree it can be manipulated. Our discussion on aging of course leads us into interconnected topics of epigenetics, sirtuins, cellular senescence, as well as what compounds David is personally taking for his own longevity. Additionally, we discuss the most up to date information related to NAD and longevity by looking at the potential benefits (if any) of supplemental agents (NAD precursors, NR, NMR, etc.) that pose a promise of increasing NAD.

We discuss:
-SIR genes and cellular identity [8:45];
-Sirtuins regulate gene expression [14:30];
-DNA is methylated at the deepest layer of the epigenome [17:45];
-Methylation pattern and determining cellular age [20:15];
-Cellular reprogramming [33:45];
-Yamanaka factors to push cells “back in time”  [41:00];

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the podcast episode on blood flow restriction (BFR) training:

1. **Executive Summary**:
The episode features a detailed discussion with Jeremy Loenneke about blood flow restriction training, its mechanisms, applications, and relationship to muscle strength and hypertrophy. Key topics include the physiology of muscle contraction, fiber types, and the controversial relationship between muscle size and strength. The discussion challenges conventional wisdom about the causal relationship between hypertrophy and strength gains.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- BFR involves reducing blood flow to muscles during exercise without completely occluding it [00:45:00]
- Optimal BFR pressure is typically 40-80% of arterial occlusion pressure [00:50:00]
- Type 1 (slow-twitch) and Type 2 (fast-twitch) muscle fibers exist on a continuum rather than distinct categories [00:15:00]
- Traditional belief that muscle growth causes strength gains is challenged by recent research [01:15:00]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Start with 40% arterial occlusion pressure for BFR training [00:48:00]
- Use lighter weights (20-30% of 1RM) with BFR [01:00:00]

Context-specific recommendations:
- For maximum strength gains, traditional heavy lifting (80-100% 1RM) is still necessary [01:20:00]
- BFR is particularly useful in rehabilitation settings [01:25:00]

4. **Exercise & Movement**:
- Recommended BFR protocol: 30 reps, then 3 sets of 15 reps with 30-second rest periods [00:55:00]
- Total time under BFR should be limited to 7-10 minutes per exercise [01:05:00]
- Can be used with both isolation and compound movements, though isolation exercises may be safer [01:10:00]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"If you're training for maximal strength in getting as strong as possible, you probably don't care whether it's a mechanism or not, you just want to know how do I get strong." [01:30:00]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. Long-term effects of regular BFR training
2. Optimal pressure protocols for different populations
3. Role of BFR in preventing muscle loss in elderly populations
4. Potential applications in various medical conditions

**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR9i2aPD29s
**Duration:** 138 minutes

## Description

Robert (Bob) Gatenby is a radiologist who specializes in exploring theoretical and experimental models of evolutionary dynamics in cancer and cancer drug resistance. He has developed an adaptive therapy approach for treating cancer which has shown promise in improving survival times with less cumulative drug use. In this episode, Bob explains what brought him into medicine, his search for organizing principles from which to understand cancer, and the mathematical modeling of other complex systems that led him to model the dynamics of tumor cell changes in cancer. He discusses his pilot clinical trial treating metastatic prostate cancer, in which he used an evolutionary game theory model to analyze patient-specific tumor dynamics and determine the on/off cycling of treatment. He describes how altering chemotherapy to maximize the fitness ratio between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cells can increase patient survival and explains how treatment of metastatic cancer may be improved using adaptive therapy and strategic sequencing of different chemotherapy drugs.

We discuss:
00:00:00 - intro
00:00:10 - Bob’s unlikely path to medicine and his disappointment with his medical school experience
00:12:30 - Rethinking the approach to cancer: using first principles and applying mathematical models

In this episode, Peter sits down with Drs. Marty Makary and Zubin Damania (aka ZDoggMD), both previous guests on The Drive. Marty is a Johns Hopkins professor and public health researcher and ZDoggMD is a UCSF Stanford trained internist and the founder of Turntable Health. This episode, recorded on December 27, 2021, was in part inspired by some of the shoddy science and even worse messaging coming from top officials regarding COVID-19. 

In this discussion, Marty and ZDoggMD discuss what is known about the omicron variant, the risks and benefits of vaccines for all age groups, and the taboo subject of natural immunity and the protection it offers against infection and severe disease. Furthermore, they discuss at length the poor messaging coming from our public officials, the justification (and lack thereof) for certain mandates and policies in light of the current evidence, and the problems caused by the highly politicized and polarized nature of the subject. Themes throughout the conversation include the difference between science and advocacy, the messaging which is sowing mistrust in science despite major progress, and a search for what a possible “end” to this situation might look like. 

NOTE: Since this episode was recorded over the holiday and published ASAP, this is an audio-only episode with limited show notes.

We discuss:
00:04:15 - Comparing omicron to delta and other mutations
00:13:15 - Measuring immunity and protection from severe disease—circulating antibodies, B cells, and T cells 
00:18:45 - Policy questions: what is the end game and how does the world go back to 2019?
00:24:00 - A policy-minded framework for viewing COVID and the problem of groupthink
00:39:00 - The difference between science and advocacy
00:46:00 - Natural immunity from COVID after infection 
00:57:15 - The unfortunate erosion of trust in science despite impressive progress 
01:02:30 - Do the current mandates and policies make sense in light of existing data?
01:18:15 - Risks associated with vaccines, and the risk of being labeled an anti-vaxxer when questioning them
01:26:15 - Data on incidence of myocarditis after vaccination with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines 
01:35:00 - Outstanding questions about myocarditis as a side effect of mRNA vaccination and the benefit of boosters
01:40:30 - The risk-reward of boosters and recommendations being ignored by policy makers in the US
01:43:30 - Sowing distrust: Lack of honesty and humility from top officials and policy makers ;
01:52:15 - Thoughts on testing: does it make sense to be pushing widespread testing for COVID?
01:58:45 - What is the end point to all of this? 
02:05:30 - Downstream consequences of lockdowns and draconian policy measures 
02:10:30 - The polarized nature of COVID—tribalism, skeptics, and demonization of ideas
02:20:00 - Looking back at past pandemics for perspective and the potential for another pandemic in the future
02:25:00 - What parents can do if their kids are subject to unreasonable policies
02:28:45 - Voices of reason in this space

Rick Johnson, Professor of Nephrology at the University of Colorado and a previous guest on The Drive, returns for a follow-up about unique features of fructose metabolism, and how this system that aided the survival of human ancestors has become potentially hazardous based on our culture’s dietary norms. In this episode, Rick explains how the body can generate fructose from glucose and how circulating glucose and salt levels can activate this conversion. He discusses the decline in metabolic flexibility associated with aging, as well as how factors such as sugar intake or menopause-associated hormone changes can alter responses to sugar across a lifetime. In addition, Rick lays out strategies for combating the development of metabolic illness using dietary changes and pharmaceutical therapies, and he discusses the impact of fructose metabolism and uric acid on kidney function and blood pressure. He concludes with a discussion of vasopressin, a hormone that facilitates fructose’s effects on weight gain and insulin resistance.

Mike Gershon is a Professor of Pathology and Cell Biology at Columbia University and has been at the forefront of studying neural control of the gut for the past 60 years. In this episode, Mike gives a tour de force on the pathways of gut-brain communication but first sets the stage with an overview of gastrointestinal tract development and anatomy. He then explains how the gut communicates with the brain and vice versa, from early observations in physiology and anatomy up to our present understanding of what makes the GI tract so unique and complex relative to other organs. He talks about how the gut responds to meals of different food qualities and how that affects satiety signaling to the brain. Additionally, he explains how antidepressants and other drugs impact digestion through effects on serotonin signaling, and he discusses the effects of antibiotics, and what’s really going on with “leaky gut.” Finally, Mike offers his thoughts on the utility—or lack thereof—of gut microbiome diagnostic tests, and wraps up the discussion by considering how diet, probiotics, and prebiotics impact the microbiome and GI tract.

Josh Rabinowitz is a Professor of Chemistry and Integrative Genomics at Princeton University, where his research focuses on developing a quantitative, comprehensive understanding of cellular metabolism through the study of metabolites and their fluxes. In this episode, Josh focuses the discussion on three main topics: metabolomics, NAD (and its precursors), and cancer metabolism. The metabolomics discussion starts with a broad definition of metabolism, metabolites, and fluxomics before diving deep into glucose metabolism, lactate as a fuel, movement of lactate, and the regulation of these substrates. He then gives a detailed explanation of the electron transport chain and Krebs cycle and their implications with respect to both drugs and nutrition while also explaining how NAD is central to the process of energy generation. He then discusses the age-related decline in NAD and what current literature says about efforts to increase NAD through intravenous or oral supplementation with the precursors NMN and NR, including whether doing so provides any advantage to lifespan or healthspan. Finally, Josh ends the conversation talking about cancer metabolism and how one particular intersection between cancer metabolism and immunotherapy might provide a hopeful outlook on the future of cancer treatment.

Don Layman is a Professor of Food Science and Human Nutrition at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. He has spent the past 40 years investigating the role of dietary protein in muscle protein synthesis. In this episode, Don describes how his decades of research have shaped his thinking around protein, muscle, anabolic factors, metabolism, and more. He explains the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein: what it is, how it came about, and how it should serve only as a guide for the minimum protein necessary for survival rather than as an optimal level of protein intake. He provides an overview of the essential amino acids, explains the nuances of animal versus plant protein, and provides insights for determining protein quality, absorption rates, and how to best track your intake. He discusses the ideal timing of protein intake in relation to resistance exercise, how protein should be distributed among meals, and how limitations in protein utilization per sitting can impact those practicing time-restricted eating. Additionally, Don shares results from his clinical trials, including how a high-protein diet fared in terms of fat loss, and explains the differences in protein utilization between adolescents and adults and how the problem of reduced efficiency of protein utilization in older adults can be overcome.

Erin Michos is an internationally-known leader in preventive cardiology and women’s cardiovascular health. In this episode, Erin discusses current trends in cardiovascular disease (CVD) through the lens of female biology and the observation that major adverse cardiac events in both sexes are on the rise. She walks through risk factors including LDL-cholesterol, apoB, and Lp(a) and makes the case for the importance of early preventative measures. She explains various interventions for reducing risk including a discussion of statins, GLP-1 agonists, PCSK9-inhibitors, and drugs that lower Lp(a). She goes in-depth on female-specific factors that contribute to CVD risk such as pregnancy, grand multiparity (having five or more children), oral contraceptives, menopause, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Bill Perkins is one of the world’s most successful hedge fund managers and entrepreneurs, and the author of the bestseller, Die With Zero. In this episode, Bill unpacks the Die With Zero philosophy which challenges conventional thinking related to the balance between health, wealth, and time—the three variables important for fulfillment. Bill makes the case that we should strive for maximum net fulfillment rather than net worth (or even health). He argues that we need to optimize our life to have memorable experiences before it’s too late and that most people are over-saving and under-living. Bill also explains how one can apply the principles in Die With Zero to break out of “autopilot” and optimize their life to achieve maximum net fulfillment.

Dan Rader is a Professor at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, where he conducts translational research on lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis with a particular focus on the function of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). In this episode, Dan goes in-depth on HDL biology, including the genesis of HDL, its metabolism, function, and how this relates to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). He explains why having high HDL-C levels does not directly translate to a low risk of cardiovascular disease and reveals research pointing to a better way to measure the functionality of HDL and predict disease risk. He also goes into detail on the role of HDL in reverse cholesterol transport and the benefits this has for reducing ASCVD. Additionally, Dan discusses the latest thinking around the association between HDL cholesterol and neurodegenerative diseases and ends the conversation with a discussion of how the latest research on HDL provides a promising outlook for ongoing trials and future therapeutic interventions.

We discuss:
-The lipidology of apoB and apoA [4:00];
-A primer on the high-density lipoprotein (HDL): genesis, structure, and more [9:30];
-How the lipoprotein system differs in humans compared to other mammals [20:00];
-Clarifying the terminology around HDL and apoA [25:30];
HDL metabolism [31:45];
-CETP inhibitors for raising HDL-C: does it reduce CVD risk? [34:45];
-Why it’s so important to have hard outcome trials in the field of cardiovascular medicine [42:30];
-SR-B1: an HDL receptor important for cholesterol efflux [48:00];
-The association between HDL levels and atherosclerosis: are they causally linked? [53:15];
-How insulin resistance is impacting HDL, and how HDL-C provides insights into triglyceride metabolism [58:00];
-Disappointing results from the studies of niacin—a drug that raises HDL-C and lowers apoB [1:08:15];
-HDL lipidation, dilapidation, and reverse cholesterol transport [1:12:00];
