**Duration:** 195 minutes

## Description

Sean Mackey is a professor of pain medicine at Stanford University & the director of the Stanford Systems Neuroscience & Pain Lab, where his research explores the neural mechanisms of pain & the development of novel treatments for chronic pain. In this episode, Sean joins Peter for a wide-ranging discussion on the multifaceted nature of pain—as both a sensory & emotional experience—& its evolutionary purpose as a critical survival mechanism. He dives into how pain is transmitted through the nervous system, the different types of pain, & why different individuals perceive pain so differently. Sean shares insights into pain management strategies ranging from medications like NSAIDs & opioids to neuromodulation techniques such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Additionally, this episode explores the interplay between sleep & chronic pain & the psychological & emotional dimensions of pain, & it includes a personal story from Peter about his own experience with pain & how Sean’s expertise helped him more than two decades ago.
