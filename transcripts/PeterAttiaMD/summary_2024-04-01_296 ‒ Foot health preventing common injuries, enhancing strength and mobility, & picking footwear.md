1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features a detailed discussion with Courtney (last name not mentioned), a chiropractor specializing in foot health and biomechanics. The conversation covers foot anatomy, common pathologies, preventive measures, and treatment approaches. Key focus areas include the importance of toe strength in fall prevention, proper footwear selection, and the relationship between foot health and overall body mechanics.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
