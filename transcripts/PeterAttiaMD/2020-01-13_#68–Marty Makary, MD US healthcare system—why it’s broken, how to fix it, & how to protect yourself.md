## Description

Full title: #68 – Marty Makary, M.D.: The US healthcare system—why it’s broken, steps to fix it, and how to protect yourself

Original release date: 8/26/19

In this episode, Marty Makary, Johns Hopkins surgeon and NYT bestselling author, discusses his new book, The Price We Pay, and his ambitious attempt to fix the broken U.S. healthcare system through educating the public, changing the lexicon, encouraging radical transparency in pricing, and more. We go in detail into the main drivers of inflated health care costs, the money games being played making it hard to understand, and the unfortunate system structure that has resulted in one in five Americans finding themselves in medical debt collections which can ruin the lives of people and families seeking basic medical care. Marty also shares some very practical advice and tips if you find yourself a victim of predatory pricing and stuck with an outrageous medical bill. In the end, despite the current state of the system, Marty discusses the many exciting trends gaining traction in healthcare and why he is very optimistic and hopeful about the future. 

We discuss:
-The science of delivering healthcare, how we need to do better as a system, and why no single person or entity fully to blame [10:15];
-The stories that prompted Marty to write his first book (Unaccountable) [19:15];

## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic

[00:01:04] I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming

[00:01:23] I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our shows members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:25] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription my guest this week is dr. Marty Meharry marty is who's a close personal friend from residency we overlapped when he was a fellow at Hopkins and I was a resident he's currently a professor of surgical oncology in the chief of the islet transplant center at Johns Hopkins and

[00:04:26] Wow so much of his work and professional accolades come from his surgical career and the work that he does in pancreatic surgery especially in minimally invasive pancreatic surgery Marty is one of the pioneering surgeons in doing one of the most complicated operations that's ever done which is removing the head of the pancreas minimally invasively meaning laparoscopically something I can't even fathom because at the time of my training that wasn't even something that was considered we actually don't touch on that one bit because there's so many other things that we really wanted to talk about the other thing that Marty is really known for is being one of the co-creators of the surgical checklist this is something that has made its way up to the w-h-o safe surgery save lives committee today many of you if you're ever in the hospital if you're ever having a surgical procedure will encounter this checklist because it's the thing that makes sure that people don't get operated on the wrong side which is actually something that happened to me when I was in medical school and it actually is something

[00:05:24] Marty wrote about in his first book which was a New York Times bestseller called unaccountable and it's actually that book that became the basis for a very very popular television show called the resident which is based on Marty's work we touched on that briefly but most of what we talk about is the material and the content that's featured in his upcoming book the price we pay which will be available shortly and this book really takes on Marty's next challenge because if figuring out how to weigh hey to who do the most complicated pancreatic surgery remenham ly invasive standpoint wasn't enough and then going after medical errors and trying to figure out a way to fix the system that makes it too easy to commit medical arrogance well if that wasn't enough you know Marty's decided the next thing that he's interested in trying to address is the broken healthcare system which I think anybody listening to this knows in the United

[00:06:13] States is pretty clear what I like about Marty is he isn't one of these guys who's trying to put the single silver bullet and blame it all on one thing that's all drug prices or it's all this or it's all that what follows is a pretty nuanced discussion that it sometimes makes me really upset there were times during this interview where I just couldn't leave the stories he was telling and I think many of you will be equally upset by these things and find it totally unacceptable but at the same time when it was all said and done and as is often the case when these podcasts finish and the mic is off we keep talking and I think to myself oh I wish we recorded that because that was probably the most interesting part of the discussion we had but I actually came away before Marty left my apartment

[00:06:53] I came away realizing there's actually hope here and I've actually never felt that there was hope for this problem I truly thought that the US healthcare system is something that will drive itself off a cliff until it bankrupts us and that is the end of it and I came away from this discussion thinking no there are actual steps that could be taken to fix these structural errors that have allowed people with in some cases very good intentions in some cases reasonable intentions and in rare cases horrible intentions to basically create the most financially irresponsible system that I think has ever existed in the free market if you're listening to this and wondering why does this concern you

[00:07:34] I believe it concerns almost anybody because anybody who's ever received an explanation of benefits that made no sense anybody who's ever received a medical bill that seemed ridiculous anybody who's ever known anyone who's been chased down by a collections agency which sadly the numbers of Americans who experiences is staggering you'll want to listen to this because I thought I understood this system well enough that

[00:07:57] I could coexist with it I learned so much from Marty about what people can do to protect themselves from this sort of predatory pricing that is I mean literally gouging the pocketbooks of people I think if nothing else you will come away from this episode with a greater sense of empowerment and how you can protect yourself in such situations and protect the people that you care about I'll share with you just one statistic that breaks my heart I believe it's one in four maybe one in five women who undergo treatment for breast cancer about a year after their treatment is currently being pursued by coal

[00:08:35] Asians agency for some sort of ridiculous predatory pricing scheme that resulted from the treatment to know that a patient now based on some of the work that Marty has done have steps that they can take to put an end to that kind of stuff and fight for their rights is just one of the many things in this episode that kind of gave me some comfort so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with my good friend dr.

[00:09:00] Marty Macri hey Marty how are you man great to see you Peter I love that I can see you twice in two days it's awesome awesome proud of you everything you're doing helping a lot of people out there so just really great to see you yeah well not as many as you you know it's funny whenever I'm doing a podcast I'm sort of going over a person's bio and

[00:09:20] I've had the luxury of interviewing a number of friends for this podcast and so I'm thinking to myself yesterday I don't really need to review Marty's by oh I don't Marty he but my team was kind enough to pull the bio together and they sent it to me and I was reading it and I was like goddamn what happened how did all of my friends leapfrog 27 steps ahead of me and I say that without any

[00:09:41] Envy just complete admiration I was with Jorge Salazar a few months ago and it's just another one of those examples of like all these guys that we trained with Ted Shaffer is the head of neurology at Northwestern and Jorge's building the pediatric cardiac surgery program in Houston I mean like when did Marty even become a professor how did you fully I mean dude you are accomplished man

[00:10:02] Hopkins is a special place just as you've suggested and I love it just as you loved it there but I've always had a special affinity for individuals that are highly creative a little too creative for the mold in medicine and so you're one of those guys that's why it's just so great to see you here and be with you it's a kind way of putting it there are a lot of things I want to talk about but among them of course is you've got a new book that's coming out really soon and this is your third book but really you're second on the topic of

[00:10:32] Medicine in a pretty serious way let's start with your first book though because that was that's almost 10 years old now isn't it yeah unaccountable coming on eight years yeah eight years what prompted you to write that and of course what some people probably don't know is that a show that many people love called the resident is actually based on that we'll talk about the show in a minute but let's talk about the book unaccountable yeah unaccountable to me was an opportunity to talk about what we all talk about but engage the general public in a way that both brings honor to medicine and at the same time warns people that it's important to get a second opinion it's important to ask certain questions I've always been amazed even from my days as a medical student where I was lucky enough to work with two of the leaders of the field of patient safety Ellucian

[00:11:17] Leap and David Bates at Harvard and at that time they were sort of radicals they were talking about hey not only can you study infectious diseases for cancer but you can study the science of delivering health care like medical mistakes and how that harms patients and then you go from that academic concept to surgical residency where it's like you can debate on a policy level should we ration care but like on-call in the trauma Bay you're rationing care every minute it's like look on the ground it's a different world it's relentless and they seem completely detached by the way complete like there's nothing in residency that and maybe it's changed but I'm guessing it hasn't changed that much there is nothing to prepare you for or teach you about those types of questions and decisions exactly when I was at DC general City Hospital in

[00:12:09] Washington DC as part of my residency at Georgetown and there was an open elevator door and somebody walked into the elevator shaft thinking that elevator was there but it was just the shaft oh my god and fell in and died I don't mean to make light of it but it was a tragedy and they had her picture up everywhere and the door remained in the open position with the open shaft for three more weeks haven't we learned our lesson what do you mean they didn't put a barrier there's no barrier there was no cone there's no do not cross tape or anything and to me this was like the ultimate story of how hospitals were not learning from their own mistakes and three weeks later another person walked into this opened elevator shaft and didn't die but fell down and hurt themselves you just think who is watching for the whole ship who's in charge here and those sort of experiences and we see them all the time as residents you'd see the elevator button wasn't working to the helipad or the person in the x-ray counter refused to give you x-rays because they had their own little policy that they made up and you're just like can't somebody just look at the whole picture so it made me think about systems hospital systems redesigning the delivery of care and I think all of those questions naturally open up the question of how can we do better how do we harm people and the lexicon is tricky right because if you call it a medical mistake doctors get very very defensive and we work so hard to get to where we are by the way John Cameron who people may or may not know maybe the most famous surgeon in the United States I spoke with him just before I came here and he told me are you gonna see Peter attea he was the best resident we've ever had at

[00:13:57] Johns Hopkins and when you did your time at the NIH in research he said Steve Rosenberg who's head of the NIH science surgery site said Peter was the best researcher we've ever had at the NIH doing his research anyway we work our tails off in that residency right and then to have someone say oh you screwed up it's like well wait a minute it wasn't me it was the system or I'm overloaded and the reality is it is a systems issue so the lexicon is important if you call something a medical mistake then it assumes you're blaming somebody but if you say the patient experienced medical care gone wrong it's a more patient term now we have a lexicon in medicine that sterilizes everything we call things a preventable adverse event just kind of washes anybody clean of any responsibility right but as medical care gone wrong and in the pricing world it's the same thing if you talk about health care costs it's kind of nebulous but if

[00:14:54] I told you the price of healthcare has gotten out of control it's like talking about gas prices versus petroleum futures or something it hits home medicine has a way of creating its own lexicon and it really has a value system behind it so one of the things I've tried to do at least with the platform that I've been given from my surgical career at Hopkins is say we change the lexicon how can we look at the systems and the delivery of care how can we make sure somebody's in charge of the overall ship so the elevator door closes or somebody for the love of humanity put a cone in front of an empty elevator shaft we laugh at that example not as you said because of the tragedy of what took place but because of the absurdity of it but what's really scary is the far less absurd errors that take place and I knew we were gonna be talking about this stuff and I was trying to think of some of the non absurd mistakes that I made as a resident and more importantly it's the lack of a system in which one could make the mistakes I think we just didn't know any better it's only now I had the luxury of leaving medicine for many years before even coming back to it a sort of different capacity so I don't think it was until I fully left that I realized holy cow that was the Wild West man and we were doing our best I mean that was sort of to me one of the real beauties of being at Hopkins in addition to I mean I chose Hopkins as the place I wanted to go because of John Cameron who was the chair of surgery Charlie Oh

[00:16:23] Keith Willem oh it was basically three people who I had never met before I interviewed there was the reason I wanted to go right guys so you had these three total legends and then you had this idea if you were gonna go to the epicenter of the surgical residency program William Stewart Halsted creates this program in the late 1800s and there was this sort of lineage of what was going on you're in this place that's in theory the best place in the world and yet on day one I remember the responsibilities I was given and I'm thinking oh my god am I good enough to do this am i and the other thing that humbled me was the absolute faith that the patients had in us and it really humbled me really made me think they think I'm better than I am they completely trust me and how do i balance communicating my own insecurities about even the most trivial thing and give you a silly example your priapic a patient and you're putting an IV in them and you're thinking to yourself I'm not even that good at this yet I mean this patient is going to potentially stuck three times while I fumble to put an IV in them because the anesthesiologist couldn't be here right now to do it and I'm sort of filling in and yet they're stoic Lee sitting there thinking well I'm at Johns Hopkins I think that's the nature of a teaching hospital so that's part of what we're supposed to be doing but when it starts to get to the really serious stuff I think there were many times woman certainly I felt like I was out of my lane you realize you walk into this incredible lineage historically of public trust in the profession and a patient you meet in the emergency room will trust you to put a knife to their skin within two seconds of meeting you or the tell you secrets they've never told their spouse of 30 years just because you're the doc and it's this incredible sort of ah inspiring Wow they trust me more than I trust myself I remember trying to put a central line into a difficult patient you know at 3:00 a.m. the patient probably didn't even need the line and that we were put in central lines and everybody I was putting central lines food people in the parking lot practically what I I mean you didn't want to have your chief resident walk in and say why doesn't this patient have a central line and lose it so you just put a central and everybody on this service for fear of getting yelled at it was just absurd the things we used to do like that and I remember one night I tried to put a central line couldn't get it and I signed it out to the other resident and I said I tried I couldn't get it I tried I don't know five six times and then he went to do it and he said I was able to get it by the way I think you tried more than five or six times I said what do you mean he says other word twenty introducer holes in the neck area where you win and I thought gosh the patient was ventilated they were intubated I just had no idea how difficult it could be and the mantra was you just try again and again until you get something right that's the surgical mentality that's sort of the ideas that you will perfect it and if it takes a million times it takes a million times yeah so what year did you start working on that book I mean you and I had spoken about some stories that even ended up in the book years before so obviously the idea had been with you for probably ten years but when did you actually like kind of put pen to paper and start saying I'm gonna do this thing

[00:19:36] I remember telling my dad who's a hematologist or Leukemia Lymphoma expert I remember telling him that I was seeing things in the hospital as a student and as a resident that were just mind-boggling I couldn't really grasp with the collision of sociological issues to see us spend a million dollars rescuing a patient only to go out and have them repeat that behavior that brought them in or a new medication finally get invented in the pharma world and brought to the bedside but Doc's just didn't feel like giving it or weren't aware of it and you thought wow the implementation science of medicine is more challenging than the discovery science and if you can invent Kevlar but people don't wear it it's a failure of the delivery or implementation I thought this is where the opportunity is and then I think you know part of things in my career were right time right place right that's when everyone started to say hey wait a minute we could deliver care better safer more reliably but I told my dad these stories about stuff I was seeing and there's this one patient

[00:20:42] I basically didn't want anything done sometimes as a resident you connect with a patient at the bedside and you realize they really don't want this surgery that they're gonna have done and you communicate that to your team and you were great about communicating you had no hesitations to say this is what the patient believes or I'm concerned about this and hyper communicators do great in surgery they do great in medical school they do great in surgery they're annoying in the real world but in surgery you want that non-stop communication are you going to the emergency room should I come with you are you gonna get these lab tests where should I stand in the operating room those are the communicators we love it's always amusing I have every now and then a parent who will call and say my son who's in high school it wants to go to

[00:21:27] Hopkins Medical School can you help him or talk to him he has amazing hands he was putting puzzles together age too it's like they're all learned techniques okay there's no gifted hands they're all learned techniques and by the way we're not gonna help anyone kid give him preference and getting into med school but he realized there was this when I was a resident there was this patient who just did not want surgery and the doctors insisted that she have this invasive biopsy in order to figure out what they can her type was but the cat-scan essentially said it was clear what this cancer type was and the biopsy was just to confirm it and I remember the patient just but regardless of that she didn't want the surgery to remove it period yeah presumably she was old or yeah she was old and she lived alone and she didn't want the biopsy the invasive biopsy she wouldn't want a surgery to remove it if the biopsy confirmed so she was basically saying I just want to go home and sort of live the last few weeks months of my life in peace yes leave me alone and I thought well maybe it's important to prognosticate to tell her you've got maybe two months four you've got six months the reality is we never really know like we have any clue yeah exactly so I remember telling the team she didn't want anything done well we have to do the biopsy because we don't know what it is I'm like well she doesn't care what it is we have to get it well why do we have to get it to know we have to know and I'm just looking at this train that just will not stop and listen to patients and I'm thinking how did we get to this point where we just do stuff on people who don't want things done and you look on a broad scale now as I've been researching the cost crisis for this new book the price we pay healthcare is now the number one industry in the United States it is the number one business as of January 2018 entire cities have been transformed I mean look at Pittsburgh it used to be a big steel town my home state of

[00:23:21] Pennsylvania you look around it's all health care all the tall buildings are health care health insurance health administration and you realize how did we get to a point where we've created this train that sometimes doesn't listen to patients and my dad said write these stories down Marty because you'll be amazed how you forget when you go on and someday you'll be teaching residents and students and these are important things to remember and that's when I started writing things down for the book unaccountable the TV show the resident by the way did a beautiful and it brought a tear to my eye they did a beautiful description of that case where that patient wanted nothing done in the

[00:23:57] TV show that patient simply said I want to go home and clean the garage I don't want to leave my wife with the mess I've accumulated over my lifetime it was beautiful to me that was the most amazing part of being a part of that show yeah my mother-in-law is obsessed with that show and she didn't realize it was based on you and your book and of course for the listener my mother-in-law was kind of a funny story here because she used to work for

[00:24:20] Charlie Oh who is one of these legends that drew me to Hopkins and so she was actually one of the first people I ever met at Hopkins because the day I showed up I wanted to go and meet Charlie oh so I went up to the office like an eager little intern with my tail between my legs but she just had like a soft spot in her heart for me and when she knew I was talking to you today she just couldn't tell me as many times as how many times I needed to tell you how much she misses you and how excited she was in talk to you but anyway it's her favorite show for me to be able to say you know that's about Marty right she's like what oh my god no it went from being her favorite show to I don't know like a deity TV by the way your mother-in-law Janet was wonderful and one of the reasons why we all loved her so much as a resident was here's a normal caring person in the department of surgery you can actually talk they would listen was it like suck it up and move on so it's like a normal healthy human ombudsman in the middle of Navy

[00:25:22] SEAL training and it's like oh my gosh she'll hug us and she had this feelings and she was kind so we all loved her but yeah I try to lay low at the show because there's nothing really good that comes out of associating your name with a show like that when you have no editorial control and even the first couple episodes I learned in retrospect there was a low budget now the show's crushing it and they'd spend four or five million dollars a show and but back then when it was a tight budget they had for example an episode in the early parts where a medical coder was rounding with the doctors in the CT scan room and telling doctors they need to order this test and it's like come on no coders are rounding with us and then over time and their budget and they get more people involved they really beefed it up and now it's really it's a drama about the business of Medicine the TV show the resident whereas previous medical dramas have been about sort of the medical side and medical care so this is an attempt to really look at the business of medicine when did you meet Peter

[00:26:16] Pronovost did you know Peter before you got to Hopkins no I met him I met him in the ICU he's an ICU doctor as you know and so I met him in the ICU and then when you get on faculty at Johns Hopkins they assign you an official mentor so he was assigned as my mentor and we had offices next to each other and he started talking about gosh we're using this checklist in the ICU when we round to make sure we're covering all these points like what day of antibiotics is this patient on let's anticipate where they're gonna go after they leave here and how can we make preparations so that's where I got to know him yeah he was incredible I always think back to my time at Hopkins is unbelievable like I just felt too lucky to be there and you just couldn't believe like everywhere you went there was this person who was exceptional and arguably the best in the country if not the world at what they did and certainly Peter he was no exception interesting as an aside when I decided to leave medicine a lot of people thought you were making the biggest mistake of your life Peter was one of the few people and by the way the people who said that and felt that way did it out of complete compassion and concern so nobody was nasty about it but

[00:27:26] Peter he gave me a book by Joseph Campbell and said read this I think it will help and he was the most understanding person about it he was like no Peter you know I think you'll be a decent doctor but if you choose to leave the practice of medicine I completely supported and proud of you and I've never forgotten that Peter was sort of the first person who kind of accepted my decision to leave we were so torn by the way because we had these conversations we were thinking about leaving and I thought gosh you're so creative this place beats creativity out of you this cookie cutter job so run with that creativity but on the other hand we loved working with you it was like having a reliable solid doc to work with is the best part of the job so that's anyway well the good news is there was so many of those at Hopkins I mean it I felt like my absence certainly didn't change anything because it was just honestly I felt like everybody there was we joked about us or like what it must have been like to play for the

[00:28:16] Yankees right everywhere you look there's like the best person at whatever they were doing but how much resistance did you get from the field because I got a feel like writing that book ruffled some feathers and again you do a very good job in unaccountable of not turning this into a holier-than-thou crusade you're self-deprecating I mean it but nevertheless in some ways it's one of the first times an insider said with vulnerability look we're not perfect here we're struggling and we don't have a system that's great it wasn't some sensational whistleblowing nonsense it was almost a cry for help but we come from a culture and this isn't just

[00:28:57] Hopkins I think this is medicine of a very stiff upper lip you suck it up and you do it and you're doing the best you can because our intentions are good I mean I can only recall two residents in the entire time I was at Hopkins that were just bad people and when you think about how many residents would come through that program that's less than 1% so there's less than 1% of the residents

[00:29:18] I saw at Hopkins were just horrible human beings so we got all these people who are good and they're trying to do the best they can and there is this veil of secrecy and you come along and you say we're not doing good enough like we could be doing better and I'm gonna share with the outside world for the first time what this means so did someone like sit you down and say Marty shut the hell up I tried to make it very personal and like you say I tried to point out where I've made a mistake in taking care of patients I tried hard to basically say look I'm a human being we're all human beings we're gonna make human mistakes let's not blame the human being let's talk about how we minimize those mistakes how we create safety nets when they do occur and how we talk openly and honestly about them so we don't go home with little PTSD because it is a horrible feeling when you're involved in those things but I tried to tell my own story of observing in residency at an affiliate Hospital a woman walk into a place that was a branded Breast Cancer Center and it really wasn't there was somebody there practicing outdated breast care they didn't offer all the surgical options they didn't offer any trials and I just thought this is dishonest to the patients now what do you do with that observation do you internalize it I remember telling my dad once about a surgeon who shouldn't have been operating and we've all seen them they're everywhere I mean most surgeons do the right thing and always try to and we don't want to create hysteria but you do see there's 5 10 sometimes 15 % of

[00:30:48] Surgeons that should not be out and I told another doctor in the hospital about what I witnessed in the operating room and how it was an entirely avoidable and it was a skill issue and the doctor just kind of put his head down and said yeah that's too bad and I thought is that how we help each other is that how we police ourselves there's got to be a better system and at a certain point you realize okay the state medical boards it's not really a feasible way to help outliers the department's they're not always incentivized or driven generally we respect everybody's autonomy hospitals are profiting from the individuals not that they want anything bad to happen but they're just not financially aligned to really intervene typically I don't wanna make a broad statement there but no one is in nobody's direct interest and so I realized we've got to educate patients on second opinions we've got to educate patients on the questions to ask and I try to be very honest about the issue now the one problem with the book unaccountable was the title the publishers slap their own titles on it and I of course had a positive title on it and they come back no we're gonna call it unaccountable and this subtitle and of course I'm thinking that it's not gonna fly well with the medical profession it might sell more bugs and they had title rights and I've learned I probably got burned on that title affair a bit because of the 10% of doctors that contacted me most doctors said thank you for speaking up or I've seen this or this is going on here but the 10% of doctors that gave me negative feedback I'd say nobody of those doctors read the book but actually just reacted to the title or the title of a book review and the media sensationalizes the topic of patient safety and it's very difficult as a patient safety researcher to treat the subject in a way that the media is fair and balanced because what they want to do is just they're all in the ratings business

[00:32:44] I remember Fox News wanted to do a one-hour special on this topic and had me in it and yes doctor this is important we want to help this effort in patient safety and they call the show the night before it comes out they call me and they say the show's coming out tomorrow it's called doctor death or I heard something like come on you know

[00:33:03] I thought you'd gonna treat this and so that's the issue with patient safety researcher to be very honest I'm thankful that I am no longer a researcher in patient safety and my entire research effort has moved on to the cost crisis in healthcare because during that era a 10-year era when we were doing a lot of research on patient safety working on the surgical checklist the media was sensationalizing the subject a lot and the profession to be honest if somebody had a medical mistake a patient was complaining they were sort of relegated as crazies they were just kind of put out there any malpractice claim that was resolved had a gag rule that I wrote about and unaccountable so you could not speak to anyone for the rest of your life about your medical mistake well mistakes happen and gagging somebody is tragic because talking about the mistake is part of the therapy not just for the patient but for us Doc's well I'm glad you said that because there are several things that I still feel upset about from residency again they're not specifically directed towards any individual or even the program itself but more the overall culture and this is one of them as you probably recall there was a very clear rule now it obviously wasn't a written rule it was an unwritten rule but whenever there was an outcome that was not desirable so that meant the patient died even if there was no mistake involved or obvious mistake but patients die but Hopkins doing the most complicated surgery that can be done on this planet and because it's a huge tertiary center you're getting people from all over the world who are coming with the biggest problems invariably people are dying well their rule was the unwritten rule was if there was even a chance there was going to be a lawsuit involved you weren't permitted to speak with the family and so and I remember this very clear one night when I was an intern and I was in the with you so one of the ICUs at Hopkins this patient had been on our service for patient had been in a hospital for probably three months

[00:34:59] I was just coming off the end of being on one of the so I'm actually I wasn't the Wiki resident I was one one of the surgical teams but you're taking care of the patient in the ICU and one night I'm on call and this is kind of the end I think the family withdrew support and this and I'd and so I'm filling out the death certificate and his wife comes up to me and it's 2:00 in the morning and she just wants to talk I mean she just wants their kids aren't there yet they're probably not gonna be there till the morning or whatever so I just talked with her and again there's no blaming this is just a she's questioning oh my god should we have even done this surgery the gravity of this is starting to weigh and it's a typical situation of a patient was probably in his late 70s who had an aggressive surgery for a cancer and yeah maybe in retrospect it wasn't the right thing to do did anybody make a mistake there no even if somebody did made a mistake it's remarkable how patients are forgiving they just want they just went honest they're hungry for absolutely and so I remember kind of the next morning getting spanked a little bit by the chief resident when he found out you were talking to mrs. Smith for an hour last night like how dare you a day right our job at this point is to make sure that if their lawyers call and want the medical records we get them to them in a timely fashion we cooperate and and I'm like what the hell are you talking about why is that what we're thinking about at this point and as myself being a victim of a medical mistake which you wrote about actually in the book I was amazed at how well you knew that story I don't even like it's funny I remember when you sent me the galley of that I was like I can't believe Marty remembers all this stuff because I have total hippocampal wipe out from residency I remember that huge blind spots I have but I never wanted to sue the surgeon who did this stuff to me but I was definitely upset about the fact that he wouldn't talk to me it was surgery gone bad if you will I feel like I've may have told the story before but I had a wrong side surgery when the surgeon operated on the wrong side of my spine something went wrong I woke up from the surgery in worse shape than when I went in and for three weeks he refused to acknowledge anything was wrong I was seeing him in clinic he actually called me a [ __ ] and told me to suck it up he was a horrible human being there's no question about that not because of this he just this guy was over all be human being who happened to do this but what amazed me was the complete and utter lack of honesty I think and to this day people say to me how did you not sue him sue the hospital and I said look maybe it's cuz I'm Canadian and we're just not litigious people but it was never about that this wasn't something a dollar was gonna solve for me I just wanted a guy to be able to say oh my god Peter I can't believe in awe and I understand how the mistake happened it was VIP treatment that's the problem so I'm a medical student at

[00:37:53] Stanford I've got this huge finding on the MRI they want to get me right to the o.r it's a Sunday night we're gonna pre-op you first thing in the morning you're going straight away didn't even meet the surgeon no physical exam it was a perfect and colossal mistake that was the result of a whole bunch of people trying to do the right thing as quickly as possible and in all of the hoopla they got the side wrong yeah it's always the case with VIP care isn't it if you're a VIP do not tell anybody yeah exactly do not get VIP do not say you're on the board or have a buddy who's a doc just your average Joe lock it in and asks all the right questions yeah but you went through I mean that was a lot but people are just hungry for honesty and you know unfortunately now the risk managers of hospitals have dominated the practice of medicine when things go wrong they basically create this denying defend mentality so you're saying that's gotten even worse it's got well I personally think that hospitals are making too many decisions based on what the risk managers are telling them to do because from a risk management standpoint legally and this is with any corporation it's not just medical you want to basically shut off communication deny and defend hold your party line and fight it in court and in the settlement process and depositions but in medicine people want honesty they're forgiving and they want to understand what happened and it's remarkable I had a patient once who said that surgeon wasn't able to do this in the surgery and they sent the patient we here to

[00:39:24] Hopkins and I said well yeah I'm sorry you went through that yeah us too but you know our surgeon did his best and he offered for us to come here initially to Hopkins and we said no we'd really want to stay here in North Carolina we'd like you to go ahead if you feel comfortable and there was so much honesty you realized people don't really sue because things go bad they sue because things go bad and there's no honesty and transparency well and I think there are data to support that because I remember in residency getting kind of annoyed by this situation of when bad things happen you're not allowed to talk to the family and I remember pulling out some this was soft research but the takeaway seemed very clear to me which was lawsuits happen when communication breaks down independent of the severity of the outcome so you can have lawsuits over bad communication when the outcome was not really that bad you order the wrong diagnostic test on a patient for example they're not hurt from it they were exposed to maybe more radiation and they should have been and that's bad but that's different than you operate on the wrong carotid artery but it seemed that the lawsuits the severity of any sort of litigious behavior was much more proportionate to everything that happened after the breach absolutely I mean again that was my very kludgy takeaway 15 20 years ago is that still did the data bear that out yeah well the studies show that satisfaction of the patient is the bigger driver rather than the actual events of the patient it's extremely satisfied the risk of a lawsuit is low and that's why I tell Doc's when something goes wrong reach out to the patient immediately and disclose I had a patient where I ordered a cat scan and they shouldn't have had a cat scan remember you told the story once and this patient didn't like you in the first it was already pissed at me the patient had a pancreatic leak which is 20 30 percent of all pancreatic surgery they struggle with a leak that keeps him in the hospital longer they feel sick afterwards and I basically went to this patient thinking gosh this guy's gonna sue me he had a similar name to another patient and when I talked to the resident who then talked to the clerk at the nurse's station something broke down I might have not been clear I might have said the wrong name I don't remember I was busy the resident might have passed the wrong name the clerk may have entered the wrong name who knows we're not gonna have an investigation but I went to the patient and I said look I made a mistake here something went wrong I take responsibility you shouldn't have had that cat's key it was not intended for you it was intended for another patient on this floor I mean this is the stuff risk managers just vomit when they're here right they're like shudders come up with an excuse because it's plausible that you would do a CT scan on a patient with a pancreatic leak you could have easily gone in there and said mr. Smith I just wanted to be doubly sure that the leak was contained yeah so the guy looked at me and I said

[00:42:15] I'm happy to get the results right now as soon as I found out about it I came up here to tell you I'm happy to go down get the results right now I haven't seen the results yet and share them with you and we can just see what the casts can show this guy he already had sort of an angry look on his face he was already upset

[00:42:30] I think idealistic expectations of how his recovery should have gone and he looked at me and this guy put a big smile on his face and he said doc thank you for coming up here and explaining this to me I really appreciate your honesty about it that guy never sued me okay we are Facebook friends today because he just hit me people are hungry for honesty in medicine now honestly when you make a mistake and someone dies you need to talk about it I mean I hear every now and then about a tragic horrible avoidable case and my first reaction is I want to talk to that cardiology fellow or whoever was involved and let them know this happens to all of us were human beings things are gonna happen let's talk about how to prevent it how do you feel about this we've got to talk through because I'll tell you when we internalize it's bad for our bedside skills we turn into robots I don't know if you saw the movie

[00:43:23] Hurt Locker mm-hmm where this guy's defusing bombs in the Middle East then he comes home and his wife is telling him like go pick up some cereal in the supermarket and he's just looking at these cereals like what's this matter I'm in a war overseas and who cares what cereal he can't do the activities of normal living American sniper the same thing he's a hero in war and then he comes home and he's watching his kid and daycares wife's trying to engage with him and he's just a robot and that is exactly what we doctors go through when you're in the ICU you're in the trauma Bay and somebody has a tragic illness and you're yelling and screaming to get a chest tube in and you go home unless we address it head-on unless we talk about it unless we can't cope in the way we tend to cope is we just internalize it

[00:44:16] I'm always laughing when one of my friend says I went on a date with a doctor he didn't have any emotions and he just started talking about different incisions he would use on the scalp to approach a brain tumor and I'm like we internalize too much at the hospital and it's important to have these honest conversations by the way this is what I love about the students the students have like very little tolerance for BS I guess is just part of this millennial generation so when they see stuff in the hospital they call it out wait a mo this lady didn't want a biopsy why are we doing the biopsy hoho wait a minute and they don't care about how it was very different from us telling students we were head down and when someone says jump we say how high all in line I mean do you remember the twist which was this pastry on the tray on the catering tray at M&M conference at Hopkins for many years yeah yeah that was the knife hole

[00:45:08] DT 2d special right exactly but the word was John Cameron the chief of surgery loved the twist and there's only one twist on it to any resident or med student took it it was the biggest faux pas you could do not touch the twist and they would literally orient you like here's how you call the blood bank here's where you send the labs in and don't touch the twist at M&M conference like part of the four things they tell you when they start or yet the students and I heard one day I wasn't there but I heard one day they found a stood nude showed up early for conference and he was halfway through the time and they were like what are you doing no we got to get another twist sent up here immediate emergency they're trying to do like the Heimlich on him and preserve the remaining piece of the twist and make a clean cut and prepare their apologies I mean that like you're saying we just fell in line it was the military and - I remember a patient struggling in the ICU their oxygen saturations were low but it was 627 and it took me three minutes to walk to the

[00:46:13] M&M conference and you were never late for that Congress and I'm literally like nurse can you just manage I have to go I have this absurd patience struggling in the ICU with this incredible I've never seen anyone show up late to that conference in my 16 years of conference at Hopkins and it's just amazing this militaristic and the reality is we should be at the vet whatever the patient's need we should be there for them but there's this culture and it's changing so I love the students the students are the most exciting part of the job they are with the pricing failures that we're writing about now and our research they are going after these predatory billing practices and they're saying excuse me what the hell you build a patient $10,000 for a cat scan and they've started this movement called restoring medicine they've got a

[00:47:01] Facebook group they've got these are labs medical students at Hopkins yeah medical students at Hopkins and around the country they're just trying to get a grassroots thing going they did this on their own they approached me and they said look we love the book the price we pay we want to work on this these are our patients that are getting harassed for their medical bills the patient's did not come to the hospital administration or billing department for medical care they came to us the doc and now they're getting shaken down with these egregious overpriced surprised bills it may be that this is going to be the number one issue in the next election there's some early polling from the LA Times that are showing it's not just health care that's number one issue in America at the voting polls it's medical bills in the midterm elections

[00:47:47] Trump's first term in the midterms health care surprised everybody was the number one issue they didn't think it was gonna be that high that was not the Obamacare debate that was people getting hammered with medical bills and the students right now are saying enough is enough that generation demands transparency in every aspect of life there's so much I want to talk about on this front because that's the subject of your book and the stories that you tell in that book just they they really resonate with me but I want to tell a funny story just cuz you've brought up John Cameron and he is such a God to me as you pointed out the

[00:48:19] Hopkins medical students are probably the best medical students in the country and so that was sort of one of the privileges of being a resident there was for the listener there's a real hierarchy in medicine so you have the attending that's the faculty member you have the fellow so they've finished their residency but they're now do some additional training you have the chief resident who's the most senior resident so they're still in training you have sort of mid-level resident junior resident intern sub intern which is still a medical student but in their final year and then the third-year medical student I mean that's basically the entire hierarchy so one of the real privileges of being at Hopkins was even as an intern you got to scrub in with dr. Cameron when he was doing a Whipple procedure you got to retract and you got to remove the gallbladder you have the privilege of being yelled at if you're really lucky well I mean it's funny because if you were in the general surgery categorical program you couldn't wait to get in there and do that now of course if you were one of the neurosurgery residents that might not be as appealing because you're like oh my god you know I just got to get through this thing but but I loved it so anytime I got to be in the o.r with dr. Yeoh dr. cameron it was the greatest day of my life and I didn't care if I got yelled at a hundred thousand times and I didn't care if my fingers went numb trying to retract her liver it was the best and there was generally a medical student in there as well and again if the medical student wants to go into surgery it's just gonna be a fun afternoon if they're competent because they're gonna get pimped so I don't know if the word pimping is still is that still legal oh yeah pimping is alive and well okay okay can you explain what pimping is the

[00:49:47] Socratic method of teaching it's really pausing a question and so it's just a method of explaining things but the students perceive they've been taking tests their entire life on average every four days of a human beings existence before they come into Medical School they've been taking a test so they perceive it as oh my gosh the great John Cameron or whoever the surgeon is yo li'l mo is asking me a test question and I'm cataloging through the billions of things I've memorized to see if I know the answer and if I do I will make it and if I don't I'm dead we're more interested in someone's communication skills upon us the affability than we are if they know every fact and some of this stuff is not knowable anyway pimping is alive and wellness as a term still exist because it was a very important part of what was happening and you thought a lot about this you knew any day you went in the o.r okay what are they gonna pimp me on is gonna be the anatomy is it going to be the history of this surgery is it going to be what the next step is that kind of thing

[00:50:45] I personally don't do it after somebody passed out when I ask them a question once they were normally there shaking as you're asking them a question and you need their hands to be steady so I basically asked myself the question if I were to ask myself so-and-so I would think it's it so anyway well I'll tell you I thought there were some attendings who pimped purely from the standpoint of just trying to torture

[00:51:08] Cameron was not one of them now in Cameron I actually talked about this with Ted Schaefer on my interview with him Cameron did this thing called Sunday school with us interns every morning it's like seven o'clock every Sunday morning we did Sunday school with Cameron where we would have these discussions about the history of surgery and for those of us who came to Hopkins with that sort of love this was a gift from God like you couldn't imagine you were getting to sit down with the most famous surgeon in the country and one of the greatest historians of surgery and get this lesson so to be in the O R with him was usually a history lesson yeah okay so fast-forward I'm an intern on GI gold which was the flagship service at

[00:51:44] Hopkins and we had a medical student you always have two medical students and as I said usually the medical students it happens because it's they're just so good that it's just it's fun to have him around even if they don't want to go into surgery they're just good students and you get to know them and stuff so I became friends with many of the students and in this particular month one of his students wanted to go into neurosurgery well she's at the right place we're at

[00:52:03] Hopkins but you knew deep down that wasn't gonna happen she just was a space cadet like there's just no other way to describe it she was out to lunch actually the problem is she didn't know it she had this incredible confidence about her that did not match her ability that's the most dangerous subtype it really is so we're in the or1 day and dr. cameron is always talking to the medical student he's always being friendly and he says I do remember her name but I won't use it so let's pretend her name is Susie he's like Susie what are you interested in and again this is where any medical students say I'm interested in Pediatrics great and he will march down the path of do you know who the first pediatrician was blah blah blah blah blah and he's just walking you down the path and so Susie says I'm interested in neurosurgery he's like great do you know who the first neurosurgeon was

[00:52:59] Johns Hopkins she's like no now the listener if someone's listening to this they're thinking oh my god how would you know that but here's the deal if you're at Hopkins you know this stuff just as you know William Osler and William Stewart Halsted who they were like everybody knows who created neurosurgery guy named Harvey Cushing and he trained under Halsted in the late 1800s before moving to Boston and basically creating the field of modern neurosurgery the

[00:53:24] Cushing reflex right if you're listening to this and you're not in medicine you'd be like why should she have known this but if you're in medicine you realize you can't be at Hopkins and not know this okay so she doesn't know the answer so he keeps trying to give her a hint he's like well he trained at Hopkins under Halsted in the 1880s no I don't know he then went up to Boston and created this Pro I don't know and by the way at the time dr. Cameron is holding the Bovie which is this is called the electric artery but everyone just calls it a Bovie and this is a device that revolutionised surgery it's hard to imagine you could do surgery without electric cautery so this is a device that cuts and simultaneously cauterizes so almost everything we're doing in surgery is using this device and it was invented by of course cushion and so as he's holding the Bovie and he's starting to get a little act now that she doesn't even have a clue yeah he says he invented the device I'm holding in and he rattles off whatever year it was 1907 no idea no idea he must have rattled off ten other hints she finally blurts out her best answer Ben Carson who at the time was a pediatric neurosurgeon

[00:54:40] Hopkins who of course has since gone on to become a volitans and he loses it he's like I suggest you learn your history of neurosurgery I couldn't wait to get out of the oh are that day to tell my other co intern this story and this is how deprived you are of any sense of whatever we thought this was so funny that we spent the next few months referring to ben Carson as Benjamin

[00:55:07] Beauvoir a de cárcel because we came up with this idea that Ben Carson had actually invented the Bovie and that's why I took his name but we had to come up with this whole French twist to make bah so 20 other residents at Hopkins heard this story and we were all going on about how Benjamin bubbly a ducat of salt created the Bovie I think it wasn't Cushing and all of those other stuff and to me that's just an example like I don't know why I told that story other than it just you're so sleep-deprived you're so giving you're under so much stress that you have to latch onto the dumbest thing as something that's funny yeah absolutely and it's like whatever it takes to appease the higher-ups this sort of deep sarcasm have been the subject of it many times with dr.

[00:55:52] Cameron I have a very good strong complicated relationship with the man he's my senior partner we've shared a secretary and I practice now for my entire career since I was a fellow under him and he's both my best friend I play golf with him maybe every other week or great friends we've done vacations together the man's 82 years old and a legend in the field and at the same time he's my greatest adversary in some of the innovation I've been trying to do at

[00:56:23] Hopkins mainly introduce minimally invasive pancreatic surgery now he's been very supportive at times at other times he'll look at me with this suspicion of are you using those toys again heaven forbid we have a single complication even though the baseline complication rate from pancreas surgery is 20% it's unavoidable if you do a fair amount if I have one complication and we had did you use those stakes and toys and cameras yes document we use the minimally invasive to have less surgical stress on the patient's physiology and nearly eliminate the risk of a wound infection and other complications and you'll say well next time you might as well just take that patient and roll them into an empty elevator shaft no

[00:57:10] I'll call you an assassin or what was the other one he used to say Marty M&M conference sometimes I wonder whose team are you on the patients or the cancers I'll be like no document the gas does not spread the cancer inflating the co2 gas and that was an old criticism that I've answered thousands of questions about I heard the gas spreads the cancer no that's not true it's like lunar eclipse couldn't spread the cancer

[00:57:39] I do want to go back to something else you said we sort of glossed over it and but before we get onto this or a price stuff which is it's so frustrating to me two things one is you're absolutely correct and I've never really thought of it as explicitly as you've described it but the idea that the doctors nurses and health care providers who are involved in seeing bad outcomes it's a form of

[00:58:02] PTSD now it's absolutely not as severe as a person whose job it is to diffuse roadside bombs and I don't think that anything we would ever see in the hospital on our worst day comes close to what you're gonna see in the battlefield but it is still PTSD yeah and you bring it home and I think of all of the weird rituals I used to have and I don't think

[00:58:25] I mean I may be told this story once but we saw a lot of gunshot wounds and sometimes the patients died in the field so you never see them and then sometimes they come in and you get to do these heroic things and they you save them but there's a subset who died in the trauma Bay there's quite a few of them and I don't know why but I couldn't sort of let that go I remember distinctly one case of this guy who looked like he was about 25 single gunshot wound to the head but he must have had some vital signs in the field so he was still brought in the trauma Bay and I might have actually been the intern at this point I don't think I was the Halstead chief so we're doing the few things that we can do to basically try to at least see if he has some vital signs so we can do something and but very quickly it's clear that nothing's gonna happen so we don't even bother to call neurosurgery I think at this point he's just declared dead and at this point everybody just has to sort of leave the trauma Bay quickly so that the cleaning staff can come in body can be put into a bag get all the blood off the floor open the trauma Bay up for the next one and his wallet is on the floor and nobody else is in there except one of the nurses and

[00:59:27] I pick up the wallet and I open it up and there's his driver's license and I look at the picture and you can see what he looks like when he doesn't have a gun wounded in his head looks good I bet ya then there's a picture of a girl in his wallet and she looks like she's about three years old and I'm guessing it's his daughter and I'm thinking to myself

[00:59:47] I realized this guy is involved in something to do with drugs because 95% of the trauma we saw was drug-related and it's so easy to just dismiss that as well now that's what's gonna happen if you're gonna sell and buy drugs and the streets of Baltimore you're gonna get shot once in a while and I have no attachment to this but I looked at that

[01:00:05] I look over at him and his brain is coming out of the side of his head that's unfortunately just the reality of what a gunshot wound to the head looks like and I'm looking at this picture and I'm just torn up by it because I'm thinking this is one more kid that doesn't have a dad whatever this guy did he didn't deserve this whether he stole something or didn't pay somebody or I mean whatever he did this was too extreme a punishment but then I also realize like whoever did this to him is also in the same situation this is just one horrible situation and it just killed me it's hard to explain how upset

[01:00:37] I was about this but I also realized you have about ten seconds to get your stuff together and get on to the next one because you're gonna get paged again and again and again and oh by the way you've got seven other things you didn't do yet on your list today that you have to go and do and you got to go track down those blood culture results there just wasn't a moment to stop and do this and

[01:00:57] I thought to myself we saw so much trauma and I don't mean just trauma literally as in trauma but I mean things that are traumatic to a human and yet I don't once remember there being a discussion about that and how one should deal with that and I do think that so much of the burnout that we see and my friends e-dawg who I know you've met briefly but hilarious yeah you guys should spend a lot of time together he's spoken about this so eloquently but this idea of physician burnout he calls it sort of mortal wounding and I think he's right this isn't I'm tired of my job it's I don't know how to internalize what I'm seeing and we're just I don't think as a society whether it be in the military or in medicine or in any field we're just not I don't know not coached were not encouraged were not taught how to share that I mean it would never make sense to me to talk to that to talk with anybody else about that including my peers because why would I bother you with that story because you got 10 of the same story and you never think that well maybe there's value and talking about that and by the way acknowledging how much it tears you up yeah and it's exhausting to allow your emotions to go there and think about that patient's daughter and what's happening with the family and should I reach out to a family member you know there's a nurse saying at the nurse's station we have the family on the line and you're thinking I don't why I take that call because it's emotionally exhausting and you're already exhausted you haven't slept for the love of humanity in 36 hours you got to prepare for the next one so as a coping mechanism by default without any outside instruction a human being in that situation will naturally turn into a robot you just become androgynous you do not express any emotions you basically say this is part of the job and I've got to move on but what happens is it changes who we are and you see these incredibly bright young people interview for med school the sort of kid in a college that says when everyone's talking about their careers I'm kind of thinking about med school they're different from their peers right there's this intense sense of compassionate desire to apply science to help people it's a compassion driven profession the sort of person in high school says you know I'm thinking about nursing they're different from their peers we're all driven to medicine because of a sense of compassion and then you take these students when they interview for medical school at Johns Hopkins and we ask them the standard question everybody gets asked in every medical school interview why do you want to be a doctor because I really want to help people and 90% of people will say they want to go into medicine to become a missionary doctor or to help the poor or underserved in some capacity if not full-time as part of their job as a part-time Co career I didn't realize it was that high ninety percent percent starting out have some desire to serve underserved underprivileged people in some Kip exactly they're not coming in saying I want to be an orthopedic knee surgeon and we need good orthopedic surgeons but they come in which you can still do in an underserved capacity with you is basically less than 10% of people have it very clear sense in their mind that they want to do the most elite or whatever thing and yeah they're coming in open-minded they want to do some good

[01:04:20] I mean especially nowadays the Millennials are coming in with this social justice mentality I mean when you interviewed for med school I said it let me ask you how did you answer that question did you have I don't know that I was asked that explicitly when I went to medical school I wanted to be a pediatric oncologist and I had been sort of very moved by an experience that I had seen of a child dying of leukemia whose name I still remember when I was in college it's funny it's a funny story actually

[01:04:45] I interviewed with a surgeon at Stanford an ENT surgeon and you sort of get this random draw like you get a medical student that's gonna interview you in three faculty and I don't remember who the other two faculty were but this one guy interviewed me he was sort of a big-shot ENT surgeon and when he went down this path of what do you want to do and I said PT arc oncology he spent the entire interview trying to talk me out of it classic what what are you talking about do you have any idea how hard that is I mean are you crazy like are you a glutton for punishment you want to watch kids die of cancer let me tell you something kid you do not want to do that all right you want to be a surgeon you want it and he just rattled off all these are the things you would do but you do not under any circumstance want to go into pediatric oncology and I was like okay all right it's impressive I mean first of all that is probably the most admirable area of medicine people can go into I think pediatrics and psychiatry are probably the most impressive and honorable subfields of medicine people go into and of that say cancer care and children is just I really admire those folks but there is something to be said for what he pointed out that I couldn't appreciate at the time and so as much as

[01:05:55] I can mock that story when you don't have kids there's something you're missing in that equation I couldn't do pediatric oncology today of my life depended on it because I think is a doctor you're sort of always putting yourself a little bit in that person's shoes that's sitting across from you that's what empathy means and if we're doing our job correctly we have to have empathy so you have to be able to look at the world through their lens the problem is once you have children you look at the parent of someone whose child you're taking care of who has cancer and I don't think I could do I mean I now that I have kids there are a lot of things I could take in life but losing a child I don't think

[01:06:33] I could take and so maybe he probably had kids and maybe he understood without being able to articulate why maybe he understood are you crazy it takes a superhuman to do anything in that space and that remember my time in this sort of pediatric oncology world as you said it's a very special nurse respiratory therapist physical therapist physician everyone who was involved in that care that's a different cloth those people are cut from yeah it's a very impressive we take people when they come in with these very altruistic goals in life and you look at them fast forward eight or ten years later and they're like different people they are all of a sudden we beat them down we make them memorize and regurgitate the urea cycle and the Krebs cycle 18 times even though no one's ever needed to know the intermediary of the Krebs cycle on the fly in the hospital right it's just this absurd this entire medical education is just so absurd and I loved in the price we pay book highlighting what's happening now with some of the innovative education Jefferson for example the Dean they're saying we're gonna hire based on empathy and compassion and self-awareness and yeah we'll teach you what you need to know you'll know the vocabulary we're gonna teach you the life skills that you need to know we're gonna teach you how to communicate how to find knowledge when you don't know it how to be honest and say I don't know and you need to say that so I love learning about this new approach to education but there's there's this thing that we've been doing where we take these highly creative and talented altruistic people I mean they look beautiful when they're in the lobby of the Ross building waiting for their interview their hair is combed perfectly they're wearing these suits or dresses that are just dressed to the nine and they say all the things that show that they are a hundred percent in to help people there are mega athletes they've run immunization programs and kirara right there the most creative beautiful awesome souls in the world and they come in and then we beat them down with this urea cycle krebs cycle regurgitation treadmill and in residency don't ask questions and internalize all this crap that you're gonna see that's stuff that isn't right is this still happening though oh it's happening I mean I was just talking to one of our medical students about and they were talking about how a lot of it's the accreditation boards and the examiners these are not your Millennials writing the boards these are folks saying you have to know how to refract somebody for glasses even though you're becoming a urologist it's important information for you to know them ology it's just territorial so they come out and 8 to 10 years later look at them the hair is all messed up they're wearing pajamas they don't have a business card if you ask them where's your office they sat on they feel humiliated belittled subjected to all this beating and we wonder why they feel entitled and we wonder why they feel why they're doing stuff they know they shouldn't be doing we wonder why a doctor in a primary care clinic is giving out antibiotics too frequently or 10 years ago we prescribed as physicians in the United States 2.4 billion prescriptions last year it had hit 5.4 billion the disease double in the last ten years know we have a crisis of appropriateness to memorize everything in medicine it's Pairs diagnosis treatment diagnosis treatment that's the only way you can memorize the thousands of things we have to regurgitate so you develop these reflexes gout is a condition where the big toe has pain that the joint from crystals you treat it with colchicine and you memorize these pairs and what you lose is the sense of the threshold of treatment or the appropriateness of care what comes out are these doctors that are entitled sometimes burn out we've beat them down they're speaking a different language that has its own value system no this is not everybody I mean this is the sort of risk or the hazard along the path to me

[01:10:25] I think of the exceptions I think of Chris on and day he's to me the most special one most special residents I ever knew I don't know I always looked at Chris and thought and Chris by the way is he's now running a transplant program at the University of Michigan but there was just something about that guy yeah motional Eve ulnar ball yeah and maintained his humanity under any circumstance and always I guess I've never met a human in the context of medicine and

[01:10:49] I've met some amazing people but it's hard to say like you've met one person who took everything that you would want to be able to do to the highest level yeah so I always wonder why couldn't everybody myself included that is be like Chris I mean it's hard I mean you were one of the most disciplined people

[01:11:04] I've ever known in my life but it's hard not to get beaten down oh man I was so jaded that's the beauty of someone like Chris and you never really got jaded either I mean you were also in this thank you a group of people who just never because you pointed this out yesterday when we were having dinner it came up it's like most of us when we become jaded becomes sarcastic that became our coping tool of we just became sort of snarky sarcastic bastards coping tool yeah cope until I mean I remember my first day in the clinics in medical school I was assigned a primary care office and I was working with the doc who's an internal medicine doc I show up a little early and he says the charts are in the door here's the schedule feel free to just go in and see the patient and I go in them to see the first patient at 8 o'clock and there's a 15-minute slot and they're getting into all these deep issues and they're asking me about medication interactions and I'm thinking I think there's an interaction there I got to look it up and basically

[01:12:03] I leave the patient with I'm gonna get back to you there's a lot of stuff here to unpack and then I go to the next patient at 8:15 and then the next patient at 8:30 and for patients in the hour and each one I feel like I'd even dove a half-baked it's like this is insane and I stopped at 9 o'clock and I looked at the head doctor and I said I know I'm giving you brief presentations here in a minute you're going in for a minute they were treatment plan and a minute of documenting and I get 10 minutes with the by the way are we going like this till 5 o'clock cuz like I'm dead or an hour into this and this is crazy there's like oh yeah yeah and you do this every day is that why I do it four days a week and I have an administrative day like how are you not going bananas how would you possibly manage this he's like well you know you get comfortable with certain diagnoses the reality is show me somebody in America who's practicing office based high-volume medicine who's not burnout I mean it's probably I don't know 20 30 percent but you talked to folks I was talking to what an editor of the New

[01:13:07] England Journal Medicine at the Brigham meant when I was visiting and we met and she said I just came back from Clinic endocrinology clinic and I said oh how was it and she's like I only do it one day every two weeks or something because I'm worked for the New England Journal of Medicine but it's clear to me everybody there is burnout I'm like how could you not be office based medicine I mean what's the solution to this we have a population that seems to be getting sicker and that's not medicines fault there's lots of blame you could point at maybe why we're getting sicker but there's no doubt about it I mean people are getting more and more sick with chronic diseases and they're going to come to the healthcare system to get cared for again

[01:13:50] I don't have the insight you do into what those volumes look like and to how many of those patients are being treated as outpatients and things like that but how do we take care of people how is there enough time in the day to have enough doctors to take care of these folks because what you described sounds horrible like I can't imagine if I only had 15 minutes to see it like I get angry at my office staff if they give me less than two hour blocks between patients like once in a while they'll stack them one hour apart and I'll get upset be like guys are you joking we have to spend the first 30 minutes just catching up yeah before we even talk about the lab so what you're describing seems so foreign to me but at the same time I'm empathetic because I realized that's the nature of patient volume so how does one fix this by the way it's horrible on both ends patients don't like it either what I've discovered is doctors were able so first of all I personally believe that doctors are not lazy people we just don't want to spend our time on things that don't matter and there's an incredible amount of [ __ ] that's just been thrown at doctors in the last several years that has nothing to do with patient care and I know you've talked about some of that and some of your other episodes but the most exciting thing and I'll tell you in writing about these issues be medical education or pricing failures or over treatment or primary care in the book the price we pay one wanted to do is balance every problem with a solution or exciting disrupter because right now I am so optimistic and up on the future of health care so many cool things are happening there mostly the young folks mostly people that have very little tolerance for BS the globally capitated primary care clinics are freaking awesome okay so let's explain to people what all of those words mean and start with what has capitated me so basically there's no billing going on because globally capitated means that the clinic as a whole the organization is getting paid a lump sum amount of money so they don't have to worry about billing for every little thing and they can spend as much time as they want with patients because they are evaluated by the outcomes of those patients long term what percent of their patients use an emergency room multiple times or get readmitted to a hospital after discharge or the rates of certain health complications in a population long term there's an exciting one in Florida called Chen med and the

[01:16:10] Chen family is an incredible group of doctors a father and two sons both of whom are primary care physicians and they have made a deal with insurance and employers where they've said look pay us a lump sum for the entire journey of care of your beneficiaries your population your employees and we will assume that downstream risk and if you do enough you have enough patients you can assume that risk so if your patient goes on to surgery it sort of counted that money is sort of counted against the amount that you've been allocated for that patient so what it's done is its created this incredible incentive because the primary care physician assumes and takes the downstream financial burden of the care it creates this incredible alignment of incentives long-term to do it's in the best interest of the patient and Doc's know it's in the best interest of the patient it's exactly what you're doing it's spending time it's being able to go to the home or send somebody to the home and they hire these patient navigators at least I auric does this and the navigators will visit the home to figure out why aren't they taking their medications or what's in their refrigerator or what do they want to talk about what's their activity challenge here but this is different the only example that people would think of today on a massive scale of capitation would be Kaiser

[01:17:30] Permanente if you're on the west coast is there any other large capitated system in the country I'm a big fan of Oak Street I or Chen med there's the magenta clinics these are smaller they're probably doing much more than what one of these huge cap systems are doing right exactly is there a critical mass at which from an actuarial standpoint to manage risk you have to have a certain number of patients in a pool to justify what for example the Chen family are doing because if I'm putting my sort of risk mitigation hat on that's a dangerous proposition for the physician they could get wiped out if you have a small enough pool one bad outcome which can be entirely out of your hands patients walking down the street they get hit by a car or patient gets cancer

[01:18:14] I mean it's gonna happen despite all of your best efforts in prevention if that counts against your cap you're done so what's the nut you need like a thousand patients at a minimum to be able to 500 has been the number that's been floated out there in the actuarial science for when it's worthwhile to self fund a population so in other words if you're

[01:18:32] Apple and you've got giant cash reserves why do you need insurance you can just process the bills yourself with a 3% overhead you hire like a bill claims processing company so right now Apple I don't know who they're ASO is but Apple goes to Blue Shield and says we're gonna pay you X dollars to it administrative

[01:18:53] Lee Manning but we manage the risk yes we hold the risk we are paying for the cost and what does that work out to maybe you don't know apples numbers but if you'd pick a company that for whom you know the data what is the cost per life that is typically paid for by a large employer in the United States today average it might be $7,000 and with there being a financial benefit to self-funding or what we call self insuring it's usually just below that once you self fund so at the point of 500 employees or more the vast majority of businesses in the United States have recently moved to self funding just like if this seems crazy I obviously my company is very small so we are not self-insured we pay an insurance company to take the risk we pay way more than seven thousand dollars per person per year yeah traditional insurance usually is more expensive now it's regional and it's based on the age of the employees and whether or not families are covered but per person that's generally the average expenditure and a self-funded plan now there's many variations so a lot of businesses let's say businesses your size might say we're gonna take out stop-loss coverage so if anybody gets one of these giant Bill's over $100,000 that stop-loss plan will kick in there's 21 stop-loss insurance companies in the u.s. they sell across state lines it's very competitive it works beautifully and businesses are saying look we'll assume the first hundred thousand dollars of risk a lot of businesses can afford that risk especially if they're saving money on the front end and if they have a large enough patient population that they can spread that risk oh yeah exactly this is the future of health care and what's happening pretty soon and the reason I'm so excited about health care is that doctors primary care doctors are saying let me help you let me move in I want to be the doc for your company I want to go over the occupational hazards on the factory assembly line I want to talk about prevention and doing stuff immediately so that patients don't need to go to the emergency room they can come to me for urgent care then I'll sort of figure out and the utilization is down the costs are done because if there's one story of a modern American medicine it's that price gouging has become an accepted way of doing business in certain pockets of healthcare and as a business you're very vulnerable okay so now I want to dive into this quickly but to do it we have to set the stage for the listener so I want to tell a story and then I want to talk some numbers here's the story when I left medicine the first thing I went and did has worked at a consulting firm and what

[01:21:23] I got involved in just based on my background was on credit risk when I left medicine I really left medicine so I'm now a model spreadsheet jockey and we're working on something called the Basel 2 Accord which then turned into two years leading up to the mortgage meltdown I was part of a team that was basically now in the business of predicting how bad that was going to be and then once it became clear it was going to be a catastrophe figure how would you stem that tide by the end of two years of that stuff I actually understood pretty much everything one could understand about mortgage-backed securities and all of the ridiculous financial tools that were very eloquently described in the movie The

[01:22:08] Big Short yeah now look you can watch the Big Short and in two hours I think understand frankly 70% of it but I spent two years knee-deep in it and understood 95% of it by the end of it if you gave me another three years and said Peter I want you to devote yourself to this study of the US healthcare system and at the end of it three years I want you to explain it to me as clearly as you could today explain to me how mortgages work how their securitized packaged credit default swaps all these things and how it led to a calamity I wouldn't be able to do it and I can tell you this because over the past 10 years I have tried to understand it over the past 13 years actually and I can't even fully give you the profit and loss statement of the US healthcare system now I don't think I'm a smartest guy in the world but I'm also not the dumbest guy in the world and that drives me bananas that all I see is a black box for which over three trillion dollars goes in and three trillion dollars gets pulled out I don't understand how we can fix something when most people can't even wrap their heads around what's happening it's incredibly frustrating especially when you master a certain domain of medicine to be able to have no understanding about this gigantic industry that you're in the midst of people came up to doctors all the time during the health reform debates and said what do you think and the reality is have we ever really talked about how we finance health insurance or whether or not doctor pay gets pulled out of nursing home payment allocations we've basically been focused on two issues in terms of our doctors groups doctor pay and malpractice reform which is a whole nother subject we the big short beautifully explained that no it's not credit default swap is so complicated that nobody can understand leave it to us experts it's actually pretty simple it's just a way around insurance to do that it's spending money you don't have so what I wanted to do is in the book the price we pay create the big short for health care to explain things in a way that are understandable relatable and that touch on every area of health care and basically because there is no silver bullet in health care as you're alluding to it requires a brief moment understanding pricing failures a moment understanding the over treatment crisis that we've created and a moment understanding middlemen and administrative waste and if we can tackle each of those subjects in one book in a way that people can walk away and say oh now I understand how a PBM or a Pharmacy Benefit manager works I try to give an example explaining it like somebody's selling girl-scout cookies and how the money flows alright so it's use that example because

[01:25:04] PPM's I think I mean it took me two years to understand what a PBM did again I might not be the sharpest tool in the shed now it annoys me that it took me two years to actually understand how PBM has worked so explain it using this Girl Scout example so let's say that a mom comes to your business and says I'd like to be the exclusive seller and provider of Girl Scout cookies to your employees you say okay that sounds good I don't really know what Girl Scout cookies cost but yeah I'd like the idea of all my employees having Girl Scout cookies so this mom then brings in a bunch of kids who sell Girl Scout cookies to the employees and the employees walk up and say oh how much is a box well which company do you work for I work for this company okay then you just have to pay three dollars oh because this mom sells

[01:25:54] Girl Scout cookies to many companies she's the exclusive provider of Girl Scout cookies to more than one company yeah but that's not why it cost three dollars it cost three dollars because that's just the copay of what the employees paying for the box the mom then charges the employer 50 bucks per box as the benefit the employer saying oh great thank you for providing

[01:26:15] Girl Scout cookies to my employees you have 50 bucks a box I don't really know what they go for won't we go for five dollars sometimes in the real pharmacy benefit world the employer is paying six dollars a box of Girl Scout cookies which covers the entire cost and some profit and then they are still billing the employer 40 bucks now you would think the employers would say this is complete [ __ ] I know what you're up to

[01:26:41] I know those boxes are five dollars box you're gouging me screw this I'm gonna get another Pharmacy Benefit manager I believe in competition I want to put it out for bid the problem is employers cannot understand the names of the drugs and the generic substitutes and the biosimilars and the bio equivalence and the different dosing schedules and the different frequencies so they literally get a report at the end of a year with say let's say you have a thousand employees of you know four thousand medications that you paid for as a self-funded or self-insured miss rice which is different from saying there's chocolate chip there's Oreo cream there's vanilla mint

[01:27:24] Oreo I'm making it with cookies it's easier because there's only like ten flavors right you can understand that market value when you're doing it with medications there are so many games it's so hard to understand I've talked to employers when doing the research for the price we pay that they get these reports and they're like I don't know what the hell I'm spending money on I can't understand this and they brokers or the PBMs say look you're getting bulk discounts okay you're getting a 15% discount and the employers that they look at these shiny objects and think okay well I guess and then there are all sorts of money games that they added on now providing pharmacy benefits is a valuable service

[01:28:05] I believe businesses should make a profit so they should make a profit for the service but what they've done is played a massive shell game with things that nobody can understand sometimes the pharmacists themselves can't understand why when you pay out of pocket when you go to good rx which is one of the apps I recommend people use when they need a prescription go to good rx and they'll tell you what the price of that drug is and all the places near you why is it that that price is often below which your employer is being charged and it's sometimes even below what your copay would be yeah I did this actually recently I had to pick something up and so I'm a big fan of good rx as well we should make sure everybody knows to use that I'm actually friends with the guy who built the app so I looked up what 30 day supply of this drug would cost if I went to buy it in cash because I've been I'm so annoyed with how high my insurance premiums are

[01:28:53] I keep saying to myself why do I have health insurance like I'm not even sure I know anymore because the co-pays we get stuck with telling you last night I mean I got an ambulance bill for $15,000 or something it's just ridiculous so I noticed that the cash price of 30 days of this drug was 227 dollars it was fine so I went to the pharmacy and I'd already paid for it with my insurance so my copay was 30 bucks but when I looked at the slip I saw that my insurance company was charged almost $1,000 so there's a bit of a disconnect here my insurance company who's charging me a premium to take care of my family that is I think beyond absurd is getting gouged they just paid nine hundred and seventy dollars for something that if I didn't have insurance I would have paid $200 for how does that happen so one thing that has come up in the recent case of the insurance executive who got charged seventy thousand dollars for a hip replacement even though Medicare would pay twenty thousand and the benchmark Blue Book price is 28 or 29 thousand how did he get charged 70 thousand now he didn't get charged directly he was responsible for something like 20% a 20% of that amount he's an insurance executive or leader in the field of insurance actuarial science and he basically said who the heck negotiated this rate it wasn't a sticker price it was the negotiated price between his insurance company and one of the big hospitals in

[01:30:29] New York why wouldn't they negotiate a better rate and the article basically suggested that it's not necessarily in the financial interests of all insurance companies in all areas to really negotiate the best rate why well for a couple one there's something called the medical loss ratio or the MLR that was instated with the affordable care act that said that insurance companies can basically only have a profit if you will of twenty percent that is eighty percent of all the money they take in for insurance premiums has to be paid out as claims payouts I mean I understand that and I applaud the idea behind that but to say that well let's just be completely wasteful with the resources to make sure we hit our MLR is crazy why not instead say if you blow through your MLR let's say your profit margin is forty percent instead of twenty percent just apply the extra 20 percent to next year's premium reduction well if you can only make twenty percent of the premiums as profit how do you make more profit the next year organizations like to make profit you build in you almost want more payouts and then build it into your premiums for next year so the more they pay out the more they can say well premiums are going up twelve percent next year that gives them more money I see so you're saying they want to drive revenue as high as possible because they're only allowed to keep twenty percent of gross exactly the higher the gross the higher the profit yeah now I don't think I know a lot of insurance executives I don't think they're diabolical people I have really asked how intentional is this or it passive is it and I've heard it's mixed some insurance markets are very competitive but this was in New York

[01:32:08] City one of the big hospitals charging 70 grand so the insurance companies may not be your fiduciary you're independent and if I can just take an aside for one second one of my biggest frustrations is the lexicon or the language that we all use oh not to criticize you but I do this also you've referred to my insurance company paid that amount well actually you paid that amount in your insurance premiums oh my employer paid the rest well guess what that's from the same pool of money of wages and benefits that you would otherwise get a raise from so this lexicon of oh my government paid well we're paying what a 7.5 percent Medicare excise tax on your end and then if you're self-employed double that you're paying 15% Medicare excise tax otherwise the employer is paying your pain it's the same pool oh the government had a Medicare payment oh the insurance company paid oh my employer paid no no you pay the joke is on us right you've paid in so many different ways people say that health care is now 18% of the GDP and it may be as high as 16 percent of our federal expenditure all of our tax dollars in Massachusetts guess what percent of all the state dollars go towards health care 43 percent I was gonna guess 25 43 percent

[01:33:29] I just met with one of the recent legislators in Florida is now in DC working with us on price transparency advocacy forty three percent so people think okay sixty percent of the federal expenditure well guess what guess where people are spending their social security checks they're increasingly spending on those co-pays and deductibles is our health related costs still the leading cause of personal bankruptcy yeah it's the number one cause of personal bankruptcy and FICO scores getting ruined and now tragically one in five Americans has medical debt in collections what one in five

[01:34:05] Americans has medical debt in collections and that seems I mean that's saying I don't believe you that just seems hard to imagine are getting ruined people are paying more for their mortgages because they had a surprise bill that was unpaid people are getting hammered out there and when we hear that health care was the number one issue in the midterm elections it's really medical bills people are angry they feel they have no recourse in some cases I discovered in the book the hospital's take the patients to court and garnish their minimum wage or paycheck there's a court in Virginia an hour south of my house where if you don't pay your bill to that Community Hospital they will take you to court within months garnish your wages and if you don't have a job where you prefer not to have your wages garnished the court will ask for your

[01:34:54] ABA number and your routing number and your bank account number and the money will just get pulled right out of your savings from the hospital now these are hospital a for-profit or not-for-profit it's a not-for-profit it's a not-for-profit and the for-profit HCA has a hoss well in town and they behave they stay true to the mission of Medicine they don't shake people down that are poor I mean you can shake down I look a rich person who had plastic surgery and didn't pay their bill I got no problem with you soon the socks off of that person but that doesn't even happen because you pay up front for all that yeah exactly yeah that's sort of a known issue that's a non-issue but these are low-income these are poor people who work and have health insurance they've done nothing wrong they've showed up to work they work hard I met several of them who are single moms I was in New

[01:35:45] Mexico visiting a hospital before the book I profile in for the hospital I profile in the book we price we pay where the hospital has sued half the town in New Mexico that town only has like 28,000 people in it they've sued half the town the courthouse when I walk in there the clerk says that's all we're dealing with here is hospital lawsuits I said what percent of your civil cases in this courthouse in this town is the hospital suing patients to garnish their wages so very low-income blue-collar towns in town mostly oil workers and they said oh it's 95 percent of what we deal with I said how many in the day will you get oh we could get 10 or 20 lawsuits in a day from the hospital it's almost become like the court is now their collections department and one woman her car was in the shop for repairs it cost 800 bucks she didn't have the 800 bucks to get it out of the shop and then she gets hammered with a four thousand dollar bill for taking her kid in for an asthma treatment that took 45 minutes people are getting hammered out there and what we're saying and what I'm trying to use this incredible platform that God's given me as a surgeon at

[01:36:52] Johns Hopkins is to say this is not our heritage this is not our profession we have this incredible public trust we need to stand up for our patients I mean just to take a step back from this I don't think anybody listening to this right now thinks what you're describing is cool I mean this is totally unacceptable the doctors think it's unacceptable the patients think it's unacceptable but the doctors and the patients aren't the ones that are making it happen so you've got now two groups who are finding this unacceptable one because they're the ones actually getting gouged that's the patient and of course in the physician who's saying wait a minute this just doesn't even seem right on first principles but how do we do anything about it I mean it's very frustrating because I grew up in

[01:37:37] Canada I think it's totally overblown when people in the United States romanticize Canada let me tell you something Canada does not have a perfect health care system so any of you listening to this who think we should just be like Canada be careful what you wish for because I could tell you fifty-seven horror stories of what it's like to be a patient in Canada who tears their ACL and has to wait seven freakin months to get an MRI to confirm a diagnosis and if you want to do anything else about it good drive to Buffalo and pay out of pocket for your MRI and join the price gouging south of the border so Canada is not a panacea either but there is something in Canada and the UK and in other single-payer systems that just makes sense and it is the following it is a budget not a demand driven system and a single-payer always owns the risk for life those are in my humble opinion two things that are sorely lacking here

[01:38:32] I'll explain what those mean I know you understand what that means in the UK the NHS has a budget the budget determines how much they're going to spend on health care that year in the United States we have a demand driven system you can predict what we're going to spend next year on health care but the reality of it is demand determines how much we'll get spent the demand is set by the patient and the provider a lot of the stuff you talk about the over treatment the unnecessary treatment we want to dive into that by the way because there's so many interesting ideas there the second thing is I think

[01:39:06] I'm Blue Shield right now is my insurance company but tomorrow like next time there's an open enrollment I could switch and join Aetna and then I could decide a year later now I want to go back and do United I think there are probably stats on this that would suggest that the average tenure of an individual with a given payer is probably less than four years so you have this portability of risk so if I'm in charge of Marty's risk but I know that I've only got Marty's life for three years what did do I have let's say you were just diagnosed with type two diabetes today I know that in 40 years I know that in 20 years you are going to be a nightmare for me to manage from a cost perspective your amputations your cost of insulin because even though you're not on insulin today you're gonna be on insulin then and the cost of insulin is another one of the greatest scams in the history of civilization but in the next three years are you really gonna cost me that much yeah so I don't have any incentive to do what you described in the capitated system I don't own your risk for long enough whereas in a single-payer system guess what I own your risk forever so I actually have an incentive to do something about it so I think it's that coupled with this demand driven system that has created something broken and then notwithstanding what you just said which is we don't have universal coverage and I know that's such a politically charged topic and I realize that in saying that you just take 50% of the population and you pissed them off for saying we should have some universal coverage but what are the polls actually say I mean I know this is such a political topic which I don't understand why this is a political topic like to me save the political topics for things that are political like but what is the public's opposition to some form of universal care at least a cover sort of primary care or some sort of basic expense like why is someone who makes twenty eight thousand dollars a year and has health insurance ever getting a bill for $4,000 what's the morality behind that and when people understand that fact how many of them still oppose a net that would prevent it you're absolutely right that there's has not been a traditional financial incentive to reduce long term health complications and utilization because I even had don't laugh but I had one insurance executive actually tell me actually if we do some things that reduce long-term complications we're actually saving money for our competitors now he didn't because he's basically acknowledging that whatever we do today our competitors will reap the benefit of because four years from now this life will be my competitors life yeah this patient is going to be with a different carrier for sure in five years with the rare exception people just switch jobs and switch plans he was being very honest with me and I have this great relationship with insurance executives in hospital executives where they're saying Marty you're right about these issues but I want to do something about it so he's being honest and he's not saying I deliberately do not want to invest in long-term health because I could save my competitors money it's just there's no real reward financially to a company the goodwill that we all have that we want what's best for patients so that's what

[01:42:19] I love about these what I call globally capitated primary care that have lives for the long haul and they're doing incredible things if you're a business sign up with I or attend med Oak Street one of these globally capitated primary care or get some of these local primary care practices are pulling together and saying we want to go to the local business and we want to work with them

[01:42:38] GM just signed a big contract with Henry Ford Health System direct employer contract I've helped some businesses do these deals just sort of free service - I love it it's the most exciting thing going on right now but I think the reason why the outrage has been suppressed is just like we saw with the mortgage crisis and the financial collapse of 2008 people just don't understand what's happening and the money games have sort of been flipped around so for example if a business gets a higher insurance premium rate for next year they'll tell their broker this is crazy 11% increase in one year they'll say well are the cost of drugs and the cost of the reality is it's more than intermediaries it's the money games I have met a couple independent brokers these brokers in the business routinely and almost always get paid a giant kickback from the insurance company or the pharmacy benefit manager for sticking an employer with one of their plants and it's hard to watch you realize why people are paying too much sometimes they're not given the best options I profile it in the price we pay businesses that said no no I want another broker I want an independent broker and they just immediately save half a million dollars or a million dollars in businesses all over America are getting ripped off right now on their health insurance and on their

[01:44:01] Pharmacy Benefit manager so these brokers are not legal required to be fiduciaries you know they are routinely accepting so it's worse than real estate and real estate you know your agents not a fiduciary but at least you know at least you have transparency into what their Commission is it is worse and it's at least in real estate you know there's a 6% Commission in this world of selling health insurance which by the way I've not met a doctor in America who knows how health care is sold in America to businesses this is sort of when we were memorizing the krebs cycle 12 times how about substitute one of those 12 times for a quick lesson on how health care services are bought and sold on a grid like energy these brokers get a say in New

[01:44:44] York it's a standard four percent commission of every premium dollar of the business we'll spend on health care goes to that broker who cut the initial one-time deal they placed you so imagine you're a real estate agent getting five percent for life you're paying every year it's a one-time cost so it's not really a good example but every year business pays a million dollars four percent goes to the broker who cut the deal it'd be like a rental agent you mean if you cut the deal in 2019 and the employer keeps going with that same deal you continue to get your commission on the tail yeah four percent in New York it's regulated some places it's a little competitive but generally like in New

[01:45:22] York it's four percent for life so let me ask a question what is the if you use the word single-payer half the country loses their mind you might as well say we want a resurrect Stalin and put him in the white like it is such an anthem to our existence I don't know that a single-payer fixes a lot of problems but it fixes this problem yeah it fixes this problem so question one why are we so morally opposed to a single-payer system and I'm not sure I would like it by the way because when I see the single-payer system in Canada I can point out all the flaws and - is there a hybrid where you can get some benefits of single-payer because almost everything I've heard you say so far is a cost center because of the complexity of negotiation and so if you took out that complexity you would eliminate the need for a broker why do you need a broker I don't need a broker when I buy underwear why because underwear a freaking easy to buy and I can price shop myself I mean most things in my life I don't need a broker for because they're easy to buy I mean the issue here is you need brokers for things that are really complicated to buy and I don't think there's anything I don't think this is an exaggeration I don't think there's anything more complicated to buy than health insurance I want to answer your question about the Medicare for all issue that's coming up but real quickly by the way the brokers don't like this either okay they went into this thinking oh I'm gonna do something good in society I'm gonna work in health care

[01:46:51] I'm gonna help businesses and guide them then they find themselves in these traps where they're getting these cash flow streams these retention bonuses these threats from insurance companies I profile in the book a guy who basically got fired as a broker if you will they closed all books of business with him because he'd suggested to an employer they could get a better deal somewhere else and it was one of the big Blue

[01:47:14] Cross Blue Shield plans they said screw you they wrote in this nasty letter they trash talk to him they closed all his books of business so all of his lines of revenue all his steady commissions and the bonuses on top of that all got shut down that's catastrophic if you're a broker they don't like living like that they know I've been I went to a broker conference and I started talking to them and they just started saying look this shouldn't be this is a dirty secret in the business we don't even like it write about this and they gave me these stories in these spreads and but the medicare-for-all thing real quick right now it's polling very high that the

[01:47:48] American public is very very much liking the idea of Medicare for all the Democrats are running with it as you know and work with both Democrats and Republicans and the government I briefed I advised I try to be as independent as possible Medicare for all is very appealing because all of these money games in this Mirage and shell game all disappear with a direct Medicare for All system has anyone done is there an independent think-tank that's done the actual analysis and said look right off the top you're gonna save 8% of three trillion dollars if you do that is there a sense of what the benefit is of making that type of a change my research teams estimated that you say 15% right off top of this team immediately immediately not even over time and no journals interested in publishing that does not a randomized control trial but it's the biggest issue facing America right now here's the issue I have with switching over to this single-payer medicare-for-all system is that over time historically governments have shown a hundred percent of the time they cannot resist the temptation to make across-the-board cutbacks on health care we've done it in Medicare as a country and so you go 10 or 20 years sure you've cut all this waste initially but politicians governments political will they cannot resist the urge to just dial down dial down their spending on health care and then you're left with these dilapidated systems and parts of the UK or other countries where they're spending on health care is just so weak that when the doctors like in England went on strike the government is kind of like well you guys are civil servants suck it up and that's what I worry and if we can accomplish these incredible efficiencies in the market to cut the waste I mean I've seen estimates that as much as 50 percent of our health care spending is wasted and if you look at the amount we spend per beneficiary we're more than double what some countries are the average person in the

[01:49:48] United States might have a total health spend of $12,000 per year on average that's not self-funded it's not your part it's the overall expenditure we are way way over the curve and we didn't spend this money growing up when we showed up to the emergency room with a cut you might have seen a bill for a hundred bucks but insurance always took care of it now there's a woman who was charged for just checking in to the ER she left before she went back into the emergency room and she got it this big bill for like 1,200 bucks I mean the pricing failures have really hurt so I'd like the idea of cutting out the waste but I think if we can do it through free market competition then it's much better for the long term so so I'm ready the flipside of there's advantage to a single-payer system because you could cut out all of the machinery that's necessary to make a market understandable the flipside is but a free market works better and I think that's generally true I mean it's hard to argue that capitalism works it's hard to order that it's the least bad option may be to fit mildly it's hard to argue that competition is not a good thing so what's the argument that says no no no no no a single-payer system is a disaster we want to stay with this sort of system that has multiple different competitors across every spectrum from hospital systems to that are each competing to do the best to payers to PBMs to brokers and all these things so what's the argument that says don't leave that but let's just read channel it yeah well I mean one of the big tasks have been trying to do is educate the American people describe the book the price we pay as the big short for health care if we can educate employers every day Americans how to buy drugs how to buy health insurance how to ask the questions get second opinions challenge their bills recognize that when you get one of these massive bills you're not legally obligated to pay it and we're making these legal cases to judges across America I've got a group of pro bono lawyers as a part of this restoring medicine movement that we're assigning to individuals and we're swimming in cases I mean there's just unlimited cases out there one in five

[01:52:04] Americans have medical debt collections well some of those go to court we're basically telling the judges there's no legal contract now can I mow your lawn and then send you a bill for $5,000 and say well that's what I charge I mean you'd say we have no legal contract how could I cut your hair for 30 bucks and then one year you come in and I say it's $900 there's no legal contract so this is a very important point Marty because

[01:52:30] I didn't know this yesterday we had dinner and one of the people we had dinner with who's just amazing we could go off on stories on how amazing that guy is in his work ya African doctor yeah but he told a story of his son needed an endoscopy and they're back in the u.s. for this and to get an endoscopy which is a tube that goes into your esophagus and your stomach and takes a look around and comes back out and makes sure everything is okay we have a lot of fees in there you've got the fee for the gastro and just who's doing it there's a hospital fee for that there's an anesthesia fee because you need an anesthesiologist to give you some sedating medication so you're not under complete anesthesia but you're comfortable so that you're not gagging at this thing happening and it turned out that the hospital was inside the network the professional fee for the gastroenterologist was quote-unquote inside the network but the fee for the anesthesiologist was not inside the network because for no reasons that this patient could ever understand the anesthesia bill came from a group that was outside of the network so he got a bill for $10,000 for the anesthesia portion of this which let's just call a spade a spade Marty that's putting an IV in somebody and for 30 minutes taking care of them after you've administered some propofol I mean let's just be completely honest about what actually happened there so a few dollars worth of propofol and some IV equipment and an

[01:53:48] EKG and a pulse oximeter and you're watching someone for 30 minutes so I might be in the wrong business by the way if that's 10,000 bucks that is insulting to what money means so there's two issues I'd like to understand there one what in God's name does it have to do with the fact that that was in or out-of-network that such an egregious charge could be levied on that patient and two what is the legal obligation of that patient and how can that patient fight and say this is totally [ __ ] we're not doing this well right now the judges have been sympathetic to the hospital's and we're trying to show the legal argument that there's no contract when you walk into the emergency room today with a cut chances are they're gonna give you some form and say you have to sign this and the person giving it to you doesn't know squat about what's in it you could be an excruciating abdominal pain and need to go have your appendix removed you're signing it at a vulnerable time well and in fact let's take a step further if you have a prenuptial agreement and you want to get that held up and there's any evidence that that was signed under duress guess what it doesn't matter and

[01:54:53] I don't know about you but an acute abdomen sounds like duress yeah I mean if you're in a criminal trial and somebody says gives the key evidence that somebody murdered somebody the other lawyers could argue entrapment he felt a little pressured to offer that confession and it's negated and yet in the hospital not only is there no contract sometimes but there's this document that is fooling you into thinking it's a consent to be treated but there's a law in the United States called EMTALA that requires any hospital to take care of any urgent or emergent patient that walks into their door it's not dependent on giving your credit card when you check-in it's not dependent on giving your social security number and your mom's address and all these other things that they try to collect you don't have to do that hospitals are required by law it's called EMTALA to take care of anyone with an urgent or emergent condition if you feel that there's a legal document that you have to sign your home and your financial life away in order to get stitches and you're concerned about predatory billing you sign in that little signature box in the iPad you sign did not read because no one's gonna read but you sign there okay and then we knew the collectors call and the judge says you have to provide your routing number in your account number or we're gonna garnish your wages you say there's no legal contract we're trying to empower people in the United States to say we need a competent and fair pricing system the surprise bill issues by the way people are getting hammered with surprised elves right now hammered and why are they so hard to understand I'm taking you off that question but I get about 300 B's explanation of benefits per month maybe for them I feel like there's a never-ending stream of them you take your kid to the pediatrician because he's got a fever and you think he might have any er infection the pediatrician looks in the ear confirms that he does you got some amoxicillin you go home everybody's happy I get 6 EO

[01:56:46] B's for that encounter each one saying something I can't understand this is what we build this is what your insurance company paid this is what you're responsible for and then they attach a check to it and I'm like what like I don't I don't get it and again if I don't get it at least one other person listening to this doesn't get it right well look I took one of those bills to a hospital CEO like I said I've got very relationships with a lot of these hospital CEOs quite honestly sometimes they're just disconnected from what's happening with their revenue cycle

[01:57:19] Department don't you love that word revenue cycle it's collections like revenue cycle one woman handed me her card and it literally said on it director of revenue enhancement like gosh Hippocrates man would just be rolling over in his grave that's funny I hope that the guys in the Mafia are listening to this and upping their game a little bit because if you're running collections in the Mafia you should at least have a revenue enhancement car well in Florida drug dealers have given up drugs and turned to doing medical fraud because it's more profitable and they can make more money I don't know if you know but the Medicare anti-fraud offices I know the head of the division they've essentially closed down most of the regional offices and move them all to Florida because Florida is just the rampant center of a lot of abuse so you show an EOB to a hospital CEO yeah they can't even interpret the bill I mean there is a buddy of mine who had a friend get a $5,000 bill for an hour in the emergency room or something like that did a couple simple things and the bill was over five thousand dollars took it to my friend who's a consultant knows the healthcare executives went to the

[01:58:32] CEO and to the CEO he said by the way my friend went to your emergency room she was in the ER she got a little oxygen nasal cannula and an IV and was sent home about 45 minutes later guess how much the bill was and of course he's cringing embarrassed and he says I don't know fifteen hundred dollars now it was five thousand oh my god you know he's let me take care of that for you and there's this embarrassment when it comes up that yes we've allowed this game of dialing up bills and then offering these bigger discounts as shiny objects to employers and insurance companies has gotten so out of control that the victims his hospital CEOs will often tell me Marty you're so right but nobody pays those bills those are sticker prices we give discounts liberally well not to the people I'm meeting in

[01:59:14] Fredericksburg Virginia and Carlsbad New Mexico who are fighting their bills and they're they can't even get a call center representative in they're being harassed and the collectors are calling saying now it's the handed collectors so you can't talk to the hospital and let's explain what that CEO is trying to explain to you which is look we want to make this look really good so something like coming into the ER having a nasal cannula an IV and an EKG and sending you out we're gonna put a sticker price on that of $5,000 and we don't really think anybody's gonna pay it but what we're gonna do is we're gonna tell the insurance company or the employer we normally charge five thousand dollars for this but for you my friend today one-time only if you sign up now this will only cost five hundred dollars and you're thinking it's a great discount we're all over and if a different company shows up they might get a different rate then I get a different discount so different people can get different discounts on the same egregious price that serves no purpose other than to make you feel like you're offering a great discount I mean can you imagine if the rest of the world ran on this principle what can you grow Surrey store yeah exactly the restaurant I'll have the tikka masala please well here's the deal who's your employer it's $1,000 who do you work for I work for Walgreens Oh take this all the tikka masala is not a thousand for you it's only $100 for you and the guy sitting across from you to work somewhere else and well it's $50 for him but he gets a two percent discount on the 50 on the fifth so he's only paying 49 tell me on time our insurance company we get a 40% discount well I'll give you a ninety-nine percent discount if I'm selling you a car as long as I get to set the price you can have a ninety-nine percent discount is there another example in our economy that works this way well there is bulk purchasing and retail but here's what I would add to your example that you very well describe in addition to these secret discounts both parties are sworn to secrecy that this discount cannot be made public and that kills the competition and that's what we're working on with legislation and that's legal it is legal to put a gag on the chicane eree yeah okay so going back to our friend from yesterday the reason he gets a $10,000 bill for someone putting in an IV and some propofol is because the anesthesia group set a price that was ridiculous not necessarily expecting people were gonna pay this out-of-pocket again they didn't go into this trying to kill people for whatever reason the anesthesiologist who was probably supposed to do that case was maybe not so someone else comes in there out of network and now that ridiculous price actually sticks to this patient now what is his legal recourse in that situation he got overcharged yeah I mean what we're telling them is you argue as strong as you can argue to the collectors to the courts if they take it to court to whoever that they need to provide the legal contract cheering yeah Oh their chart they want $10,000 just send me the agreement

[02:02:15] I understand it's part of my consumer rights that when a collections agency calls that I'm entitled to see the contract or agreement that obligates me to pay what type of contracts are being produced at that request well I've never seen a collections agency produce a contract because it's that little iPad form that you sign in the lobby or something that doesn't exist where it's combined with a consent decree so it doesn't exist at the beginning so let's say open enrollments every January I mean I'm sure we signed something in

[02:02:43] January when we enroll is that the contract is there something in there that the collections agency can come back and say well Marty I'm not gonna show you a contract from when you were in the ER in May I'm going to show you a contract from January when you signed up through open enrollment no because that's a contract between you and the insurance company it's not a contract between you and oh good political center and they're the party that's going after you so this is a great point so the only time you're being technically presented with a contract for price is that the providers level and we're basically saying it's very easy to render that contract null and void yeah and sometimes it doesn't exist or logistically honestly they just can't produce it they send the what they call bad debt to the collectors and collectors go after you but they're not saying I love the idea of signing did not read did not read no I never entered a legal agreement obligated me to pay if

[02:03:35] I did show me the thing the other thing we're telling people to do if it's really egregious contact your state's attorney and contact your local news network now unfortunately some of the local news networks their number one client is the local hospital that's running ads this complex is taking it it's incredible but contact them and tell them my friend Sarah Kliff at Vox

[02:03:56] Elizabeth Rosenthal at kaiser Health News they each have sections where you can send in your bills I'm swimming I'm underwater I've got 54,000 emails I haven't read probably half the number of emails you have and have not read I'm gonna try to clean it out this weekend but so many people are getting hammered out there it's like an unlimited drinking from a fire hydrant but those are things people should do ask for the contract sign if you feel like it's not a fair agreement if you're not disclosed prices no I wish I knew this two years ago when we got stiffed with some 15,000 dollar bill for an ambulance ride well you know one of our friends from residency that had a sort of a catastrophic medical illness in

[02:04:34] Australia yes and he was flown back we all paid money to chip in for this there was a whole Facebook page where we were all kicking in thousands of dollars for his care I mean yeah so what happened I don't want to upset you but some of that money do I get a refund on that one I'll give him back to him I mean this guy's one of my best friends and it was awesome to see everyone come together but the flight back they charged him like a quarter million dollars okay for that flight you could get a private g7 and fly to Beijing and back five times for that money that was just pure price gouging and actually I'd got him some legal help to knock that bill down because this came outside of his insurance like his insurance decided they didn't cover that kind of stuff bingo you just nailed the number one story of the modern American health care system entities organizations doctors hospitals ambulances helicopters have figured out if you bill outside of insurance you can just gouge and some people will pay it and if you just send it to questions and harass and send them 50 bills some people just pay it and the reality is God's been good to you and I if we got a 5,000 dollar bill we'd find a way just to pay it might be annoying but we'll find it but half of America has less than $300 in savings people are getting hammered oh god that's so upsetting

[02:05:51] No can I talk about something positive on this subject yeah please talk about one good thing Keith Smith in Oklahoma City has basically said this is total BS I don't understand how a doctor can take an oath treat a patient and ruin their life financially it's against everything I've ever considered sacred about this heritage medicine he is offered one bundled price for every service at his medical center if you come in and you need shoulder surgery you don't get a bill for the epidural separate and from the anesthesiologist probe feed separate they got their act together and hospitals need to get their act together instead of sort of the finger pointing up oh well that's the lab the labs billing you separately we laugh at this because it's so true it's pure gouging and we're all paying for it it's not all my insurance paid or my Medicare paid four thousand dollars to test for one gene allele you can genome your whole 23andme cost one hundred fifty bucks and that's like all these gene tests so we've seen that genes that are in the 23andme panel billed separately for thousands of dollars so people need to ask when we all started and I have you to think a little bit for this started asking about healthy foods you remember that conversation early on when you were learning about this subject and you're like Marius is incredible what I'm learning I started asking in restaurants kind of food is this and does this have this and how is it prepared and and it's putting pressure on the restaurants it's driving the market the food label world the food industry is now trying to say hey this has these healthy ingredients that are good this has no added sugar and so the enquiries are moving the market and in addition to Keith Smith disrupting health care in Oklahoma and it's awesome that insurance companies hate him the hospitals hate him right all these people want him to fail it's like Elon Musk everybody surety everyone wants me to fail but he's actually growing like crazy people are flying in from Japan to

[02:07:59] Oklahoma City why because they haven't fair and honest bundled price he had 200 Canadians I think last year we did a study at Hopkins of all the price transparency medical centers in the United States before and after they decided to go full honest pricing not chargemaster pricing but the real price not oh here's a price and we're gonna give you a discount of two percent right the real price and they all do incredibly well their business goes up their satisfaction goes up we published the study this is the future it's exciting it's disruptive it's why I'm so up on medicine right now and you think that this is potentially a better solution which is basically still private health care but with market demanded transparency I do I do look it's very appealing to wipe out all the money games overnight with a single payer sits very very attempted and you know what people are advocates for it are absolutely correct it will slash the money games overnight it'll just put it to a screeching halt but over time historically if you look a khadeem eclis at every government that's done it they cannot resist the temptation to just skim cut skim cut year after year ten or twenty years yeah and I don't want to live in Canada I mean I don't want to live in a Canadian health care system either because I see what my parents experience I see what my whole family's still in Canada every single person my family is still in Canada and I wouldn't trade places with a single one of them for their health care even though average it's infinitely better than American health care in terms of accessibility and cost my Dean of the Harvard School of Public Health when I was a student said Canadian is essentially an unarmed American with health insurance now I agree with you we have an incredible health care system the problem is it works for the wealthy and it works most of the time and the reliabilities not there but the only reason it works for the wealthy is something you said a moment ago it's that the cost of the care for the wealthy falls below the hurdle rate of hassle I mean is there any place in the country that someone of means would rather get their health care no I don't know the last time an American of means left the u.s. to get their health care it's the exact opposite Hopkins I feel like half the people we took care of were outside of the United States so there's no question that we have the best health care when it's applied correctly which is to say the quality of care we have the potential to deliver is exceptional under the right circumstances that's a lot of caveat Eng we have a cost crisis and we have an access crisis and the two people the two subsets of people who are therefore going to be crushed in the US healthcare system are people who cannot afford access at all and people who can't afford egregious costs when levied upon them if you're not in those two camps you're gonna be okay it's annoying as hell but you're gonna be okay and I think that's what's allowed this system to sort of limp its way along and

[02:10:55] I guess what I'm hearing you say is we might I hate to use the term tipping point but we might be at a tipping point where it's become so egregious that even the people now who a there might be enough people that are moving into the latter categories of okay this is now if one in five people are you having collections through healthcare I mean we have a fundamental problem half of women with stage four breast cancer in the

[02:11:19] United States a recent study just came out at ASCO half of women with Stage four breast cancer in the United States are being harassed by medical debt collectors did you talk to the medical debt collectors well that study was published by another group but no but in general oh yeah and are they feeling I mean how are they feeling let's try to do something we talked about earlier let's try to have empathy for them you need a job everybody needs a job so I got a job I'm a medical debt collector do I feel good about myself I mean I'm calling a woman with Stage four breast cancer every day and threatening her that's a good person that's on the phone I don't believe that that medical debt collector is some like evil incarnate

[02:11:53] No so how do they feel about what they have to do well some of them hate their life I would say for the most part they are glad to be in a position where for the most part if you object fight your bill they're gonna just knock off twenty fifty percent right off the top this is another tip for people out there bills are negotiable when you get your bill they are negotiable I wish I knew this when I got that goddamn ambulance bill a few years ago yeah I mean imagine there kind of hoping that you I don't wanna say hoping like you say we have all good people working in a bad system but the business model relies on some people just saying screw it I'll pay and entire careers in industry the slogan right if the business model is quote ass screw it

[02:12:39] I'll just write and these folks in the so-called revenue cycle world right if they're earn revenue enhancements revenue in hands of a new enhancement how did I discover these people I get invited to speak at a lot of conferences as you do and I never actually get invited speaking conferences okay I'll consider yourself invited everyone I've done no no I'm happy to not so they say I got invited to this conference of revenue cycle managers and I just sure I'm happy to speak to them it's a nice that's awesome I mean that's a great opportunity for you to learn yeah and that's basically this book the price we pay is a two-year tour around America talking to patients and revenue cycle people and businesses and brokers and everybody I wanted to talk to everybody and get their point of view and I don't believe there's any one bad villain I think it's the system but the revenue cycle people I show up and I'm like I'm sorry I just got out of the operating room and flew into town who are you people what is revenue cycle what do you do in is this in healthcare or you outside of what is it are you tax accountants and they explain to me how it works and I look out there's a conference of like 4,000 people and I'm like does every hospital have one of these you know this oh yeah every hospital has a department at Duke at one point there were more people working on billing and revenue cycle than there were beds in the hospital come on that can't no this is a true fact I think they had 900 beds and they had it just over that in terms of billing coding and revenue cycle and in managing these discount okay so let me give you another contrarian argument if you fix the healthcare system how many people are gonna lose a job a lot healthcare is an enormous industry it employs tens of millions of people yeah look what are those people gonna do now well you can make the same argument about the financial mortgage crisis you had all these people selling in subprime mortgages and getting rich and employing other people and these giant companies

[02:14:33] Healthcare is a gigantic bubble right now and the parallels to the financial crisis are striking and at some point if you think about it we are spending money we don't have on products that we don't even need sometimes the PBM world medical services that are unnecessary the enormous middle layers and doctors quite honestly are very suspicious of what's happening they don't understand I mean I didn't understand until I started touring and to going to these conferences and and saying I'm sick of this I'm a professor of Health Policy I don't feel like I have a handle on the entire house care system and I decided enough is enough I want to learn educate myself on every tiny detail of this enormous system I want to know every law Medicaid rule insurance contract negotiation talk to the negotiators what goes on at that meeting well they say our prices are gonna go up by 10 percent next year but we're gonna give you a 12% discount and then they turn around and dial up the prices 15 percent and then the hospital says oh good job Bob I'm just making it up you generated another four million dollars for us you're now promoted to whatever title this gigantic industry and they're coming up to me at the conferences in other places and telling me I do this and this but quite honestly my job doesn't need to exist if we had honest and fair pricing in America we wouldn't need this gigantic negotiating of discounts and markups the markup discount game I call it and one important thing and one thing I'd ask you and all your listeners to do is use the Honest lexicon just like we talked about medical care gone wrong versus a preventable adverse event let's use the patient-centered terms let's talk about prices and not costs let's remember that we're paying not our insurance company or our employer or other folks let's talk about bills you shouldn't be getting there I refer to them as predatory billing practices or predatory medicine screenings you don't need so let's talk a little bit about that you talked about how studies have looked at what percentage of tests that physicians order do they deem unnecessary so in other words you go and you pull a thousand doctors and you say secretly and confidentially so no one's gonna come and spank you for this how often are you ordering a test that is unnecessary and the answer turned out to be twenty one percent twenty one percent was the average now actually yeah the average the question said excluding your own practice in your observation got it okay okay as we develop practice pattern measures of waste which is a big project we're doing at Johns Hopkins with some other groups we've asked doctors tell us about an egregious area of overuse in your specialty something that's done much in a certain clinical situation and sometimes they'll be like I can't really think of anything and then we'll say well think about your competitor groups are they doing other stuff oh my god yeah they're doing endoscopy is every six months after an initial screening they're doing 50 biopsies and all this stuff so it's easier to get an answer when you don't force the lens inward right and I think it's back to our opening conversation we work our tails off in residency how dare we start saying that you've crossed over to an area of entitlement and burnout where you do too much unnecessary let's talk about the system it's not a threatening we talk about low value care in the medical literature and that's how we're talking about this subject now you could take a couple of those into I've always thought of this as an area that doesn't get enough attention because I sort of divided into two categories so let's take one of the most egregious examples which I'm sure will upset a few people which is interventional cardiology there's a lot of people already upset from the pot we've upset a lot of people okay so the medical literature on stenting is like all things in the medical literature there's some room for interpretation but there are some things that we kind of know so if somebody is having an ST elevated wave MI and they're hemodynamically unstable in the emergency room those are patients that do a lot better when you put a stent in them it can be life-saving yep you're gonna save that person's life so we're here to say stents are not bad okay but then there's a whole body of literature that makes it also pretty clear that there are a whole bunch of people that don't seem to get any better with stents meaning there's no evidence you're gonna save their life and that's not the only reason to put a stent in because if you save a person from having another heart attack that might be a reason anyone who's had a heart attack would say I don't care if it reduces my risk of dying but just not having a heart attack would be a benefit or if it reduces chest pain so you have this whole other group of people who actually have no benefit of a stent it doesn't reduce chest pain doesn't reduce subsequent heart attack and it doesn't save a life and then you get into the business of well how many stents should you put in you know where I'm going with this right there are interventional cardiologists out there that are putting stents in people and violating every aspect of what is known meaning they're putting them into the wrong patients and they're putting in far too many and they're getting paid by the stent okay you've actually talked publicly about this in the dermatology world about people doing Mohs surgery that's one type of bad actor in the system and you could argue some of that is conscious some of that is subconscious so it might be the case that that doctor who is putting five stents in the person with stable angina who's never shown even evidence of Emma high or EKG change deep down is a good person and thinks that they know something that none of the studies have ever shown and I get that okay and then within that there's going to be some nefarious actors who are simply used-car salesmen gone wrong I just realized I insulted a bunch of used-car salesmen but there are people who are literally just shaking down the system and they know that they're gonna get a thousand bucks for every stent they put in so I'm gonna put five in this guy today even though he probably needs zero my impression which could be entirely incorrect is that the majority of unnecessary care is not in that category it's in a different category which has two ends to it one is the I don't have the time to deal with figuring out exactly what the right thing to do is and the cost of me giving in and giving someone an antibiotic when I'm pretty sure they have a viral infection that's gonna go away in three days the cost of me trying to educate the patient on that and explain antibiotic resistance it's just too high I've only got 15 minutes

[02:21:00] I'll just give them the goddamn z-pak right that's one and then the second subset of at which by the way I think is the worst one is that the I'm not going to be the guy that gets sued because I didn't order the head CT on the person with a headache even though I know that this person stopped drinking coffee two days ago and they went from three cups of coffee a day to nothing and they're coming in here with the worst headache of their life and I'm pretty 99.999% sure its caffeine withdrawal but I'm not gonna let this person walk out of this

[02:21:31] ER without a head CT because if god forbid it's a tumor or an aneurysm I'm gonna get sued so everyone gets a head CT I mean I told a funny story last night at dinner that I will repeat but of a patient coming in with complaining that their hair was vibrating and they get a head CT because the ER Doc's like individual I know that's bad for the system but as an individual it's in my best interest to do that or one time I saw a patient with hair vibrating and I got a CT and it showed a cancer yeah I'm like Osler reincarnated I'm so good I suspected that that vibrating hair was actually a meningioma beneath the surface this to me is a very dirty problem in America which is we are a very litigious culture and it is that so when people talk about medical malpractice which I want to come back to because you alluded to it people tend to be dismissive of it and say it's not actually that big a part of medicine because they're looking at the actual cost of medical malpractice what I think they're missing is the threat of medical malpractice has created a culture of completely unnecessary testing as part of the cya fellowship that everyone gets taught in medicine so somewhere down the line each of us in residency was taught cover-your-ass which means you are doing stuff that is not good but it is going to look good in a deposition in the worst case tout come here now how do you fix that problem good medical care so for every five docs in the ER that will say if somebody has a headache you just reliability reasons need to get a cat scan or an MRI I bet you there's a senior doc who says no you don't look people are more likely to sue you because they're just angry at you or they're incredibly dissatisfied than because you failed to order a test and do the right thing and you can defend it if you need to defend it that the patient had a moderate headache and so really good sound judgment I mean I love these very senior wise doctors that say do the right thing don't just react to some fear of a potential risk the unnecessary testing and unnecessary doing things because if malpractice concerns is definitely a problem in certain pockets of medicine the emergency room and OB they're getting hammered and OB but it's not the driver you know people it's so vivid to us doctors and it seems so wrong and so unnecessary and you want to blame these lawyers that have these contingency games the reality is it is such an inconsequential small fraction of the medical spend even though most doctors think it's one of the primary drivers of our higher health care costs when you say it's insignificant you mean the actual cost of malpractice insurance litigation and things like that well not just that but studies have shown it's not just doing stuff that costs money but you are avoiding things because of malpractice concerns people may avoid surgery I don't want to touch this guy because if something goes wrong I don't want to have that liability so you also have avoiding care because of malpractice concerns I remember once in clinic a discussion coming up with a patient that was an attorney and the attending said complex case and an attorney don't do it you know you asking to be sued if something goes wrong yeah so how many unnecessary head scans the Medicare pays 300 bucks for did that one of operation avoidance balance out so if you talk to the real scholars of health care cost they'll tell you it's now malpractice I know it's an emotional issue so yeah and it's nothing about practice but you're saying even the over treatment to minimize the risk of it so so what about another thing which is do we have a culture of just expecting that like so how many times has you get that patient who comes in who said I stop drinking coffee three days ago I've got a really bad headache but I'm really worried and is there ever room for the discussion that says look in my judgment and I've already talked to three of my colleagues here today we all think that your headache is from caffeine withdrawal and we think you should take tylenol and maybe have a coffee and maybe taper off as opposed to just going from three coffees to zero coffees but if you really really want a CT scan we'll do it it's gonna cost this much now your insurance company is gonna cover this much but you're gonna cover this much I mean that seems like a reasonable discussion I mean again it's artificial in that I can't imagine an ER doc having the luxury of time to sit down and have that let alone the transparency into pricing but to me that's the way the world works in everything else

[02:26:14] I mean Marty if you want to buy a Ferrari you can you know how much it costs and you would presumably decide that car is worth more than a house you could make that decision if you felt that way so in theory you should be able to say to people look I'm your advocate here is the doctor I don't think you need a head

[02:26:34] CT if I was in your situation I would not want the radiation I think people don't understand the radiation they're getting in CTS 100 times more than an x-ray I don't think you should be allowed into a CT scanner without someone telling you how many millisieverts you're getting and showing you the NRC guidelines for how many millisieverts of radiation you should be exposed to and look I order CT scans on patients all the time but I have this discussion it's like okay you're allowed 50 millisieverts of radiation a year we're gonna do a CT angiogram in you but in this facility it's 2.2 mil easy verts and you're gonna pay this amount for it if you go and do it over there it's 18 millisieverts and you're gonna pay less your choice great to me that makes sense so I guess I didn't realize it I guess I thought it was a bigger problem but you're saying the data say that's not an issue it's a small issue it's less than three tenths of one percent of the overall healthcare cost crisis and that's been studied many times but yet it's vivid and we're proximate to it as doctors and to be honest with you like you say healthcare is a lot of things that we don't understand and here's one thing we see and we understand and it just seems wrong and that's why it's disproportionately dominating the discussion of healthcare costs the reality is my malpractice insurance it's about 40-some thousand dollars a year as a surgeon at Johns Hopkins it's been about that for 25 years but yet premiums go up 7 to 11 percent a year for health insurance for health in general what we're spending yeah yeah so

[02:27:57] I mean so if you're gonna rank order the things I mean you've pointed out an enormous one if simply if bogus discounts in middlemen is 15 percent of it that has to be the single largest item then isn't it well that's just the pricing failure piece of it and that's just an estimation so then you add to that 21 percent of healthcare and services are unnecessary according to this survey of 2000 doctors that we did at Hopkins around the country if they're saying that 21 percent of everything we're doing is unnecessary there is a huge cost reduction an opportunity if we can focus on appropriateness what about drug pricing generic versus non generic I mean that seems to be another place where the

[02:28:38] United States pays disproportionately more than anyone else in the world yeah absolutely another piece of it I mean that's where people are coming up with the stats that roughly half of our healthcare spend can be chopped off and we can still deliver high-quality health care that has better patient so what about the counter-argument counter-argument would say look pick your favorite drug Americans are gonna pay two times more than anybody else in some cases much more I mean we sometimes use a canadian pharmacy for our patients for really expensive drugs just on principle it's not that the patient is so he can't afford it but I just say to them look I'm morally opposed to the fact that you're gonna pay thirty dollars a pill for something that I know in Canada is a dollar and ninety seven cents a pill and that example is actually true if I'm gonna give you 300 of these for a year I'd much rather you pay two bucks a pill than thirty bucks a pill because your insurance won't cover this by the way the counter-argument is yeah yeah yeah we have to pay more for drugs as

[02:29:30] Americans because we're reaping the benefit of drug discovery all the best drug discoveries taking place here these are our companies which by the way is not entirely true and therefore we subsidize the rest of the world's drug costs because that's the price we pay for being the innovator that kind of a bogus argument you're absolutely right

[02:29:49] Pharma companies when they develop drugs are factoring in their sort of budgeting the profit down the road into the drug development price so if there's bigger profits in the US that's all part of the investment that they make in the research problem is with drug pricing is there are so many moving parts and what

[02:30:06] I've seen is first of all as a cancer surgeon some of these drugs do miracles and save lives it's just incredible what we're seeing biologic agents now are working wonders in part because it's a whole different generation these are not small molecules these are expensive drugs to develop their immune based medications katroo de is just unbelievable Eva below and it's getting more awesome and we're seeing live saved well what we're seeing is a couple bad actors engage in the business of price gouging we're seeing a couple bad actors transition from brand to generic by not giving the information to the generic companies they're not disclosed using it like they should normally have to disclose when your brand is done all the manufacturing stuff you're supposed to disclose it so other well they just delay it and they drag and Scott

[02:30:53] Gottlieb the head of the FDA has basically said enough is enough when your patents are over you've got to turn all this stuff over we got to get the generics going right away if you drag your feet for a couple years it's like having a patent for a few more years Wow I didn't even think of that opportunity to screw people harder and then you get the PBM middle Games which the smoke bomb in the PBM world is the rebates rebates are when the PBMs or middlemen you name it any of the middle layers say to the pharma companies and this is where I have a little sympathy for farm if it's okay to say that America today the PBM say Oh or group purchasing organizations if you want to be in our catalog our formularies that we make available to our employees you know the benefits programs we manage or the hospitals that we supply if we're a group purchasing organization or GPO pay us a million bucks to be in the catalog well what does the pharma company do they pay the million bucks and they build it into the price of the drug and then the middlemen says hey this is a good game how about two million sure build it into the price of the drug how about fifty million and we'll give you exclusive placement in the formulary or exclusive placement in our group purchasing cattle numbers directionally

[02:32:00] I mean are you making these numbers uppers now literally what some of them dollar numbers are it's literally what they are and they're there not only are they forcing you know the the pharma companies device companies also are being held hostage these middlemen to say look you pay us these fees or you're not gonna be our in our catalog how do you think we had a shortage of saline I mean ask Jill who's one of the best nurses I've ever worked with and Hopkins asked her how do we have a shortage of saline it's salt water salt the two most common elements in the world salt and water how do we have a critical shortage and the price spikes why because these middlemen played these play to pay fee games called so-called rebates so really kickbacks let's call it what it is let's change the lexicon pay these kickbacks to be in our catalogue or pays a lot of money you can be the exclusive saline company in art and then all of a sudden their supply chain gets I love the notion of their needing to be exclusive saline provider like there's something so proprietary about putting sodium in water the shiny object they're floating to the hospitals and the employers yes they say you're gonna get the biggest discount oh we get both discounting well you don't even know what the bench reference price is anymore there's only one company making it and so they figured out this game now the game is very profitable for the I call it a rich man's game it's very profitable for everybody except the last guy holding the bag the patient I mean the hospitals are even getting a share back sometimes these rebates are basically kickbacks and I've argued to every single politician I get in front of which is a lot of them and I can tell you I've met with a lot of people in the Trump administration even last week and I've told them we need to eliminate all kickbacks in healthcare it's time we ban all kickbacks is that a policy issue was that a legal issue or is that a market issue it's two issues it's one it's a policy issue in 1987 law was passed to give PBMs and GPOs or it gave PBMs and GPOs exclusivity so the Sherman Antitrust Act does not apply to this supply chain I'm glad you bring that up because I was just about to say that sounds like antitrust like we certainly wouldn't allow that in any other industry how bad is it that those middlemen PBMs GPOs have benefited from a law that was passed which gave them so-called exclusivity to the state to the Sherman

[02:34:21] Antitrust Act it's called the safe harbor and you'll see a lot of us writing about it you'll see a lot of it and the policy discussions let's get rid of the safe harbor let's get rid of kickbacks and hell okay so to fix any problem you have to immediately understand who's going to be hurt by this situation leaving its status quo surely there must be an army of lobbyists that have no interest in anything you're talking about they don't want any safe harbors being revoked they don't want any middlemen going away and despite the fact that at the individual level I believe many of these people are disgusted by the profession in the end as a group you stand up for what you have and used to end up for your livelihood so it seems to me one of the biggest challenges is okay Marty is a voice of opposition to this but the people who are being hurt the most which with every human out there every person in this country that is there not collective they're sort of like I'm one guy and I got my bill and I'm getting screwed and you're one guy and you're fighting with a collections agency and you're one woman and you got breast cancer and you got these guys riding shotgun up your butt and blah blah blah blah but there's no one that brings them together so it's sort of like you have an industry complex a machine that is very easily able to diffuse a bunch of one-off attacks that strikes me as to me the biggest single problem here it's not the structural problem within the system there are relatively straightforward ideas that can be tested and iterated on the problem is how do you create the inertia for change when the people who have to force change at the individual level have less to gain then the collective entity does to lose that's I mean not to be depressing but that strikes me as the problem here but the exciting thing is that young people

[02:36:07] Millennials doctors senior physicians that have been in practice who see propofol and sudden shortage people who understand there's money games and there's stuff that's going on that shouldn't be happening they're standing up there organizing I mean look at what this has got to be grassroots I mean its grassroots and you know what's awesome is this is our heritage this is the medical profession this is who we are as doctors were advocates for our patients that's who we are it's in our blood I mean when dr.

[02:36:36] Sabin invented the polio vaccine they told him all his colleagues told him and these business guys you need to get a patent on this because this could be the biggest moneymaker in the world he said no this is the property of humanity I want as many people to get this as possible there are estimates of what

[02:36:53] Salk forfeited by not 8 billion Forbes estimated 8 billion dollars of that day that was 1954 a year when 20,000 people were living in an iron lung machine he talked about a horrible disease and he said this is a gift to mankind this will be disseminated as broadly as possible and it's probably one of the greatest and most inspiring stories that guy's a hero that is medicine that's who we are and when Benjamin Rush one of the five physician signers of the Declaration of

[02:37:23] Independence had his Pratt does his entire life he took care of patients with schizophrenia and he D stigmatized mental illness so it wasn't seen as demon-possession his patients were chained to buildings they had no money mental illness meant you were impoverished he took care of those patients he was a role model he was one of our greatest leaders in society

[02:37:43] President Adams says you know Benjamin Franklin and dr. Benjamin Rush both had great contributions to mankind but Benjamin Rush had more and they were greater and that's our heritage I mean that is who we are that's who my dad was as he took care of cancer patients he's now retired he would never treat a patient and then destroy their FICO score with surprise bills we have this incredible heritage of being patient advocates and if we can channel 1% of the energy we spend on lobbying for higher doctor pay in Washington DC into being the champions of fair and honest transparent pricing we're gonna see this incredible public trust come back because I worry and I'd love your thoughts on this but I really worry we are seeing the public trust eroded by this medical money game billing predatory game that's going on I'm from central Pennsylvania not a town called

[02:38:39] Danville the Amish people are very close to that area we have more men and I closer to our region the Amish people when someone gets a serious illness half the time they take an Amtrak train for five days to Mexico because the medical care there has honest and fair transparent pricing they're worried about getting price gouged in the hospitals locally what's that say about our country you get on the Amtrak train in Pittsburgh where the Amtrak from

[02:39:07] Lancaster connects with the train that goes cross-country it is mostly Amish people going to Mexico for breast cancer surgery for a chronic disease therapy for a medication what said say it says people are hungry for honest and transparent pricing like Keith Smith has in Oklahoma City it's well here you say is look physicians aren't the reason that this system is broken but now the onus is on them to play a role in catalyzing reform because by association whether we like it or not we're now part of the problem and it's so proximate to us we interact all the time when I'd show the egregious bills or the stories of individuals harmed by these bills or they're paying more on their mortgage because their FICO score was destroyed from a balanced bill from an epidural the hospital executives are very understanding I mean they I think it sometimes just don't know how far the revenue cycle or billing outsource departments how aggressive they've got and if you appeal to everyday human instinct they will say yeah this does not seem right we are very close to our hospital leaders in medicine we need to say okay here's a couple things a hospital code of conduct we can get our act together and provide one honest transparent bill that's not jacked up for discounts we can agree we will never sue a patient that's low-income and came in for basic medical care we can agree that if we're going to bill a patient directly we'll use the Medicare allowable amounts we're not angry when

[02:40:34] Medicare pays us we should be angry if somebody pays us the Medicare allowable amount this is a great idea Marty is there such a code of conduct that's being generated and signed off on this to me sounds like a great first step and there's no order to these steps that can be done in parallel but I think you could rattle off ten things that 90% of physicians and hospital administrators would look at and go yeah I believe in like everything you just said who wouldn't agree to those principles and potentially seven more is that in the works yeah my students have put it up at restoring medicine org a basic code of conduct for medical centers but it's not just Doc's it's not just medical professionals I have people all the time every day folks if I speak to a conference or say real estate agents and we get into all these issues they'll often say and I want to do something what can I do and I tell them get involved in your local hospital it is a community organization it's a nonprofit with a public mission and ask these questions how do you manage patients who can't pay if their deductible is high and they get a bill or they're uninsured how do you bill what's your average markup is it 1.5 is it 2.5 is it 23 like we found in some of our research what is your average markup define as how much do you charge above the

[02:41:52] Medicare allowable amount we did get the Trump administration I was very impressed Seema Verma alexsei czar Kellyanne I mean incredible folks that basically said yeah we get it when it comes to fair pricing we want every hospital to submit their prices and they did that January 1 it's a first step it's a first step these are jacked up prices we got to get the real prices but every day folks want to know what to do

[02:42:13] I tell them find out what's your hospital's average markup how do they handle bills that are not paid among low-income insured and uninsured people reach out to your local courthouse find out if they're suing the socks off of the town like we've seen in 20% of hospitals in the state of Virginia and then reach out to your board members and ask them engage them on the subject and the hospital board members it's always the president of the local bank it's always a couple business leaders they're always reasonable people they come in

[02:42:41] I'm on a hospital board I got a meeting later today Anne Arundel Medical Center it's at the big Hospital in Annapolis Maryland these are good people appeal to those people and say look we want to take this code of conduct seriously we want a hospital that provides roughly 6% of our services as charity care disclosed upfront to the patient not we shake you down whatever we can't get that we like that we did him charity we deem charity which is the standard way of doing business six percent charity honest pricing honest billing practices those are things we can engage our community board members on that's the purpose of writing this book the price we pay you know when you write a book especially as a doctor maybe is especially even as a surgeon some people who don't like this message will ascribe to you and I know you're working on a book people are scared oh they're self promoting they're just doing this for self-promotion what's known among authors is the books don't make money you don't make them for the time you spend I mean I'd make a lot more money just doing surgery but this is a way of getting the message out there and to engage people and to say hey this is what's happening and this is what we can do about it well Marty I know you do have to get down to

[02:43:52] Annapolis today so I guess we'll bring us to a close I think there are a lot of things here it's sort of overwhelming as I said I don't know I can't really think of a machine that I find more confused in the US healthcare system and that in general probably isn't a good thing I hope that you're right I mean I got to be honest with you I'm concerned that a force necessary to overcome the inertia is so great that we need a bigger crisis because in the end we'll do things until we can't do them anymore we always talk about well this isn't sustainable well technically it is because we're still doing it right so what does it take for this to not become sustainable I don't know but I I love your message that doctors need to sort of get involved in this a little bit because by proxy we are involved in it whether we want to be or not so you take that example of a woman if you provide care to this woman with breast cancer and you're doing the best you can and you don't realize that a year later she's getting shaken down for medical bills well you can say well

[02:44:52] I didn't have anything to do with that and it's true you didn't but do you also have an obligation to her and if the answer that question is yes then I think that doctors and patients alike can probably overcome what you're describing I hope that turns out to be the case I'm seeing some exciting things I mean right now I think the American people are prioritizing this problem as the number one problem in America when the LA Times reporter Noam levy tells me that more

[02:45:18] Americans are making different choices at the supermarket they're cutting their vacations and they no longer have money to save for their kids and sometimes their FICO scores are getting destroyed all because of surprised medical bills or inflated bills this is saying and he's saying this is going to be the number one issue in the election this is the number-one issue from the American public and my goal is how can we educate people I'm never gonna run for office

[02:45:44] I mean I've thought about running for president simply on one issue of banning all plastic surgery because I got a Florida a lot you know there's it's the evolutionary reflex of a human being identifying another species and being frightened you know like a kid you know if I kid sees someone ugly they don't jump they see something with all this plastic they're startled and it's sort of the natural selection identifying foreign species but this is something that is eminently fixable we're seeing employers now saying I want independent broker

[02:46:14] Consultants renegotiating my PBMs that don't take kickbacks there's a group of them there's not a lot we put them on the website restoring medicine give me all the resources so we're can someone go if they want to know how to find an independent versus on kickback broker so health rosetta is started by Dave Chase and what he's done is try to create a brand of sort of the free trade brokers if you will that is those people that have agreed to a code of conduct and it's all transparent and you feel it's worth getting a second so that's health

[02:46:42] Rosetta calm the health rosette if you Google Health Rosetta it comes up we're putting a link to it on our resource what's your resource restoring medicine org and we're trying to generate some interest the students created the website I put a post on there that showed the prices of everything in America and prices of hospital services which was crazy off the charts compared to everything else in society and this thing I just posted it god I don't know seventy likes in a day and share seventy shares in a day I don't know if I have seventy friends I realize like people are connecting with this issue that we can do better so that's restoring medicine restoring medicine o RG basically can point people in the direction of all of the things you're talking about here yeah and also I've got a website Marty MD com where I try to provide some resources for folks that are interested in learning more about this all right and the price we pay comes out exactly when they're still floating the date but it's gonna come out when they line it up with the media but it'll be very soon all right well

[02:47:41] Marty thank you so much man awesome to get to hang with you two days in a row great to be with ya Peter it's just so awesome to see what you're doing educating people and promoting good health and reeducate and I'd like to see some humility from the American Heart Association just to say we're sorry we got it horribly wrong but I think it's gonna be individuals like you that just say hey stuff I was taught is now outdated and this is the new science so thanks for pushing us on that well I'll tell you that seems like a much easier problem to sort of be working on than the one you're working on so I think you are actually working on the single most important problem in all of medicine and

[02:48:15] I don't say that lightly cuz I think there are a lot of problems in medicine but if we don't get this one fixed soon we're gonna be and I think the degree of pain that most people can't fathom from any it's great to be with you Peter crazy mmm you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog at
