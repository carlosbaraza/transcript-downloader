## Description

Original release date: 10/18/2018

In this five-part series, Thomas Dayspring, M.D., FACP, FNLA, a world-renowned expert in lipidology, and one of Peter’s most important clinical mentors, shares his wealth of knowledge on the subject of lipids. In Part IV, Peter and Tom review the history and current use of drugs to prevent cardiovascular disease. They also discuss why some drugs appear to be more effective than others, an in-depth conversation about niacin, cholesterol and brain health, and the futility of using CKs (creatinine kinase) and liver function tests to identify adverse effects in statins, to name a few topics in this episode.

We discuss:
-Bile acid sequestrants and statins [2:00];
-Ezetimibe (Zetia) [15:00];
-PCSK9 inhibitors [27:30];
-Fibrates [41:00];
-Fish oil, DHA, and EPA [1:01:00];
-Niacin [1:05:15];
-PCSK9 inhibitors [1:23:45];
-Cholesterol, statins, and the brain [1:30:00];
-Elevated creatine kinase (CK) and liver function tests (LFTs) on statins [1:50:30]; and
-More.

About:
The Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking…and a few other things. With over 10 million episodes downloaded, it features topics including fasting, ketosis, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, mental health, and much more. 

Peter is the founder of Attia Medical, PC, a medical practice with offices in San Diego and New York City, focusing on the applied science of longevity. The practice applies nutritional biochemistry, exercise physiology, sleep physiology, techniques to increase distress tolerance, lipidology, pharmacology, and four-system endocrinology to increase lifespan (delaying the onset of chronic disease), while simultaneously improving healthspan (quality of life).

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast with Tom Dayspring:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focuses on various lipid-lowering medications and their mechanisms of action. Dr. Dayspring and Dr. Attia discuss statins, ezetimibe (Zetia), PCSK9 inhibitors, fibrates, and niacin. They explore the evolution of lipid-lowering therapy, clinical trials, and the importance of understanding both the benefits and potential risks of these medications. A significant portion focuses on the relationship between statins, cholesterol synthesis, and brain health.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Statins work primarily by enhancing LDL receptor expression and clearance [00:13:08]
- Ezetimibe has dual mechanisms: blocking intestinal cholesterol absorption and preventing hepatic cholesterol reabsorption from bile [00:16:38]
- PCSK9 inhibitors work by prolonging LDL receptor life and enhancing clearance [01:28:31]
- Desmos sterol levels can be used as a biomarker for brain cholesterol synthesis [01:39:35]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Consider combination therapy with lower-dose statins plus ezetimibe rather than maximum statin doses [01:42:19]
- Monitor desmos sterol levels when using statins [01:43:10]

Risk/Benefit Considerations:
- Cognitive effects of statins may be more pronounced in certain individuals [01:45:49]
- CK elevation alone should not dictate statin therapy decisions [01:51:50]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Medications discussed:
- Statins (Lipitor, Crestor, Pravastatin) [01:33:05]
- Ezetimibe (Zetia) [00:16:38]
- PCSK9 inhibitors (Repatha, Praluent) [01:23:59]
- Fibrates [00:41:36]
- Niacin [01:06:22]

5. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Desmos sterol as a marker of brain cholesterol synthesis [01:39:35]
- ApoB and LDL particle count as better markers than LDL-C [01:53:37]
- CK and liver function tests not reliable for statin monitoring [01:51:50]

6. **Notable Quotes**:
"If you tell me you are a doctor who has prescribed a lot of statins... and you've never seen cognitive impairment in a patient, you're a liar or you're a fool" [01:47:49]

7. **Follow-up Questions**:
- What is the optimal way to monitor statin therapy beyond traditional lipid panels?
- How can we better identify patients at risk for statin-related cognitive effects?
- What role will PCSK9 inhibitors play as they become more affordable and accessible?

This analysis captures the main points of discussion but there was significant additional technical detail in the conversation that would require medical background to fully appreciate.
