Sam Apple is the author of the book Ravenous: Otto Warburg, the Nazis, and the Search for the Cancer-Diet Connection, published in May 2021. In this episode, Sam describes the fascinating life story of Otto Warburg, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist who, despite being both Jewish and gay, survived Nazi Germany because of his valuable research on cellular metabolism and cancer. Sam describes Warburg’s observation that cancer cells consume large amounts of glucose anaerobically – a phenomenon subsequently known as the “Warburg Effect” – and relates how Warburg’s seminal work on this topic was largely forgotten after the discovery of oncogenes, only to regain relevance decades later within the field of cancer biology. Sam sheds light on the current debate around Warburg’s interpretation of the causes of cancer, and Peter gives his personal take on the matter. Finally, Peter and Sam tie it all together with a discussion about cancer prevention, the role of hyperinsulinemia, and the link between dietary sugar and cancer.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of the episode about Otto Warburg and cancer metabolism:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features an interview with Sam Apple, author of "Ravenous: Otto Warburg, the Nazis, and the Search for the Cancer-Diet Connection." The discussion covers Warburg's groundbreaking discovery of cancer cell metabolism (the Warburg Effect), his survival in Nazi Germany despite being Jewish and gay, and the modern implications of his work for cancer research and treatment. The conversation bridges historical narrative with cutting-edge cancer metabolism science.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Warburg discovered that cancer cells preferentially ferment glucose even in the presence of oxygen (aerobic glycolysis) [32:15]
- Normal cells produce 32-34 ATP molecules through oxidative phosphorylation vs. only 2-4 ATP through fermentation [1:15:20]
- Warburg believed damaged mitochondria were the primary cause of cancer [45:30]
- Modern understanding suggests the Warburg Effect may be more about providing building blocks for cell division than energy production [1:25:45]
- Hyperinsulinemia appears to play a crucial role in both obesity and cancer development [1:45:30]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Maintain metabolic health and avoid hyperinsulinemia [1:48:15]
- Reduce exposure to environmental carcinogens [1:12:30]
- Focus on prevention through lifestyle factors [1:52:40]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Consider metabolic approaches alongside conventional cancer treatments [1:55:20]
- Monitor insulin levels as part of cancer prevention strategy [1:49:30]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
No specific supplements or medications were discussed in detail.

5. **Exercise & Movement**:
No specific exercise protocols were discussed.

6. **Nutrition & Diet**:
- Reducing sugar/fructose intake may be important for cancer prevention [1:58:15]
- Focus on dietary approaches that minimize insulin response [1:50:30]

7. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Insulin levels are an important marker to track [1:49:30]
- Glucose metabolism in cancer cells can be measured [35:20]

8. **References & Resources**:

## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia

[00:00:10] hey sam how are you doing today i'm doing good how are you good good um congratulations on the uh the publication of your book uh very recently uh i i having never done that before i can still only imagine it's uh akin to giving birth or something like that um it feels like the weight of the world off your shoulders after how much research you've put into that yeah it's a it's a huge relief just to be done so i'm uh trying to think about a future project but i feel like i need a few years just to to relax now oh yeah yeah i uh i imagine there's nothing more annoying than when you publish a book when somebody says so what's your next book going to be about it's like like many uh books that go really deep into a topic be it science or otherwise they often start out as articles um and of course you wrote a piece uh was it 2015 when when was that piece came out in 2016. yeah um it was the new york times magazine piece correct right um and i remember that quite well you and i had spoken quite a bit before then and i know that that sort of ultimately led to the work that went into this book but more broadly speaking what attracted attracted you to this topic of of warburg cancer metabolism the the era of nazi germany and science in um in that era what what uh what gravitated you to that yeah i mean like so many people in this world um i was influenced by taubs at a fairly early stage of my interest in metabolism i you know read some of his work and that had led me to other authors and and eventually to to a lot of your work in your blog uh which i learned a lot from so i had been interested in metabolism for a number of years uh but i i had not really thought of cancer as a metabolic disease or thought about cancers being lumped with obesity and diabetes and heart disease and when i started to read more about that and see that you know they clustered together and that you see the same pattern that begins in the 19th century of all these metabolic conditions growing more common that's what really sort of sparked my curiosities you know cancer isn't supposed to be metabolic like these other diseases you know it's bad luck it's mutations that are caused by environmental carcinogens or whatnot so it just stayed in my mind but i hadn't planned to write about it until i came across a mention of warburg i think it was just one sentence you know 1923 a german scientist makes an important discovery about the metabolism of cancer cells and um you know so i googled otto warburg and i started to read about him and you know it was kind of a light bulb moment for me like oh my gosh i have to write about this man uh you know because i'm a journalist a storyteller by profession and so i don't write about science usually unless i feel like i know how to tell a story if i have a central character then i know how to tell a story so once i i had warburg i knew i was going to write about it and um and you had a way to tell the story before we get to that story i want to kind of understand a little bit about your your your work as a writer um you're a prolific writer you you actually teach a course in science writing at johns hopkins now don't you uh yes i do so when did you realize you were a writer um well my father is a writer so it helped to to have that you know for many people grow up it seems like a you know an unusual career choice but for me it was you know obviously you know potential option just having seen my father do it but um truth is i didn't try to at least not consciously to follow in his footsteps if anything i thought that you know i might need to distinguish myself by choosing a different path and you know i like my father mostly writes fiction i like to half joke that my big rebellion was moving into non-fiction um but really was in college when um you know i wasn't sure what i was going to do and i was getting a lot of praise for my writing and you know the praise felt good and that you know i wasn't you know killing it necessarily in other areas so you know i saw that it was my strength i enjoyed doing it and um i sort of you know just continued with it because i was succeeding with it so do you think a a good writer is born or made or how much of your success do you attribute to some inborn gift versus something you'd been cultivating and nurturing and practicing yeah it's a tough question i i think about it a lot because i you know i teach science writing and general creative writing at johns hopkins now and you know i i certainly think that everybody can improve a lot as a writer and you know i think clearly every day about how to get better at teaching it and helping people improve but you know at some level it's innate uh you know some people have more natural ability than others with language but i think it's pretty analogous to you know musical talent where some people can very quickly get very good at an instrument sit down on the piano in a matter of weeks be good and others will struggle for months and have to practice again and again but they eventually get there so um you know it's not i don't think it's correlated that strongly with intelligence it's a sort of just an ability to you know use language in a certain way that um comes naturally to some people and comes to other people with more practice but i think everybody can get pretty good with with enough practice so when you're teaching a class let's just say there's 100 students in the class what type of an assignment would you give if you wanted to very quickly figure out the the the breadth of natural ability or the spectrum of natural ability across the students how would you ferret that out quickly um truth is that um you can see it in almost any writing sample you know i i'm on the faculty of johns hopkins i'm also involved in the application uh in reviewing applications and and selecting students for the science writing program and you know they submit samples of their writing but i often look most closely just at the the cover letters because i feel like you know within a paragraph or two i get the feel you know if they have a feel for the language or not uh so it really comes across you know i think almost in any three or four sentences i can start to feel is you know are there extra words in these sentences is the logic tight does it flow um it really doesn't take very much to to figure it out that's amazing and it makes me feel so self-conscious because of how often i write you know every sunday i'm putting out a newsletter and i enjoy writing a lot but it doesn't i don't feel like it comes naturally to me so i can imagine um you know how many people must read that and go oh my god like yeah what he's saying is interesting but he's such a horrible writer and of course i know what it's like to read very good writing you know you can sort of spot the extremes or at least i can spot the extremes i don't think i could rank a hundred people from one to a hundred even though obviously there's somewhat you know there's a lot of subjective stuff in there but you know i could certainly say this is exceptional like i can read sid mukherjee and say wow this is really really good and similarly i can read something that is absolutely horrible and say this is really really bad i might not be able to tell you why though um so how much of it is also being able to in that cover letter say um you gave a couple of examples right like this person is using a lot of unnecessary words or they're presumably repeating themselves or this is illogical that's a lot to pick up in just a paragraph yeah i mean i think it comes down to clarity more than anything you can read something and grasp it right away because the language is concise and clear and you can read other things where it's just a very simple statement but you actually have to read it two or three times just to grasp the writer's meaning so you know george orwell famously wrote about politics and english language and you know how much good writing depends on clear concise thinking and i think that's true um but such a big part of it you know everything that that i write comes out pretty poorly in the first draft even my emails that if i really care about an email i spent a lot of time just going over and over and over because it's the repetition it's correction after correction after correction where the writing starts to improve so you know i think the difference between a good writer and a less good writer is often you know how many times the good writer goes over the work whereas the lesser writer will just say yeah it doesn't matter that much and send it off but there's a price to pay you know i waste half my life worrying about sentences and emails so you know something's come to the cost um and uh you know for the record i uh i was a big fan of your blog when you were posting more regularly so i think you're being too hard on yourself thanks um did you did you go to journalism school or did you do something after undergrad to further hone your writing skills i did i um i graduated and then i took a few years off to work at a magazine and then i spent two years doing a mfa program at columbia it's a creative non-fiction program so it's not journalism i thought about going to the journalism school but i i chose creative nonfiction because i was interested in more in long form and more in sort of you know storytelling as opposed to you know rigorous reporting that you know i do that as well but um i was really more interested in book writing and sort of long-form non-fiction and how do they teach at that level i mean obviously people who show up to do a two-year mfa at columbia which is arguably the best school in the united states at least to study that subject matter um you're dealing with a bunch of really talented people to begin with but what are they doing in two years to take you to the next level yeah it's it's mostly a writing workshop so you know every semester you have a group of about 15 students and a professor and you submit you know three four times during the semester you submit your own work and everybody in the class critiques it and the professor of course you know critiques it and discusses it and and that that's really the heart of most writing education and it's it's a grueling process at times you know you have 15 people sitting there telling you everything that's wrong with your work and you can't listen to all of them and they often disagree and you can go a little crazy you know trying to make your work sort of fit everybody's expectations there some writers in recent years who have really been pushing back against this workshop approach because they feel it's turns every piece into sort of a formulaic story or essay where you meet a certain set of expectations that everybody has and you don't do more experimental work so there are a lot of debates about that but i do think it's really important because even the best writers in the world don't know when their own work is working you know you need feedback from other people so much of it is trial and error and you know writing a short story i might use the first person you know telling it from my own perspective and then everybody says it's not working so i try it again and i write from the third person not using the i and then it suddenly works and you don't really know what works until you get responses because when you're writing you know if you get on a roll everything feels good everything you know if you're in that space for you know a few minutes when you're writing you think oh i'm not a role this is great and then you show it to your workshop and nobody likes it so you need that feedback and you know maybe sometimes you're right and they're wrong but but ultimately you're trying to publish your work for an audience so the audience has to be right at some level does it amaze you when you see people like you know atul gawande and sid mukherjee and azra raza people who didn't necessarily formally train in writing but who seem to write beautifully yeah i mean it's beyond amazing it's actually really annoying and frustrating i it just you know all you know i i admire all three of the people you mentioned and you know not only are they exceptional writers but um you know they're full-time physicians and doing these incredible things and it just absolutely blows my mind that they have the time to do it and when they do it they do it you know almost in a way that's almost unimaginably good like i get depressed reading mukherjee because i think you know what's the point of me even trying when he's writing in this way uh so i i don't know how they do it but um you know i just have to accept that you know very few people reach that level and you can still do good things if you're not reaching that level well that's definitely a good way to think about it so let's get back to the to the story here um and let's assume that the the listener here doesn't really know anything about warburg that name means nothing to them um what's the where's the right place to begin this story we've we've you know he he's he's born into a pretty well-to-do family in the uh kind of latter third of the 19th century um tell us where to pick up this story sure yeah i do think that his childhood is a really important part of the story um you know i had a hard time finding a lot of original sources and documents about his childhood but the the basic facts are that you know his father emile warburg is a very prominent physicist uh despite coming from a famous jewish family he rises to the top of german physics he's at the university of berlin which is very unusual for somebody of a jewish background in the late 19th century and einstein really loves his father you know says that he's like his favorite physicist and you know emile warburg ends up providing some of the experimental proof for some of einstein's theories so einstein was a regular in the house when warburg was a teenager max planck emil fischer and all these titans of german science and you know the germans revered their scientists the country was at the top of the scientific world at the time uh so warburg's you know vision for himself is you know he's gonna grow up and be a great scientist like the people that hang around in his house he's gonna make a world-changing discovery just as his father and einstein and emile fisher have and the question is where he's gonna you know focus his energies and he moves away from from physics which is a little surprising um i think that was his his rebellion in a way and he wanted to outdo his father emile warburg and uh so he moves into the realm of biology and physiology but it's always throughout his life uh through the lens of a physicist and always interested in energy and how you know we can understand biology through an understanding of energy so he didn't fully move away from his father so much as take the physics into a new realm and that extended to a study of photosynthesis as well so how old was he at the beginning of world war one uh that's a good question at the beginning of world war one he um i'd have to go back and do the math so it's 1914 and he was born in in 1883 uh so he's in his early 30s i guess and so what was the impact of world war one on german scientists it was you know pretty remarkable that um you know given that if you look back from a historical perspective i don't think that germany's position at the time is particularly defensible but there was you know just this huge surge of nationalism and the scientists for by and large got you know signed on and signed letters in support of the fatherland and were ready to go fight on the front lines and uh you know many of them did in some cases you know many of these scientists were jewish and because of the politics at the time they were you know can their german patriotism was questioned so by signing up for the war effort this was a way to prove they were full germans uh so that was a big part of it and you know many of them went to the battlefield and others uh you know worked with fritz haber who develops these gas weapons and you know all these sort of new weapons of war that are coming out of german science uh it you know it surprises me that warburg went to the battlefield rather than working with fritz harbor who you know he knew and you know was in you know ended up working in the same area in dalham where warburg worked so it's hard to understand why that happened but um you know i think warburg was really wanted to prove himself and he loved horses and he joined a cavalry regiment so i think that was a part of the appeal for him as well um now einstein urged him not to go correct um well einstein warburg went and then einstein wrote a letter to him uh in 1918 so the war was nearing its end and by that point you know everybody could see everybody who was rational and paying attention that it was a lost cause germans were dying by the tens of thousands and you know as madness as warburg's mother put it and they want they're desperate you know for warburg to come home his parents are desperate so they're friends with einstein and they can't convince warburg to come home so they turn to einstein and you know they know that warburg reveres einstein and they say you know will you write him a letter so so einstein does and it's really a perfect letter because it you know he knew warburg well enough to know that he was a narcissist and so he wrote the letter saying that you're just too important for science we can't afford to lose you and we don't have warburg's response to that letter but sure enough he comes home shortly thereafter so i think it was a letter from einstein that most likely convinced him and you know possibly saved his life and um you know five years later he makes his great breakthrough about cancer and fermentation so i like to think that you know that einstein may you know have saved his life and therefore deserves credit for this great cancer discovery as well in some indirect way you wrote about warburg that he was uh pathologically dedicated to his science what did you mean by that yeah i mean i think it's hard to understand unless you grew up in in 19th century germany but um you know somebody a friend who knew him described it as having a religious devotion like a prophet who has like this fervor who just thinks about nothing but science is passionate about science you know warburg used to say uh a scientist has to be prepared to die for the truth you get a sense of his perspective there and um i think my favorite example the one that's maybe most revealing is that at one point a friend was telling warburg about somebody a mutual friend or somebody she knew who was having mental difficulties and going through various problems warburg's advice for this person was tell him to think about nothing but science just think about science all day and you know the person in question wasn't even a scientist but that was you know reveals you know a lot about warburg i think about how he viewed the world and this devotion to science was partially about narcissism and wanting to be great but i think partially you know obviously a genuine love of science and curiosity about the truth but also a way to avoid looking internally you know i think that comment about the other person really reveals that he was covering something up by focusing on science all the time and you know trying not to look inward what do you think he was afraid to look at well you know he was he was a great narcissist and you know i think when you see that personality type it almost always comes sort of hand in hand with deep insecurity um and he he was clearly you know extremely insecure you had last you know whenever he was criticized he would lash out and start these feuds with other scientists so you know i think that um you know that that's where it ultimately came from but he also had you know all these difficult things to deal with you know being jewish in germany wasn't easy even before the nazis and then he has this other complicated issue which is that he's clearly homosexual he ends up spending his whole life with his male partner and he couldn't be out at the time in germany and his mother was pressuring him to get married and questioning his lifestyle and there were all sorts of rumors about him so he had a lot of stress and you know there are various ways it comes out like he he can't do public speaking you know he keeps being told you know to get your degree you have to go and give these talks and he just refuses and if it was anybody else they probably would have failed him but he was so brilliant that they just finally decided to move him along so you know there were a lot of psychological issues there did he in for his i mean was he in the closet his entire life or did he eventually come out well yeah i'm not sure i would use the phrase in the closet i mean in a sense almost everybody was in the closet so i actually you know he didn't fully come out and say i'm gay or talk about it but i think he was about as out as one could be throughout most of his life you know he didn't try to hide the fact that he lived with another man when he was invited to give a talk his his partner jacob heiss would always come with them warburg which you know in some instances say i'm not going to come unless you know my partner comes so you know they would go to the opera together and travel to his vacation house together so you know he didn't explicitly say you know i'm a homosexual but i think he came pretty much as close as anybody of that era and you know i really respect him for that had he met hitler uh there's no record of them meeting uh i think there's a lot of indirect evidence that that hitler was directly involved in in his his case and his fate um i can go into that detail or maybe we can build up to that but um there's no record of a direct interaction well yeah i guess before we get there let's i want to come back to that because it's it's the the intersection of them is is so fascinating to me um but let's go back to post-world war one and pick it up where um warburg moves into his sort of seminal work so it's 1918 einstein's convinced him to come back um potentially saving his life uh his first choice i suppose is where is he gonna set up shop right is he gonna stay in berlin or is he going to leave and he elects to stay yeah yeah he um he actually you know right before he leaves he's given this incredible position his own sort of wing in the kaiser wilhelm institute for biology which is sort of you know the pinnacle of german science they create this kaiser wilhelm society which is now the max planck society uh you know it's supposed to be the oxford of germany the idea is that they're going to get the best scientists in the world and give them everything they need it's actually inspired a lot by the rockefeller model the rockefeller institute the united states just find the most brilliant people give them what they need and let them go so he returns you know right before world war one he's about to start this position his lab was under construction and when he returns it's a very different world you know all the wealthy funders of the kaiser wilhelm society are now bankrupt um so he he doesn't even have you know much money for his his work at this point there's this famous example uh he has to write a grant proposal for one of the only times in his life and you know he can't bear to do it because he's so narcissistic so he finally writes you know scribbles on a piece of paper i need ten thousand dollar ten thousand marks and uh he actually gets the money um but uh he actually focuses on you when he comes back from the war he focuses on photosynthesis rather than cancer first and it's actually really interesting i think that um when his father was trying to get him out of the war he was making the case that warburg was needed for photosynthesis research because he was going to find new ways to grow food make photosynthesis more efficient and have more crop yields and you know the germans had been starving throughout much of the war and there were a huge few food shortages so you know he he um you know came back and and really i think wanted to solve world hunger and that remained an interest of his throughout his life uh but he was always interested in cancer as well at one point he asked another famous scientist for advice should i do photosynthesis or cancer and scientist says do cancer photosynthesis is working pretty well so he decides to do cancer and it's because you know he wants to make a world-changing discovery and cancer really has become a german obsession by the 1920s um you know if you look back into you know the early 19th century you know there's not much cancer around obviously there's all sorts of discussions and things you have to look at in terms of longevity and diagnostic techniques but i think there's overwhelming evidence which i try to document in my book that cancer did really increase and continue to increase uh well into the 20s and 30s and by the 1920s there's there's a panic uh so many people are getting cancer you know it's still pales in comparison to today's rates but it's a panic at the time and you know the germans had conquered so many diseases robert koch and paul ehrlich had figured out bacteriology and infectious diseases and it just seemed natural that they were going to do the same thing with cancer and warburg worshiped air like and uh you know thought he was going to be the next one to make this great discovery and uh so he takes on cancer and and pretty quickly finds this remarkable thing which is you know as you well know and probably a lot of your listeners know that uh you know most cancers uh eat differently than other cells they ferment glucose rather than you know burning you know breaking it down and burning with oxygen oxidative phosphorylation so this cancer cell shifts to fermentation is a remarkable discovery and you know ends up occupying his life uh his thoughts and he ends up focusing on that for much of his life so let's go back to how that discovery was made and what he was actually seeing in the laboratory that led him to this observation sure yeah so he you know the background is that um he had been studying um actually sea urchin eggs uh in the first years of the 20th century uh he's still a young scientist and uh he had seen that these eggs you know this is a little complicated and that you know he didn't necessarily get all this right but what his early studies showed was that um when the eggs were about to grow and proliferate they would immediately begin to increase oxygen consumption and it made perfect sense because you know you need energy to grow and you know using oxygen is the more efficient way to create energy for the cell uh so when he turns to cancer in 1923 he expects to see the same thing you know cell needs to grow it needs more energy it's going to use more oxygen and burn more nutrients with oxygen to grow and so um you know the experiments that he does you know he takes you know a slice of a tumor from a rat and you know he attaches it to a manometer which is a device really a very simple sort of u-shaped tube which can just measure changing gas pressures and um you know he expects that uh these cells he'll will start to take up more and more oxygen and he'll see the pressure change inside of his u-shaped tube uh but he doesn't see it he doesn't see the oxygen consumption increasing instead you know he checks the solution that these cells are in and he finds it's full of lactic acid you know lactic acid is what's made from fermentation you know what what human cells make from fermentation of course you know yeast and other microorganisms will make alcohol and carbon dioxide but um so he sees that they're clearly fermenting and you know it's a strange phenomenon that it's happening and he you know tries to do other experiments they end up doing you know tests uh in vivo in in people and seeing that they have more you know with cancer have more lactic acid in their blood and you know every every test he sort of carries out comes to the same conclusion that cancer cells are are taking up a lot of glucose and fermenting it to lactic acid and using less oxygen than he would expect go a little deeper for folks into that biochemical pathway so when a cell is presented with glucose as substrate and it wants to make atp what are the different fates of that glucose molecule and and why is it so absurd that a cell would in the presence of sufficient oxygen choose to make lactate why is that such an unusual thing to do why is he so surprised by this sure um you know he wasn't the first to understand or to see that a human cell can um ferment it was understood you know going back to uh you know the previous decades that human cells uh could do this you know it's very surprising when it was discovered because there was thoughts only microorganisms did it but um you know warburg was very close with another physiologist uh otto meyerhoff who you know made a lot of important discoveries and found that human cells could do much the same thing that that microorganisms can do so warburg knew a cell could do this but what he didn't know was that a cell would ever do this if oxygen was available it was always thought to be a compensatory thing that uh you move to fermentation if you didn't have enough oxygen or you know if there was you know as warburg thought some damage to the mitochondria where the you know oxygen is used to burn nutrients so the really surprising part of it was not just that a cell was fermenting you know if you do as as you know intense exercise and oxygen you know your lungs are heating and you don't have enough oxygen to sort of keep up with the needs and you know fermentation will you know glycolysis will take place in that setting as well but the surprising thing and what we now call the warburg effect is that the cancer cells had oxygen and they were still turning to fermentation you know what we call aerobic glycolysis so that that was the really surprising part yeah aerobic meaning in the presence of oxygen but still undergoing this inefficient pathway of glycolysis and it's so inefficient in fact that from an energetic standpoint it's hard to understand because the total yield of atp when you take glucose to lactate i believe is four units of atp two going and i could be wrong it could be two whereas in normal um aerobic um metabolism where which would be oxidative phosphorylation you would take glucose which has six carbons you would make two molecules of pyruvate which each have three carbons and that pyruvate would be turned into acetyl coa into and then it would enter the mitochondria and where it would go through all of the steps of the electron transport chain the final emissions would be carbon dioxide and water and that process would yield either 32 or 34 net molecules of atp so the difference is so stark right it's like a 17x difference in energy yield which as you point out the only reason you would ever make that sacrifice in favor of lower energy yield is if you have no choice so if you know if i said hey go for a jog and you know run your your eight minute mile pace that's great you have i'm demanding atp at a slow enough rate and therefore you have enough oxygen that you can do it the efficient way but if we you know make somebody run for their life you know the fastest quarter mile ever all of a sudden the need for atp is so great that it can't be matched by enough oxygen intake so you take this inefficient pathway which unfortunately we can't sustain for as long because with lactate comes hydrogen and hydrogen reduces the ph and that reduction in ph with that hydrogen ion makes it very difficult for the actin and myosin filaments in the muscle to release and that's what people are actually experiencing when they feel that horrible burn that's actually erroneously attributed to lactate it's really the hydrogen ion so yeah it's like we knew about this but i i think this was this was a really interesting discovery and that's why i think the term aerobic uh for fermentation um is a paradox right um yeah i mean the aerobic you know glycolysis or aerobic fermentation you know from warbird's perspective it was a paradox you know and you know as well maybe talk about more not everybody sees it that way but um you know many many scientists um continue to see it that way i think that's the only explanation that you know if you're choosing to you know use glucose in this way to ferment it rather than to do the much more efficient way of breaking it down and getting much more atp then the only way to explain this paradox is that something is broken and why else would a cell do this well and we'll certainly get to that because today i think we have other explanations uh but but going back to warburg how did he then explain the observation so if if if science is a process of making an observation and then coming up with hypothesis what was his hypothesis in light of that observation his hypothesis was that um you know the mitochondria you know he didn't have full understanding of mitochondria at this time but he felt that there had to be some sort of defect in the mitochondria you know the structure that was burning uh nutrients with oxygen because it made no sense otherwise and the only way to really understand it is that you know warburg idolized pasteur and um you know he had his his library set up so that he was gazing at a portrait of pasteur at all times you know one side was robert kaufman on the other side paul ehrlich but pasteur was in the center and um you know it's pasteur who had discovered that um that microbes could ferment that they didn't need oxygen it was this you know shocking thing to him he called you know life without air and um pasteur himself had uh explained it by the fact that uh if they were if cells were you know fermenting and not using oxygen it must be because there's some kind of problem because why wouldn't anybody uh any cell use oxygen if it could um and it's called the pasteur effect the see-saw-like relationship you know respiration with oxygen goes down fermentation goes up so that was how you know and that's what other scientists had found when they were you know studying frogs and you know i mentioned meyerhoff so that's how everybody understood this relationship so that was warburg's lens you know i think a seesaw is a good way to think about it respiration goes down fermentation goes up i in my book i talk about it as a backup generator clicking on um and you know what's interesting about it to me is that you know both pasteur and warburg were sort of aristocratic personalities and i think they really thought of fermentation is lower and less noble than respiration warburg actually literally used those those type of terms when talking about it so for him it was just almost shocking almost unbelievable that a cell could use oxygen and they would do this lowly thing that microorganisms do it's impossible so how did warburg attempt to actually test the hypothesis of the hypothesis if the observation is cancer cells are undergoing aerobic glycolysis to fermentation and the hypothesis is they're doing this because their mitochondria are defective how would he test that hypothesis to increase the confidence that he would have in that hypothesis he didn't he didn't really have a great way to test it um certainly not at the time in the 1920s i mean the tests that he did was just to see the effect over and over but he couldn't prove that it was a problem with defective mitochondria um did he recognize that by the way as a limitation um i don't think he did you know in even most the most surprising part really is that in the early 20s his first test actually showed that respiration was continuing um and then later in his career you know he he does additional experiments and insists that you know respiration is not continuing or if it is it's you know can be explained in various ways that the there's uncoupling which causes the electrons to leak out et cetera so uh but but his early tests showed that um fermentation was increasing while respiration you know continued to to sort of hum along and he just sort of denied that or or you know came up with various explanations for it but um you know it was really in the post-war period where he starts to make more and more extreme statements he uh finds these cancer cells uh in the abdominal fluid um i think they're called ascites um is that correct and you know he sees that in his test of these cells he sees you know very little respiration and just very high fermentation rates so he becomes more and more convinced and he called these pure cancer cells he thought it was the best test of it but he never really had any concrete evidence that there was some sort of structural defect or in the mitochondria he felt it was almost tautological that's you know the job of respiration is to you know to keep fermentation repressed and if that relationship is not working then it's necessarily broken at one point when critics were charging him you know was asking for more proof he said it was a semantic debate it's necessarily true because it's not supposed to work that way which really is ironic right based on his observation there is absolutely no way to know if his observation is the cause or the effect of cancer um so i was struck by i think in his case you could almost use the word the arrogance with which he would treat it as tautological um as opposed to acknowledging that you know hey absent additional tools right laboratory tools it's difficult to know for sure if this is cause or effect which actually brings to uh it brings to the forefront of this discussion this um this overlap with between him and hitler right which is this this view of cause and effect that hitler even writes about right um are you oh i think you're referring to warburg's thinking about causation and and cancer yeah yeah one one of the interesting things that i found is that um you know warburg and hitler you know i hitler was you know as one of history's greatest monsters i'm always hesitant to to compare anybody to him let alone warburg who's somebody i you know admire greatly despite his flaws but um i couldn't help you know because i was writing about both men i couldn't help but see some parallels in their story um you know first and foremost they grew up uh in germany or at the same time you know warbirds born in 1883 hitler in 1889 and um at the time the hero of the day is robert cough the german scientist who makes you know discovers the causal relationship between microorganisms and infectious diseases you know it starts with anthrax then he has his his great breakthrough with tuberculosis so it's hard to you know from our perspective today it's hard to i think appreciate how how much germans revered cuff yeah they were like parades and flags with his face on it uh because he was conquering disease and um so hitler and warburg are both narcissists both want to be the greatest men of their generation and the model for that is robert cook first and foremost uh in their childhood and what's amazing i think is that you know kos is most famous in a way for his postulates which talk about how you can know one thing causes another thing and you know what conditions you have to have to show that a microorganism actually causes the disease which are let's see if we can rattle these off right so one is the healthy individual can never contain the microorganism that is reported to be caught right right i think that another one is the corollary is that the uh anyone with the microorganism must have the disease and then i think any time you take a healthy person and insert the microorganism you must be able to cause the disease is that i think that's the third one what's the fourth it's been heat it's been eaten but that's the gist of the logic it's it's it's very it's a very rigorous logic that again i think we all take for granted today yeah but at the time it was remarkable um and it demonstrated the causal relationship between these various micro organisms and the diseases they caused yeah and a key breakthrough if i'm remembering correctly is that you know they had already known that you could you know take blood or whatnot from one organism to another and transfer the disease but kof understood that he first had to get the microbe and grow it outside the body so you know he wasn't transferring anything else you know he had to prove that it was it was the microbe itself by growing independently and then taking some of those microbes and injecting them um but in any case you if you listen to um hitler's speeches you know some of his speeches in the 40s and read some of warburg's papers they actually you know it's almost like they're quoting robert cough uh you can hear the same phrases and talking about causality and um one of the most chilling things that i that i you know they both refer to cult directly but you know the most chilling thing i found i think is that um hitler you know multiple occasions referred to himself as the robert of politics and he said that you know had um saved the world through science by eliminating the microbes the microorganisms that cause disease and i've done the same thing with the jew uh so he saw his effort in some ways as a scientific project and you know that killing jews in his you know twisted mind was was like eliminating microbes um you know of course it wasn't just warburg and hitler but i i was just struck that they were both using this language of causality and so how did um warburg described that in terms of primary and secondary causality of cancer how how did he really start to sharpen uh his thinking on that so warburg says that um you know every disease has a prime cause and a secondary cause and he uses the analogy of robert cuff that the prime cause of the disease is the microbe and then there are all these secondary causes the unsanitary conditions that cause the microbe you know to get onto a person and make them sick um you know various plagues and and anything that you know causes a microbe to to transfer and get into someone's blood is a secondary cause and the microbe itself is the primary cause so warwick tries to extend this to cancer he says the most fundamental thing about cancer is the shift to fermentation um and so that is the primary cause he although there was never proof for this he insisted that it existed in 100 of all cancers i think today people say you know 70 percent or more but not 100 but warburg thought it was 100 of all cancers i should modify that by saying probably all cancers at some point start to ferment it as they have reduced access to oxygen if they become advanced cancers but um at the most fundamental level i don't think you can say a hundred percent but uh warburg said it was 100 of all cancers ferment this is the primary cause and anything that causes the fermentation can be thought of as a secondary cause so you might have you know a dangerous chemical and that injures the mitochondria and therefore you have fermentation so that's the secondary cause is the chemical or you know anything you can think of a virus that causes cancer would damage the mitochondria it's always viewed through the lens of causing a structural problem which causes respiration and to be damaged and fermentation to increase in a see-saw-like relationship what did warburg believe um accounted for the um significant increase in the prevalence of cancer leading up into the 1920s and 1930s as a secondary cause by his definition at the time he doesn't in the 20s and 30s he doesn't say much about it but um you know i think it's clear looking back that he was from from an early time very worried about environmental carcinogens but in the post-war period uh he becomes very outspoken about environmental carcinogens and i think his influence is much wider than many people realize uh you know in germany he starts campaigning against smog from automobiles and buses and food dyes you know used in the german food supply and all sorts of chemicals he becomes basically an organic farmer you know one of the first organic farmers i've heard about he has his own garden and he has his partner jacob heiss is the only person who's allowed to cook for him and he even has a well where he gets his own water so his hypothesis was that the chemicals in our food first and foremost were poisoning ourselves poisoning the mitochondria and causing the shift to uh fermentation but what's what's really interesting i think is that um if you read rachel carson silent spring which is you know hugely influential book and really changed american environmental policy um warburg is actually the first cancer scientist mentioned in the book and it's clear that um that's exactly how how she viewed uh you know cancer and and so all these environmental chemicals uh is causing cancer via you know the damage to respiration that warper excited so you know i think he ended up having a massive influence on american life just nobody knows about it he was awarded the nobel prize in 1931. what was the what was the seminal work for which he was awarded sure um yeah a lot of people think that he got the award for cancer but that's not true he he was nominated in 1926 and should have won for his cancer research but uh and it was apparently a tie and they gave it to the other guy and no one really knows why orber didn't get it in 26 but in 1931 he gets it really for figuring out the the final step he believes it's the only step at the time but really the final step of a respiration understanding how the electron passes down the electron transport chain and you know is able to react with oxygen um so he sort of elucidates this process and wins the nobel prize for that so what happens during world war ii um as you point out obviously he's jewish he's gay um i'm guessing that both of those things make him an enormous target for nazis um why does he stay in germany yeah it's one of the most fascinating parts of his story you know 1933 comes along and only two years earlier uh the rockefeller foundation has built this beautiful institute for him he has designed the institute himself after a country manner that he admires and he's on top of the scientific world he's just won the nobel prize and all his colleagues start to you know flee his jewish colleagues they see what's coming and and warburg refuses to see it you know he's not going to give up his kingdom uh in dalham in southwestern berlin he says i was here before hitler and like a lot of germans he he believed that the nazi phenomenon would be short-lived his cousin max warburg had said you know we just need to give hitler enough rope to hang himself so warwick had said you know maybe six months a year he thought they'd be gone but i think that part of it was he was so arrogant and so narcissistic that he couldn't fathom you know anybody telling him what to do let alone you know he called him bavarian noisemakers these nazi thugs were going to get kicked him out of his institute no way i mean that that was his perspective and i think the most shocking thing about his story is you know he has a famous jewish name his father is jewish so he's jewish by the nazi standards he lives with his male partner he should have been as vulnerable as anybody in nazi germany and yet he not only you know stays but he provokes the nazis uh you know he screams at them when they come to his institute demanding aryan descent forms at one point he says he'll burn down his institute if they come again he won't do the hitler salute he won't put up the nazi flag so you know he he really was in a very dangerous situation 1936 you know the new york times ran an article saying warburg uh maybe in jeopardy uh you know he was famous enough at the time that um they were writing about him in the times and you know he was also tremendously stubborn you know he said to his sister at one point that you know it's going to be either near them i'm not budging and his sister's understanding of it was that you know the more the more pressure he got the more he insisted on staying because he couldn't you know stand to think that that he would lose that battle and it's very hard to understand this when we look back we see these jewish scientists fleeing and we think oh you know what wise moral people they saw what was coming and they left they didn't want to be a part of it but at the time it was really considered a shameful thing that to leave was to accept that you were somehow a lesser german and warburg you know that was the antithesis of everything warburg stood for you know to to do anything that would cause him shame would be unimaginable so there was really no way he was leaving um he did think about it but i think he correctly understood that he would never be the same if he left did he journal i mean how what what what what type of sources were you able to if any um get into his head during that period of time um it was honestly one of my most important find i didn't find it myself but um it was it already existed in german but hit one of his sisters lotta kept a diary and she was a writer and um she wrote a great deal about him and recorded their conversations so that ended up being really my key source for a lot of this uh warburg didn't keep a diary but because he was famous and he wrote a lot of letters i had a lot of letters that he wrote and whenever somebody encountered him they would often write down their impressions because he was such a character and and he was already world famous but at the very end of the war he actually did scribble out some notes a few years ago a historian karen nicholson in germany actually discovered in the back of his notebooks uh these notes which were really fascinating uh he was feeling you know we haven't really talked about that part of the story but he was dealing with some guilt that that he faced by not protecting certain people who worked for him from being forced into the military so he he started to scribble out these defenses and just you know it's only a few sentences here and there but it gives you a window into how persecuted he felt at the end and how guilty in some ways i think he felt as well how many people did he know that died in concentration camps fewer than you would think um partially because you know most of the jewish people that he associated with left in the kaiser wilhelm society i think there were like you know 2500 jews at various institutions and warburg was the only one who stayed until the very end so um most of them left and you know what a lot of people don't realize you know that german jews in many cases were more likely to survive the holocaust than other european jews uh so he didn't uh some of his warburg cousins actually were murdered in the camps he wasn't particularly close with them but he didn't he didn't lose a lot of people who were close to him but he certainly you know he certainly knew people you know i i don't have a good answer to that question but it would be impossible for him to have not known a lot of people who died but i don't know that they were the people who were closest to him you certainly knew hundreds or thousands of people who fled for their lives you know in countries like poland there was clearly a moment in time when you could no longer leave um was that true in germany as well was there basically a time beyond which if you if you had not left you were not going to leave yeah i mean certainly for warburg there was because he was famous and the nazis saw sort of propaganda value and having him there uh for others you know it really changed a lot um after the you know the war started and that was you know by that point if you hadn't left uh you know you were in great danger if you were jewish or homosexual or you know various other persecuted categories in nazi germany um so but in the early 30s you had an opportunity to leave germany at least but um you know they also had to it was extraordinarily difficult because you they would take all your wealth you basically had to give up everything and leave with nothing and find a new career and you know this is in germany the other countries didn't have the advanced warning and the the jews of eastern europe were much less wealthy you know these are in many cases more you know people who lived in much uh sort of less wealth than than the german jews and never really had a real opportunity to escape when the when the germans rolled in so it was very different for eastern europe players where the holocaust really begins so what do you attribute the fact that he survived the war to is it simply that the germans benefited more by him staying there and being alive as a showcase of their scientific prowess or do you think there was an explicit directive from hitler or someone else saying you know despite the fact that you know he's everything we despise there's value in the work he'll do yeah so you know by the mid-30s you know it's clear that he serves propaganda value for them you have the berlin olympics in 1936 they're able to show that you know this guy who you know has jewish descent um jewish ancestors is still here working in germany but um by the late 30s you know that propaganda value sort of drifts away and certainly is useless once the war starts uh so he's he's in increasingly sort of grave danger as things progress throughout the late 30s meyerhoff a lot of people stayed until 1938 meyerhoff is also a nobel prize winner escapes in 1938 and flees to france and um you know from that point on you know that's when germans roll into austria and all the the austrian jews who can escape escape in 38 um but the fascinating thing really it comes to a head in 1941 where you know by that point you know the war is in full swing and um you know there's no value to keeping warburg alive really you know for propaganda means at that point uh so warburg is called to nazi headquarters in uh 1941 june 21st and he meets with victor brock who is one of the worst nazis a guy who designs the euthanasia killing program that sort of starts the mass killing and it looks like it's going to be the end for him he's already received an eviction notice from his institute he has a lot of enemies in german science i mean you have to keep in mind he had a lot of enemies in german science before all this started so you can imagine that uh how many people hated him and wanted to get rid of them you know all the other institutes were full of nazis his was the only one that wasn't so you know they finally succeed in you know getting rid of him and he's called to nazi headquarters and um you know he sits down with victor brock and he's told that he's actually going to be allowed to live on one condition that he focused on cancer research and um it you know it's extraordinary in itself but the part that surprised me most um you know and other german historians had recorded this meeting on june 21st 1941 but what i realized nobody had yet realized that this was an extremely important moment in german history uh the very at dawn the next morning the german tanks rolled into soviet territory was the launch of operation barbarossa which is you know the biggest at the time the biggest military invasion in history it was you know the most significant moment in the nazi project in a lot of ways and and that very day they're sitting around you know worrying about warburg and it wasn't just victor barack you see in himmler's daily planner that he has a meeting about warburg that day and then later that night uh gilbert's kept a diary and uh he records in his diary that later that night just hours before operation barbarossa he and hitler are talking about cancer research the diary that diary doesn't say warburg's name but given that everything else that went on that day and that warburg was in the building it certainly seems you know that hitler knew what was going on and warburg there's more evidence of hitler's direct involvement because warburg has applied for uh something that they call the german blood certificate this just shows you what a you know twisted horrific world that was at the time that you know for judah survive in nazi germany at that point if if you had managed to stick around that long you could apply to have yourself upgraded to be more aryan so warburg goes through this application process at this point i think it's defensible because you know it's really to save his life in a way but hitler would actually review these applications himself and certainly for a nobel prize winner hitler would have reviewed this application uh so you know as you had to talk about all your ancestors and submit photos you know just sick stuff where you know the kittler wouldn't you know look at the noses of the people and decide if you would upgrade them or not so that they they never actually formally arionized warburg but uh it's clear that hitler would have been involved in that review and that probably decided on that day june 21st 1941 to let him continue to focus on cancer was hitler personally obsessed or touched by cancer what what was this um i mean or was it simply just the epidemiology of the time yeah he um you know was very personally touched by it um when he was a teenager uh he lost his mother to breast cancer and uh his mother was really the you know historian say the only person he was capable of loving and uh he had already just sort of failed to get into art school and was depressed he comes back to austria uh or comes back to his hometown in austria and um sees his mother dying of breast cancer and um it's just distraught it's actually a jewish doctor who's caring for his mother and he left a little you know reflection on the experience he said in his entire life he's never seen anybody look as dejected as hitler uh and you know hitler sort of okayed these experimental treatments on his mother which left her writhing in pain and he was there at the bedside and for the rest of his life he was obsessed with cancer and talked about it constantly in a speech as a metaphor but was also a hypochondriac who constantly had stomach problems and thought it was stomach cancer and you know it became a huge part of the nazi project is trying to eliminate cancer and um you know one of the very uncomfortable things about this is that you know as monstrous as the nazis were in every way they actually did make some some advances in cancer prevention you know for all the wrong reasons but um you know they they inherited you know a great scientific establishment and it makes sense that they they would actually make some progress on cancer it's very interesting to imagine a world without the nazis given the prominence of german science uh into into going into you know the second world war and how much of a balance in in um how much of a shift in power that was scientifically post-world war ii right how effectively that was the change from germany being the epicenter of science not just biological sciences but but physics and then that that shifting in fact so many of the journals right shifted from being published in german to being published in english post world war ii yeah i mean early 20th century you had to speak german to be a scientist or be able to read german yeah it's incredible how the extent to which you know all the early nobel prize winners were germans not all but you know shocking percentage it's rumored i don't i've never actually been able to confirm if this is true or not because i've read various accounts um that that warburg could have won a second nobel prize during the the second world war um what what was your finding on that yeah i i think that he you know certainly deserved a nobel prize for his cancer work which he didn't get in 1926. i don't think there's there's really proof of the the you know warburg said that he didn't get the nobel prize in the 40s because the nazis wouldn't allow it um he certainly would have was considered for it i found evidence he was considered for it but i didn't find any evidence that they were going to sort of give them the award but couldn't because of the nazi and what work was that in the 40s that um that they would have been potentially considering him for yeah warburg you know his nobel prize as we talked about before was um you know for the understanding the last stage of respiration this you know enzyme let me now call cytochrome oxidase uh but um you know the whole time he had been saying in the 20s that this is the only thing you need to know for respiration it's kind of analogous to what he said about cancer but then he he finally accepted that no respiration is actually a multi-stage process and you actually need you know not just to react directly with oxygen but to rip hydrogen off these nutrients and to pass the electrons down the transport chain so he became interested in these hydrogen transfers and understanding you know how the reaction took place and he actually you know a lot of people think this is the best science he ever did uh he actually made huge advances in understanding the role of of coenzymes and how they react with hydrogen and allow for these transfers um you know it was really innovative work uh really kind of set the stage for decades of enzyme research um so yeah and you know that that led to the discovery of the components of nad among other things so he did deserve a nobel prize for that but i don't i didn't find any evidence uh that they were going to give it to him but i think he fairly deserved three nobel prizes what um say a little bit more about his work on nad that was actually new to me i until recently was not aware of his contributions there it's not surprising i suppose when you consider his involvement with the electron transport chain and as you point out the electron transport chain transports its electrons using hydrogen back and forth transporting between nad and nadh um but um it's actually kind of an interesting story right about how he uh made these discoveries yeah so warburg uh is trying to do a chemical analysis to figure out the reactive component of what we now call nad uh he called the in-between ferment uh and he can isolate very small amount but he can't get enough of it to really understand and do the chemical analysis of what it is and he's using horse blood um to to study it he says at one point to figure this out i'm going to need to kill all the horses in germany and and he was a great lover of horses so that was not a good option for warburg uh but he knows he has enough of the stuff to figure out the molecular weight and a few basic facts about it so um he has a friend who works in the chemistry industry and uh in the chemical industry and you know it's just a big part of german industry and he asked him to look it up see if he can find anything similar and you know based on what he looks up he finds an exact match which is uh nicotinic acid and um you know so warburg is the one that figures out that you know this key component that makes this reaction possible is actually a chemical that you know that everybody knew about that was being used in photography for decades um you know where rick said you know a day ago i couldn't buy it for all the money in the world and now you know i can get it for two marks um and it actually you know turned out to be hugely important um not only for understanding respiration but uh for understanding uh the disease pellagra uh which um you know was only sort of solved after warburn made that discovery and someone thought you know let's give this chemical to people who suffer from this disease and see if it cures them and sure enough it did and it's one of the ironies of warburg's story that um he always wanted to make a great discovery and save lives and he actually did but he never even really recognized it or saw it that way so he stays in germany after the war ends he could obviously at this point have gone anywhere he could have come to the united states which is what many of his peers had done before the war um what was his reason for staying in terms of staying at in in the years after the war correct yeah yeah i i think that um you know for a few years after the war i think he was prepared to go elsewhere i mean i found letters of him you know searching for places and he comes to america in the late 40s and you know he stays in one lab for six months in another lab for six months but um it's clear that um you know there's no future for him in america that you know a lot of the rockefellers no longer want anything to do with them because you know it looks suspicious that that he had stayed you know the truth is he despised the nazis as much as anyone but you know anybody who stayed when they could have left is under suspicion and you know he's making more and more extreme statements about cancer so he's alienating a lot of people and meanwhile in 1950 the americans gave him back his institute they had taken it over when they had their military uh occupation of of berlin so he gets to go back to his beautiful institute and he has again some proper propaganda value for the germans you can say look we've given this person of jewish descent his institute back and he's living here and thriving in germany so i think you know if he had gotten the right offer i think he would have gone to america but he ended up sort of returning and reestablishing his old life in a lot of ways and in some ways it's shocking and upsetting but you know by 1955 you know from from his perspective it was like nothing had happened you know he's continuing with all the same stuff now forgive my ignorance um how is it that um was it a is it was it an easy choice for him to end up in west berlin as opposed to east berlin following the war and what determined that was it simply a function of where he was prior to the war and therefore it was somewhat fortuitous yeah it um it is actually interesting and a little bit complicated his institute ended up in the american sector but um another extraordinary thing about his story is in in you know 1943 bombs are falling near his institute and he's actually moved to a new institute and the nazis built him you know sort of they sort of refurbished this beautiful sea house for warburg in the middle of the worst part of the war for them when you know there's no gasoline for anything it's forbidden to build anything if it's not for the war effort and they take time out to build you know sign for warburg to continue his cancer research in a safer place but um and that that institute was actually and ended up in soviet territory uh so he was sort of caught between these two different worlds and uh he had a vacation house which is in soviet territory so when the war ends he is actually uh under soviet rule and uh he has to escape back to the west um but the the soviets were trying to recruit him much more so than americans interestingly you know both a lot of the great german scientists and you know unfortunately a lot of nazis ended up you know being smuggled into america uh you know for the purpose of american science but the uh the germans i mean the soviets were going after them as well so um he is sort of caught between these different worlds uh but ends up you know because his institute is in west berlin uh is able to uh stay in the the american side ultimately so interesting to me because you you have to wonder if people in berlin at that time understood how stark that contrast would be you know you you could argue that well gosh it's just it's wonderful that the war is over and the nazis are gone and you know you might end up on this american side or you know what the time was american occupied or you might end up on this what will be a soviet side but it it probably couldn't have been clear just how different those two would end up being over the coming you know four or five decades yeah i i don't think it was clear but it was clear that the soviets you know with good reason were much more feared so you know in the last days of the war in 1945 you had a lot of people fleeing westward not so much because they could imagine what the cold war was like for decades but because they were worried about being you know murdered and raped you know because the soviets were you know with with good reason you know furious at the germans and out for revenge and they certainly took that revenge so it was understood that you had a better chance of surviving if you made it westward but i don't think anybody could have foreseen what happened in in the following decades um warburg has a really interesting tit for tat with um with with sydney winehouse in in science uh about a decade later i actually was able to pull up the article and and and read it they both wrote uh letters um and and winehouse was really kind of a mild-mannered guy wasn't he yeah he was you know most of the people in warburg had these you know vicious you know scientific feuds with i would look them up and they seem you know much more reasonable and calm than uh than warburg himself uh wine house i'm in the philadelphia suburbs he actually worked at a hospital just yeah he died in what the early 90s i think and he was at he was at penn wasn't he or no he was a jefferson if i recall he may have been i think he was at lancana hospital but maybe maybe at jefferson as well i'm not sure but he was around here i actually found some people that knew him and talked them a little bit um but he but he publicly called warburg out he basically said don't agree with this observation um i mean agree with the observation don't agree with the interpretation is what he said yeah i think if you look at the quotes from him he was relatively calm about it but uh you know as a journalist i have to laugh yeah i'm sure it was the headline writer you know the headline under one of the articles was cancer theory overthrown you know i don't think that uh winehouse would have put it that way but um you know some editor like me just wanted to you know make it a little more sensational so well and he was deferential to warburg in the article i mean he did say something to the effect of um i don't remember exactly but yeah the gist of it was and we owe a great debt to to warburg for his amazing contributions to the field etc etc um but you know cellular respiration is basically there he said look there's no difference in oxygen consumption between these cells and there's no evidence that the mitochondria are damaged uh warburg's rebuttal was far less uh kind uh again yeah he was yeah you might be thinking of the the papers in science in 1956 yes exactly yeah they had a back and forth i believe it's august 1956 uh where first you know warburg writes a piece in early 56 and then winehouse responds in warburg that's right responds to his response and yeah warburg you know comes off i mean it's a really elegant paper that he writes he was a great writer again we should have talked about warburg's writing at the beginning because yeah i really admire his writing and but um you know he makes much bolder statements and denounces his opponents in a way that the winehouse doesn't winehouse as a more humble scientist um but um that is yeah i encourage all listeners to look up warburg's paper from 56 that's pretty really i'll link to it in the show notes for sure i love reading that stuff i mean i just absolutely fancy reading that stuff which actually uh an example of one of my favorite scientific papers to read is the next logical place to go in this story which is the uh the paper by watson and crick describing the helical structure of dna um so that's relevant to the story for reasons you will tell us but it's also a funny paper in that the i think it's the last line either in the abstract or the paper um makes some very very very understated remark that this this thing what they're referring to is dna you know may prove to be of interest at some point or something to the effect um i used to be able to quote it verbatim um but uh what is it about the discovery of of dna that um would ultimately put a uh changed the course of warburg's discovery and um and this entire field of cancer metabolism for decades to come yeah so you know by the 50s and 60s warburg is already fading away for some of the reasons we've talked about you know winehouse challenges his belief that you know cancer cells have defective mitochondria he sees respirations running fine so there's more skepticism of warburg and people suspect him because of the nazi years but i think the single biggest factor was sort of the changing wind in science and you know more than anything you know the discovery of oncogenes genes beginning really in you know the mid 1970s when they're first able to identify specific genes that in their mutated activated form cause cancer so this unleashes the whole new world of molecular biology and warburg's study of enzymes and cancer metabolism starts to seem like you know old world biochemistry stuff and you know if you want to really understand cancer you got to look at the dna and the signal transduction pathways and all the new molecular biology and you know there's literally stories of like you know people seeing manometers thrown in the trash you know warburg's signature tool and it's just amazing to me how quickly warburg gets relegated to the old world and you know nobody's interested in um you know by you know by the 90s you know students don't know his name and then and by the way he died in what 1970 1970 but you know there's all these remarkable examples uh in the year 2000 uh robert weinberg um co-authors you know the the hallmarks of cancer paper which sort of you know i'm sure you know better than i do the the six uh you know fundamental traits of cancer doesn't include the warburg effect or mention warburg uh or metabolism you later you know they later do a revised edition and do mention it 10 years later i believe um so warburg is is just gone from cancer science gone from textbooks you know weinberg's famous textbook in 2006 doesn't mention him uh you know mukherjee who you know i think his book is absolutely brilliant but also doesn't mention warbrick just because nobody was mentioning you know it's just not something that people were interested in they talked you know the enzymes that were say were referred to as housekeeping enzymes you know seems you know cancer needs to divide and therefore it needs energy it needs nutrients but it's sort of you know just um not fundamental to the process just something that's needed to to supply cancer as it progresses uh and it's really it's really shocking to me that something so fundamental could just get lost but i think you know to some extent that's how science works you know there's an exciting new thing and it's it's hard to focus on two things at once and and look i mean i think it is a very um remarkable discovery in the 1970s that there are oncogenes um and then harold varmus and michael bishop awarded the nobel prize in 1989 for that discovery um it holds a lot of great promise certainly by the time i got to medical school in the late 90s that was i mean my god if i could go back and figure out how many oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes i had memorized and all the pathways and such i mean that was really what that that's the only thing that mattered in cancer biology um so what what do you think led to the renaissance i mean for me personally um the first thing that came on the radar screen was a science paper in 2009 written by um matthew vanderheiden um and co-authored by lou cantley and craig thompson um was that sort of the first uh thing that showed up on the radar i mean obviously those three had been doing a lot of work leading up to that i've had lou on the podcast and we've talked at great length about his work in the discovery of pi3 kinase so clearly this um this idea that metabolism mattered um was was was on the radar of others even though it was not necessarily on the forefront of the field i think that that paper was you know the moment it was 2009 or 2010 that um it sort of reached the mainstream uh but you know as you mentioned they had been working on this stuff uh for some time so it was really in in the late 90s uh that uh the revival starts mid to late 90s uh in the the two key labs i think at the early stages um one is craig thompson who you mentioned who is now uh the presidency of memorial sloan kettering and the other lab was chivan deng who was at the time at johns hopkins and they both you know were sort of you know working on uh you know understanding cancer molecular biology and both sort of tracing you know these signal signaling pathways to the cell and sort of working their way back to metabolic enzymes uh in cheese case uh he found that the transcription factor mick uh was actually activating uh like lactose dehydration ldh and you know he was really quite quite shocked to find that you know this pathway leading back to this basic fermentation reaction so he became very curious about warburg and reading the old papers on enzymes and um really helped launch a lot of the uh metabolism revival and then craig thompson and van der heyden was a student in his lab uh they had also sort of independently uh rediscovered metabolism and ended up focusing on on akt which is um it was already known as a an oncogene that caused cells to proliferate so the surprising part of their work wasn't that they found an oncogene but that this oncogene was actually a metabolism that what its role was basically to you know allow glucose into the cell and that you know thompson i think correctly states that this is the most fundamental thing that it does and that uh the proliferation you know is is downstream of this glucose uptake yeah it's uh it's a very pro-growth um uh factor so um what i think is most interesting about the 2009 paper in science is that it acknowledges the warburg effect but comes up with a different explanation right and what was that explanation so you know prior to this point you know the accepted view or that warburg's view which you know again some some people still support is that um all fermentation is a response to defective mitochondria it's compensatory the cell can't create energy in one way so it's using the backup generator it's it's revving up fermentation but um you know what uh thompson and van der height and kently argue in that paper is that um you know we actually don't have you know as we talked about wine house we don't actually have the evidence that that respiration is completely defective so the mitochondria still seem to be functional and intact and uh there are other reasons that a cell might need to take up a lot of glucose and you know first and foremost they're bioenergetic they need the building blocks to create uh you know new nucleotides and lipids for for the daughter cells um so it makes sense that um you know glucose uptake would increase rapidly but the cells they actually you know they're getting some energy some atp from respiration some from fermentation but they have enough to continue to function what they really need are the building blocks for growth and so that is a sort of new way to understand the warburg effect and uh i think that you know that's now what most most scientists but not all sort of view is the main explanation what's your view um you know it's it's tough as a uh as a science writer uh at a reporter you know i i'm not trained as a scientist and i interview one person you know famously thomas sieffried who is very much a warburgian who thinks that warburg got it exactly right and that it is a problem of defective mitochondria and he cites the research of uh i believe uh peterson at johns hopkins who also believes this so there are a lot of very smart accomplished scientists who think orbit got it exactly right and you know it would have been easier for me to writing this book to conclude that warburg was right about everything yeah that's the story that would have been easier to tell and made my narrative tighter but um you know i interviewed many more people who who felt that warburg was wrong about this that um it was not ultimately a problem of defective mitochondria and uh you know i look at papers from both sides and don't ultimately feel that uh you know i have a good way of resolving this debate but um ultimately i i sided much more so with um kent lee and and thompson and vanderheiden and others like nav chandelle who who also takes this position um and you know it's it's partially just a numbers thing like many more people believe this and their evidence is compelling and i can see that they're brilliant and it's partially also sort of an intuitive feel for the science and uh i say that because you know one of one of the things that really struck me is when craig thompson was uh giving a demonstration for for students about uh what cancer is he puts up this slide i don't know if you've ever seen this talk and he shows a mold growing on a piece of bread and he said everybody's first cancer experiment and then it shows the mold growing and you know it really goes back to pasteur and in understanding proliferative metabolism is not something that happens in microorganisms only in response to defective respiration that's what pasteur thought but he was wrong you know proliferative metabolism happens when a cell can get all the nutrients at once you know you put i mean when i say so i mean the microorganisms you know you put the yeast on grain and they don't care how much oxygen is available they take up the grain and they grow and they grow and they multiply and and that i think is a fundamental program that ourselves know how to do as well and i think that's really the key to the story is what causes you know this proliferative program to you know to take off and i think it's you know in single-celled organisms it's the nutrients and i think in uh you know when you look at advanced organisms of animals we have to think not just about the nutrients but the hormonal involvement as well it's much more complicated but the fundamental you know program is running and uh it's it's the nutrients and the growth factors i mean i think if you just step back from it and you say you know what is cancer it's a problem of growth okay well what causes things to grow you know nutrients and and hormones that's where you start the conversation and i think that if science had progressed in a different way then that always would have been the focus but you know it was only in you know the late 1960s where we could even measure insulin in the blood you know so cancer all this stuff about the warburg effect as a response to you know damage respiration made sense before we knew anything about you know insulin and growth factors but you know the science has progressed and and i i tend to to view it in much more of the way of of thompson and cantley but i do think that seafree deserves a ton of credit for sort of bringing metabolism back into the conversation and it is as i said before you know i think everybody agrees that as as a cancer progresses you know the blood vessels no longer getting oxygen in the same way and that's that's clearly playing a role in terms of revving up fermentation uh so it's not necessarily either or but at the at the sort of core origin of cancer i don't see that the respiration damage is being sort of conclusive yeah and i don't either i mean i just think on first principles it doesn't actually make sense right so if if you if you follow the logic of warburg um if the primary insult or the prime cause to use his language is damage to the mitochondria that's an insult to a cell that's a deficit to a cell that's an inhibition of a cell's ability to respire and frankly acquire energy so the fact that the cell has the ability to do something outside of the mitochondria in a compensatory fashion is great but in and of itself that doesn't explain why it would take up more nutrient it simply explains why it would metabolize nutrient in a different way and to for me at least to focus just on the availability of nutrients and hormones doesn't explain to me why if we're let's just talk about colon cancer right or pancreatic cancer you pick your you pick your cancer you have a normal cell and you have an abnormal cell the normal cell presumably then is the one that is not going to become cancer the abnormal cell is the one that is going to seed the cancer they're both exposed to the same amount of nutrient they're both exposed to the same hormonal milieu so why is only one of them going down that cancerous pathway why is one turning into a polyp and why is only that polyp becoming dysplastic and ultimately you know or metal metaplastic and ultimately dysplastic and ultimately becoming metastatic um it i i think that the the the hormones in the nutrients are simply the fuel that allow the thing to happen but they're not the spark you know and to me the spark is what matters um and and that's why i i i don't agree that warburg was correct i don't agree that that the initial insult is the mitochondrial insult um i i think that the i think that the event that is driving this i think that the the i think the oncogenic effect is the is the driver and i think the metabolism allows the cancer to be even more adaptable to the scenarios that you describe um and i've spent perhaps not as long as you but i've certainly spent a lot of time talking with people on both sides of this going to conferences um but in the end it somewhat matters because it it it comes down to what's the implication of this from a treatment and prevention standpoint and i would say in the opposite order right what's the implication of this from a prevention standpoint what's the implication of this from a treatment standpoint and that's what i think about because in the end that's the part that i think is a kind of a bedside doctor that's the part you have control over is what can you do to prevent cancer or reduce the probability of cancer i don't think one can truly ever prevent it and then in the presence of it what can you do so how did this work impact your thinking on that question um sure yeah in my mind you know that that's really the key to my my whole story is you know there's sort of two components to it one is what's going on inside the cancer cell and you know that's all this discussion we've had about the warburg effect but there's another part to the story which is you know 150 years 200 years of cancer epidemiology and seeing you know various environmental causes of cancer or various various theories about what causes cancer and what really struck me in it i don't think you know as a journalist i can't understand the science sometimes in the same way that probably you can and a lot of the people i interview can but what i try to do is connect dots you know that's one thing i can do as a journalist is look at one scientific field in another scientific field that aren't necessarily talking to each other and try to put stories together and the thing that that really struck me uh was that in the late 90s at the very same time that uh you know thompson's lab and chivan things lab by returning to warburg metabolism we have these new epidemiology papers coming out showing both that insulin as coral you know elevated insulin hyperinsulinemia is correlated with cancer and obesity is correlated with cancer so it happens at the same moment and that in a lot of ways that was my project uh for the end of the book is trying to understand you know is the obesity story related to the overeating of glucose in the cancer cell um and i think those two stories are related and that's why you know the last part of my book is really a focus on hyperinsulinemia because i think it's the piece that puts it all together it could explain the obesity it could explain uh the cancer and it could explain why cancer was once a rare disease and then in step with diabetes and obesity and other you know quote unquote diseases of civilization became much more common so in in my book insulin is sort of the explanation which ties it all together which obviously not all cancers are caused by insulin and you know insulin's role according to some scientists is only indirect it causes the obesity and the obesity causes other hormonal changes in inflammation but but one way or another i think it's a big part of the cancer story and the part that you know if we're going to really make progress on prevention we have to focus i think on hyperinsulinemia uh to me you know this is now exactly 50 years since the war on cancer begun and we've made so little progress in in many ways and certainly with respect to prevention and there's been remarkable cures and therapies and um you know i revere the scientists who make this work but certainly in terms of prevention you know we're just not making progress and i think it probably comes back to the hyperinsulinemia and again i do kind of like the way warburg positioned a prime cause and secondary causes so um when you think of the ravenous diarrhea that was ripping through london in the 1800s the prime cause was cholera but the secondary cause was the lack of sanitation right it was the it was that which permitted the cholera to um travel so freely from sewage to drinking water um so now let's think about cancer through the lens of the two most readily identified epidemiologic factors on scale not necessarily with the clarity of evidence but just in terms of breadth of numbers impacted first and foremost is smoking and second as you point out is obesity at least in the developed world so with smoking would we put it in the prime or secondary cause i think we'd put it in the prime cause right i think we would argue that the evidence for the causal relationship between cigarette smoking and cancer is likely related to the carcinogenic effect of the tobacco on presumably the dna structure of the cells that leads to mutations that drive unresponsive or unregulated growth would you agree with that yeah i mean it does come down to you know semantics at some level you could argue that the prime cause is the mutation you know in the dna that that's caused that's driving the cancer uh or you could say that cigarette smoke is the prime cause i personally find it more sort of logically compelling to talk about the prime cause is the very first thing in the step and the very first step in the process so i i think you can say cigarette smoking is the prime cause but uh by warburg's definition he would say that if you accept that paradigm then you would say the mutation is the prime cause the you know chromosomal damage whatever it is um you know another way to think about this is that the accepted paradigm is that all the problems you know one way or another go through the dna and that the safe read and paradigm is that all the problems go through the mitochondria so those are the you know the two sort of causal centers but i think logically prime cause should be the very first thing so smoking in the case of cancer makes sense to me yeah no i think that i agree with you i think that makes sense so now the question is how do we apply that that thinking to the second one so if we pause it that indeed obesity plays a causal role in cancer there's no dispute that the correlation is quite strong that i i mean i you you don't need to be an epidemiologist to understand that the question is is that correlation causative now with tobacco the correlation is so strong that it's very hard to find somebody who doesn't appreciate that there's a causal relationship there i did see somebody on twitter the other day try to argue that tobacco has no relationship to cancer but let's put that guy aside for a moment um with obesity it's a little harder because the hazard ratio isn't nearly as large as it is with tobacco and obesity is is actually harder to disentangle from its other multivariate parameters it comes with so much else so the person who is obese eats a different way sleeps a different way exercises a different way the list goes on and on and on of other things that could that could potentially play a role but again for the purpose of the discussion if we posit that obesity is causally related to cancer then the next step is is it one of the growth factors associated with obesity of which insulin is one is it other changes that are prominent with obesity such as inflammation um how do you then arrive at you know for example insulin being [Music] the you know the prime candidate to use the word prime again within the obesity paradigm that's driving this and that says nothing by the way of where we're going to then have to go which is is it the enabler or is it the primary cause i mean my argument is that um you know ultimately you know as you said these are very complicated you know there's there's many different factors that play out but but my ultimate argument is that the obesity is not causal that it's actually the hyperinsulinemia that is simultaneously driving the obesity and the cancer cell proliferation uh so i think part of the evidence for that is that um you know there are people who are quote-unquote metabolically healthy obese that um you know they store more nutrients in their their subcutaneous fat and more energy and their subcutaneous fat and not the visceral fat and they tend to be metabolic metabolically healthy and do not have insulin resistance and they seem to be no more likely to get cancer whereas when you look at the insulin resistance and people who are thinner but clearly you know i think it's most people actually do have insulin resistance and when you see that metabolic disruption people who aren't obese they that also tends to correlate with cancer so i think you can to some extent dissociate the obesity uh but then you still have to you know the insulin cancer correlation isn't as strong as smoking either so you know you still have a lot to work with and then you know there's the question that you brought up is i i think this is what you're referring to is the insulin actually you know the first prime step in the process the hyperinsulinemia or is it you know a mutation that occurs for some other reason and allows the cancer cell to to take advantage of that hyperinsulinemia so yeah is the model basically that if you take um you know a two by two matrix where you have chromosomal insult yes or no hyperinsulinemia yes no so which one gets cancer is it only the double positive right i mean we would agree that the double negative almost assuredly does not but yeah and we would probably agree that the double positive does the question is what's happening in the other corners right what's happening in the individual who has the chromosomal insult in the absence of hyperinsulinemia and what's happening to the person without the chromosomal insult who is hyperinsulinemic to me those are the questions that matter a lot and they matter a lot for the sake of prevention now the the the the obviously um and this is the approach that i take clinically right which is um let's be overly aggressive and assume that both of those are sufficient then you would say well you have to put yourself in the double negative box which is avoid hyperinsulinemia and any sign of metabolic ill health and do every single thing imaginable to reduce the burden of dna insult and you try to narrow yourself and confine yourself into this very narrow box and then you layer on a whole bunch of other things like really aggressive screening and all this other but but so that's kind of what you would do if you don't have a choice if you're absent perfect information you have to probably act more aggressively but i still think this question of which of the two positive negative negative positive squares you know until we at least for me i don't have a great understanding of those and because i think they exist in both i think there are examples and counter examples for both yeah no i mean i don't think anybody has a great answer for it at this point but um i do find you know this is speculative but uh you know one one hypothesis is sort of that these chromosomal insults occur by by chance or for whatever reason and you know eventually you get one in this pi3k pathway and cell's now able to take advantage of that hyperinsulinemia but another speculative idea is that um if you have you know hyperinsulinemia and um sort of excessive glucose metabolism that it's actually going to be driving the chromosomal insult uh through you know creation of reactive oxygen species in the mitochondria and that the hyper metabolism you know as craig thompson puts it actually creates a way for the cell to mutagenize um so you know i think that's probably part of the story you know there's new research coming about how nutrients are actually you know play a huge role in epigenetics as well so you know it may be that um you know there's just bad luck a mutation comes along and then if the insulin is there a cell takes advantage and if it's not maybe that microscopic tumor never takes off you know a lot of people die with cancer rather than from cancer as as they say um maybe the immune system can can kill these microscopic tumors if not for the insulin keeping the you know insulin really tells the cell to stay alive and so you know i don't think we have great answers to these questions but um i think that you know if you just step back and look at the epidemiology like you know something has to be going on with with nutrition you know because you know the cancer was so much more rare prior to the shift to the western diet and you know could it could be many different things but you know the it all points to hyperinsulinemia and you know it's it's a growth factor you know and cancer cells are covered in insulin receptors it just you know makes a lot of sense that that this is really fundamental in one way or another that's right i'll just say the counterpoint is you know maybe that if you just have bad luck and get an akt mutation then the cell you know no longer needs insulin and can just get all the glucose at once and and that um you know maybe it's true in some cancers but but from as i understand it that even when you have these mutations in this ph3ktm pathway that they're still insulin dependent just less dependent so you can imagine a scenario at least where keeping insulin really low will help even if that chromosomal insult takes place and makes a cell more susceptible you know what about non-insulin requiring nutrients such as fructose rick johnson and lou cantley have um both spoken about this what um what if anything did you uncover about the potential role of fructose in cancer yeah um that was one of the most surprising parts of the story for me uh in in in humbling and in a way as well uh you know a reminder reminder to me you know i was writing about warburg who always believed too strongly in his own ideas and couldn't you know accept that they may be wrong and you know it's anytime you're writing a book that has any kind of argument in it you sort of fall into that trap and have to remember that you know science changes and not everything's proven so i had decided you know early in my writing process that i thought sugar sucrose was a big part of this story uh but my assumption was that it was all by way of driving you know liver fat and insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia and then um in recent years this work out of cantli's lab and richard johnson's and uh has shown that uh you know even independent of the the effects on insulin that fructose seems to drive you know certain cancers that that you know particularly in the colon that are able to get the fructose uh and uh actually you know turns on you know through sort of a an odd metabolism actually turns on the warburg effect and allows sort of atp to go down and then glucose to flow in but um the surprising part for me was that um you know that could be disassociated with insulin i had to to step back and say that um you know maybe maybe sugar is even worse than we thought and uh is sort of causing cancer in two different ways in some cases yeah that that to me is the most interesting question um still somewhat unresolved frankly although i think rick johnson's work is among the most compelling i've seen to um to disentangle that relationship of fructose um independent of its caloric contribution um and as you said it this is this is a mechanism that's that has an indirect effect on insulin right so so fructose metabolism when consumed in excess does in fact lead to insulin resistance which by its very definition leads to hyperinsulinemia but but the work you allude to in in colonic cancer by lou cantley uh actually posits that you know that it's the energetic issue in the cell that you alluded to of the trans and johnson as well it's this lowering of um of atp in the process of metabolizing fructose and it's that um that adp atp sort of switch that that can drive the hyper influx of glucose and that's not necessarily an insulin driven phenomenon yeah yeah now that um you know it's kind of odd for me in a way it supported my hypothesis that sugar is at the center of the story but it it sort of upended my idea of what the mechanism was yeah so um yeah there's still clearly a lot to learn but uh i found you know rick johnson's whole discussion of this absolutely fascinating i listened to the podcast when he was talking to you uh you know part of it you know all the stuff we were talking about uh you know the turn to fermentation low oxygen environments which you know again i think you and i agree that that's maybe not the whole story as some people think but that it the see-saw-like relationship does exist but his example which really fascinated me was that these naked mole rats i don't know if you remember this but yeah they live in this low oxygen environment and they they run a lot of warburg metabolism by converting glucose to fructose and then using the fructose to drive the warburg effect was really fascinating to me what did you learn in this project that you absolutely positively could have never predicted i mean you sort of alluded to the fructose more than glucose issue here was there anything else that either historically or scientifically completely caught you off guard and and um challenged what you thought you knew about yourself or this body of work yeah it's a good question i think one of one of the things that really struck me and i think a lot of people who spend years researching and writing about nazis end up with a similar insight but you sort of have to go through it to to maybe realize it is you know i grew up you know jewish and learning about the holocaust and nazis and in my mind you know they were evil monsters and and they were but i i never humanized them and now i had to sort of look at the personal stories of all these nazis and and not think of them as in an abstract you know evil monstrous way but understanding as human beings how they went down this path and how it happened progressively throughout the 30s and how it could be that somebody who you know might in one context be a nice neighbor and friend and then you know go into the office and you know work on documents that you know that uh lead to you know millions of people ultimately getting murdered you know just getting into the lives of these people and seen that progression it really was chilling and eye-opening in a way to make me think that this wasn't an anomaly that this in theory you know it has happened elsewhere in various forms and could happen elsewhere so it made me sort of much more politically attuned to certain extremist politics so so that was part of it on a political level and you know on a personal level in terms of the writing it was such a daunting project for me how many words is the book sam i actually don't even know i think it's about 120 000 some words but you know i didn't have the training in biochemistry i didn't speak german fluently and i really you know i didn't plan to write the book the publisher came to me and said i saw your new york times article do you want to do this and and i hesitated didn't say yes right away because such a big project but um you know i think that over the years i sort of learned a lot about myself as a writer and sort of was able to gradually you know trust myself more as a historian and you know i i think that um i feel more confident as a writer having completed this project we'll see uh you know if i still feel that way after somebody trashes the book but uh for me i felt like i was taking a big risk and that that i made it to the end of that project uh you know is very rewarding makes me feel confident about taking on other stuff as a writer do you pay attention to what people say about your work or do you go out of your way to avoid reviews and things like that um i go out of my way to avoid reviews uh what's fascinating to me is that even positive reviews which you know i'm very grateful grateful for but they also make me uncomfortable just the thought of anybody sort of passing judgment you know on something that you know you work on so hard for so many years it's just it's just too much to to get a reaction to it in some ways i am incredibly grateful for the positive reviews and it's been really rewarding to get some nice responses to the book on twitter but um you know i think there's gonna be a new york times review out soon i'm not even sure i can read it you know just i have the same thing with my student you know i teach and students provide um you know assessments of my teaching at the end of each semester and i read them because i need to know how to become a better professor but it makes me deeply uncomfortable um you know i i don't write book reviews anymore because it's just you know when somebody works on slang so hard for so many years it's terrible to have to pass judgment on it uh you know i'm kind of a softy i guess but um but how do you learn then i mean i can be totally sympathetic to that but is there um is there a model where you let somebody else read the reviews and pass on just the objective you know this is working this is not working feedback i'm asking honestly for personal reasons um as i sort of think about how to digest feedback in a forum that is actually very harsh no i mean no it's certainly i think it's certainly true that if you don't read your views you're not going to learn as much but in a way it's too late at that point you know what i do is before uh you know before i finish the project i sent you first and foremost my editor who was wonderful live right dan gerstel to do a shout out uh but you know i also have a handful of trusted friends who i send a manuscript to and get their feedback on and you know i certainly that doesn't make me uncomfortable because it's a different dynamic it's not in public it's in private and they're people that i trust and i don't feel you know publicly shamed if they uh tell me it's awful and um you know i can't get better unless i get their feedback and um you know i got tremendously valuable feedback from those early readers so you know i i don't think there's a writer i mean every writer i know does some form of that and i think everybody should so sam tell folks again the name of the book uh the book is ravenous otto warburg the nazis in the search for the cancer diet connection all right well sam thank you very much for taking the time uh so much time to sit down with me today and talk about this and share these insights with all uh all the folks that are everybody's interested in cancer so um i think there was a lot here both in the history of it and also the um the implication which is potentially that metabolism plays a very important role in cancer uh it might not be entirely clear if it's uh the the trigger the you know the if it's the spark if it's the oxygen if it's the fuel but it's in that mix so um the more we can do reduce hyperinsulinemia improve cancer improve our metabolism reduce reactive oxygen species all these things that you've spoken about um presumably the better odds we have against the disease to which we've made very little progress as you point out in the last 50 years so thank you sam yeah
