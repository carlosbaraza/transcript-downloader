[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD com

[00:00:40] this podcast I'll be speaking with my good friend da Wallach I've known da for maybe five years now maybe four I can't recall but he is truly a Renaissance man I have been accused of being a Renaissance man on occasion but I am NOT da however is and if you look up Renaissance man in the dictionary I think you'll just see his picture with his curly hair sitting there he is a recording artist a songwriter an investor an essayist he was discovered while an undergrad at Harvard by

[00:01:13] Pharrell among others who signed him to a deal he went on to become one half of the band Chester French they released three full-length albums and he also has a solo album called time machine which was released in 2016 will link to all of that stuff well with Chester French they toured with a number of legendary bands and artists such as Lady gaga Weezer and perhaps my favorite of them all blink-182 beyond music however da is sort of in a class of his own in terms of his intellectual curiosity and his ability to assimilate information that seems so far outside of his area of expertise in fact some of the most interesting discussions I remember ever having with da is sort of what prompted this podcast I remember one day he came over he was passing through San Diego on his way down from LA came by and we were sitting out at a park on the swings having a discussion about liquid biopsies and I was thinking to myself how is it that I'm sitting here with this guy my buddy who's musician and a very good investor having this discussion about liquid biopsies at a level of detail but I don't get to have with pretty much anybody else outside of people who are knee-deep in this field and that was sort of when it clicked in my mind I was like you know da would be a great guy to have on the podcast he's advised a number of start-up companies including SpaceX doctor on demand Ripple emulate and of course he was an artist-in-residence at

[00:02:37] Spotify and we talked actually quite a bit about Spotify on this episode for anyone who's kind of interested in how it came to be the other things that we talked about of course is his background in music and his start my daughter is a great drummer for a little kid and I've always been interested in how one can continue to encourage kids to be involved in music and we talked about some fun times that we've had when he's been over and as jammed with her we talk a lot about cancer screening which anybody who's kind of ever heard me talk about this stuff privately I really think that when it comes to the major metabolic diseases cardiovascular disease and the other atherosclerosis cancer and neurodegenerative disease is the big tool that is really missing is these liquid biopsies by the time cancer becomes visible on an imaging study you can make the case you've lost the war I don't know that that's true but I do believe that if we can catch these things when they are not yet fully determined to be cancers based on either looking at a DNA signature and RNA signature or even a protein signature that we might have a shot we also get into some really kind of nerdy stuff that I think is very important for anybody thinking about screening such as positive predictive value negative predictive value sensitivity and specificity and we'll link to some information here that we use internally in our practice to help patients navigate that so if you're interested in music if you're interested in liquid biopsies cancer prevention general cancer screening and just interested in listening to a really smart dude who seems to know a lot about a lot of things and can speak very articulately about them I think you'll really enjoy this podcast you'll be able to find the show notes for this at Peter attea MD com forward slash podcast and we'll link to a lot of the stuff that we talked about that will hopefully allow those of you who interested to follow up and learn a little bit more so without further delay here is my conversation with the amazing da wallet da Peter thanks for having me over to your lovely place you're welcome you're welcome here anytime

[00:04:44] I like how you saw that I was in the driveway before I got here and I was kind of just hanging out well we have this thing called the door bird which is kind of the evolved version of a ring and you you since you're interested in all esoteric technical things would be interested to know that this is the only web enabled cloud recording doorbell system that can hook into a electric strike a strike being the thing that that opens a gate hmm remotely and so

[00:05:19] I'm able to see who rings the doorbell and then if I want to let them in press a button from the same app that opens the gate remarkable technology yes technology as Ellie G would say yes so we have known each other I don't remember how we met actually think we met through Gary Taubes did we met through Gary Taubes and I met Gary Taubes because I cold emailed him which is how most things start in my life yes and I called emailed him because I became sort of obsessed with obesity and nutrition research this was maybe six years ago hmm or there about six seven years ago and then I had gotten coffee with Gary up in Berkeley and he thought it would be worth our meeting and now I talked to you more than I talked to Gary ya know it became a it was a love at first sight actually and it you know one thing that's really funny we're gonna talk so much about sort of your musical career and things like that but I will forever be grateful to that one night that you and Adam were over for dinner this was just after my daughter Olivia started to play the drums and you guys got up Adams played the piano you played the drums

[00:06:27] Olivia then played the drums and it was really exciting to see she got to see in action what like improvised music can look like and I really think that that's part of the reason she still loves the drums well that's good I mean part of the that's fine is that you don't necessarily need to know the musical material as well as other instrumentalists do in order to play along with people you know you don't need to sort of learn the song you can kind of as long as you can learn the beat of the song or figure it out quickly you can play which is as someone who doesn't necessarily love practicing something that's always drawn me to drums and I remember her teacher when she was five and I started saying you know it's gonna be really hard because the music's really hard to read so the only shot she'll have it starting this young is if she sort of has an intuitive feel for the music in which case she can get by on that until she learns to actually figure out that you know two sixteenths is actually an eighth and that kind of stuff right well that's a good point and I think the best way to learn instruments or to learn music in general is kind of to start without any framework play around and explore yourself and then learn a little theory because what you don't want to do is become imprisoned by theory but it does answer some important questions that you'll arrive at if you allow yourself to get lost in the first place and so

[00:07:51] I've always said that you know when we have kids my vision for piano training would be you just have to sit there for half an hour every day and you can do whatever you want you don't have to touch the piano if you don't want but of course anyone's sitting at a piano for 30 minutes will and you can figure out how it works and then theory if you have spent you know tens of hours messing around is like an amazing gift because it goes oh okay well that makes sense that's how it works it's just like if you were trying to reinvent mathematics with no orientation like Rama Newton yes like Rama Nugent would you know I'm not you're almost a revolution of music I wish so speaking of which how did you what was your how did you get started in music were you always musical as a child were you playing instruments when you were young I don't think I was particularly musical I always liked listening to music and my dad would take me to jazz shows okay when I was young which sort of infected me with an interest in jazz the first instrument I tried playing was the saxophone because I thought it looked cool and I remember we rented one this was in the middle school band so it might have been fifth grade this was an alto sax or a tenor I don't even remember and in any event we rented it I brought it home and I tried to learn how to just make us sound with it which is not trivial because with a reed you have to push your lips in a particular way in all this and I was so frustrated in the first hour of trying to play the saxophone that I gave up and became a drummer and then played drums throughout middle school and high school and I had had sort of bands with high school friends that sort of thing and then in college became a singer which was something I had never done oh so I didn't realize that you had never son until you got to college I had never sung and I met some cool guys in the dining room at my college and then they said you want to try out for this band we're thinking about starting and I said sure I tried out as the drummer but I got beaten by my friend Damian who then became our drummer and as a consolation prize they asked me if I wanted to be the singer and I said well I've never sung before but I'll try and I've been trying ever since so I didn't realize that so you went into what became

[00:10:15] Chester French as the drummer trying to be the drummer and then Damian who became the drummer later quit and became a filmmaker and is now one I like ten Academy Awards he did whiplash hmm and then he did lala land which I have a small cameo in but whiplash if you've seen it is about a drummer and you know somewhat autobiographical about Damian oh I didn't that I didn't realize I mean whiplash is there's only probably five movies I have stored on my iPad because you know it's just they take up a lot of room right so but the five that I have are like such that if I'm on an airplane and everything goes to hell in a handbasket and the Wi-Fi is broken and I don't feel like doing work boom boom boom and and whiplash is one of those five it's great which means it's a movie

[00:11:01] I've seen more times than I can count but is they like the last scene well it's a high-octane movie I mean it's about human performance basically so yeah why you like it it is unbelievable yeah but I had no idea about this notion that it was not just purely fictional and that there was some autobiographical component to it a little bit I mean I don't think there was anyone as sinister and Damien's life as the teacher you know in the movie but Damian both is a drummer and now as a filmmakers incredibly self-critical and hardworking and perfectionistic and so I think those elements are definitely a reflection of his personality I'm always amazed when you look back it's sort of the annals of rock and roll how many musicians didn't come into it a singer so for example I remember hearing about Bob Dylan and

[00:11:47] Jimi Hendrix and people who really never thought of it as their voice was what was gonna do things and yet we still think of them as completely iconic can anybody learn to sing I don't know if anyone can learn to sing I mean you need a certain amount of physical instrumentation that you just can't escape I mean so there's things I wish I could do with my voice that I'll never be able to do just like I wish I could dunk a basketball that being said I think there's probably an or I I know there's an enormous range of refinement that can be pursued because I started as a pretty bad singer and I think have become an OK singer and a lot of that just like any physical activity is about learning how to mentally control a part of your body to get it to do what you want it to do it's just that controlling your vocal folds and the way that you you know Express air is a relatively fine-tuned set of physical processes and so the sort of detailed control that you need to physically command over your anatomy is kind of difficult to obtain but you know I became a much much better singer I think the thing that is probably more natural that you either have or you don't have is an ability to know when you're making a noise whether it is on pitch and some people clearly don't have this but I think most people have a decent sense of pitch and if they didn't then you know they wouldn't be pleased by harmonious music I mean we have a natural ability to hear whether someone's hitting a sour note in a chord or something or whether someone's singing off tune that that bothers most of us so if you can be bothered by that then chances are you can hear the difference between that and the right thing and that's what a lot of it comes down to when you're singing it's very important that you hear yourself because that's the feedback loop yeah so do you remember the first time you sang on stage in front of people besides your bandmates well it would have been freshman year in college and we began by doing sort of weekly performances in the student Commons at Harvard and you know the audience was twenty or thirty of our friends and the band always had a sense of humor to the music although that trailed off in our final album which was not really funny but earlier we had always kind of been humorous at some level and I think that masked how poor my musicianship was for a long time because we could kind of play it off as a bit of a joke band so sort of like barenaked ladies like what was it not that they were a joke band but you know they were always having fun they were silly mm-hmm we were irreverent and somewhat subversive in the notion that that what we did was meant to almost be ironic so we would do songs about medieval nights we would do totally absurdist music and I think totally possible to hear it and either think that it was self-consciously funny or to think that it was totally clueless and so that made it easier to sort of cut the tension a little bit and break the ice or so to speak you know that it wasn't like you were scared to death getting up there for me like if you said to me you're Peter you have to either go and climb Mount Everest or k2 and there's you know like a 30% chance you're gonna die or you have to sing in front of and people I'm trekking like I'm going to the mountain like the heart of actually singing in front of any human being right like including people like my kids like there's no way I'm singing yeah I don't know why there is some sense of shame that attends singing I mean I know what you're said I don't feel it but I wish I'd written I mean like part part of it is I think realizing that singing is just musical speaking so we're really seeing all the time when we're talking we're just not using tonality and as deliberate away I mean there's a pitch to every time you speak so singing is just controlling that pitch which is actually a helpful thing that I learned from vocal coaches who when I went to go touring I went to see literally because it became more of a sport for me it was now something that

[00:16:27] I was gonna have to do for an hour to everyday and I didn't have the physical endurance and the muscle control to endure that without hurting myself so I would go to some coaches to sort of get ready to tour and they would make this point that that singing is just musical speaking and it really changed the way I thought about singing and made it quite a bit easier so let's talk to the transition so you guys start this pamphlet that tell me about the name

[00:16:56] Chester French where did it come from Chester French was the name of a sculptor Daniel Chester French who did the Lincoln Memorial and then he also did the John Harvard statue which is in the center of Harvard's main quad and we didn't know that when we chose the name but we had a dining hall there that all freshmen ate and that sort of looks like the Hogwarts dining hall in Harry Potter big wood paneled room with soaring ceilings and busts all around the walls so we were going in to lunch and we saw one of these busts and it had a little plaque under it that was we thought the name of the person who had been sculpted and so he said Chester French that's kind of a cool name and we picked it then and there and then we later of course learned that that was the sculptor of not only that bus but also these other great American sculptures got it so when did you guys start to get some traction and I mean because most college bands don't end up going on tours so what was that transition like we basically got no traction doing what we initially set out to do which was to build a live performance following so the conventional wisdom if you started a band on the East Coast in college which a lot of people did actually if they were musicians was start playing on your campus start playing at surrounding campus parties and sorority keggers and whatever and then ultimately get a van and start driving around the East Coast and going to other colleges and you can build a following among college students and we tried to do this but we just totally ate I mean we could barely get people to come to our shows on campus and then we I remember booked a gig at a club called Great Scott in

[00:18:40] Boston which was kind of the Harpers Ferry was that was the specific one that I'm thinking of here Great Scott was another club we'd booked a show at this Harpers Ferry and we both tried to recruit our friends from campus to make a 10-minute journey to this club I think three of them came and then we also for the three nights prior to the show went and stood on the street in front of the club figuring that people who lived in the area probably walked by the club and or people who went to the club might come and see multiple shows handing out flyers trying to promote ourselves and when we got there to do the gig on a

[00:19:20] Thursday night or something I think there was an audience of like five or seven people and you know that's particularly depressing when you've spent two-and-a-half hours setting up and sound checking and hauling all your gear so anyways that strategy failed I'm not sure why maybe we just weren't good live or something but we took a turn at the end of sophomore year in strategy and our focus became just making recordings and the thought was ultimately the product is a recorded music product that's what we're really making were songwriters and we're producers and so our focus shifted to essentially just living in the recording studio making stuff and the idea became let's try and make an album that we think is a great complete representation of our musical ideas and if we do that and it's really good it will speak for itself and no one in the record industry will care whether we have this big live following or not luckily that turned out to work I mean it was not certain by any means but we made this record over the subsequent two and a half years and then in the middle of senior year started sending out that album to as many people as we could send it out to and ultimately it got to Kanye West who gave us our big break and flew us out to Los

[00:20:46] Angeles and offered us a record deal and then that spurred a number of other people attempting to sign us to record deals we ultimately chose to work with Pharrell and did a deal with him and a guy named Jimmy Iovine who ran Interscope Records and as soon as we graduated we moved out to LA and that became our career I mean just put that in context from him but that strikes me as like a fairy tale right I mean what's the probability that Kanye West I mean how many times is he getting something pitched and having to you know pick a needle out of a haystack is that how that works I think it was a little atypical that other artists supported us and you know now that I'm sort of not doing music full-time in retrospect when

[00:21:30] I look at the band's career it's kind of clear to me that we were an artists artists in other words our fans tended to be people who were quite musical whether they were famous musicians or whether they were just random people who played guitar at home but we were making a style of music that I think spoke to musicians specifically part of that was the result of trying to make music that we wanted to listen to and so we were our own customer in a kind of weird way so it certainly wasn't typical that other artists would be the ones to jumpstart our career on the other hand it was at a time when the music mystery was changing and so all of the paradigms by which artists got discovered were being destabilized there used to be these armies of a and our people who worked at record companies and they went to concerts and scouted and what was changing when we came onto the scene was that the internet was becoming the primary distribution channel for music and also the primary place where people discovered new artists this is what like two thousand three thousand seven two thousand seven okay and so you know Facebook was a couple years old myspace was kind of at its height and we were one of the first artists to primarily build our audience online so you know that was unique and was Facebook a better channel for that than say having your own site that you're hosting like how were you

[00:22:59] Facebook was and remains a bad channel for that but MySpace was an amazing channel for that and MySpace had all of these features that allowed culture to kind of virally permeate civilizations so tell me what what myspace did better than Facebook with respect to that or what had enabled well there were let's say two or three distinctive things about it the first was that it essentially was a place where spam was totally legal and standardized and so it was kind of like

[00:23:31] MySpace felt almost like Times Square in the 80s or something you know it was like a little unsavory there were all these weird people on their people had avatar so you didn't know if it was really them or not identity had not been formalized in the way that Facebook ultimately made it so on the one hand you could spam people so for us we could go on there and just randomly send our music to random people who we thought might like it that was highly useful the second thing was that they had this thing top eight so on everyone's MySpace page you could pick your top eight friends and that became kind of like a prize to be one of the top eight of a famous person or one of the top eight of a famous band or something and so you could kind of go on MySpace and

[00:24:23] Ryann find artists who you thought would share an audience or whose audience you wanted to steal essentially it's not stealing because it's not a zero-sum thing people can like a lot of artists but we would identify these artists who we wanted to you know steal the fans of and then we'd try and get our music to them to get in their top eight because then tons of people would discover you and then the third thing was that myspace allowed each user an incredible amount of freedom in designing their page so you could go in and change the

[00:24:58] HTML or the CSS on your MySpace page and this from a user experience standpoint made it a very difficult place to navigate but I think what it brought out was that everybody when you give them a creative canvas likes to paint on it and what you saw was that ordinary people who were just myspace users consumers of content themselves would really wear their identity on their page and so you could kind of navigate this universe of

[00:25:34] MySpace and understand the cultural orientation of every person on it and it made it really easy to figure out who were your people you know I mean if you were like a goth band or something a metal band it was very clear who the metal people were and so for us we could really take advantage of this and kind of hack the system to find our people quickly I don't wanna go down the rabbit hole in this but it's so interesting because I've never I haven't thought about MySpace in probably 10 years or something like that when the history books written and it can probably be written now I'm assuming why did Facebook win myspace lose at the risk of oversimplifying things I think there are a few reasons I perceive and then there probably many I have no idea about like you just strike me as having a better sense than the average person based on a pretty robust understanding of how both of them worked myspace was even if they maybe thought they were being scientific it was not a sort of science project in other words the people building were in LA there were kind of more inclined to understanding culture and the thinking about personal freedom and expression whereas what Facebook was built around was the idea that if you created an accurate map of people's real world relationships then the behaviors that they exhibit in the real world would end up mirrored in this digital environment so social values like trust were gonna be essential in the Facebook universe where as in MySpace like I said it was like Times Square in the 80s it was like there were seedy people on there you didn't know if people were who they said they were it was a fake place and the early internet was much more like that you know everyone was in chat rooms with aliases and stuff you never really knew who was who

[00:27:34] Facebook became a digital version of the real world and so it was kind of more valuable from the outset because things that you only previously could do in reality like talk to someone or share with them photos or something became something that you could do in a highly managed way through Facebook that's really interesting I have never I would have assumed just as a guy who knows nothing that you know Facebook won because they figured out how to monetize this stuff better than MySpace but it sounds like there's much more cultural emotional sort of philosophical differences that that may have decided which direction was going to have greater mass appeal I think that's right and you sort of see this resuscitated in the rise of snapchat because snapchat is also kind of back to that la mindset it's much more expressive and irreverent and kind of culturally contextualized it's got a lot of character and personality its logo is a funny ghost drawing and this sort of thing and so I wouldn't give up yet on the idea that the future of the Internet may allow people to be much more expressive then you see them being on

[00:28:53] Facebook Facebook is a little bit totalitarian not necessarily in a bad way I mean that's that's a word that is pretty loaded but you know loaded but I'm looking for a antiseptic or anodyne or I don't know what the right word is but it's it doesn't have a lot of flavor it's a reflection of the engineering mindset behind it which itself is really ingenious but it as a digital place lacks culture Mark Zuckerberg who I think very highly of and who's a friend is a genius business person and technologist but he's never I don't think been especially interested in culture and when he talks about Facebook being a community in a global community

[00:29:44] I think he is potentially always you know I don't to put words in his mouth but I think he's maybe always thought that Facebook shouldn't have too much of a culture that it imposes it should basically be a blank canvas for all of the diversity that is in the world and when you allow people to express themselves more it's unclear whether what you're doing is loading a place with some cultural precepts of your own even by dint of the way that you design what those expressive tools are or if you're actually giving people more freedom and so I think Facebook has always taken the approach of limiting people's expressive capacity forcing them to make comments or post things in these very structured linear formats whereas some of these other tools have been a lot more liberal in the attitude that they take to personal expression when you went to college what I mean what you studied I didn't African

[00:30:53] American Studies and I have a minor in Kikuyu which is a in language that I no longer speak were you thinking about going to grad school after I mean were you just pursuing your bliss like what were you thinking you would end up doing before you ended up in LA of course I wasn't thinking much about it at all I mean I think I had been very interested in public policy and so politics interested interested me and I think academia maybe interested me the arts certainly did and I think halfway through my freshman year I decided that the goal I wanted to shoot for was becoming a musician but part of that was a response to finding when I got to college that Harvard was essentially a vocational school for investment banking and management consulting I I never I didn't know that those were jobs in the world I had never heard of either of those professions and when it became clear to me that 40 or 50 percent of my classmates would end up in those jobs I was kind of horrified and I thought oh my gosh is that the adult life that awaits me and maybe is a bit of a rebellion against that I went full bore into I want to be a musician that is hilarious the vocational school for investment banking and management consulting I didn't realize it was that high so roughly I don't but whatever call it even if a third of people end up as investment bankers and management consultants that's it that's pretty interesting concentration anything wrong

[00:32:23] I mean I know you were management consulting yeah on point but there was a sense in which I felt that my college and elite universities in general I mentioned it a couple times but I'm not someone who's a big booster I'm not involved in alumni stuff I don't take a lot of pride particularly and having gone to Harvard or anything and part of why is because I'm very suspicious of these institutions both because they essentially serve a function in the

[00:32:50] Society of reproducing inequality and social hierarchy and they've been doing that for hundreds of years and second because they homogenize all of these talented young people so they do an extraordinarily good job of finding interesting unique people in highschool and then turning them into boring high achieving technocrats and that's kind of a tragedy for the world because it's a waste of the formidable resources that those universities do have that what they choose to do with it is essentially pump out functionaries in the financial services but somewhere along the way you learn to think and is it safe to then assume that you learned that before college and that college if anything didn't diminish that ability rather than

[00:33:39] Augmented it I'll tell you where I'm going with this you know and we're gonna talk a lot about biology and our mutual interest in you know hacking and life spin and all that sort of stuff but I remember after even the first day we met maybe it was like after our second meeting or some hammering we're thinking how does this guy know so much about this stuff like you had more than just a superficial understanding of stuff that's suggested like you'd read a couple of things about it which obviously just suggested to me that you learned how to learn and as a result of that when you decided hey I really want to understand this area and I want to understand the science of this stuff you at least had a tool kit that you could use to do that where do you think you got that I think I maybe just always been curious and that is a personality trait or disposition just wanting to understand things is has always driven me to some degree when I went to college

[00:34:32] I was interested in race and the history of race in America and how this set of ideas about who we are influences what the world is and who we become as people and I was essentially interested primarily in these very complicated phenomena in the social world so I wanted to you know I remember the first time I read Marx and whatever it was so engaging to discover a set of these totalizing ideas about how history works or something you know whether I agree with them or not it's a separate issue but the idea that one could theoretically describe reality was always compelling to me and what has happened intellectually as

[00:35:26] I've gotten older is that I've realized that science is essentially the best methodology that we have for describing reality and I've realized that I think the things that most interested me social phenomena government public policy history are very difficult to address with the science currently at our disposal so ultimately I believe we will be able to have an empirical understanding of some of these sorts of things but I was going after them back then naively thinking that we already had those tools at our disposal or that

[00:36:06] I could by reading a lot about history develop a accurate picture of how it works and one learning how to think is about understanding the limitations of our own biology or in our own cognition but then it's also about figuring out what's knowable and how you can understand things and what processes you can use to understand things and so when I encounter a subject I'm instantly tracking on what's the theoretical framework behind it the details don't really interest me it's what's the skeleton behind it what's the structure of it and for that reason I don't think you know I've never been good at facts

[00:36:53] I'm not good at dates I'm not good at memorizing names of biomolecules but what sticks in my brain are these kind of theoretical constructs yeah somebody asked me on Twitter a while ago and I decided it would be a good question for an AMA at some point which was if you could change something about the medical school curriculum what would it be in it

[00:37:13] I wouldn't describe it probably as eloquently as you but it's basically I remember the first day of medical school they said you know the average college graduate has a vocabulary of X words and I don't actually remember what X is but I feel like it was about 10,000 or something like that and they said you know in the next two years which is before you go into the clinical stuff you're gonna learn and it was a little more than so if it was 10,000 was the college grad they said like you'll learn 12,000 new words and obviously you do need to learn a new vocabulary in medicine but when I look back at medicine in medical school rather I think the biggest deficit was no attention paid deliberately towards how to think and that of course becomes relevant because you know all facts have a half-life and some facts like anatomical facts have very long half-lives so in an area like that it's probably reasonable to know stuff but in other things like by the time you're done medical school the information is wrong or irrelevant and yet nothing's really put in place to teach that skill of how do you go about you're now out there in the real world you're taking care of patients and yet maybe what you learned about cholesterol or maybe what you learned about subject XYZ is kind of not right or at least should be revisited or the probability of it being correct is lower so do you enlist think you'll have kids yeah and so how do you now I'm asking this as a curious parent but how do you think about creating an environment to produce that type of curiosity and that skillset what do you think a parent can do deliberately but

[00:38:44] I'm asking this based on you having been the kid not the parent so far look you certainly have more experience with this because you've got kids what I've heard people say and what I sense may be real is that you actually don't need to teach kids this they're born with a lot of it and what the world tends to do is squeeze it out of them and so I guess I would invert the question and frame it as how do you not kill a child's curiosity and how do you feed it and certainly one of the things I I think my parents did was not sanction in a negative way asking questions or asking why questions and by contrast you can inculcate a child in religious ideologies or strictures about how to live that are so imprisoning that becomes a fundamental part of their brain and so I think just not making those mistakes is probably the most important thing I like the example you gave earlier of your piano lesson is 30 minutes of sitting in front of a piano for some period of time before you start to read sheet music and start doing drills and things like that I like that idea that's absolutely I mean that look there's a balance between the sort of rote discipline that is required in anything and then the creative and exploratory potential within that area in my mind I tend to wait the latter and so what's difficult for me is the brutal repetitive skill building and I've had to figure out ways in life of not making my success depend on that aptitude and figure you know that's stuff that I look to other people to help me with you know my band as an example my partner max is an Inc I mean he's good at everything he's a musically brilliant person at a compositional level too I mean he can write great music and he's very theoretical but he also has that OCD capacity to sit there and practice guitar for 10 hours and that's really fun that's his happy place I'd go crazy doing that and so I think to come back to your question about children I think the struggle for me will be figuring out how to impart to them a greater capacity to do the part that I don't like doing because if you can really have both that's the superpower but it sounds like to me at least maybe part of the the secret is knowing how much emphasis to put on each of those tune again they're not mutually exclusive but you understand that this is a kid that if pushed too hard on the rote stuff will actually dampen the creativity versus sounds like in Max's case that's not the case he can live in both of those worlds and be quite successful and I think that's right you know the one metaphor I used to think about this because a debate that comes up in all contemporary art be it painting or writing or music is essentially whether amateur work can be just as valid as quote-unquote professional work so if you think about punk rock the whole idea is screw learning these instrument

[00:42:01] I'm just gonna pick up the guitar and express myself and so of course there's a level of vitality that can be produced through that type of artwork both the absence of formal rules gives birth to a lot of expressive freedom and you can get a kind of visceral version of someone but there are only so many ways to smash a guitar on stage and so in 100 none of them are as good as Jimi Hendrix at Monterey not and Jimi Hendrix can he can still smash a guitar on stage but he can also do a thousand other things that the Ramones can't do and so the metaphor that I've been thinking of lately is almost like granularity or resolution so you know if you imagine a photograph of something in low resolution versus high resolution it's the same thing that's being expressed but the greater the resolution the more detail there is and when someone is making music or singing or writing a poem or doing anything what you're essentially they're communicating and what you're getting is you're getting sort of a photo of their brain and the more technical skill they have in this metaphor the greater the resolution of that picture they can produce and so I once remember being in the studio with Pharrell and Herbie

[00:43:37] Hancock came by and Pharrell is a kind of folk musician I mean he's incredibly successful and he's very very talented but he's not a trained he didn't go to music conservatory he can't play you a box Sonata he can write amazing stuff he's a theoretical musician right he's a great songwriter and he's got great taste and Herbie Hancock came and he was showing us a bunch of piano exercises that he and his friends used to do in

[00:44:06] Chicago in the 60s and Pharrell kind of expressed that he was scared to learn that stuff because he was worried it would eat into his roughness or his authentic expression and I remember Herbie Hancock's saying it's just gonna give you more colors to paint with it doesn't cost you anything it just it just gives you more things that you can say with those ideas you've got and I thought that was a great argument you know I think it was convincing to Pharrell - when you were in high school who do you in retrospect look back at and say yeah and those were really those musicians shaped my either my tastes or my philosophy or my way of writing or performing like who just broadly speaking who were your influences in that regard they're a little bit mundane but they're sir the obvious suspects the

[00:45:04] Beatles Bob Marley Curtis Mayfield those are the big ones Stevie Wonder maybe maybe those for Motown you know all the holland-dozier-holland were the three great songwriters who did a lot of the Motown stuff a lot of four top songs the temptations songs any James Brown yeah I like James Brown but I would put I'm more of a songwriter and James Brown I think is most important as both a performer and as a groove guy so you know different music is good at different things and there's a tradition in black American music that I think ultimately begins in Africa and in the

[00:45:48] African Diaspora of music that is not really linear it's not about a narrative story being told through something like a song it's much more about setting a musical mood and almost being a place that you hang out Indian music is also like this if you think about Indian ragas for example it's sort of a tonal place and the piece of music maybe half an hour long it maybe two hours long but you kind of go there and you're just hanging out there in that vibe whereas the sort of music that influenced me much more that I working is is more about its again it's kind of more theoretical it's more about a story it's a linear story it's a three-minute song there's a beginning a middle and an end it has some conventions about the way that it moves through those places and people I cited I think are emblematic of that style now you're a drummer so what drummer would you have identified with most I'm certain now gonna double back on what I just said because the key function of the drums is most highly expressed in those types of music that are essentially groove musics so Clyde

[00:47:09] Stubblefield who played with James Brown is one of my favorite drummers of all time that style of music that James Brown made is all about the drummer you know give the drummer some and other people who are you know giants of that format are Bernard Purdie who's just he's still still around and he's incredible I think he claims he's the most recorded drummer of all time or as maybe played on the most hits of any drummer of all time and you know then there are great rock drummers like Keith

[00:47:42] Moon or John Bonham in jazz the drums are much more of a instrument you you can sing through the drums in in jazz music because the drummer is not just hitting hard and fast and loud the drummer has an incredible dynamic range of tonality and expressive options so in in jazz drumming you know Elvin Jones is probably my favorite who played it a lot with John Coltrane but there are an almost unlimited number of incredible jazz drummers who I look up to I think in the show notes for this podcast we should link to some performances that you find particularly notable now that'd be cool

[00:48:29] I remember once you you gave me a nice list of stuff for Olivia which was like here are some great Michael Jackson songs here are some great James Brown songs here are some great boom boom boom it was like this is a great way for a kid to start thinking about music and I thought that's but such a helpful thing to provide so okay let's go back to LA so you get to LA you're living the dream right like it's you've hit a homerun here it's hard to imagine given what the denominator is on the number of people that are trying to accomplish what you guys have accomplished and they're you primarily now still a studio band or are you once you've got this break are you becoming kind of more performance-based as well well by that time the band was just me and my bandmate max so it was a duo really and we as we made music were a studio thing still but we quickly realized you were playing what so you were doing vocals you were doing drums and were you keyboard as well you know I was primarily writing the songs with Max and singing them and Max in the band was the primary instrumentalist he can play pretty much everything and he can learn new instruments in a week so max on the recordings was playing almost all the instruments occasionally we would have studio musicians come in and do stuff that he couldn't do you know if we needed a viola player or something but my function in the band was largely to write the songs with him I was writing all the lyrics I was typically writing the vocal melodies of the songs and then singing them so how did Spotify come into the picture was that true true and unrelated was that just a did Shawn start that or how did that know so let's fast-forward a few years so we basically because there's there's not a lot I think that is super interesting about this period in my life although you may disagree but I don't know a period of your life was not introduced this is 2007 we get our record deal we move out here and then we spent three years making records and touring and a lot of stuff happened a new tour link at one point right we toured with all sorts of people Lady Gaga blink-182 Weezer huge number really cool artists and then I concluded that I didn't like touring and it was around that time that I discovered Spotify I think at the time I already had an interest in investing but

[00:50:50] I didn't really know which direction ago I had met Ashton Kutcher who became a really good friend and he and I got along I think right away because we were both from the Midwest we were both artists and we both had an interest in business and technology but he was a decade ahead of me in terms of being a famous entertainer and he was three or four years ahead of me in terms of thinking that Silicon Valley venture capital could be an interesting canvas for his artwork and so he gave me a little bit of a template for an artist who was gonna get into the technology business and the question became for me you know how do I go from being a musician who neither has capital nor investing experience and become a professional investor and Spotify ended up being in retrospect - the pivot that allowed me to do that you know historically the music industry has not birthed many good businesses and so it was a pretty happy accident that right at this time that I wanted to make this transition this company that would become now a twenty eight billion dollar public market behemoth was starting to become ubiquitous in Sweden and I had friends who knew about it and when they told me about it the appeal of that product of this idea that you could install a thing on your computer and have all of the world's songs ever at your instant recall was an incredibly cool thing to me and I was just thinking of it as the customer basically you know

[00:52:37] I was someone who collected tons of music had hard drives full of it was always struggling to manage the data you know I'd get a new computer now I have to copy all the songs and I have to put him in folders and I it was such a pain in the ass that when someone showed me this I thought wow this is what I've always wanted and it was Pandora on the scene at that time Pandora was really popular and it was just streaming Pandora was streaming but it was streaming algorithmic radio right in other words you couldn't choose the song what was so cool about Spotify was that it recreated the experience of having bought every song ever you had mp3s that you'd buy through the iTunes store for example and they'd be on your computer but maybe you had bought 200 of them that was your library of music whereas when I first saw

[00:53:24] Spotify I thought wow for ten dollars a month it's as if I bought everything ever I mean that was such a shocking value proposition to me that I thought this is almost certainly what everyone should have if the powers that be allow it and the business question which was much more difficult than the product design question was can this company get everyone who owns music to be a part of delivering this experience to the consumer and so was the hardest sell would the artists or would the studio's everything was a hard sell Spotify was

[00:54:08] I'm not gonna take much credit for it because there were thousands of people working on this from the beginning almost but everything about building that business was difficult the first thing that was difficult was that record companies and music publishing companies own the rights to the music and they had seen their business destroyed in the 90s the record industry went to a quarter of its former size in the 90s because of piracy and so you'll remember the record labels were suing is that because CDs had become so ubiquitous that it was easier to copy a CD than say a vinyl or a cassette I mean not that it's not hard to copy a cassette but the quality is not as good is that well it was coincidental with CD ROMs so two things happened one sites like Napster arose that allowed people to trade music freely without paying for it and then what they did with that music after they traded it on the Internet which was so difficult to control or put a lid on was then they would burn CDs and copy the

[00:55:11] CDs and whatever so not only did the format of CDs get unlocked with the ability to write CDs you remember getting your first CDR that was really cool but also you had this unfettered digital environment in which people could share music without anyone getting paid for it what preceded this in the 80s and 90s or really in the 90s was the CD revolution and so not only was piracy painful in its own right it succeeded a decade during which the music companies resold the entire history of music in a 10-year period in other words they not only sold in the 90s on CDs the new music that was being made in price but everything that had been made today so they sold you an entire library of the world's history of music in a 10-year period they were rolling in cash and when they made new music they would sign an artist they'd make one hit song that would play on the radio and then you had to go buy an 1899 album with 14 other songs you didn't want just to get the one you liked so they were raking in the cash by completely controlling the consumers experience piracy blew the lid off that and the consumers rebelled and everyone stopped paying for music and so the industry that Spotify came into was one that had been eviscerated by piracy and then to add insult to injury the legal paid download model that Steve Jobs pioneered with iTunes unilaterally recaptured the distribution system of what before then had been fragmented so the record labels used to in the good old days of the 90s both control the radio stations so they could make things get popular but then they had a variety of physical retailers Sam Goody Virgin

[00:57:22] Megastore all these different CD retailers that they could play off each other they had all the leverage they could make the thing big and then they could tell at the records store that you had to give him this promotion or else your artist wasn't gonna show up there into a CD signing well when Steve Jobs invented the iTunes store he became the only retailer that mattered and so the record labels had this one two punch they'd been subjected to of the industry disappearing and going to a quarter of its size and then this one guy who didn't need them Steve Jobs who made all his money selling hardware gaining total unilateral control over them because he became the only place they could sell music and so they were desperate never to let either of these sorts of things happen to them again they were incredibly paranoid about a new model that they viewed as threatening the paid download business so Spotify was showing up telling consumers for 10 bucks a month you get all the music ever the labels at that point were still embedded in a model where what you did was you sold people downloads for $1 apiece they were used to selling you 10 songs a month for $10 and spot if I came along and said let's give him 22 million songs for $10 so selling the record labels was incredibly difficult and then the artists were ardently against this as well because for them their lifeblood was selling downloads they too were in an environment that was severely nutrition restricted from the past decade and they were struggling to make money most of them were only making money touring and recovering a little bit of income selling their recordings spot if I came along and what we said was we're gonna fix this problem we're gonna convince most people in the world that they should pay for music and the way we're gonna do it is we're gonna give them an experience that is every bit as good as the free illegal experience and we're gonna get them hooked on it and then we're gonna charge them 10 bucks a month and if we can get a huge percentage of them paying 10 bucks a month that is far more than the average consumer at that time was currently spending on music

[00:59:46] I still don't understand the economics of Spotify so if you're spending that 10 and by the way I couldn't just sign up for 10 bucks a month today could I aren't those sweetheart 10 bucks a month I thought that was like a student deal or some you can sign up for 3 dollars a month for the first 3 months today and then it'll go to $10

[01:00:03] I'm ashamed to say I still don't use Spotify I'm still wed to iTunes and I don't know if it's just like the hurdle rate of switching out of iTunes but it strikes me as ridiculous because I pay a buck 29 person I probably buy an average of 10 to 20 songs a month so I'm obviously spending more money than I would but let's just talk about the remuneration for the artist so when I spend a buck 29 on iTunes where does the rent go 30% goes to Apple 70% goes to the record label the record label pays out roughly 10% of their 70% so 7% to the music publisher which owns the song note that the song which is called publishing is different from the recording of the song so if you and I write happy birthday and people sing it all over the world we own the song no matter who's singing it but if Toni Braxton records a version of happy birthday she owns the recording the song owner gets about 10% of the 70% and the artist will typically get somewhere between 15% and 20% of what's left after their 15 or 20% cut has fully paid back the record label for all the money that label has spent promoting them so apples getting a straight 30 that's pretty straightforward of the 70 the labels getting the majority of it the label is getting the majority of it and the artist is getting anywhere from zero to maybe 10% percent something like that now that sounds grossly unfair what makes it less obviously unfair is that the record label is the one taking all of the financial risk in financing the music and very often paying for the artists life so in this economy they are still the only companies that take a financial risk making original art work and they certainly deserve to be paid for taking that risk so how does it work at Spotify so now you paid your ten bucks a month how is that rent spread out sure so what happens is you listen to music all month at the end of the month

[01:02:20] Spotify looks at the amount of time that you spent listening to each of those songs and your ten dollars gets split pro rata to the originators of that music in roughly the same distribution as the seventy percent out of iTunes got split yes how do much despot if I get to keep of the ten by 30% okay so Spotify keeps 30 and the other seventy goes the same way but now it's pro rata yeah that's correct and so for a consumer like you who maybe before spot if I was spending more than ten dollars a month it results in less financial benefit than it might have before on the other hand depends how much you listen to those songs so if on

[01:03:03] Spotify you know if you buy the song on iTunes and you listen to it one time you're paying a dollar twenty nine for one listen but a lot of people when they fall in love with a song listen to it thousands of times and they listen to it for years and if you take a dollar twenty nine and split it among thousands effectively they're paying very little each listen so the paradigm shift is towards a pay for listened model it's a consumption based payment now back before any of this stuff came along if you had a radio station and you played a song not satellite radio just straight

[01:03:38] FM radio for example did you have to pay a royalty for that the radio station had an agreement with an organization called a Performing Rights Society these are societies that manage a particular type of write in music so if you and I write a song we and record it we've just generated a whole basket of different types of legal rights all of which we begin by owning and then we can sell those rights off to different third parties that will help collect the income that attaches to the exploitation of those rights in the case of songs that get played on the radio or performed at a basketball game or these sorts of things that right is called a public performance right and the radio stations do deals with these rights societies in the US the two most prominent ones are called as cap and BMI and those organizations are responsible for monetizing that right on behalf of artists so the radio station at the end of the year will give ASCAP a million dollars and then as cap will do something like Spotify does which is tabulate what that million dollars correspond to and they'll pay out the royalties to artists pro rata in accordance with that and Sean Parker was involved with Spotify and with Napster right that's right so he had kind of a this was this was the evolution of what he and Shawn Fanning had done yeah it was they had intended Napster to become a legal service and what they wanted you know 20 years ago was to go do deals with the record labels to legalize it but the industry was so defensive towards them and so aggressive that it couldn't happen it took 20 years and it took the industry being decimated for everybody to be desperate enough that they were willing to entertain solutions to the Internet and that's what Spotify was you know it's interesting when you look at all of the businesses that have been disrupted by the internet and contrast it with those that have not right so you've just given us a very eloquent description of how the music industry was disrupted but you also pointed out something interesting which is it wasn't just the internet that disrupted it was the desperation that followed the decimation that permitted the restructuring of course then you can rattle off all the glib and obvious examples right what amazon has done to retail what netflix has done to you know blockbuster and you know stores on the side of the street what uber has done two taxis what you know all of the travel sites have done two travel agents

[01:06:17] I mean it's been incredibly disruptive and yet when I think about medicine it's like one of the least disrupted industries by technology and you know you basically still have hospitals eat all the rent payers although most people generally perceive them as bad guys generally don't get paid that much providers get less and less on a per encounter basis and it's you know overall a pretty much similar system to what it was 20 years ago and that's I don't know I mean I guess I'd have to think about it but I can't think of too many industries that are as unchanged in the presence of this revolution as healthcare no I think you're right the appeal of investing in healthcare is exactly what you just expressed and that's what drew me into it several years ago and what I've learned since then has been slightly disillusioning but I'll give you my take on it the first thing I would say is that healthcare is still an industry that largely gets paid through labor so most of the money ultimately goes to labor goes to doctors it goes to healthcare personnel the hospitals don't make that much money they're not that great a business you know if you look at

[01:07:35] Kaiser for example which is an integrated payer provider you know in California I think they have a three or four percent gross margin it's not a phenomenal business the payers to your point have very low margins they in fact have legally imposed limits on the amount of gross margin that they can generate which you know you can argue about the ethics of the pharmaceutical companies who everyone hates seemingly extract enormous profits on the other hand it's a very competitive industry and apart from the legalized monopoly given to them via patents on new drugs they are the only companies sort of as I said about record labels they're the only ones who are out here designing new solutions and taking an enormous risk taking an enormous risk and their shareholders are taking that risk now whether they're being overpaid or underpaid to take that risk is totally debatable the other thing is that it's unclear where technology can deliver dividends in terms of human health and so were thinking about

[01:08:46] Madison at a moment in which we as a species have already made enormous progress I mean whatever we've doubled or tripled lifespan and you know I mean you know these numbers better than I do but even if you get rid of the infant mortality factor and these other things that distort the numbers people are living quite a bit longer on average than they were even seemingly thirty years ago and that's especially true of affluent societies until they get afflicted by the diseases of affluence so where can we get more life from or where can we reduce suffering and disease by way of technology is a little unclear there are all sorts of things that we could of course do to make hospitals more efficient and to spend less than we do on things like end-of-life care that maybe aren't a good use of capital but there's not so obviously a Spotify of health care waiting to happen it's more like there are a million little IT operating efficiencies that

[01:09:52] McKinsey consultants will over the next several decades implement in large health organizations and then the big promise is around new types of medicine that I think will arise in the biotechnology industry and that's where I'm now spending a lot of my time and attention yeah it's sort of interesting because I think one of the challenges of healthcare and I think this was most evident during the debates many years ago not many but I call it eight ten years ago around the ACA and around completely revisiting a restructuring of healthcare and one of the things I found a little painful and listening to politicians talk about health care was they spoke about it like there was just one problem to be solved but the way I sort of think about it is there are at least three completely separate but highly related problems which is you know quality of care and that can be broken down into two levels you can sort of have it as just keeping people from dying versus like generating alpha so you know really improving quality there's cost which is just the cost to this system and about 90 percent of the dollars are basically spent by three entities the government the employer and the payer depending on who's at risk the consumer is on the hook for about ten percent of that cost so how could you reduce the cost and then the third leg of that stool is access how do you ensure access and so when we talk about technology disrupting healthcare it's like where do you start right because you know for me

[01:11:24] I can see things where technology can be quite helpful on quality of care not entirely obvious to me how to leverage technology to lower cost people much smarter than me I'm sure think about that and not entirely clear at least at a practical level how it can drive access although in theory that should be the first place you'd want to go after leveraging technology but I think I'm trying to think about what you said about how Spotify went about it and trying to see is there a parallel there because the thing with Spotify that was hard was you had multiple constituents right you have artists you have labels you have consumers and they all kind of want something a little different and that speaks of an optimization problem which is clearly what healthcare is but going on what you said a moment ago it sounds like today you're a little less encouraged than you would have been four years ago and you're thinking on this problem well let me try and recapitulate you're three legs of the stool and in one simple framework which is something that we should all be aiming for is to generate universal access to the current best available healthcare that anyone in the world receives you know one of my favorite quotes I always forget whose quote it is but venture capitalists talk about a lot which is that the future is already here it's just not evenly distributed and I think that's almost always true look at what rich people are doing and assume that in 20 or 30 years everybody will have that and so what are rich people doing right now well they're paying doctors like you a lot of money to do very bespoke types of Medicine that leverage all sorts of deep biometric analyses of their bodies a lot of thinking by you and your team and a lot of spend on the usage of what are currently expensive machines MRI machines to do preventative screening for tumors every year things like this that if you're really rich you know you might as well go get an MRI every you get a full body MRI every year I mean just see if there's anything going on why not and so what stands between today and orphans and Somalia receiving that level of care and what stands in the way I think is to some degree a level of technological leverage what is happening in your head when you look at a patient's blood tests and try to gel that with your bio physiological mental models is something that I believe computers will be able to do in the future and so right now we use physicians for thinking and for bedside manner and for guidance and then we use some physicians like surgeons for physical procedures that they're essentially athletes at you know you want high-performing athletes who don't mess up who are very precise who've done it a million times well the robot a cessation of physical medicine like surgery is something that I believe will just continue to get better and better it may take longer it may not be replaceable immediately but that will you know we will be primarily doing robotic surgeries a hundred years from now the cognitive work that physicians do will I believe largely be replaced by computational systems that can leverage the same types of theoretical frameworks that our minds are utilizing to make good decisions and what you're left with is all the touchy personal stuff that you as a physician and any other physician knows really matters it's not superficial the ability to help someone make good decisions about their own health to make someone care about their physical health to help them navigate difficult decisions that aren't straightforward that involved trade-offs are the sort of things that physicians right now don't have the time to do that they did when they were taking their medicine bag around to people's houses and hanging out for a couple hours and so in a certain way we may go back to an older style of medicine but the people who do that may look more like highly skilled nurses than like physicians so I believe that what you'll see is globally a lot more technology involved in the deployment of medicine and a shift in the composition of the labor market around medicine towards something that looks more like a large population of highly skilled nurses fewer overpaid or appropriately paid but maybe over trained physicians that right now are very scarce that only rich people can access and then most excitingly you're gonna see a lot of new medicine that's the stuff I'm focused on now as an investor and that's the stuff that I think is going to be the most game-changing that's the stuff that's gonna buy us years of additional life so when did you make that transition where you sort of you're your big foray into this was obviously Spotify as far as like transition one so DEA 2.0 to DEA 3.0 and then DEA 4.0 doing the investing so the biotech stuff specifically when did you make that transition well I'm still making it because it's a hard transition to make and there's been so much that I've already had to learn and so much more that I have yet to learn I think the starting point was this realization that what mattered most in healthcare as a capital allocator meaning the the most useful place that I could help direct money was to what goes through the pipes of the healthcare system as a to the healthcare system itself the health care system in America for the reasons we've just discussed is a creaky old infrastructure and it's important to fix it just like it's important to fix the government or the broken bridges that we have all over the country but it's not the most interesting thing to do and it also doesn't have a global impact because fixing the US healthcare system doesn't do a lot for folks in

[01:17:59] Sudan or in Saudi Arabia or in Japan or anywhere else you're just dealing with a human system where what's broken are the human structures that we've constructed to deliver the thing so that was my starting point was was realizing that the medicine itself was the thing that mattered more and ultimately despite all of the valuable things that physicians do the biggest game changers in human health in the past 50 years have been pills they've been pills that very brilliant people invent and that we can give to people through any number of channels and that actually fix the problem sometimes and we're moving into an era of medicine that people call preventive medicine or precision medicine or whatever you want that really boils down to addressing illness at the level of mechanism understanding that diseases have a functional concrete explanation and that we can develop interventions that actually fix what's broken in a very precise way and without a lot of collateral damage and our ability to do that better and better is what's going to give people much more health in the future and we're in inning two or one of that journey so as an investor there couldn't be a more exciting place to hang out and the advances that we're making on a monthly or yearly basis are staggering so when I noticed that that was happening the it just became clear to me that this was not only an exciting and interesting place to be but also one that could be enormous ly profitable both financially and in terms of the benefit to humanity that delivered what got you interested in the problem of living longer personally well I guess I am not primarily preoccupied with living longer or with longevity as I am with the reduction of suffering that already exists and so people who are really obsessed with longevity maybe you are one of them will make the argument that death is the great tragedy of human life and that you know we basically don't realize it's so bad because we take it for granted and can't see any alternative that may be right but I also think there's a lot of evidence in nature the death and the turnover of populations has some utility Steve Jobs talked about famously that this is

[01:20:44] Nature's Way of clearing out the old ideas and bringing in new ones and creating urgency and creating urgency and but but I don't want to downplay the credibility of the argument for longevity I just think that there are enough people dying obviously prematurely from things that should be preventable and there are lots of people dying in the second half of their life or suffering from things that should be preventable that we should start by focusing on those things now it may be the case that longevity is the skeleton key to all of those problems that the number one risk factor for all diseases is age and that if we could just figure out what's happening with aging then we could get out in front of all these other diseases as it was opposed to playing whack-a-mole with all of them that may be the case and I think it's a legitimate hypothesis to explore but it's not the one that I'm starting from or else all of my investing would be in longevity whereas most of my investing at this point is preoccupied with individual disease and whether we can arrest them and detect them earlier so what are you most passionate about right now not necessarily from the investment thesis perspective but from the technology or promise that the idea holds well the holy grail for me is approaching what I think of as a singularity like moment in biomedicine people throw around the term singularity to mean all sorts of things but I actually believe it's a who's who coined it you know it may have been

[01:22:29] Kurzweil Ray Kurzweil or I'm not sure but or it may have been some of those old cybernetics dudes like I first heard it from Ray's work I don't know enough why don't you explain briefly what how he's referring to it well I think Ray Kurzweil is referring to the singularity as this moment when human minds merge with machines and so we for example download our brains into computers and then are effectively immortalized because our consciousness exists now in a digital format that's not the singularity I'm talking about but the concept of a singularity is that this is a moment at which sort of everything changes and there's an almost infinite acceleration in our capacity to do something the singularity that I envision in our understanding of biomedicine is the moment at which we can digitally represent complex biology and therefore study it at zero marginal cost so let me explain this right now what we essentially do in biology and what medicine has always tried to do is understand how the Machine of a living system works and in the work you do on metabolism for example the ways that we try to represent how the machine works are incredibly complicated they're these flowcharts with all these arrows and pictures and this connects to this and this connects to these ten things and if you pull this lever these four things happen and how do we even make sense of that a

[01:24:12] Waystation to the singularity I'm talking about is the field of so-called systems biology in which what people do is they observe these biological systems and then they try to translate the mechanistic connections that they have uncovered into code into formal representations into a formal language that captures how something works in a way that a computer can understand and in a way that is unambiguous and not sort of stifled by the inherent ambiguity of human language by which we describe a lot of these things in everyday life ultimately systems biology

[01:24:56] I think will allow us to simulate biological systems in their full glorious complexity and when we can do that which we might be twenty years away from where we might be a thousand years away from I don't know but once we can do that then we can effectively run intervention based experiments on digital systems at zero cost and that would be the moment at which we will start to understand biology and the ways that we can intervene in it at an extraordinary rate until then unfortunately we have to do tests on humans or mice or dogs or monkeys and unfortunately we can only learn one thing at a time that way we do controlled experiments where we hold everything constant except one variable and in so doing we try to understand how that variable works and this is a very slow way of learning and it's a very expensive way of learning and although the people who participate in clinical trials are heroes to whom we owe most of our medicine clinical trials are a brutal form of learning that cause many people to die from experimental medicines or that cause many people to endure enormous suffering without any benefit and so that's the thing I'm most excited about getting to that singularity of digitally representing complex biology most of the things that I'm focused on as an investor I view as somehow being stepping stones towards that singularity if you look at other fields that could benefit from the ability to do digital experiments consider macroeconomics wouldn't macroeconomics be even more complicated than biology in other words this sounds like the hardest problem

[01:26:52] I've ever heard of all of these systems people put in the same bucket of complex adaptive systems kind of ground zero for studying these things is the Santa Fe Institute an organization which I'm involved and I'm very passionate about and part of the reason I'm passionate about all of these types of systems is because they share certain characteristics so in a kind of vague way they're all complex in just the colloquial sense like they're really complicated there are a lot of moving parts but it may turn out that we can come up with theories that actually describe all of these types of systems so there's some sense in which these problems of economies and the weather and physiological systems are all kind of similar and we may be able to come up with theories that are predictive that help us make predictions about these different types of systems so that's a kind of intellectual promise land that I think is worth chasing whether or not it's gonna happen or not I think even trying for those sorts of theories is gonna generate useful information whether we'll be able to simulate these things or not is sort of an open theoretical question but I'm optimistic about it because it seems like it's the logical endpoint of all of our digital technology is to create digital representations of reality and on the one hand reality is really complex but on the other it seems to be driven at the bottom from relatively simple theories and so to the extent that the laws of physics are ubiquitous and are driving everything from the bottom up and that everything that happens subsequent to the laws of physics are these emergent phenomena it's not clear to me that we won't come up with simple parsimonious descriptions of these types of systems and the physics of the universe before Newton probably also appeared intractably chaotic so the way that anything looks to us before we understand it is I think pretty imposing which is why when we have breakthroughs they feel almost like this enormous relief because something that seemed really complicated becomes really simple yeah I mean the obvious example right would be the coding of the human genome which is now approaching twenty years in its anniversary do you feel that that discovery has underperformed over performed or met expectations on what we would have thought prior to that codification the pithy aphorism that I think applies to genomics and a lot of things in technology is that it is probably short term overestimated and long term underestimated so certainly when the human genome project reached its initial milestones and Craig Venters genome being sequenced there was a extreme optimism that was unjustified that now that we've cracked this code we're gonna figure out everything in five or ten years clearly that has not happened and so to that extent those predictions have failed on the other hand the sequencing technology that under wrote that is now being used to sequence mRNA to sequence methylation of the genome to sequence neill antigens in cancer patients tumors this has become an extraordinarily useful set of tools for reading all kinds of biology and so long-term I believe the impact of the human genome and our understanding of it is almost impossible to overstate because it represents a basic part of a toolkit that is now integral to everything at the cutting edge of medicine yeah so in other words the tool might actually be more valuable than the initial application absolutely but the only way that people were able to justify pain for that tool was in this then the in the hope that's what I say about Bitcoin and stuff by the way as well because this is now part of my theory of technology which is that you take something like Bitcoin and all these block chains and all this I was an early investor in this company Ripple about six years ago now and so I've been interested in all of this for years but

[01:31:48] I don't take the view that there's any endpoint I predict and know with any level of confidence all I can tell you is that having the smartest computer science 19 year olds in the world in mass shift their attention to an area of technology is gonna produce something so whether Bitcoin becomes a replacement for the United States dollar is almost irrelevant what I'm interested in is what's gonna happen now that millions of people are working on this thing similarly the human genome project was this kind of catalyzing event it's very vivid Bill Clinton had a press conference with craig Venter and it got everyone excited and that sort of moment is what inspires a lot of 18 year-olds are a lot of 15 year olds to go into molecular biology undergraduate programs and then to become genetics researchers and you know so this is how history happens and a lot of things have already come out of genomics and will continue to have you been paying a lot of attention I mean you alluded to it I'm gonna go but have you just on a personal level been paying one attention to the liquid biopsy space a lot yeah

[01:33:02] I've been following the liquid biopsy space now for about four years yeah you and I spoke about this a couple of years ago and I wasn't sure how much you'd still been into it this is something that's very interesting to me you know one of the things I talk about with patients is even with my most best attempts at providing the most bespoke insights into how to prevent diseases when you take a big step back and say let's look at the three main diseases that are going to kill most people in a civilized society where you're basically taking care of the blocking and tackling that you've alluded to earlier it's atherosclerosis it's cancers and neurodegenerative diseases and my personal viewpoint is that the atherosclerosis is in the neurodegenerative diseases we have much more insight into how to prevent cancer stuff and I sort of explain to people when you look at a blood test and let's talk about the best blood test money can buy it's probably offering you 70 to 80 percent of your predictive value on the atherosclerosis I probably offering you 60 to 70 percent of your predictive value on the neurodegenerative side it probably isn't offering you even 30 percent of insight on cancer because of course the mutations that kill are somatic not germline so we're not measuring those we don't have great assays for measuring adoptive immune cell function we can measure an eighth immunity but that's so crude and it's irrelevant in cancer and so we talk about something else you alluded to which is how aggressive can we be in screening whilst solving for optimizing around minimizing physical harm and emotional harm physical harm from the actual screening tool emotional harm from risk of false positives because the harder you look the more you'll find and the open gaping open hole in this is we can't do a liquid biopsy so we got interested in this together you and I mutually around this Enochs to protein which was quite interesting but unfortunately that company that technology doesn't really seem to exist right now it also had a number of issues with it but basically it was a Western blot it was a protein assay they were looking at a protein this Enochs to protein and the belief was that that protein was found exclusively on malignant cells and could only be shed off not just cancer cells but cancerous cells that had the potential to spread and attach to other cells now a company that we both know pretty well Grail is taking a different approach that seems slightly more logical tell us a little bit about Grail Grail is an interesting company it's the spin-out of alumina which is the behemoth genome sequencing business they make all the machines that do sequencing that most people use and the premise of Grail is that by sequencing peripheral blood you can find all sorts of cellular refuse from somatic tissues and that this refuse if you are able to amplify it will tell you about the cells that it's coming from and so one of the proofs of principle of this concept in general was non-invasive prenatal screening pregnant women have in their blood I think up you know potentially 10% of their peripheral blood is actually coming from the fetus and so you can detect a lot of things about the fetus by looking at the mother's peripheral blood and in that case maybe what you need to effectively do is separate the 10% from the 90% in order to look at it when you're talking about early cancers you might be dealing with sub half percent or sub tenth of a percent concentrations of tumor DNA that are showing up in the blood and so the premise of grail is that if you sequence the blood with enough depth meaning you sequence it over and over and over again you can detect just that DNA that's coming from the tumor and by doing so you can identify things about it that give you a guide to where the tumor is and what its genetic characteristics are and this is this is much harder than what you just said a moment ago because the problem you described earlier has two things going for it which is one you've got much more of it there let's just assume the number is percent but the other thing is half of that DNA is foreign that's right 50% of that DNA's from the father 50% from the mother so you have half foreign greater quantity if you have colon cancer and we are lucky enough to get the RNA or DNA of that colon cancer it might have 20 mutated genes it's effectively self DNA well it is self exactly it's tumor DNA a tumor yeah exactly so I mean that's a double whammy it's not just a needle in a haystack it's like a needle of hay in a haystack that's correct and it's also difficult because I just came up with that by the way I'm really that's the first smart thing I think I've ever said it's a good needle of hay in the haystack I like that you can use that as much as you want I will I'm gonna start right now when you're looking for that needle of hay in the haystack the premise of your search has to be that you know what you're looking for in other words you have to identified a series of potential oncogenes in which you're seeking aberrant genetic variants that would indicate the gene has essentially been co-opted by the disease and is now working for the cancer as opposed to working for you who want to defeat the cancer and there are so many different ways that this technology is going to be difficult that is matched by billions of dollars that people are investing in this because solving this problem is as the company's name suggests sort of a Grail I'm not an investor in Grail but I've looked at them and I've also looked at many of their competitors there's another approach that's really cool that I'm investing in right now a company out of

[01:39:15] Boston called glimps is a business that was founded by Sangeeta Bhatia who's an extraordinary researcher at MIT Sangeeta is a hepatologist but a bioengineer whose work has uncovered two really interesting ideas that I think are useful in cancer screening one is that when cancer is setting up shop in a tissue it remodels the micro environment so as to build defenses for itself against the immune system and against the other physiological processes that would stand in its way and it turns out that there are in the human genome 550 different endo proteases that are in some combination utilized in the remodelling of tissues in different processes so they're used primarily in healthy processes but when cancers are beginning these proteins get recruited or these enzymes get recruited rather to do this remodeling work they're sort of the construction workers of the disease as it gets set up and Sangeeta's work and and the work of several other researchers that she's leveraging has identified what proteases tend to be implicated in the early formation of different diseases ranging from fatty liver disease to liver cancer to lung cancer and a set of others and if you can it turns out identify 10 or 15 enzymes that you basically only see up regulated enormous ly when a particular diseases beginning then there's another way of detecting it that Sangeeta is working on which is to engineer nanoparticles that you send into the body she calls them a synthetic biomarker you let them circulate and you design them such that they break apart if they encounter those enzymes and when they break apart they fragment into smaller nanoparticles that can be detected in the urine so sangita's approach is rather than look for these trace amounts of refuse in the blood why not send essentially a team a SWAT team into the body to circulate and hunt for a thing and if that SWAT team finds the thing get a much larger signal in the urine I think that's a very elevator I have tissue specificity it'll have tissue specificity to the extent that the disease you're looking for has a different enzymatic signature when it's in different tissues got it so in the context of let's say you get the signal and you would have to believe then that you're gonna have different enzymatic pathways in the you know Me's and kimmel system of colon cancer versus lung cancer I see so it's not you know when you were saying this I wasn't I'm not familiar with limp so I was I was wondering if what you're gonna say was it got taken up in residence and then you basically would do you know it was labeled with gadolinium or something and you do an MRI you'd see well hey this stuff is being broken apart in the lung therefore that's where we want to look but that's not what you're saying no this is all happening in the periphery in the blood itself the break up of the nanoparticles is occurring at the site of the disease but the refuse from that interaction is going through the kidneys and into the urine it would be interesting if there was a way to see if there's a way to capture the local signature at the tissue site of origin there may in fact be ways to do this and there are several nanoparticle based approaches that follow the lines that you described where it's an imaging agent that is meant to bind specifically to the tissue what's cool about this though is you don't need to target you just use the circulatory system to get these things everywhere and if they detect the thing that you're probing they change and that's what you measure

[01:43:19] I think this is a really clever workaround for some of the problems that I think have been be deviling liquid biopsy but I do think liquid biopsy will probably work and the other reason it may work and there there's a company called free gnome for instance that's taking a different angle on it free gnomes approach is don't look for the tumor DNA in the blood look at the entire genome and see if there is any sort of smoke from the fire if the cancers the fire try to detect the body's systemic response to the cancer and recognize that as aberrant in other words even if the cancer itself is sending off a very small signal maybe the systemic response to it is a much larger signal you can detect that so people are gonna try and get after this in in many different ways my prediction is that within a decade we'll have one or more of these that work quite reliably and each of us will at our annual physical have a routine blood test that is pretty good at detecting cancer now that begets another problem that people have raised which is you know what if we're all getting cancer all the time and most of the time the immune system is disposing of it in short order if that's happening then we'll have another problem to solve which is how do we know when we should treat people who are detected early versus when shouldn't we but that's fine problems create solutions which create more problems and that's what we do you know that's the problem that I probably worry about the most I mean I guess the second most the problem I worry about the most is can we crack this but that problem I got this glimpse into with with all the deep dive I did into ankle blot three years ago which was I was asked by a company that was interested in acquiring them to help with the due diligence I actually thought it was complete buffoonery total quackery complete and utter nonsense but after about a year and a half I thought there really was something there that unfortunately had been sort of bastardized by unsavory characters that were involved in basically creating kind of a profit center around selling alternative products that were complete nonsense but when we did our own analyses on raw data that they gave us we saw something pretty interesting there's two questions you have to ask right when you're doing this is the first is and rather than describe them in terms of sensitivity specificity negative predictive value and positive Q value just describing this stuff in

[01:45:55] English you want to understand something which is if you do a blood test on a person and it comes back and says nothing how confident are you that they have nothing that's the concept of negative predictive value and then conversely if the test comes back and says you have something how confident can you be that you have something that's the idea of positive predictive value now if you look at how onco blot was created you look at how the FDA gave it a type of approval which is not an FDA approval but there's you know and I don't wanna get into the weeds on that stuff but basically it was approved quote-unquote only for patients presenting with metastatic cancer of it with an unknown primary because of its remarkable ability to create a differentiation around 27 different types of tissue so someone shows up with a lung nodule that's not lung cancer it's actually important to know is that breast is it thyroid is it what because they could have a primary that's occult but it's still metastatic cancer and this is a life-and-death decision as to how to treat it and that's where uncle block was actually very useful and so uncle blot became really really good if someone had cancer and you did a blood test on them you had about ninety nine point four percent likelihood of correctly guessing not just that they had cancer but what kind of cancer it was but the flipside is really important which is if you take a whole bunch people that don't have cancer and you can only do this out of a blood bank prospectively you can't even do this in the population what's the likelihood that you're not going to be over calling cancer and when we did an analysis and it was not a huge analysis we were limited by the amount of data we had what we saw was by about five x it overestimated the prevalence of cancer at a given age for a given histology and our interpretation of that was either this is categorically useless or it's picking up a bunch of cancers that don't go on to become cancers they get winnowed out by the immune system which is exactly what you just described and that raises a very difficult question as a physician as a patient which is what do you do if it's your annual physical now sometimes you'll get lucky right you when what's getting lucky getting lucky is it says you have colon cancer and you can go into a colonoscopy which is a great way that says that it's not a great way though if a colonoscopy costs the system three or four thousand dollars and you now are giving people a thousand times more colonoscopies than we're giving today because we've got some screening tests suggests this I'm reading right now a phenomenal book that everyone listening to the podcast and you should read the book of Y by a Judea pearl or you day a pearl who's a professor at UCLA and his area is causal inference and he goes through in the book some of the fascinating math that corresponds with

[01:48:55] Diagnostics in particular and frankly I'm always confused by sensitivity and specificity measurements and which is the inverse of which and we're gonna send you my primer please send me it I we've put so much work into this it's my niece our favorite talk I believe I understand it now but for your listeners

[01:49:13] I'll just from the book give you one example of it and the conditional probabilities that express it people will probably remember a few years ago the guidelines on mammography changed to suggest that women I think what under 40 should not get mammograms as a screen and I was always a little bit skeptical of that conclusion because there's this certain intuitive way in which you think well if it gives you a false positive kind of who cares cuz just go get a CT whatever you know I mean what's obviously don't go get your breast cut off but if all the cost is to a woman is that she goes and gets another test maybe that's not good for the system from a cost standpoint but if you're the patient you certainly don't want to not get screened if you do have breast cancer and so pearl though in his book walks through the actual statistics of this so if the incidence of breast cancer in the wild population is one in 700 that means that out of 4,000 women say five of them would have breast cancers is what you'd expect if the sensitivity of the test is 73 percent which sounds high that means it's sapore below means which is what the sensitivity is of a mammogram 73 percent it means that if you get a positive test result you still have a sub one percent chance of having breast cancer now Bay

[01:50:46] Asian statistics adds another layer of level of complication to this in that Bayesian statistics gives us a way of updating probability estimates that we make and so there's a difference between you being a member of the random population and you being a woman who say has a bracha mutation that radically increases your chances of getting breast cancer and so if you are someone who say has a 50% chance of getting breast cancer in your life then a positive mammogram gives you a much much higher likelihood because it effectively updates your estimate that you began with of your likelihood of getting the disease and so what we probably end up with in any of these tests is a way of stratifying populations based on their genetic risk of getting different diseases and it's only within each of those cohorts of relative risk that we can consider the importance or usefulness of a screening test like a liquid biopsy because it's utility to each person depends upon the extent to which that person is already at risk of the disease you're surveilling yeah the other thing

[01:52:05] I add to that is the way we think about this problem clinically is if I gave you a piece of Swiss cheese and I said how many pencils could you drop through here it's a lot but what if I put four pieces of Swiss cheese on top of each other and rearrange them in such a way that one and only one hole could accept the pencil and so where I see the real application of the liquid biopsy is as follows so let's use a mammography example so so mammograms are good for some things and bad for some things and let's ignore cost because I think once you layer cost into this it becomes way too complicated a problem so it's highly relevant but as a physician I'm trying to solve the problem of the patient not society that's my cop-out so then it becomes a question of is the radiation significant and the radiation of mammography is trivial MBI of course which is a more elaborate a mammogram has very high radiation but we almost never do that anymore so now we've taken away physical harm and we've decided to just discount cost well mammography is good for seeing calcified lesions but it's not good for seeing non calcified lesions conversely MRI won't pick up a calcified lesion but if you're using something called diffusion-weighted imaging it's infinitely better for picking up pretty much everything else so then the question becomes what happens if you layer the mammogram with the DWI MRI with the liquid biopsy those are three pieces of Swiss cheese and then the fourth layer would be the Bayesian piece which is what is the woman's probabilistic likelihood of breast cancer based on her family history known mutations and known mutations of unknown clinical significance which was basically the types of mutations we have and now all of a sudden you've got a much smarter way to think about it so my only take on this one is if and when the liquid biopsies become viable I don't think they should ever be leading candidates I think they should only be used as confirmation so once you do you know XY and Z you then come back so for example if you do you know you go and get a whole body MRI and there's a little shadow in the pancreas well what's the next step there that's a big step are we gonna submit that patient to an

[01:54:18] ERCP or a biopsy of that that's the real deal well I think you're right to some degree but I would push back to lead with it you back against the a priori assumption that we wouldn't lead with it because that does really hinge on sensitivity and specificity you know I mean if we have 99% specific sensitive and a hundred percent specific liquid biopsies over what timeframe though that's CT I think that that's the challenge with the liquid biopsy is you're right I mean technically there's no test that can have a hundred percent specificity a hundred percent sensitivity that sort of like having a rock receiver operating characteristic curve that's a square no such thing exists what I think is you take something where you can can you generate a liquid biopsy that has 100 percent sensitivity even if specificity is only 95 percent which a lot of people think is great but 95% no I actually think you want the inverse I think you never want false negatives in other words you want a hundred percent specificity you never want it to yeah yeah yeah sorry I misspoke you know what do you want how negative predictive value to be a hundred percent you never want someone who has cancer to be told they don't have cancer you can tolerate some people who don't have cancer being told that they do that's right the other dimension here I mean I know we put cost aside but you can't really because the the question is what are the relative costs of these different surveillance measures if liquid biopsies are trivially inexpensive which is the goal say this glimpse test you know I mean forget all the health economics of it if just the cost of doing it might be five or $10 or $20 or something if the sensitivity and specificity are both high enough then of course you would rather use them as a universal screen and then follow up with much more expensive interventions yeah and with things like fecal occult blood testing or fecal DNA as a precursor the colonoscopy it makes tons of sense because we have a pretty well understood pathway for the tumor again not having an answer to this dilemma my big concern with everybody shows up in willy-nilly gets a liquid biopsy that shows you've got pancreatic cancer is what do you do next well that's a question of sensitivity yeah yeah so you go and you get the MRI and the MRI shows nothing to me that's a great outcome that's the best outcome as the MRI shows nothing and if the test is vetted and you're positive and you can be confident that that was not a false positive but rather it's a pre clinical tumor then you're in a pathway of what's the righteous path of surveillance going forward and equally important if not more important is what steps can the patient take in that moment to ward this thing off to aid their immune system is that something as quote/unquote simple as you got to sleep more give your immune system a boost figure out ways to de-stress yourself which of course is pretty hard given though I just told you you have pancreatic cancer but you don't mean like certain way that's that's the art of of how to think about using these things which I I look forward to being able to think about these problems I think what we're getting at is a really interesting framework though that is almost certainly going to become standard which is the utility of the genomics and family history which is you know genomics tells part of that story but it doesn't tell you what happened with your ancestors it's family history remains an incredibly important but you'll you'll start when a baby's born with a whole genome and a family history and that will generate for you the prior probabilities of different diseases being the diseases that afflict that person in the rest of their life those prior probabilities will in a personalized way determine the utility of a wide array of low-cost screening tools that we're gonna have at our disposal and will also lead you to make personalized estimates of the sensitivity or rather the diagnostic power of those tests for that person which to the Bayesian point is different for every person this is a fundamentally different way than how we think about using Diagnostics today there's one detail of it that I don't have enough knowledge about but you've made me interested in and you're in your Swiss cheese metaphor which is what from a probabilities and statistics standpoint is the right way to think about that

[01:59:02] Swiss cheese metaphor does adding tests on top of each other how do you mathematically combine the sensitivity and specificity of the different tests and can you even do so without running clinical trials on the combined usage of the tests to have some ground truth to reference them against my intuition is directionally you can do it but you will not have a number and in other words you can't say that mammography plus DWI MRI liquid biopsy will have this sensitivity and the specificity calculated from the three pairs that you layered on but I think philosophically what you're trying to do is arbitrage each strengths and weakness of different screening tools I think that's right it's a conceptual model right more than it is a theoretical and precise 100% where it gets interesting though is in the math because that's for Jamaica very counterintuitive so if you think about the example that I'm citing from pearls book the sensitivity of the 73% test says that if you have breast cancer there is a 73% chance this test is positive this test is positive the much harder probability is what is the chance that you have breast cancer if this test is positive these are two different conditional probabilities and the shocking result is that if the test says you are positive you have less than a 1% chance of having breast cancer so what's counter into it is if we thought oh we have a one test that's seventy-three percent sensitive we have one test that's 90 percent sensitive we have one test that's 85 percent sensitive you would assume that if you layer the three pieces of Swiss cheese the possibility that if you are positive on two of those three and you have the disease is quite high it may turn out though that it's not very high you know the thing I always caution people against is you never want to talk sensitivity without remembering the specificity and vice versa so in our little primer that we use with our patients we use two extreme and very glib examples if I mail a letter at random to a thousand women and tell them all that they have breast cancer I have a hundred percent sensitivity

[02:01:40] I have zero percent specificity but I have a hundred percent sensitivity because let's just assume three of those women have breast cancer we told them all they have breast cancer nevermind the fact that none never mind the fact that 997 of them don't have breast cancer and I incorrectly told them they do but you can have a hundred percent sensitivity and you're still it's a test if the specificity is really low and similarly you can send a thousand letters out to women at random and say you absolutely don't have breast cancer and you will say that with 100% specifc and this may be true of incumbent Diagnostics as well but what's kind of cool in the liquid biopsy companies I'm looking at and I'm pure exposing my lack of statistical knowledge is that because the test is effectively a computer analysis of data you can manually trade-off between sensitivity and specificity and that's like a PSA yes where do you decide the cutoff is so for the liquid biopsies what everyone is doing is they're saying we have to have a hundred percent specificity we can't tell anyone who has the disease that they don't have it and that's the way it should be that is how it should be I think that that's so what you know if you picture one of those and maybe we'll link to this in show notes so people know what we're talking about when we talk about a receiver operating characteristic curve but that's the picture pulling to the upper-left tightening that curve getting it as close to an area under the curve of one and that was the thing I could never get those on Co block eyes to understand was they couldn't understand they thought of this exclusively as a binary yes/no and it's like no no there's no such thing as yes/no you could say PSA is prostate cancer if it's higher than one and you will catch every single person who had prostate cancer and a million people who don't conversely you can make the cutoff 20 and you'll miss a million people with prostate cancer but you'll be guaranteed that everyone who you say has prostate cancer has prostate cancer that's facetious and not even true but directionally that's the problem that you face and I like the question you posed ei which which I've never thought of which is could you take my sort of hand waving Swiss cheese approach and mathematically map it out without doing the clinical trial and that also goes beyond my paygrade I would to consult with the statistician you could certainly do it retrospectively the way that these tests are developed is that a researcher gets lots of tissue and blood samples from patients and they know which of those are coming from cancer patients or not and then they build a set of assays and analytics pipeline that look at the samples and try to class them correctly and so you could certainly run multiple of those types of tests on the same samples from the same patients if you have large enough sample volumes and you could develop these tests in a layered manner

[02:04:47] I don't think that the statistics would hold if you developed them separately from one another but that effectively is a controlled experiment that I'm describing yeah if you did it as a biased and unbiased sample so you'd have to bifurcate the sample do all of your learning on the biased piece and then only verified on the unbiased piece that's correct and you had the data that's you know that's how they that's how they developed these is they they teach an algorithm essentially what the differences are between healthy and disease and then they feed it new samples and they ask whether those new samples can be classed algorithmically into either of the buckets III don't know the liquid biopsy space is so interesting to me III really you know I tell my patients that I think this is the single area that will most influence our care hopefully in the next five years is right now like I you know we're learning a lot about cardiovascular disease we are still learning especially in the inflammatory side of that disease we're not learning a hell of a lot around the lipoproteins that you know we're just trying to educate people to actually know what's true and what's not true but where we're learning geometrically is around inflammation and potentially with these two clinical trials that were published this year or one that was published this year one that was halted likely the methotrexate study was halted early likely because of a positive effect and that won't be announced until the fall but that's to really in interesting proof of concepts of the anti il-1 study and then the methotrexate study we're making no change in lipoproteins you're improving cardiovascular outcomes in my line the next frontier and cardiovascular is what can we do to strengthen the endothelial resilience because if you have a strong endothelium a muted inflammatory response and you can control lipoproteins you're taking the only inevitable disease our specie has ever faced and knocking at it on its heels but cancer man like we're no better at curing cancer - and we were 40 years ago with five exceptions while cancer like aging seems to be an enormous ly resilient set of processes and you know biology and evolution have been pretty thirsty so the mechanisms as you know of many cancers are mechanisms that are used in early field development by the body so these are tools that our organism has for developing in the first place and unfortunately they run some risk of getting reactivated later in life and doing crazy stuff that's contrary to our interests and so this trade-off between the apparatus that we've been given to become healthy and mature and the processes that ultimately are our undoing seems quite difficult to overcome atherosclerosis is a less obvious one although the sort of endothelial damage that is at its core and the function of the immune system in the processes that ultimately degrade that juncture are also used for all sorts of good things I mean the immune system seems to be at the core of much of this that you know if you do view atherosclerosis ultimately as a sort of

[02:08:08] Auto inflammatory disease then you can think of it as a trade off against the immune system yeah just like allergies right you know exactly and you know we I'm getting allergy shots right now which funny enough I guess have always been referred to as immunotherapy before it was high but you know I mean I would rather have to get allergy shots than be susceptible to almost certain death if I didn't have this immune system do you have any anaphylactic reactions or your allergies frequently no and thankfully I haven't had any anaphylactic reactions to the immunotherapy yeah which is still which is still which doctor science one of the things Sean Parker's working on is allergy and it's one of the things that led him into immunotherapy because he has horrible allergies and so has always been fascinated by the immune system and when he perceived that there was a crossover between his allergies and cancer biology he got obsessed with the idea that immunotherapy was going to be the root but allergies themselves as mundane as they are still can't be addressed in a particularly rigorous or precise way so precision medicine for tree pollen allergies is still beyond the frontiers of current medicine although the work that dr. Nadeau who is the you know the largest sort of recipient of the work that Sean's doing up at Stanford I mean she is amazing and the work that they are doing I mean I've sent multiple patients there carries always very kind and takes my referrals

[02:09:48] I mean I have seen before my own eyes people who once would have died from peanut dust and they can eat peanuts again through this sensitization so it's yeah I sometimes wonder if Sean gets enough credit for the amazing stuff he's done both in terms of funding cancer research but also this incredible Center at Stanford that you know little by little we're seeing you know Mount Sinai is doing this in New York choc was doing it in Philly I mean other centers are still are taking this research forward and I don't know I mean I think for people out there listening to this who have children or who themselves have anaphylactic reactions I am way more optimistic about this than I was four years ago well and this is you know comes back to the earlier point about the futures already here yeah now how do you make that accessible to everybody make it accessible to everybody and and how do things that make sense and have been proven in a sense become standard of care unfortunately in the United

[02:10:44] States and this is and I discovered very slowly it's not as if there's one arbiter of standard of care you've got all these different medical societies that govern physicians in and standards in clinical guidelines in every specialty area they have their conferences and their Board of Directors and the payers sometimes respect their clinical guidelines and the government sometimes respect their clinical guidelines so one of the things that in terms of human systems we should absolutely put more energy into is how once something like dr. Naidu's work is sort of definitive science do we rapidly make sure that it becomes standard for every patient everywhere and right now it has to go through this long cascade of human minds and bureaucratic organizations which is an enormous detriment to patients I mean this is something that has nothing to do with science it just has to do with people and it's the sort of thing that physicians should care much more about as a community it's the sort of thing that people like I think Atul Gawande rightly are always reminding us to think more about you know it's very easy to get drawn into the Science and

[02:12:07] Technology frontiers but we forget that we could make such an enormous impact with just these simple changes in our own behavior yeah I know I could sit here and have this discussion for another two hours but I want to be respectful of your time and you've been super gracious to open up your home this morning where can people learn more about you I know you've got a huge following on Twitter so they can obviously see you there what's your

[02:12:33] Twitter handle it's da Wallach that's da wal la CH and I have a website which is equally simple da Wallach calm and I'm on Instagram also da Wallach I tend not to do that much social media these days but I still occasionally post pictures and I'm very easy to reach to so I presume in your audience there is a mixture of crazy people geniuses and smart nice people who think they're geniuses but are not and I'm particularly interested in meeting the geniuses so right now anyone listening please put yourself in the bucket of crazy genius or smart not genius correct and if you're in bucket - can you reach out to da if you're smart not genius but do have an interesting novel idea that itself could be deemed genius I'm also interested that's great do you still perform not regularly the most recent performance I did was after a dinner party when I was embarrassingly asked to play a song on someone's piano in their living room and got peer pressured into doing it but most of the time I don't perform because I don't have a great way of performing if someone was gonna buy just one piece of music would it be your most recent album what would you recommend I think so I would recommend my most recent album which just came out in October of three years ago yeah yeah called Time Machine

[02:14:08] I thought it was 2016 it came out was it 15 it may have been 16 I'm not good with dates you told us that terrible with dates okay I think it was 2006 I was thinking the other day that it felt like it was a year ago and then when I sort of realized it was three years ago I thought oh I should probably finish some of these songs I've been writing you know because I can't go like a decade between I don't have the Axl Rose credibility to wait that long between albums alright so Time Machine it is which I believe came out in 2016 but I can be wrong of course like a fool I bought all your stuff on iTunes so I overpaid for it I could have just been on Spotify you're not listening to it much I made out like a bandit on that so thank you know I tend to when I listen to music I just listen

[02:14:56] I'm like a big repeater right it drives everyone around see now it's not that OCD focus yeah I could go I can go five songs on repeat for an entire five-hour flight amazing yeah usually Zeppelin right yeah zeppelins good I don't know if I mentioned bottom before you did yeah I wouldn't have let you get this for the conversation if you hadn't at least mentioned John Bonham what's cool about both Bonham and Elvin Jones is that they both play behind the beat they're always kind of catching up with the song and when you play behind the beat it sounds cool I don't know why but just like you can recognize cool if someone dresses cool or is cool playing behind the beat sounds cool I to this day listen to good times bad times at least once every couple of days and I think to myself how is it possible that this was the first song on the first Zeppelin album and

[02:15:49] Bonhams opening riff it's like incredible and I think to myself what would it have been like to have heard that for the first time on vinyl as like a new sound I just I mean I would have worn that record out well and they had a level of mystery to I don't know if you know this but they were never on the album covers pictures of them so people would go to the concert to figure out they looked like yeah so this I do somewhat regret not having been oh yeah

[02:16:21] I've been around in a time where there was that level of magic around who was making some music you heard I mean it must have been even crazier with wax cylinders and stuff like this people famously thought when they heard the phonograph that they needed to pull the curtain back and see the source of the audio there because it sounded so realistic now if you hear a primitive wax cylinder recording it's like shocking that anyone could have thought that was in the room because it's so scratchy and simplified but the magic is happening in people's brains so they just couldn't piece together how that was coming out of the speaker if it wasn't there do you ever listen to vinyl anymore yeah

[02:17:03] I love vinyl vinyl is great vinyl is a peak technology in music reproduction so you get a level of accuracy with digital music that you don't get with vinyl but analog media are pretty cool yeah golly and last question just because we're bringing it back to music if you go back in time and the three or four concerts actual pick the date pick the band pick the venue that you just otherwise wouldn't have been able to have seen because you weren't old enough for whatever what what do you think they'd be well I would have liked to see I saw prints one time and it was the most virtuosic live performance I've ever seen so I might devote two of those concerts to prints or something people say Chuck Berry was pretty awesome live and pretty unhinged

[02:17:52] I bet you know I don't love early rock and roll and I don't love blues but some of those early rock folks you know if you had never seen it before it probably would have been incredibly shocking so I would have liked to see that and watching the documentary on Nina Simone that I saw a few years ago I concluded that she must have been one of the greatest live performers ever she's just a virtuosic live performer so I would have liked to see her it's like one of my favorite games to play in the time machine oh yeah all right BA well thank you so much pleasure was all speeder you can find all of this information and more at
