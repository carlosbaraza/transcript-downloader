Peter welcomes guests David Sabatini & Matt Kaeberlein, two world-leading experts on rapamycin & mTOR. David & Matt begin by telling the fascinating story of the discovery of rapamycin & its brief history as a pharmacological agent in humans. They then unravel the function of mTOR, a central regulator of numerous biological processes, & they discuss the pathways through which rapamycin exerts its potential benefits on lifespan. They touch upon initial studies that suggested rapamycin may have geroprotective effects & the ongoing research that continues to shed light on this unique molecule. Furthermore, they discuss the elusive details surrounding the frequency & dosing of rapamycin use in humans, & Peter emphasizes his reservations about indiscriminately prescribing rapamycin as a longevity drug for patients.

[00:00:00] you know I got very interested in trying to understand what the mechanisms are for how Ramy was affecting the biological aging process we've studied this in yeast and worms and fruit flies and mice a little bit in pet dogs which we may talk about um and I think through all of that the one thing that that has kind of kept me excited about rapy as a potential longevity therapeutic is that it always works and I would say without question it is the most robust and reproducible drug at least from preclinical studies that we know about today for impacting not only longevity but to the extent that we can measure various metrics of

[00:00:40] Health span um in complex animals rap ayon also seems to positively impact pretty much every aspect of Health span that we measure hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music] AA well guys we're going to try something a little different today which is we're going to try to have a three-way discussion which um is something we would easily be doing uh if we were sitting over a meal but always makes for a slightly more challenging podcast that said given uh our familiarity with each other and your familiarity with this topic I am 100% confident this is going to be an amazing episode it's also an episode that is long overdue so you guys are both in the

[00:01:30] Camp of I believe first dozen or so podcasts that were released on the drive uh a little over five years ago and uh Matt you and I have spoken a number of times since David you and I at least on the podcast have not obviously in person all the time so with all that said um many people are going to be new to this topic they will have heard a lot about it they may have even read a chapter about it in my book which you guys were both very gracious to help uh me fact check and edit but here we are we're going to pretend that someone coming into this discussion doesn't really know anything about Rapa doesn't really know what this mtor thing is and I hope that by the end of this discussion we will have provided people with arguably the most comprehensive quasi concise explanation of all you need to know about said topics so with that said I would like to ask each of you to do something I don't often ask my guests to do which is to your own horns a little bit about what it is that allows me to say you are each among the two most knowledgeable people on this topic um let's start with you David you you've worked on this molecule uh Rapa your entire scientific career going back to your

[00:02:52] PhD um and here we are 30 plus years later you're still deleting Authority on it can you just tell us a little bit about about that sure Peter thank you for having us and nice to see you Matt um so no indeed I've worked on rap M my whole life when I was a student with salul Snider John Hopkins I became fascinated with this molecule and frankly I needed a research topic and so

[00:03:14] I tried to figure out how it works and that led to the purification of a protein that we now call amtor which uh Michael Hall had identified a yeast version of this that Matt uh was one of the early workers on this called tour one and since that time we've done a lot of biochemistry try to figure out what this protein does and at the end of the day what we conclude in a kind of big picture point of view is that this is the protein that links the availability of nutrients in our environment to whether we're in a catabolic or an anabolic State anabolism growth catabolism breakdown of material and and I think that accounts for why mtor has so many different roles because if you think about our sort of evolutionary history there's almost nothing in our physiology that shouldn't be controlled by the availability of nutrients It's s a central thing in our lives we we we tend to forget that now because of course we're in a tend to be in an overeating stage and since that time what we've done is figured out a lot of the pieces of this pathway including what we call two complexes protein complexes mtor 1 and mtor 2 and and really the work that I'm the most satisfied with is how it senses nutrients uh and the nutrient sensors themselves which are the the actual proteins that bind The small molecules that tell uh mtor1 in particular that it

[00:04:29] Tex nutrients and so I'm excited to be here and to to delve into some of the implications of this work awesome thanks David Matt um people who are you know listeners of this podcast are going to be maybe a bit more familiar with you because in addition to that very first podcast we did Circa 2018 um you've been back a number of times and we've talked about mtor and rap ay but we've also talked about protein nutrition and things like that but um maybe for folks who are hearing you for the first time today can you give kind of a a similar bio of what it is that allows me to also refer to you as one of the world's absolute leading authorities on this topic sure well um first of all thank you for having me back I'm glad you aren't sick of me yet and uh it's fantastic to be here uh with with David um and I wish I could say that that I was smart like David was and recognized immediately how important mtor would be and Rapa but I um actually started working on mtor in yeast kind of by accident so we were really interested in understanding what are the genetics that control longevity and so we did an unbiased search for new genes that would affect lifespan and happened to find mtor um and when we made that Discovery

[00:05:51] I immediately went and looked up everything I could learn about mtor and found out there's this drug rapy that's an inhibitor of mtor and then we we found that we could also increase lifespan with rapy and at this point we were working in yeast but then it became clear to me because of the work of others that this pathway and this drug uh appeared to affect the biological aging process not only in yeast but also across the animal kingdom um and we now know even in uh mammals like mice and potentially in larger mammals like dogs and people so I think with that knowledge um you know I got very interested in trying to understand what the mechanisms are for how Romy was affecting the biological aging process we've studied this in yeast and worms and fruit flies and mice a little bit in pet dogs which we may talk about um and

[00:06:46] I think through all of that the one thing that that has kind of kept me excited about Ramy as a potential longevity therapeutic is that it always works and I would say without question it is the most robust and reproducible drug at least from pre-clinical studies that we know about today for impacting not only longevity but to the extent that we can measure various metrics of

[00:07:10] Health span um in complex animals rapy also seems to positively impact pretty much every aspect of healthspan that we measure so so I've continued to study it for that reason and I think um probably what I'm maybe best known for these days is pushing forward a a Veterinary clinical trial of rapy to really start to answer the question of you know all the things we've learned about rapy in the context of aging and longevity in the laboratory how much of that will translate into the real world and so we are actually carrying out a Veterinary clinical trial of ramyon in pet dogs right now we've got some preliminary data but it's too early to be able to say you know with any level of confidence that Romy is going to positively impact the aging process in dogs but I think we've already learned a lot about safety and maybe some hints about efficacy so that's pretty exciting and that's something that I um you know quite passionate about about about continuing to push forward and see see where we end up and I guess I should probably um before I make my next comment disclose that I and a number of my patients are funders of a study that we will undoubtedly talk about so we should just I guess declare that as a as a conflict if people want to consider that a conflict uh that uh but but regardless um I think what's really great about having you guys together and tell me if you agree with this assessment is on the Continuum of understanding rap ay and mtor David you know you're closer to what we would call the bench side of things and in many ways Matt I consider you kind of closer to the bedside so people have heard this term bench to bedside I.E translational research and obviously the bedside in this case is is not just the bedside of humans where we aren't quite yet but really the the bedside of more complex mammals so would you guys kind of agree with that assessment that that your skill sets and your knowledge base and your research are very complimentary through that Continuum of bed to bedside I would I would add though that that Matt you know takes the work in a very serious scientific way right and so

[00:09:16] I think in a field where it's very easy to get caught up in boosterism and claims that you see online all the time that that you know are extreme I think Matt has been very careful and and and I think part of what's contributed to the and rap M frankly is that Matt has been careful about this and so he's taken a very scientific approach and and as I've told many people who know me well I pretty much put Matt in one of the most respected categories of Aging researchers for that reason all right so yeah I I I agree with that completely I share guys are embarrassing me come on now uh Peter let me just give a little bit of a a a Twist on what you said I mean I agree with with with what you said uh conceptually I would also say I think you know even though much of my research on mtor and rap ayon has been what people would typically consider pre-clinical or basic research um it is different and I I agree I think the approach that David has taken throughout his career is quite complimentary in many ways to to the approach that I've taken in that you know David has really as you already said been the Pioneer and the leader in really understanding detailed mechanistic aspects of the whole mtor signaling net nwor um and I don't know how much we're going to get into that but I think it's useful for people to appreciate that this is an extremely complex network of biological interactions and there's no question that that David and and his lab and people who have come from his lab have really played the leading role at fleshing out from a very detailed biochemical and mechanistic perspective how that network is working and that has

[00:10:54] I think in many ways laid the foundation for people like me and many others who have then taken that knowledge and tried to start to move it into to maybe more applied contexts and clinical applications I think that's a that's a beautiful way to describe it and I also want to Echo something that David just said which is I I and again not to embarrass you Matt but I do think that the field owes a lot of its credibility to the way you have approached it with the sort of scientific rigor being the highest priority as opposed to the commercialization not being front and center and I do think that there are a lot of other um molecules that maybe we don't have to get into today where there is some interesting science behind it but it seems to have almost been corrupted by uh a commercialization route and the the corruption of that has meant a we may never know if these things work or don't work but more than anything else they're very difficult to take seriously and and I'm I'm actually and I think everybody should be be very grateful for for the way the field is gone so before we dive into it and I know this is a story that's been told before on this podcast and and I I probably even write about it in um in the chapter of my book I I do think that the discovery of rap ay is the place to begin this because you know there's a very unique uh uh phenomenon here which is the drug was discovered before the

[00:12:25] Target and the target is named after the drug in response to that so David you and I got to visit this very special place where the bacteria that ultimately produced this drug was discovered we we certainly have plans to go back it's on our it's on our list of things to do in the next few years and we shall um do you want to give folks the the story of of how this this this molecule rap Amis came to be sure sure and I I hope uh I hope we'll go back soon and I hope Matt will come as well he certainly will anyone who cares about for the record I did try to get this recording done on rapanui so I just want to put that out there we we'll be do we'll be doing another one there for sure well as as you know Peter there there were and are attempts by pharmaceutical companies to collect soil samples and other biological containing samples throughout the world and and there WTH aist did come into possession of a soil samper from Easter Island otherwise known as rapanui in the in the

[00:13:22] South Pacific at one point claimed to be the most remote island in the world I think it's it's actually technically not but very far from anything and in that soil sample actually in Canada people eventually isolated bacteria from it bacteria called streptomyces hopus and from that bacteria Romy was eventually isolated and in deference to rapanui was named Romy now ironically it turns out when people have looked for Romy and and other bacteria throughout the world in fact even the same bacterior it actually has been found in many other places but it did come originally from Rapa um and and like was done at the time these molecules that these these bacterial products what you you really would call an antibiotic it did come from bacteria uh were tested you know in many different assays and I actually think and Matt may may may correct me I think some of the earlier assays were actually immunological assays even before some of the antifungal assays uh and and that eventually led many decades after to pursuing it as an immunosuppressant but in the meantime it was also found to have antifungal agent activity and that's where some of the genetics are rap mice and some of the targets uh were first identified because of the ease of genetics um so this is a story that began I think the original so samples may have even been in the 60s yeah I think it was 66 or 67 soil samples and then S I don't think really got around to digging into it until 71 or 72 exactly and and then he championed it in fact you know one of my most valued possessions that when I started working on rap meon we we we didn't have much and and Saul Snider my adviser wrote saren and asked for some and he sent us many grams which I later calculated had a street value of many hundreds of thousands of dollars if it had uh if one could sell it like that and and a really nice note wishing me luck and the entire bibliography of rap at that time which consisted of his papers and a couple of abstracts so was a little thin book at the time and he is the one who championed it and eventually it took the clinical path took way too long and I think that even impacted Ed some of its utility because the patents expired I think before uh you know you could really sort of capture some of the value of it so we're talking about something now that's in the 50-year range plus right and I think a question that we could ask ourselves and I think we will is Rap a As Good As It Gets right there obviously are derivatives of rap but even in this pathway which as Matt says exceedingly complicated are there other targets that we should be pursuing that may actually have equal or better impacts on the aging process so I think you know something David said there we may again also touch on which is the the clinical path not only took too long but

[00:16:07] I think you can make an argument that the clinical path has actually maybe negatively impacted the development of rapamycin and other mtor inhibitors for other uses because it was developed clinically as an organ transplant immunosuppressant and that's how it was first approved it was used in a dosing protocol and a patient context where there are lots of side effects and I think we are still learning what the side effect profile actually looks like for rapy at lower doses in patients who are not imuno compromised and haven't had an organ transplant so so I do wonder whether the history of Romy and the rapidity at which it it is it will be eventually tested for other endpoints in clinical trials where it may have benefits has been negatively impacted and slowed down because of the the reputation that the drug got As A

[00:17:05] Dangerous Drug um based on the way it was developed clinically so I think that's an important piece of the puzzle here to think about yeah just to give some numbers to it right the first paper that seren seal put out there describing the chemical composition of rap ay if I'm not mistaken was about 1971 1972 the FDA approval for Ramy in humans was 1999 just to give you a sense of what you're both talking about here in terms of an enormous gap of time between you know when you sort of make a a chemical

[00:17:40] Discovery file an IND and work all your way through second point I'd make is uh you know as a as a as a former surgical resident who so so you know I was in my surgical residency taking care of transplant patients when Romy was in full use now again it's interesting David another drug that the whole reason you got involved in Rapa was because of fk506 which was uh another cousin of

[00:18:09] Rapa um that if I recall the whole reason your lab was using Raa was as a control that didn't have sort of the calciner properties of fk506 but that's sort of an interesting footnote um but we were giving Romy out constantly and to your point Matt it was a drug that was typically given 2 to 3 milligrams a day every single day but with three other drugs right you were also getting prednizone cellep MMF you were getting very very toxic drugs because you needed to completely shut down the cellular immune system of a patient who had just received a foreign organ and I think that speaks to this point right which is for you know the better part of a decade 1999 to 2009 the only experience that the scientific world has with this is in that cont text and yeah you're going to see a lot of side effects but how do you know they're from rap ay I mean and how do you know that they would be the same elsewhere so so what what happened in in 2009 that kind of changed this and and

[00:19:14] David I'm most interested I think in hearing this from you because by this point you've already established your own laboratory you're working on rapy and you're working on mtor probably more so than anything else and trying to understand the nutrient sensing Pathways around it but how aware were you of the

[00:19:32] ITP the interventions testing program in that first in the buildup to that first study in 2009 you know I was not very aware of it I have to say but I I do have to say that um once we started making that connection of rap aise into nutrients right which which many groups did uh if you actually look at the history of it and and it was already appreciated for many many decades before that things like caloric restriction had an impact on lifespan right and so the idea that rapy could have an impact on lifespan was one we actually thought of and we actually this just tells you how science works we actually tried dosing celegans worms with rapy naively not realizing that their cuticle would not allow rapis on the way that we were giving it to uh to have an impact um and so we we had found no impact and and then there were genetics that came out and and worms and and Matts work and so and a lot of other people really pioneered the Aging space not us uh at all but I remember when that paper came out right I think it was a nature paper that came out reporting rapid as one of the the bigger hits in in in the ITP study and I think what happened there is it and I think Matt said this before it it connected you know his work in East and work in other organisms with a mammal right and and that that now seems we just take that for granted right because as Matt said it it it does impact all those T those different animals and and Singler cell organisms but the idea that we had a molecule that span from a yeast to a mouse was dramatic that was like a huge huge impact again we take it for granted now right I'd like you to say more on that both of you because I I do think that the evolutionary Gap from yeast to flies worms mammals is a billion years are there any other molecules that have have done what you just said

[00:21:24] David I don't know if there there are but but certainly dietary restriction yes in one form or another and that did link all those organisms and and as far as I know was all done before rapis before the discovery of Tor so there was this Universal intervention I think even in bacteria people have shown impacts on you know a replicative uh lifespan so that I think was considered this

[00:21:49] Universal connector and that's why when the nutrient connection came out I think we and others started thinking along the lines of rapy as a mimetic and potentially having this impact so um so I don't know Peter whether there are specific molecules that do that I would i' probably I'm not aware of any I mean yeah I'm not I'm not asking the question rhetorically but I'm

[00:22:09] I agree with you that outside of caloric restriction um which by the way doesn't universally extend life there are models where and and certainly times at which that can be administered when it is not uh a life extending uh strategy but but yes I mean Ramy in that sense stands alone as unless Matt you can think of a counter example that I'm missing yeah

[00:22:31] I'm I'm going to try to respectfully tell you guys that you're wrong okay so so here's what I would say Romy for a small molecule is probably the only pharmacological intervention that has been uh reproducibly shown to robustly increase lifespan and health span across that broad evolutionary Spectrum there are other things out there like Alpha ketoglutarate where there are reports in yeast and worms and flies and mice of lifespan extension it just hasn't been tested or reproduced as much but on the genetic side and this is where I I wanted to just add a little bit of additional context to what David was saying which is that with rapamycin it's not only the drug but we also have genetic inhibition of mtor in each of those model systems that recapitulates the longevity and health span benefits so it's a rock solid airtight case for mtor and long vity but also on the genetic side this is a study that that we did with Brian Kennedy and Daniel promislo this probably 2007 where we asked the question if we looked at all of the genes at that time that were known to affect lifespan in yeast and all of the genes that were known to affect lifespan in worms and we simply looked at orthologues meaning the same gene in each organism how often is genetic control of longevity shared and it turns out it's pretty often so there is a relatively High degree of evolutionary conservation at the level of genetic control of longevity across a broad evolutionary distance and that's really been the whole thesis of my career right is trying to understand those evolutionarily shared mechanisms of of longevity so I just think it's important for me I guess to to to say that because there's a lot of confusion now in the field there have been a lot of new people come into the longevity field who for whatever reason aren't familiar with with a lot of this um history and so they ask questions like well how do we know that you can use worms to understand anything about aging in a mammal and I'm like because we already know that the genetics of longevity are conserved not everything's going to be conserved but it has been statistically shown that there is a conservation of the biology of aging and that's kind of fundamentally important to how we think about studying the biology of Aging in the laboratory and then potentially translating those discoveries um into the real world so again sorry for the tent but I do think this is an important more fundamental biology of Aging point that um that's useful to just reemphasize because a lot of people have lost track of that so so I I completely agree Matt and and when I just saw Peter and Austin and he took me on a rucking uh Trek in 104 degree heat we exactly talked about this topic and and my point was that sort of biochemical cell biological processes that are conserved amongst all these these organisms are going to be the ones that are going to impact aging and in fact I tend to dismiss those processes which are are are less concerned as potentially causing impacting the aging process I 100% agree to you that whatever is the fundamental issue that happens in cells that leads to aging is going to be conserved and therefore The Regulators of that process or the impactors of that process will be conserved I want to come back to this point because I yeah we had an amazing if we had been able to record that Ruck session if you could eliminate all the huffing and puffing uh it would have been a great podcast in and of itself and we're going to come back and talk about some of those things this is actually a great step off to make a point that what we are talking about here is the broad term of gero protection and I always kind of differentiate this when I'm talking to my patients I say there are certain strategies that we take to extend your lifespan and improve your health span that are very diseased specific so for example the attenuation of APO lipoprotein B is undoubtedly going to lengthen your life if implemented for a long enough period of time and by extension I would argue improve the quality of your life um but it's doing so through two disease processes it's doing it through a reduction of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and cerebral vascular disease but also through all lines of dementia but it's not attacking a fundamental pillar of Aging right it's a very disease specific hack for lack of a better word and by the way it certainly wouldn't be applied to organisms Beyond ourselves right very few organisms have apob I.E very few organisms succumb to ascvd so you know that doesn't mean that we shouldn't look at disease specific tools to modulate lifespan and health span but what we're talking about here is so much more fundamental and um I will not put either of you guys on the spot and ask you if you can recite the nine Hallmarks of Aging Matt and I tried that on our last podcast and got eight of them you do this like name that tune right how many Hallmarks of Aging can you right right but but but there are nine of these Hallmarks of aging and and there's there's actually 12 now right with the new and improved version oh there is my God I'm so dated um okay so let's now um dive into mtor a little bit unless back that

[00:28:04] Mouse study yeah just just back to the ITP yeah sure yeah because there's another part of that study so just just for a little bit of context I'm not sure this ever got said explicitly but this was a study from the Nia interventions testing program published in 2009 it was the first study to show that rap ay treatment in a mouse could extend lifespan and and that was important but

[00:28:25] I think the other maybe more important part of that study that often doesn't get always talked about is that this was the first time that any intervention You could argue a little bit about caloric restriction that's a that's kind of a tangent but I would say it's the first time that any intervention was convincingly shown to extend lifespan when treatment was started in middle age so about the mouse equivalent of a 60 65y old person biologically and that again as David said about uh rap ay we kind of take it for granted today that that's possible but in 2009 I don't think anybody expected that experiment to work it was actually an accident that they ended up doing the experiment that way and it had to do with the fact that they couldn't formulate the rap ay in the mouse Chow in a way that was stable until the mice were already about 12 months old so treatment started I think in that case it was 20 months of age when they finally started the treatment so so it was a happy accident but in my view I I've said this before I think this is one of the most important studies in the field in the past 20 years maybe 50 years for that reason that it sort of opened up what we now consider to be routine which is that you can actually have an impact on longevity and some at least some metrics of Health span when you start treatment in middle age and as we have started as a field to think about translational application that becomes hugely important because suddenly we're talking about treating middle-aged dogs or middle-aged people as opposed to trying to treat puppies and teenagers and that's just much more atic and practical from from the perspective of actually being able to implement especially when you consider what David said at the outset right which is mtor is the master regulator of how nutrients trickle into the system are you going to be in an anabolic state or are you going to be in a catabolic

[00:30:14] State well you know Matt you'll be pleased to know we just got a puppy recently so we've got this adorable little three-month-old puppy and I don't think it would make sense to necessarily inhibit mtor in an animal that is purely about anabolism right now it's trying to grow and it would be suboptimal if we had a therapy that we believed could only work if administered early in life and and yes you you're you're you're telling of that story is remarkable and

[00:30:45] I think also speaks to the Serendipity that often lies uh in in scientific discovery it's often an accident or something going wrong that leads to that because you're right I don't think and I've talked about this think with Rich Miller nobody would have ever they were contemplating sacking the whole study because they couldn't get the Rapa formulated it is a fascinating question though why that when the starting point of delivery of rap does have an impact on the life extension and the health span extension and what what the what the biological basis of that is something that at least I don't have a great conceptualization of that and and and and I'm sure Matt has thought about this much more but but it it's interesting to think about how one one designs experiments to try to ask that question is it another is it safe to say we don't know when the ideal time to implement would be I think it depends a little bit on what you mean by ideal right so this now gets into risk reward and side effects versus benefits in mice we absolutely don't know in terms of lifespan if we take that as the sort of primary metric that we're interested in we don't know when is optimal to initiate treatment or what dosing protocol is optimal so there still has not been a full what I would call even dose response profile of rap ayon across a single intervention time

[00:32:10] Point initiating time point so so the answer is the answer is no and and and honestly I think we probably never will simply because you know the cost of doing those experiments and all the permutations that you could come up with for time that you initiate and and different doses to test uh I just don't think anybody would ever fund that study and again you know now again we're getting off on a tangent but it's probably worth just uh mentioning that you know going back to the starting and middle age this is where I actually have some real concerns with the way we fund biomedical research in general uh if if somebody went to the NIH before this study had been completed and said we want to start an experiment with Rapa meon starting at 20 months of age in mice that Grant never would have gotten funded because people would say that'll never work work right and so this is where I think you know again it was very fortunate in this case that it happened the way that that it did but we I would argue as a research Enterprise should develop an appetite for higher risk higher reward projects and I don't think anybody's going to disagree with that but I think this is a nice case in point of a an important discovery that changed a field that would not have been made if not for just the fortuitous circumstances that that happened yeah I think that's I think that's completely fair I would challenge you on one thing though Matt I can't think of a better type of research to fund for relatively low dollars than the types of questions that you're asking in other words I agree that there are a lot of permutations and I agree that we're talking about tens of millions of dollars but when you consider what's at stake I.E what we could learn I guess for The Listener it's worth explaining something we're going to come back and talk about this and we're going to talk about intermittent dosing but these ITP studies are dosing rapamycin every day it's mixed into the Chow so the mice are constantly nibbling on a low dose of rapamycin and what we're going to go on to talk about as we start to extrapolate into for example companion dogs and ultimately humans um is a dosing regimen that looks completely different well for starters I sure as heck would like to see what that looks like in the mice of the ITP I'd also like to see some of these different permutations around the different not just doses but starting points and again if it cost 10 million to do that study I gotta I I got to tell you I think we could raise that money um didn't it didn't take too long to raise half that money uh to to to do you know the dog aging project so I I think there would be a real appetite to do that kind of work because the implications are enormous yeah I I I agree with you I think uh the NIH might not fund it which is probably what you meant no that's right I think also and we may get into this as well there are a bunch of those kinds of fundamental questions that I would argue are relatively lwh hanging fruit that that and then we would have to think about prioritizing right so we made I think we're going to talk a little bit about rapalogs or other classes of mtor Inhibitors the other classes of mtor Inhibitors there was just recently the first study that I know of that tested a uh ATP competitive mtor inhibitor in mice and it's intriguing I would say early data but we really have no clue as far as I can tell how other classes of mtor

[00:35:37] Inhibitors would perform relative to rap ayon that's another super important question that again for frustrating reasons has been very hard to get those kinds of studies funded and I can just tell you from my own experience I have put in Grants to study dose response of rapy different uh uh inter uh intervals of rapy Tes and other classes of mtor Inhibitors and they have been uniformly rejected because by and large NIH study sections just aren't interested in doing those kinds of uh funding those kinds of studies they're not considered at least in my view they're not considered mechanistic enough um so I I'm I agree completely with you but I think those kinds of studies will not be funded in the current uh structure for research funding even though they're super important yeah so so so David let's now start to talk about the how so um I think it's worth doing this in a little bit of detail um and I know that this might the next few minutes might be among the most technically um perhaps challenging for for a lay person to understand but I think it is important to have some understanding of the biochemistry of what this molecule does and what this protein complex looks like and what the Cascade of events are that that move on and and I think it's also important to understand how nutrients work right so we're going to talk a lot about amino acids and probably in particular Lucine um so in in any order that you feel it makes sense to to walk us through that David explain how this molecule mour which sits at the epicenter of our existence as living entities on this planet how does it do its job sure happy to talk about this you know and I think the one thing to for the listeners to understand is that rapy is is quite unique and in another aspect that we haven't talked about but also was very exciting at the time right rapy unlike most drugs right most drugs go and find their protein Target and do something usually inhibit that Target rapy gets in the cell binds to a little protein fkbp what it does to fkbp frankly doesn't seem to matter at all but instead hijacks that protein and now takes it and makes it bind to mtor it basically uses it as this thing that it draws next to mtor and that moving of fkbp to mtor is actually critical for how rap acts and as as people like

[00:38:22] Stuart shriber have pioneered it's it's really a molecular glue it connects mtor and FK p and that interaction is absolutely critical um so how does uh mtor work so you know when when we first and others found mtor it was this big protein uh it looked like a cyas that is it's a protein that puts phosphates onto other proteins uh but yet what it did what its targets were were completely unclear and I think as we were talking in the pression Matt pointed out it's incredibly complicated it probably acts on hundreds of other proteins now now in general what are those other proteins they're either proteins that make the cell build things this anabolism side or break it down and on the breaking down side as you and I Peter have discussed

[00:39:10] I'm sure mtre it's autophagy right the the selfing and destruction of parts of the cell sometimes aged parts of the cell sometimes parts that are damaged for other reasons that seems to be absolutely critical on the on the catabolic uh side and the way mtor works and and you know for a long time we had mtor we couldn't really get it to phosphorate anything in a test tube it just didn't work it seemed like a terrible kise that is its enzymatic activity was so puny we even thought maybe it's not really a chinise it really was like a a moribund protein and and the critical breakthrough was the idea at some point that mtor must work by being bound to other proteins now again this seems like obvious right like everyone talks about the tour complex but at the time it wasn't and the reason was that of course we and others had looked we'd said okay isolate mtor does it have friends and the answer was no it has no friends but what we came to realize and this goes back to sort of serendipity it turns out the detergents right so when you have a Mamon cell that's surrounded by a lipid sort of a fatty membrane you have to break that to do biochemistry it turns out the detergent we were using which was the most commonly used detergent to break cells for simply bad luck reasons broke apart the mtor complexes you could never predict this and why it does it we don't know and when we moveed to other detergents use things to stabilize it we then found these Tor complexes all right and and the first breakthrough for us was the Discover of a protein that that got this name Raptor um which at the time people didn't like this name but now is is a well studied protein and as

[00:40:52] Matt alluded there's actually genetics on Raptor that connect it to to lifespan in the aging process and so that defined what we now call torque 1 or M torque 1 another protein that we named RoR defines what we call M torque 2 I'm sure we'll talk about mtor 2 at the time and so we started building out that complex and now when you had that thing in a test tube it did stuff like it could show serious activity that you could measure it could do serious phosphorilation the known substrates like S6 kyes that before we couldn't phosphor S6 KY to save our life inside a test tube now all of a sudden you really could so it really opened up the door and then that connected mtor one to all the other things that in in sort of a biological lingo we call

[00:41:39] Upstream right all the proteins that communicate to mtor brings signals to it are Upstream of it the things mtor acts on are Downstream of it and we've actually done very little Downstream I would say we really focused on the upstream and uh I would say the next big conceptual breakthrough for us came when we looked inside of cells and saw that mtor was in a particular place and this is a an organal called the lome um the lome is sort of the recycling center this is where a cell takes things and breaks them down and releases nutrients and so it turned out that mtor lived at this very interesting interface where the cell produces its own nutrients by breaking down things and also where the nutrients are coming in from the outside so at that uh that intersection and we went on then to find lots of the pieces that allow that nutrient senting and I'm sure we'll get into amino acids and other nutrients afterwards David if I can interrupt for a sec approximately how many mtor complexes exist in a typical cell and let's talk about maybe what the typical cells are what's the distribution of mtor concentration across different cells in the body things things like that yeah in terms of just a good question in terms of numbers we're talking certainly thousands of of complexes existence it's not it's not an amazingly rare protein right it's not incredibly abundant at all you know it's probably in the 100 to a thousandfold less than some of the most abundant proteins in the cell um but not their proteins are much much less abundant than that um and it's distributed actually quite evenly between mtor 1 and two at least in the cells that that we have looked uh in uh in in culture when you look across tissues in in a mouse or a rat it's actually pretty even across tissues as as as well and so to some extent that puts it in the what sometimes pejoratively is called the housekeeping protein right um now those turn unting right exactly some of the most important proteins in the cell so what what we have found now and I think others would agree is that regulation of mtor levels itself is is doesn't happen that much it does but it's not the critical regulatory input it's all the

[00:43:59] Upstream stuff and the regulation of that that really is where the pathway gets fine-tuned in different cells to different inputs and where I think we we have to start thinking about also for new modalities to uh to Target emor so we we'll park this idea of tissue specificity down the line but if I'm hearing you correctly even though I don't know that people have sampled the

[00:44:22] CNS of humans based on what we know from mice and Road and of you know rats and things like that we have reason to believe that you would have comparable mtor concentrations within CNS tissue peripheral tissue probably everything I'm guessing virtually everything except a red blood cell or maybe even a red blood cell do we know if it's in the RBC as well there actually is some in RBC which has been very confounding to us because rbc's don't have things like

[00:44:51] Li there's even sign in platelets um or mitochondria I've actually always wanted to go and look rbcs for this uh for this reason as far as we can tell every cell has some mtor and mtor one in it and I would argue and I'm not sure if I'm 100% correct in this I would argue that in almost every cell M torque one is a very critical protein for the health of that cell right and Matt alluded to a study I guess where some where people have used now catalytic Inhibitors right and we need to distinguish that what Ramy does people call it an alisic inhibitor it binds to mtor but it doesn't bind in the heart of Emptor right if the heart is where it does its phosphorilation reaction that's sort of like the central node of it it doesn't bind there it actually binds close and what it does it prevents certain substrates from getting to that kyese domain it kind of sterically blocks them from getting there uh so so it doesn't fully inhibit all the activities of even mtor one so let's give people an analogy David so if the if the place where so for example in this case if the amino acid is like a baseball that's supposed to bind in the right inside the glove

[00:46:05] Romy by blocking that doesn't sit itself right in the heart of the glove it maybe binds outside the glove and closes the glove it shapes it changes the shape of the glove so that the intended target doesn't is that a good analogy it is now now the thing that binds in the glove here is ATP which is the phosphate donor and then the substrate let's say6 kind but you're you're exactly right right those things are ATP can get in there no problem it's small it can easily get there but what happens is basically it's almost like the entrance to a cave and now you put a boulder in the entrance of that cave but you haven't fully blocked that entrance

[00:46:43] So simplistically speaking some small things get in there some smaller substrates can get in there but some bigger ones can't and there's also of course like as you alluded to shape changes and stuff but the simplest way to think about it it's a steric block of say some things but not others perhaps also worth just REM mentioning that this is the m torque one cave right which is again different from the other classes of Inhibitors which are going to affect mtor in both mtor complex one and mtor complex 2 exactly right and and and Matt you said that there's been a study now on lifespan or or or or at least aging

[00:47:17] RIT large with catalig Inhibitors this is actually something I've always wanted to do because they're extraordinarily toxic molecules when dosed at higher levels so I'll be curious I I've not seen this uh but you're right the catalic Inhibitors basically annihilate the activity of mtor 1 and Mt 2 if used at the right dose rapy partially inhibits mtor 1 and over time can also partially inhibit mtor 2 so they're very dramatically different how they act can you say a bit more about that latter point it's a very subtle point but it's going to come up again when we talk about the difference between continual dosing and intermittent dosing what is it about the kinetics of ramy's inhibition of mtor complex one that will eventually but not immediately lead to the inhibition of mtor complex 2 sure so so uh before I I'll say that M torque one it's canonical substrate is

[00:48:14] S6 kinas so every biologist looks at S6 kyes phosphorilation as an indicator of mtor 1 activity the canonical substrate for mtor 2 is a protein called akt everyone looks at akt phosphorilation as a canonical output and so I had this post talk one of the more colorful people I had a guy from Kazakhstan actually do sasov who had discovered RoR and the akt Foster relation one day he comes in my office he's like David rap a m inhibits mtk 2 and I was like dos that is impossible because we had tried to show that this fkbp rap me would bind to

[00:48:52] Mt 2 and it wouldn't bind it would bind fine to Mt 1 but it wouldn't bind to 2 he comes he shows me data he's like look if I use rap for a long period of time I inhibit akt and I also break apart mtor 2 and I didn't believe him frankly at all what year was this D wow um this would have been you know early 2000s and somewhere in that range right I'd have to look back may maybe 2003 2004 in that range I think we published the paper maybe in 200000 five okay um but this is one of those cases which I'm sure Matt has experienced many times too where the trainee really is driving the story and has and convinces you of what turns out to be a pretty important Discovery but I didn't believe and so and so the reason was why did this happen right because you could take mtor 2 you could put fkbp rap mice and ion it and mtor 2 with phosphor KT no problem it didn't care totally fine you do the same experiment with M torque 1 and S6 kise and now you could really inhibit S6 kyes phosphorilation so what we came to realize though and to some extent it's it's obvious is that of course mtor 2 is not born as mtor 2 it's born as mtor and RoR and they have to find each other right but what happens is that fkbp Romy can bind to mtor what we called naked mtor it can bind to it and when it's bound it turns out that

[00:50:26] RoR can't bind so you can't make Mt 2 and so what happens then Peter is that when you incubate a cell and a mouse over prolonged periods of time of rapy you basically all your mtor acquire an fkbp rapid therefore you can't form a RoR complex right and so the way that we're preventing mtor to formation and therefore mtor to inhibition is dramat is completely different that how it impacts mtor 1 it's basically preventing the biogenesis the formation of mtor 2 so you need these two proteins mtor and

[00:51:04] RoR to come together basically fkp rapm is preventing that interaction and the way people are getting around this which I think we're going to discuss is by is by understanding that at a better biophysical level which we now do have that understanding so Matt given what David just said does it surprise you that the ITP study and many of the studies that have looked at constitutive dosing of rapamycin have still managed to find a longevity benefit no it doesn't surprise me but I think I think the reason it doesn't surprise me is in in part I think we need to again recognize that this network is extremely complicated so the model that that David laid out I think is kind of our best guess for how this is working and I agree everything he said is correct from a biochemical perspective what the impact is on the overall network of transient rapy treatment at a given dose versus chronic rapy treatment at the same dose or a different dose is much harder to to really understand in a in a detailed way so part of the reason why I'm not surprised is be is is because we kind of already knew all the longevity outcomes before we understood this biochemical mechanism right and so now we're trying to work backwards and say how do we explain the fact that rapy can increase lifespan in a bunch of Health span metrics given that the way it was dosed in the mice should have also impaired mtor complex 2 and built into that is the assumption that the reason rapy is extending lifespan and affecting healthspan metrics is purely because of the M torque one inhibition and I would say that piece we don't completely know the best evidence for the idea that that the benefits of Ramy and come from mtor 1 inhibition is the genetic data which we've sort of alluded to in yeast and worms and flies and mice where you can mutate proteins or genes that code for proteins in mtor complex one and see lifespan and health span benefits but that's incomplete so I guess it's all to say that I think and and this is you know dissatisfying to me and probably everybody else out there but I think it's true that we still don't fully understand the mechanisms by which mtor inhibition and rapy can impact the biology of aging and therefore we're working with incomplete models and I and

[00:53:36] I'm not convinced at this point that the idea that that all of the benefits are due to M torque 1 inhibition and all of the side effects are due to mtor 2 inhibition I'm not sure how how accurate that model is it's a model that still needs to be studied so Peter can I can I add something so I completely agree with

[00:53:54] Matt I I think that last statement is is 100% true I I don't I think we almost have no evidence that to to make that decision one way or another but I think the reason if mtor 2 is its inhibition is toxic which we have published papers arguing it is the reason that I think it's actually quite tolerated is because you know in general this the amounts of of rapy used in the longevity studies are relatively modest um they probably still are somewhat intermittent even though a mouse is eating them right because of course it doesn't eat all the time unlike what we were doing experimentally where we were dosing rap

[00:54:29] M very high keeping it above you know a certain level and certainly in tissue culture it's 247 and you can imagine that once an mtor finds aor it's immune to rap M now so so as soon as one of those guys interact you're going to have an M torque 2 and you need very little M torque 2 to keep akt happy we we found that early on you only need probably 10 to 15% at least in cells and culture to keep akt happy so there's going to be escapers as soon as rap me goes below a certain amount there'll be escapers and you'll make an M torque too so I I I do think we have to ask how relevant that activity is to the potentially beneficient effects of rapy and you know and a lot of the drive to find rapy that don't do that comes from my work right and so to some extent um I am saying hey look is that oversold I think that is a potential you know argument to make and and Matt alluded to there there is I would almost argue there's no perfect experiment to answer this question because Amor is shared you almost can't answer this this almost a philosophical issue one thing I want to add I think this say David kind of said this but I think it's really important for people to appreciate because sometimes we get into the the routine of talking about mtor and mtor one and mtor 2 as if they were onoff switches but they're not they're kind of like you can think of them as knobs right and so what

[00:55:55] David said about you need a lot of M torque 2 activity to survive and and the same thing is probably true for M torque 1 but rapy is kind of turning down M torque one immediately a lot and that's going to depend on the dose of rapamycin that we give and then over time turning down the M torque 2 knot but it's not going to zero and so again it's important that people appreciate that it's not an onoff and that's part of what makes it really hard to do the the definitive experiment that David was saying we can't really do given the tools we have because it's so complicated and the tools we've got are not clean in that context even though they're very biochemically clean and there's tremendous feedbacks

[00:56:36] Matt right that fight all of that right the system always is trying to get to homeostasis and so so David talk a little bit about um discoveries that were made in your lab about what the amino acids were doing to mtor because those actually are things that were learned much later than the initial discoveries you made around the interaction between rapid and mtor so so what do we know in particular about

[00:57:01] Branch chain amino acids uh or Lucine in particular sure so so this also has a little bit interesting backstory so when I first identified mtor in salul Snider's lab I talked to my dad who is a cell biologist and uh and he said David you have to localize mtor within the cell and I kind of to be honest with you

[00:57:21] I kind of dismissed that in maybe a little bit an arrogant way because I was like look I'm a mole biologist biochemist cell biology is kind of an old thing but we did actually make an antibody to mtor you know at the time we used to make them ourselves and rabbits we had some we purified and I added it to cells and it gave this very interesting punctate pattern inside the cell and I remember walking around the cell biology department at John's

[00:57:44] Hopkins Medical School asking people what is this right and I didn't get any definitive answer then the rabbit died the antibody was lost and literally for about that would have been in 93 or something literally until probably 10 15 years later we did not revisit this question and it was Tim Peterson in my lab who did and when he did do this and he did it in a definitive way the answer was lomes as I as I mentioned sorry just to make sure just to make sure we understand David you're saying when you did the original experiments with the antibodies and they lit up and you're walking around showing them to people saying what would light up in this pattern it wasn't clear what the answer was in other words it wasn't clear where mtor was yeah I think you know people didn't they saw dots inside the cell now it was clear that there was the little vesicles and I and I think I probably you know if I had sat down this was like literally walking around the hallway right so maybe if I had sat down with more experts and and and really showed them more experiments that we we would have gotten a more definitive answer but that didn't work and then you know you go on and again literally the rabbit died the antibody disappeared and and there was I would say no good antibody to do this experiment for the next 15 years and this guy Tim got one and he showed that again we saw the same punct tape pattern that I had seen as a student you know 15 years earlier um but he then went on to figure out what it was and they were these things called lomes again these sort of recycling centers they're they're these are compartments in the cell that have a membrane things get in them and there's about 60 enzymes in that compartment that can basically annihilate anything break it down into single components like for for example proteins amino acids come out Polymers of sugars individual sugars come out and and that was fine but the critical experiment and the one that really changed everything for us is then Tim did a simple experiment he said well let me remove amino acids and look where mtor is and it turned out it wasn't on lomes anymore it went off the lome then he added amino acids and he had even little movies within minutes it went back to the lomes and so what that told us is that nutrients communicated to mtor and one of the things they did was move mtor to the surface of the lome and then we went on and we found the docking station so it turns out you can think of mtor as like this big ship and there's sort of this docking like a pier and when it gets there it sits on top of these proteins that hold it there and it turns out that those proteins are the ones that nutrients talk to and there's an entire set of proteins about

[01:00:25] I think I count to there's about 20 proteins involved in making that communication to drive mtor to the surface of the lome and and we could go into the details of this but it's it's probably a little bit uh too much but there's multiple large protein complexes that do that communication and and what

[01:00:45] I think that indicates and I've said this in talks you know it could have been simple right there could have been one protein binds an amino acid talks to EMP but it's not there's a lot of sort of protein real estate used to do this which tells you the cell cares about this so the question becomes which amino acids and and I have to say that that really that that was broken open not by us but by Joe avick he had a paper in JB

[01:01:09] JBC where he looked at amino acid regulation of mtor this was this is before the lomes he was looking at the activity of using S6 kyes and he basically found a couple amino acids that mattered he found Lucine you know a very common essential Branch chain amino acid an important component of of whey protein for example that people take Arginine a very basic amino acid technically not essential lots of nitrogen in in that amino acid and those were the two big ones that that he found now since then we have found others and and to us the Holy

[01:01:46] Grail was how is Lucine detected that was the thing we wanted to know literally for decades and the reason was is that there's a lot of literature in mice in humans in big animals um you know used in farms that Lucine does cool stuff like boost satiety you know feeling of of having fed boost muscle mass and eventually we found it we found the receptor for Lucine it's a protein called sestrin and and and for me you know you have in your scientific career

[01:02:19] I think you only have a couple of moments where you're kind of moved cuz you see something then you've been hunting it for a long time and you see it and for us was the crystal structure of Lucine Bound in uh in sestrin where you're like okay like this is how nature does it right so from eating a steak to now detecting the Lucine in that steak there it is it's nestled in there and then you could sort of imagine how it uh goes on to talk to mtor um and so um this was so for this was this Bobby that led this work so yeah so so Rachel wolson and Lyn chantranupong they had discovered sestrin as the sensor for

[01:02:59] Lucine and they could show that genetically biochemically and then Bobby Saxton working with us and Thomas Schwarz he then did the crystal structure of uh of of Lucine bound and and what was beautiful about that structure was it immediately said it's got to be Lucine which we had kind of we and others had shown already right you could you could try isol Lucine but it didn't work um and so you could see it nestled in there and you could see all the parts of sestrin that said it's got to be Lucine the sobering part was it's a small little pocket Lucine is a small molecule very small molecule and so it's not clear how you can mimic right the the immediate idea was hey can we mimic the anabolic effects of Lucine without taking Lucine can we make something better than Lucine and and we've managed to make things slightly better but nothing dramatically better and the structure tells you why because it's it basically is made to fit Lucine and nothing else how long does Lucine stay in that pocket you know we don't know Peter but it's an interesting question because the pocket there's a little pocket and

[01:04:03] Lucine binds and then there's a lid that falls on top so it literally closes it the evidence suggests that getting Lucine in is easy getting loosing out is not easy and that there actually may be an active way of getting loosing out that lid has some very interesting sort of sequences in it that suggest that it might be phosphorated to sort of pop it open so we don't have an answer to that question but but I think you hit upon something that suggests that this is not so you know it's not the Lucine is popping in and out it pops in but probably getting out requires an active step so Matt what does what how how do we reconcile two things that seem a little bit at odds here on the one hand we've just established that mtor is the most important sensor we have not just for nutrients but perhaps more importantly the most critical nutrients of them all which are amino acids we also understand that sarcopenia is an enormous risk to both lifespan and healthspan sarcopenia meaning low muscle mass so we understand the relationship between amino acids and muscle mass we understand anabolic resistance in an aging population so all of these things say amino acids are good mtor activation I.E anabolic activation is good and yet we've just made a very compelling case for why blocking that extends lifespan how how would you start to reconcile what seems conflicting yeah so I mean um it's it's obviously ex going to be extremely complicated I think I'd start by going back to to a point that I made five minutes ago or so which is that these are not onoff switches right so you really need to think about this in the context of what is the optimal level of mtor complex one activity for whatever whatever it is that the cell the tissue the organ the organism needs to do to function or stay alive right so certainly we know that you need mtor activation to build new muscle um and so the idea was that rapamycin treatment inhibiting mtor turning down mtor should lead to faster muscle loss that was the prediction that was made so that rapamycin should induce sarcopenia if you were to treat animals with rapamycin as they were getting older that would that was the prediction that was made the reality turns out to be the opposite that it seemed to be the case certainly in rats probably in mice we don't have data yet in people frustratingly but certainly in rodents that you can treat them with Romy throughout adulthood and actually preserve muscle mass into old age so the explanation for that I would say is still a little bit unclear almost certainly it's going to be at least partly dose if you were to give them too much rapamycin you probably would in fact accelerate sarcopenia but at the doses that have been used to increase lifespan it seems like you can actually preserve muscle mass in during aging um that's a different question though than

[01:07:36] I think which is one that a lot of people ask which is if if if you were to take rapamycin would it prevent your ability to build new muscle mass and it might if you're a bodybuilder I don't think we have any data in humans on people who are just doing resistance training in the context of just wanting to maintain muscle mass or build a little bit of muscle mass as they're getting older I just don't think don't think we have that data and I don't think we have the data in rodents to really answer that question either in the context of the doses that extend lifespan would that impair the ability of those animals to build muscle mass if they were put on some sort of a resistance training regimen I don't know that anybody has done that experiment yet because it's been done with met

[01:08:19] Forman right like there's no reason we shouldn't know that question sort of so sort of so met foran you're you're talking about in the human studies or or in Rod so people have looked a little bit a little bit although again I would say even there the data is not definitive yet but you're right there have been some studies where people have looked at the effects of metformin on exercise both resistance training and uh cardiovascular training yeah and I I'd say the data is unclear although there is some reason to think that metformin might impair the what people think of as the positive responses to exercise complete tangent but I agree with you the fact that that hasn't hasn't been done for rapy in humans is a shame and it should be and hopefully will get done sometime in the in the near future um but to get it back to your question I mean I I I wish I could tell you why that's the case I'm just sort of telling you what the observations are my intuition is that part of this comes down to the effects of Romy on chronic inflammation which we also know increases with aging and can impair uh synthesis of new muscle as well as preservation of existing muscle and so I think you've got some competing interests here in that Ramy inhibition of mtor complex one byamy it might actually somewhat impair synthesis of new muscle even at the doses that seem to promote longevity in rodents but it might actually preserve muscle because it's having this more broad anti-inflammatory effect and so this is why I think it's hard to get to a specific you know detailed mechanistic answer to your question because people haven't really started to disentangle um those things the last the last thing

[01:10:00] I'll mention is that I'm a little bit wary of extrapolating too far from the rodent studies to humans in the context of sarcopenia in particular and in particular I'm talking about Mouse studies to humans mice are not at least the commonly used inbred Mouse strains are not particularly prone to sarcopenia with age there are some rat models that are better and so I worry a little bit about the use of mouse models in particular to try to say this is or is not going to be uh have an impact on on sarcopenia in in humans and I'm not talking so much about rapamycin in this context but I'm talking more about the studies of protein restriction and

[01:10:40] Branch chain amino acid restriction which in mice seem to have some positive effects on longevity but because mice are not they don't develop sarcopenia to the same extent or in the same way that people do I would worry a bit about extrapolating from that to say that it's going to have those same beneficial effects in people where sarcopenia seems to be much I would I would argue at least much more important for quality of life probably life expectancy but certainly quality of life in in older adults so I just want to make that caveat that we we need to be a little bit careful about extrapolating from mouth studies to to humans in the context of muscle preservation muscle function in sarcopenia yeah I I think that's actually really important and and it's certainly one of my gripes with people who tend to over index on protein restriction in animal studies which is a the model itself B the environment in which the model exists right if you're living in a sterile environment where there aren't curbs to step off and places to fall and injure yourself um I mean one only need look at the mortality data for people over the age of 75 even over the age of 65 if they fall um it's it's an enormous cause of not just death but morbidity total Destruction of quality of life I want to ask you both a question or you can both chime in and whoever feels more com more uh whoever has a stronger point of view on this do we know maybe I'll start with you David do we know from the laboratory in uh in in in in mice for example what the tissue specificity is of rap ay do we have a sense that we are getting uniform mtor blockade or do we get the sense that you know no it's disproportionately happening in the liver or it's disproportionately happening uh in the in the adapost tissue I mean because because this would factor into it right there's also you know in a in a dream world you might construct a version of a rapalog that also has some tissue specificity in addition to what everybody's talking about which is uh complex one specificity so so uh David anything you you can add on that sure so so you know I think you know Matt answered your question perfectly well and I think it shows you the complexity of the issue right it's not only M torque 1 versus mtor 2 which which cell type right is it is it muscle fibers is it inflammatory cells immune cells at what dose is it which process autophagy is it protein synthesis so these are very complicated questions now on to your question Peter certainly if you dose it high enough in our experience you will inhibit MTR 1 in all tissues that we've looked at it takes a little bit of time if you're talking about classic Romy to get in the brain you typically need to do a little bit of a loading dose but you'll get it into the brain now there's been some discrepancy some people say immediately in our hands it usually took a couple of doses to get in the brain at the lower doses was was that a couple of doses without interruption yeah you typically where we did not let a TR a trough level to get too low right so this this would have been probably in a mouse maybe every 8 hours or something maybe every 12 hours so it's pretty aggressive type of dosing okay so your view based on those data if you were extrapolating is that if you were taking Rapa weekly you're probably not getting CNS penetration probably with with classic

[01:14:10] Rapa and and and there was some you know in terms of the phal world right people that wanted to treat tubos sclerosis where you get these sort of tubers in the brain they did not think rapy was adequate for that because of CNS penetration but but again very talented people have argued differently than that but but our experience certainly was that the brain seemed more resistant in fact sometimes you would get you could stain the brain you'd see almost like a peripheral inhibition like it kind of permeated a little bit from sort of you know blood vessels in the in the sort of uh Dura and stuff but but now but I think the more relevant question Peter is at these lower doses that people take potentially for for health span lifespan studies in the ITP studies what what is what are the tissues that are most affected Matt may know but but but I don't know and my feeling is that it's not going to be so equal in those situations those are very low doses compared to what we would give to

[01:15:08] Romy and so my my my bet is that there's much more variation and that might actually be very interesting to to know you know a critical study that has been done in worms with other modulators of Aging which as far as I know has not been done in a mam for the mtor pathway is if genetically we inhibit mtor in the muscle in the liver in the brain which one has the most prolong lifespan healthspan impact I don't Matt I don't think that study has been done right not systematically there's a little bit of data on hypomorphic uh mtor um and gosh

[01:15:44] I wish I could remember the outcomes of these yeah know there's been a little bit Veronica galvin's done some stuff for dementia brain aging um I don't know about lifespan I think and finle may have done something but I I but but in general it has not been done outside of you know if it's been done there was like a adapost specific knock down knockout I and uh maybe liver specific but certainly not systematically looking across different tissues right and you know and this does get at this question is like okay there's lifespan but then there's also the health of all the different tissues and and my bet would be that you actually want to impact all tissue no I used to go to aging meetings and I would always always challenge when at the speaker dinner I would say tell me a biological system that does not age right give me one where you don't see the impact on Aging give from the biochemical cell biological to physiological level and as far as I know no one has ever told me one so um so I think Peter we need better information under these sort of lower doses quasi intermittent with a feeding cycle to understand the answerers your question and um and even you know Matt alluded to this before every looks at S6 kyes and its substrate

[01:16:57] S6 foso S6 does that you know there's not that much evidence it matters so much for a lifespan there's some what are the real relevant targets there yeah so let me just add on because I think a lot of what you said David is is spot on and maybe worth extending a little bit so this last point about which substrates um there's very little information about Other M torque 1 substrates or mtor 2 substrates in the context of this question of when you look across tissues how much inhibition do you get and it very likely as David already mentioned even Romy doesn't affect all of the M torque 1 substrates and you would expect that at higher or lower doses the relative effects on different substrates are going to be different so there have been a few studies looking at S6 kinas and maybe mtor phosphorilation of itself across tissues in the context of aging and there are some variations but I will also say those Studies have differed from each other because the way the experiments were done were the mice fasted and refed before you measured M torque activity which affects M torque activity wasn't the same across the study so the real answer is we don't know I think this brain this brain penetration question again as David I think correctly noted there's disagreements out there about how effectively does Romy cross the blood brain barrier how how much rapamycin do you need to get inhibition of M torque 1 in the brain what I can tell you from our own studies is certainly at higher

[01:18:28] Doses and I think this matches what what you've seen David is that we see potent inhibition of mtor complex one in the brain after repeated dosing at higher doses where we're using IP injection we haven't really compared this to lower doses where the rapamycin is in the food the one thing I'll say is and this is speculation but I think it's reasonable speculation we know that with age there is a decline in the function of the bloodb brain barrier that many mo ules penetrate the brain better in older animals compared to younger animals I speculate that that's probably true with rapamycin and so in the context of Aging it wouldn't surprise me if you actually get better penetration of Romy across the bloodb brain barrier um in aged animals and and in aged people potentially but I don't know of any real data to support that so it's these are all questions that that I think need answers and there just isn't much out there right now couple of questions um and and then a follow-up comment um what's the size of Romy how how physically large is it it's almost exactly a thousand

[01:19:34] Daltons right it's right right below a th so so it in the world of small molecules it's a big small molecule right a lot of small molecules are more and so a thousand the a hydrogen atom is a dalon right so it's about a thousand hydrogen atoms sort of weight most small molecules more in the 2 to 3 to 400 range so this is this is big and what's the what's the size at which you can easily Traverse the bloodb brain barrier I think here this is not as relevant because I think it's a very very lipophilic molecule I see so it's more about it's it's more about the solubility than it is yeah I think um you you almost sort of need to I I almost see like a lot of it get trapped in the membrane you almost sort of need to sort of push it uh through and you know the brain has a lot of things like myelin which are all very lipop so I think that I think there's almost like a the way I always saw it was a bit of a sink of of trapping Rapa in places that maybe it's not so effective the only anecdote I would add here and I I don't know if it means anything and I I would love to have a crystal ball that says in five years we'll have a better answer to this particular question but there's a biomarker called c2n I don't know if you guys are familiar with it it's a biomarker that we use clinically uh in in humans of course to look for um ameloid in the serum but it's very highly correlated with ameloid in the

[01:20:53] CNS and it's very highly Cor correlated with amalloy pet scans so you know obviously in patients who are high risk for Alzheimer's disease if they're in a clinical trial you might be able to justify amalo pet or lumbar punctures to look for amalo in the cerebral spinal fluid but not only does that come with the case of you know a lot of radiation and potential morbidity respectively for those procedures it's simply not practical if you're you know uh clinically practicing medicine so this c2n assay which was approved a couple of years ago has become a really important part of how we manage risk in our high-risk patients and again this is very anecdotal but for our very high-risk patients who are showing amalloy already in the plasma um I believe we have put two of them on intermittent Romy so anywhere from 5 to 8 milligrams once a week and in both cases the C 2 end score has improved meaning uh you know every 3 months when we are checking the amalloy concentration it's going down now there are 10 leaps of Faith you'd have to take there does that mean the ID is going down in the CNS as well I mean you I I don't have to spell that out to anybody who's reasonably thoughtful um but you know I think your point David about by definition these these patients are aging so maybe their CNS their blood brain barrier is not as robust and maybe that even though that's a very low and clearly uh infrequent dose of Romy maybe it is making its way into where it matters alternatively it may not be making a difference where it matters and it may simply only be making a difference in the periphery where presumably it doesn't matter so there's just a lot here and let me stop you there because I actually want to present a different hypothesis which is that it's actually the periphery that may matter for the brain and there's two lines of evidence that I can point to that that that that might support this um one is you know we've worked for many years in in my lab in a mouse model of a childhood mitochondrial disease called

[01:22:58] Lee syndrome it's a complex one deficiency in the mitochondria but it's a brain disease so it's it causes neurod degeneration and lesions in very specific regions of the brain so we did do an experiment along the lines of what David was asking about in the context of longevity which hasn't been done where we knocked down mtor complex one this was in the case of an S6 kyes knockout in different tissues and I expected it would be the brain specific knockout that would lead to rescue of the disease turns out it didn't at all it was the liver specific knockout that led to partial Rescue of the disease so there could be a tissue signaling piece and that could be metabolic you could imagine inhibiting mtor complex one in the liver would lead to systemic metabolic effects so I think that's a case in point where you can get effects on a brain disorder I'm not at all I'm not at all saying the mechanism there is the same as neurod degeneration and aging but you can get an effect on a brain disorder from inhibiting mtor complex one in the liver the other thing that I think is super interesting and there's accumulating compelling data that uh systemic immune disregulation drives dysfunction in many parts of the body including the brain and in fact with age concomitant with the breakdown in the blood blood brain barrier you actually may see higher penetration of peripheral activated immune cells into the brain and that's driving some of the inflammation in the brain you could easily imagine and again this is total speculation but I think there's you know it's plausible that that this is at least partly right could easily imagine rap ayon's effects on the peripheral immune system would would then reduce the transfer of peripheral immune cells to the brain or at least inflammation caused by those immune cells so it would not Shock me at all if you don't really need to get high levels of Romy or high levels of mtor1 inhibition in the brain to derive some of these benefits that people have seen in um at least in laboratory animals and our rationale for this because of course someone listening to this would be understandably thinking what the hell are these guys doing like why would you be giving people rap ay and when you have no idea if it works and why would you be doing it in somebody with ele you know elevated amounts of ameloid beta and um I think part of it is is just the hypothesis right which is look we pretty much know that there is no meaningful treatment for this condition and we also know that once you've exhausted all lifestyle measures around treating people with MCI mild cognitive impairment um you're not going to rescue everyone um and when you understand these these potential improvements specifically around inflammation and autophagy we can debate the relative importance of each of these uh we didn't talk about ccent cells let's also come back to that in a moment um it makes sense that uh that this inhibition could have an effect and I think your point Matt is an excellent one that I I hadn't really considered truthfully other than just through broad reduction in inflammation but but you're right we we could be thinking about this through the lens of you know less pbmc activity in the periphery should improve it and and Alzheimer's disease is a very complicated disease with multiple

[01:26:20] Pathways right there are these very lipid dependent Pathways and and there's a a sort of a a a a lipid type of Alzheimer's disease there's a really inflammatory type of Alzheimer's disease um and and so yeah I I think all of this basically speaks well hopefully screams towards more clinical research being done uh this gets to a broader Point um we've already alluded to the incredibly low uh pardon me slow uh timeline for ramy's transition into humans and the net result of that was a drug that you know was not a profitable drug presumably for fizer for very long and as a result of that there has been a relative lack of interest in studying rapy and instead an interest in looking at other drugs let's talk about one of them now so so eamus uh which I believe at the time was sort of part of the

[01:27:15] Novartis portfolio is that correct I think so yeah um so tell us how how does how does everus differ from rap ay before we get into talking about one of the more important studies in humans I don't quite remember but it's a it's a small modification I it was a methyl group on on Rapa you know the the ironically the original patents on Rapa did a very poor job of covering obvious derivatives of rap m i i was involved in some intellectual property cases that basically boil down to uh in the patents they talk about Rapa my sins and and WTH who who own those pens WTH a that that f eventually bought was trying to make the argument that that covered a lot of these derivatives eventually was ruled that that was not the case and so therefore a lot of these so-called rapalogs these derivatives are actually quite simple derivatives of rap M that that almost many chemists would come up with and everus is one of those since then there's been more sophisticated variations but everus is I think Matt a simple simple variant right I think you're right and again maybe just for for context correct me if I'm wrong

[01:28:22] David but I think we can say say that you know there are these classes of what people call rapalogs which are all going to be chemical derivatives of Ramy but biochemically they work by a pretty similar mechanism they all bind fkbp12 and then it's that complex that inhibits mtor complex one and I think the real differences are more around bioavailability maybe tissue distribution and uh uh how long the drug lasts before it gets metabolized I think all of these things are broken down by cytochrome p450 enzymes and so you're going to get differences in Peak and trough levels based on the the bioavailability and clearance and then maybe some differences in tissue distribution but but I think those are the primary things that that differentiate the rapalogs biochemically

[01:29:09] I think they're all pretty similar yeah no I I I tend to view them and certainly in cells and culture they act identically I think from a biochemical point of view they're they at least the original rapalogs were pretty much identical and in many cases frankly I don't want this to sound perjorative I think they were patent plays I think they were ways to try to get a new chemical entity that then had a longer life than uh Than Rap me I think I think even WTH Iris did that right they had a molecule I think CCI 779 I think was its name which was a simple rapy derivative and in a lot of their cancer studies they use that molecule instead of rapy because as we spoke rapy basically became off- patent very early it's interesting by the way how expensive it still is even as a generic drug it's still a comically expensive drug but it speaks to probably the lack of Alternatives so let we we alluded to something that happened that was really remarkable if I'm not mistaken I think it was even April of 2009 I I kind of remember this pretty well um fast forward five years five and a half years I suppose it's December of 2024 um I didn't yet know you guys you and I wouldn't meet David for another year but um that was a very important day because I had already become really obsessed with

[01:30:32] Ramy but was pretty much distraught that it would never make sense to take as a human that it would never go on to become a human geroprotective agent because despite how impressive all of the data were in all of these animal models I just couldn't get out of my mind all those transplant patients I was forced feeding rapy into to like Tic

[01:30:54] Tacs and chicklets and I was just like hey this can't be a good thing if you're in the business of living longer and God if if it wasn't literally the day before Christmas if my memory serves me correctly I got an embargoed copy of a paper by Joan manik Lloyd clickstein and others that seemed to at least challenge the very Foundation of that and of course Matt you already made a lot of uh good points about this which is you know that thinking about rap ay might have been a bit premature so uh either one of you guys why why don't you walk us through the the study in the uh the Australian senior citizens that I think for many people was um I don't know for me at least a huge turning point in how we thought about this this drug I all I'll say to me is that that paper the Joe manic paper was

[01:31:47] Rejuvenation of the immune system I think will be seen in the Aging field as certainly a milestone paper along with the ITP paper cuz as far as I know it's really the first where you actually rejuvenate some organ system in a human being right and so I think her study really was was mind-blowing um I think

[01:32:06] Matt can speak more to the the details of it I would agree completely with that and and we may want to come back and touch on that because I think as people are thinking about clinical trial end points for gerro Therapeutics that's a perfect case example of a functional endpoint that you can actually do a clinical trial on for FDA approval and show Improvement in function and potentially get a drug approved as a gerpe so I think as a conceptual Advance it's important as well so just to give a little bit of history there was actually a paper I think it was 2009 from pen jangs lab in mice that preceded the the

[01:32:42] Joan manic paper where they showed that you could treat with Rapa for I think six weeks in that study um and rejuvenate the immune function of a mouse and to me the one experiment in there that is most most compelling is they they have a set of mice I think they were 24 months of age when they started this experiment and then they had young mice and the mice got um either a flu vaccine or no vaccine and then they waited and then they gave them what would be a lethal dose of influenza if they hadn't been vaccinated and then in the Aged mice they either got rap a in for six weeks or they didn't and so if you're a young Mouse and you don't get a vaccine and you get this dose of influenza there's 100% mortality within

[01:33:23] I think it was 8 days days that makes sense right no vaccine you're not protected against the influenza if you're a young mouse that got the vaccine 100% protection so that again makes sense it's a control if you're an old mouse No rrap a you get a vaccine only 30% of the mice actually were protected so this is showing you the impact of just normal biological aging on the ability to respond to a vaccine in mice it's about 70% of the time you don't respond to the vaccine and you die then if you get a subsequent influenza infection interesting parallels to humans as we've learned over the last four or five years the cool thing in that study was if the mice got 6 weeks of rap ayon treatment before the vaccine they were then 100% protected these are old mice they're now almost 28 months old so this is sort of an amazing uh demonstration of immune Rejuvenation in an aged mammal so I think that study is what really set the stage and allowed

[01:34:21] Joan and and the group from novaris to be able to move forward and convince the people who had to fund this study that there was a reason to think that mtor Inhibitors might do the same thing in humans so the design of that human study conceptually is very similar to the mouse study I just laid out except of course they didn't give people lethal doses of influenza but what they did do was they they enrolled healthy older people I think they were over the age of 65 and they they couldn't have there was some set of pre-existing disease that they that were they would be excluded for so they were considered relatively healthy for their age um and they got either Placebo or they I think in the first study they tested three different doses of ever alus so it wasn't rap a but I think we can just think about it the same as we would rrap a based on our earlier discussion so the in there a few interesting things here so they got I think everus for six weeks or a placebo and they got either I think it was Mill yeah it was 5 Mig once a week 20 Mig once a week and I think it was 1 Mig daily was the third between the two of us we're we're close if not spot on yeah so so there are some interesting and then they and then they gave so that was for six weeks and then they gave a flu vaccine and then they looked at antibody tighters and and and I think I don't know if it was this study or a later one where they looked at um viral gene expression as well and then also subsequent infections over the next I don't know six or 12 months or something like that respiratory tract infections so the first paper what the first paper showed was I think pretty convincing data that at least at the five milligrams once a week and one milligram daily dose there was a boost in response to the vaccine as measured by antibody tighters so that supported the idea that similar to what had been shown in mice you could in fact to some extent rejuvenate the ability of the Aged immune system in humans to respond to a vaccine um with transient dosing with a Romy derivative ever in this case the other thing though that I think was super important about that paper was it was pretty large I mean not huge it wasn't like a phase three but there were yes 3 if I'm yeah I think it was about 80 per arm okay so hundreds of people in this study who got ever alus who didn't have an organ transplant and weren't taking other immunosuppressants and the side effect profile at least in the five migs once a week group was essentially no different than Placebo and so I think it that study started and it's been slow because there's still a perception that rapy has a lot of bad side effects but that started at least some people in the community thinking you know May and this

[01:37:03] I think is getting with what you were talking about Peter maybe it is possible that lower doses of AR rapalog in relatively healthy older adults could be well tolerated and maybe this idea that as a ger therpeutic we might be able to give Ramy to older people maybe it's not so crazy I think that's one of the important aspects of the study kind of independent of the potential immune rejuvenating effects which I don't want to minimize because that's hugely important I actually think both of these things are are important things that that study kind of set the stage for and

[01:37:34] I think from that study comes a word I don't know if it was you know certainly wasn't coined in that study but but in my mind at least it went from we shouldn't think of this as an immune supressant we should think of it as an immune modulator and that was a clear example of how you take at at least an aged immune system and make it more robust and it might be in fact it very likely is the case that you can also suppress the immune system interestingly these are the same parts of the immune system

[01:38:07] I mean immune system we talk about it with one word it's a very complicated system but it is the same immune system that is there to fight a virus that is also there to reject an organ I mean these are these are not just tea cells but you know this is part of the the cellular immune system so so that also I think is a very interesting footnote to the story I was living through this at

[01:38:26] Hopkins you know the the age of the immunosuppressant I mean remember how miraculous cyclosporin seemed yeah and then fk506 and rap to some extent got caught up in being this generic sort of immunosuppressant but the truth is when you looked at the data in cells and culture in um it's actually not so easy to inhibit in some of those sort of immune activation assays and culture rapon is pretty weak if you look at the data in mice it never looked like fk506 and cyclosporin but it got caught up with that name because that was sort of that Revolution that was happening and I think as as you and Matt have said that has sort of persisted but it never kind of looked well I I think to your point

[01:39:08] David I don't think any patients are using rapy today with the exception of Legacy patients in other words I've talked to many transplant surgeons um and said do you is rap ay anywhere in your immunosuppressive regimen and I've never heard anybody say yes now obviously there's going to be somebody listening to this who still uses it but the I think there are patients who still take it who received transplants 25 years ago um and and it's you know part of their their regimen and it's working for them and no one's willing to shift it but I think you're right and one part of the story I've never familiarized myself with is the the literature that led to its approval for f uh for for for transplant patients in 1999 I'm I'm not you would be more familiar with that of course than I am yeah I don't quite remember but I remember this study that you know the people who take immunosuppressant chronically have higher rates of certain types of cancer which of of course makes sense rapy does not right and it was justified at the time that the reason rapm did not is because it itself has anti now the alternative is that it you know doesn't actually impact the immune system in the way that the other ones do to cause that and that's never actually been quite resolved uh so so I I think all of you are very right to say that this is not a traditional amuno supressant in any way but that Nom that that that name has been attached to it and people say yeah I don't want to get infections by taking rap M and I think there's almost no evidence that there's actually increase in infections at all let me ask you guys a question we're going to come back to talking about broader topics but do you believe that if you could look at the epigenome of the te- cells in those patients in the manic clickin study do you believe that you would see a change in the methylation pattern pre and post

[01:41:03] Ramy absolutely but but I think what you're really asking is would we would we see a change in the methylation pattern that is what people are calling a reversal of biological aging I don't know if that's what you're asking so there's no question it's exactly where I'm going which is given our shared interest in that topic as well which is you know when what is Ramy effectively doing that is it rewriting the epig genome is it undoing some of the Aging of the te- cell and is it writing that code via methylation onto the epome yeah I don't have a strong feeling

[01:41:42] I I don't have a strong enough feeling to make a a strong prediction there like I said there's no question you will see a change in in the epigenome but that's kind of just saying Everything is Everything big that you do to aell is is going to affect the epigenome I'm less convinced that these epigenetic clocks are really measuring what from a from a biological aging perspective what some people think they're measuring and so

[01:42:04] I'm I'm I don't have such a strong feeling that rap ayon would reverse what people are calling the epigenetic Aging clock universally I think in some contexts it will in tea cells in particular I don't know I mean it's a really interesting question what what first of all what are canonical age related epigenetic changes in te- cells and how closely are those linked to the the functional declines that we see with te- cells that go along with with aging

[01:42:35] I don't think that's really been carefully fleshed out and so so I'm guess I'm just less convinced what the epigenetic clocks are actually measuring to be able to say with any level of confidence I the current versions of the clocks are not measuring anything that's of Interest truthfully but I but but I still wonder if we just don't have the technology yet to to actually read this at cpg resolution and therefore we don't really know what the heck is going on right when we use these crappy micro arrays to read these things when we're sort of averaging out methylation patterns I you know look I think it's like trying to play the piano with mittens on it's totally unhelpful um but if you can take the mittens off and put your fingers on it's a different sport you know to get to Matt's point we had actually tried to look at the the impact of rapy on specific methylation uh patterns not only on on the DNA itself but also on histones and and using a variety of different tools and the truth is we found almost and we never published this because we almost found nothing specific and all the impacts really were from the cell cycle delay once you sort of normalize that away you couldn't say hey mtor inhibitions regulating k27 this or that there wasn't there that signal wasn't there it really was impact of delay and so I agree with

[01:43:55] Matt you're going to see impacts but but why David so so so that's very interesting but how would that explain what we just saw that in six weeks which is nothing in this in this in this span of a person's lifetime six weeks of inhibiting mtor and again let's do it in the mouse experiment because that's so much more dramatic right and now admittedly six weeks might be analogous to you know a year year or so in a human's life but in a relatively short period of time you have a log function change in the immune system of the older

[01:44:31] Mouse how you how it's hard for me to understand how that could be explained by something that is just cell cycle specific and not a fundamental rewriting of the genetic code of that cell again I could be just completely naive here but it seems so profound but I me Peter this gets to the fundamental question here is what is wrong wrong wrong with the age lymphocytes and what does rapy do to them to fix that right and and so what

[01:44:58] I'm telling you is that cells and culture like we always imagine there's a signal transduction pathway from M torque 1 to a specific epigenetic change what I can tell you is we found no evidence for that now that inhibition of mtor in a living system with lymphocytes that are impacted by many different signals coming at them will acquire a different state that's reflected epigenetically I pretty much think that's what Matt said right like a self

[01:45:23] State you know Rick young always used to say epigenetics is the is the setting of the state not the thing that gave you that state at the beginning right and this is an important distinction so that those cells will be in a different state but how they got to that state which in essence is what we're asking we don't know so I so I completely agree with you

[01:45:43] Peter they're in a different state what I am saying is that the evidence at least in our systems in cells and culture of a specific signal transduction pathway way such as the one we can Define from mtor 1 to the autophagy Machinery where there's a whole relay of proteins that we can get to the structural level I don't know and found no evidence for one to the epigenetic state and let let me just add a couple of couple of thoughts here so one is you know uh if you think about go back to the Hallmarks of Aging which you know there used to be nine now there's 12 epigenetic changes is only one of the

[01:46:18] Hallmarks of aging and you can you can find evidence in the literature that rap ay imp imps all 12 Hallmarks of Aging but the link between rapy and epigenetics is much weaker than some of the other Hallmarks like mitochondrial dysfunction proteostasis nutrient signaling so it's not as obvious but I think rapamycin is going to impact epigenetic changes with aging and that's gets back to the complexity of the downstream part which we haven't even touched on all the different things that empor complex one and mtor complex 2 regulate talking specifically about the immune system though I think one way to think about this and again I'm speculating a little bit but I I think again there's reason to think this is at least conceptually partly the case we know that with aging there's it's not that immune function declines globally right there is a decline in the ability of the immune system to respond to certain challenges and hyperactivation of the immune system towards other challenges it shouldn't respond to that's why we get so much autoimmunity with aging or this sterile inflammation just from a very simplistic conceptual perspective you could imagine that that one of the things rapy is potently doing is knocking down this hyperactivation and this is something I wanted to mention but but but we didn't talk about in both the manic study and the pangang study the vaccine was given after the transient treatment with rapamycin was stopped I would really like to know what happens if those mice or people were continuing to see receive rapy when they got the vaccination but in the context of that design you could could easily imagine 6 weeks of Romy is enough to knock down chronic sterile inflammation to the point where you have a resetting of immune function which then allows the immune system to appropriately respond in a way that functionally is like a young immune system to a vaccine so I think you don't even have to say that this is fundamentally an epigenetic phenomenon um to account for the observation that functionally we can rejuvenate the ability of the immune system to respond to a vaccine and potentially protect against a bunch of other types of infections going forward I also think that's how you can sort of account for the persistent effects that we see with rap ayon treatment transiently in mice in other places like the heart or the brain or the ovaries or the oral cavity where we know that 6 to 12 weeks of treatment is enough to apparently functionally rejuvenate those tissues and organs and that that effect persists for some period of time going forward after you stop the treatment which begs a question um to cycle or not to cycle right so so Matt you you you wrote um or co-authored a paper that came out earlier this year that was a a survey not an experiment but a survey that looked at over 300 users of rap ay and so this is a you know a bunch of people who are clearly using Ramy and off label which is a completely legal thing to do it just means that there is no indication for its use and and you compared them to a group of people you tried your best to match uh nearly 200 if I recall who were you know hopefully as similar as possible in terms of their health Consciousness which would be an obvious confounder uh but who were not rapy users can you give us some of the the highlights of what that survey discovered right so so yeah I mean I think you described the study pretty well and I think it's important to be cognizant of all of the limitations that go along with with a study like that um because it was all self-reported all survey based we got in some ways Lucky in the sense that that the two populations that what we would call the users and the non-users appear to be pretty similar in terms of demographics and lifestyle habits and as you said seem to be similarly healthc conscious it's clearly a biased cohort so if you look at that the the responses that the individuals gave to the surveys I don't have it sitting in front of me but um you know in terms of Lifestyle factors this is a population that is not normal for what we would think of as Middle

[01:50:24] America much more health conscious than I think we would see if we did had a swath of just Middle America but for what it for what it's worth they seem to be pretty similar and so um there were a few take-homes from that from that study I think the the biggest take-home for me is that there really was no evidence when you look between the people who were using rapy off label and the people who' never used rapy for significant side effects of of any sense other than mouth sores that was in fact the only we had one of the surveys was a list of I think 30 or 40 you know potentially common side effects that have been associated with ramyon or with other drugs and the question was very simple for people who'd been using ramyon for at least three months uh have you experienced any of these in the past three months and then for people who never used ramyon same question the only thing that came out is statistically significantly more common in the rapid meon users was mouth source and that makes perfect sense that's the most commiting uh side effect that that organ transplant patients experience and lots and lots of people who've used I think Peter you've talked about I I I have a wicked one I have a wicked one at the base of my tongue right now that I almost burnt before this podcast um and it's it's my only bi I was just about to say it's my only biomarker that I know that I'm getting high quality rap ay right so in a sense it's it's nice to see that and it's interesting what's the approximate frequency because I think in the manic study it was surprisingly low at 5 milligrams it was like 15% yeah I think it was like 15% in hours as well okay yeah I think that's exactly what it was actually okay um so yeah so so 15ish per of people reported mouth sores any idea why any idea why this is happening is this believed to be immune mediated I don't have a good explanation

[01:52:23] David do you so so I have a couple thoughts on I think first you know you're obviously not looking at the Le the rest of your GI track right so you don't really know what the potential sores are else I mean these are epithelia that are turning over in a couple of days and and we know from many studies genetic as well as pharmacological the rapy tends to impact hyper proliferative cells right if you look at for example the impact of mtor hypomorphs in brain development it tends to be when you make the telen sephylon the cortex where there's massive burst of proliferation lymphocytes as we talked about divide every 8 hours that's pretty atypical for a Mamon cell so I think I would argue it's sort of epithelia uh proliferating fast and and you're slowing it down and perhaps losing barrier function but it's interesting we don't see we don't see side effects at the fingernails and the hair which are other places where you would expect to see it at least based on chemotherapy traditionally yeah although there are there are studies arguing for example you know I know we've even done this if you give High rap a m and before you do give some chemotherapy you can actually for example prevent sort of some of the hair loss you get in mice when you when you give chemotherapy but then as soon as you remove it it's clear that you just arrested the cells and then they all sort of fall out afterwards right it's sort of been a a block but you know one thing Peter that I've always told many people in the farmer world for the mouth sores which I know trouble people a lot right I I've never taken rap but but I know it can be pretty bad why don't people do fk506 mouthwashes I don't get this right cuz all you need to do is occupy Stuart shriber showed this

[01:53:56] I don't know ages ago right if you occupy the FK the r the fkbp with fk506 Romy has nothing to act on in your mouth and you'll prevent this because as far as I know fk6 does not do this and so you just need to occupy or even with a benign a Romy like molecule all you need is an fkbp binder to sop up The Binding sites that rap would use to me it seems like a you know I don't know how often depends it probably depends yeah probably depends on the frequency with which you do it and what what fk506 taste like sure but if the Murs are that bad but you could use you could use there are rap ay fk6 analoges they're completely inert right they simply bind to fkbp but they can't then Target FK um calura in the case of fk506 or mtor in the case of rap M all I'm saying is you just need to tie up your fkbp yeah interesting experiment right because again you know that and I think you're probably right but that does make the assumption that the mouth sores are actually caused by inhibition of mtor in those cells inside the mouth and I don't think we formally know that at this point so I you know completely agree we don't know that that would be the experiment to to to to help elucidate that or or this a more interesting experiment and this is something we would love to do is whether wrap a mice in toothpaste or wrap a mice in mouthwash or something like that specifically delivered to the oral Cav it is that sufficient to get some of the benefits that we've shown in mice from systemic Rapa and treatment on periodon disease gingival inflammation bone growth around the teeth so that's again a tangent from what we were talking about but I think Super interesting and unexplored um I want to come back to the dogs yeah I want to talk talk to me about any of the immune stuff that you saw because you know you happened to run this survey during covid what did you learn there right so so first to go back to the side effects there were other side effects that were statistically different between the groups but they were all the other direction lower in the rapy the people had been taking

[01:56:01] Romy um those included things like abdominal cramps which I don't know you know that's harder to to to Really develop many hypotheses around the ones I thought were interesting were depression and anxiety and there's a whole growing body of literature on the role of mtor and inhibition of mtor in various types of neurocognitive behavioral um uh aspects and so it makes me wonder if that actually might be real that that to some extent in some people

[01:56:32] Romy could actually have some what in this case appear to be beneficial effects may not always be beneficial effects on things like depression and anxiety so I thought that piece was interesting and certainly worther worthy of uh further study and I know there are some people working with rapamycin sometimes in the context of ketamine for things like depression chronic pain so I think there's a lot of interesting biology there that that hasn't really been explored yeah can you can you say more about that Matt because I was just about to ask you about the role what is ketamine doing to mtor because I I thought that ketamine I thought it was the opposite gu rap caused depression right I thought in in in Trials of in other types of Trials rap M Depression was one of the side effects and certainly the ketamine study argued that as well but right cuz ketamine is activated mour in the CNS isn't it that's right so the the data I'm familiar with and the clinical use that

[01:57:28] I'm familiar with is the context of rapamycin actually in combination with ketamine enhancing the effects of ketamine both in terms of magnitude and how long they last in other words that when you combine rapamycin with ketamine you can sometimes go to a lower dose and reduce the frequency at which patients are using ketamine although again I think a lot of this is not published there are at least a couple of studies that have showed a potentiating combination effect of rapamycin with ketamine in I think patients with severe depression but I don't remember for sure off the top of my head I've talked to psychiatrists who are using this combination who at least give anecdotal reports of pretty potent uh outcomes in some patients who have severe chronic pain from combining Romy with ketamine so again I think it's pretty early a lot of this is being done off label and is not being written up the way we would like it to be reported in the literature to to relas so people can learn from each other um but there's absolutely uh people using that combination now in clinical practice that's interesting because I think the initial I think it was from

[01:58:39] Dumont at Yale where I think the original ketamine study argued that rap me blocked the effect of ketamine and and and that was partly the argument that mtor was involved but I think I I think I recall also you're saying that that there's some discrepancy there right and it might be bloodb brain barrier access it might be things like this that are quite different and very dose dependent yeah sounds like we need to go back to that original study and make sure we all we all we're all on the same page but that's it so all I can tell you is I I know from conversations with people who are actually using this now that there are people using the combination of rapamycin with ketamine and at least anecdotally sometimes uh reporting pretty significant changes in in outcomes and and the ketamine is intranasal intravenous intramuscular does it matter I don't know yeah outside my my area of expertise um let's go back to the survey yeah let's go back to the survey the other things because I think if I the other thing that I remember jumping out at me was and again lots of confounders here if you have a healthier population who's more health conscious and that's why they're taking Rapa because they're they're literally at the periphery of what one would do that could easily explain the observation that they got covid last and when they got it they were less impacted by it yeah so let me tell you what we OB what we observed in the data right and again with all the caveats that that there are around the way the study was was designed and and carried out so within again two populations people who had ever used rap ayon they're all in the rap ayon User Group people who had never used rap ay they're in the non-user group but when you look within the rap ayon user group we actually had three categories of people in the context of covid-19 infection some people didn't start taking Romy until after they had had their covid-19 infection some people took it before but not after or not during and then there were people who took it continuously throughout and so we tried to group them that way and look at if there were any differences between the groups so first of all no difference in frequency of infection that was significant so didn't there's no reason to believe based on our data that rapy impacted the likelihood that somebody would get a positive covid-19 result and you know again this is self-reported so we asked people if they to confirm that this was a a positive result from a test but we're going by what they told us right so we can't we don't have any laboratory confirmation so the interesting thing was that the people who took Ramy after they got their covid-19 infection looked just like the people who never took rapy that makes sense they shouldn't and we were looking at two things Varity of infection again self-reported as mild moderate or severe and we had specific criteria for length of symptoms and hospitalization for each of those groups and then self-reported long covid as in experiencing ongoing symptoms of of covid after like a three-month period um so no difference between people who started taking rapamycin after their infection and non-users no difference between people who took Romy before their infection but stopped taking it big difference at least statistically significant between people who took Romy throughout and all of the other groups where people who took Romy throughout had lower severity of infection and the numbers were really small so we I don't want to make too much of it but signif statistically significantly less likelihood of reporting symptoms associated with long Co so it's at least

[02:02:17] I think suggestive of the idea that Rapa continuous use throughout the period of infection and resolution of symptoms it may be associated with a lower likelihood of severity of outcome and lower likelihood of long covid and again I think that might make sense in the context of at least how how at a at a crude level we kind of think Co long

[02:02:43] Co in particular is working and severe covid infections which is there's this hyperinflammatory or chronic inflammatory response it kind of makes sense that rapy use may have benefits in the context of that prolonged in inflammation or hyperinflammatory response so that might explain um what we saw in the data but again I think it's just suggestive and and worthy of potentially future work to really disentangle and I will say I don't think there's any reason to think this is specific to co9 this is this may be a general property of rapy for a bunch of different type of at least viral infections David you mentioned a moment ago you've never taken rap ay and obviously Matt and I have um say a little bit more about that uh again just obviously you're one of the most knowledgeable people on this topic I think it is perhaps somewhat telling and and maybe important for folks who are out there considering it to understand why your decision has been not to take it yeah no I I always used to joke that when I was purifying amor I got a huge dose and given that uh given that early exposure is better I got the benefit then I I never wore gloves and you know it it's a powder I remember would get into my nose and stuff so I've snorted rap aice inadvertently so so I did get a dose at the time to to now you know

[02:04:07] Peter it isn't it isn't such a willful thing it's it's more that you know it takes some effort to go and and actually do it but I do wonder and you and I have had this discussion if you eat okay and you do exercise if if Romy is a mimetic to some extent of a healthy diet let's I know it's more complicated than that but if we call it that are you getting that extra benefit right at the doses in particular that we're talking about and so that is that would be my biggest question it wouldn't be am I afraid of it I don't I don't I'm not um but will it actually do anything but but isn't there sort of a a you know sort of a hedging or a Pascal's wager which is if as long as you're as long as you could convince yourself that it's not harmful with the worst thing you're doing is wasting a lot of money cuz it ain't cheap sure so so I agree but then that's where the laziness Factor comes in and sort of figuring out how to do it and stuff but but what I would really like to know and this is what I'd like to study in the future is getting back to I think Matt you've mentioned it um Peter you have this cyclical nature right I'm much more interested in sort of a a very cuz CU what can't I do right so if if I starve myself what happen happens my body synthesizes certain nutrients breakdowns other things to release them and in fact when you look at the metabolic state of a mouse that you starved the levels in the blood are pretty similar right so I can't through dietary interventions starve a cell of nutrients like I can can in a dish I can't the body fights that and of course eventually you run out of stores and and you die but in a in a in a normal type of sort of starvation situation so what

[02:05:50] I'm much more curious about about is can I use Romy or other Mt modulators perhaps God forbid even catalytic Inhibitors to take that system to a state that I cannot simply do with a dietary intervention whatsoever and obviously that is not sustainable in any chronic way we know that if you give a cic inhibitor to a mouse you can actually kill a mouse fairly easily it's actually hard to kill a mouse with rapid

[02:06:14] M can you remind folks again the difference between an alisic and a catalytic inhibitor and what that actually is doing in the case of mtor sure so so the alisic inhibitor ramyon and and derivatives is is going to do this partial inhibition of M torque one that partially obstructs the cave entrance exactly the partial block and and also partially inhibit M torque 2 and there's going to be perhaps some tissue specificity some kinetic differences um a catalic inhibitor which is basically a molecule that will compete with ATP which is what mtor uses to do all its business that will literate mtor 1 and M torque 2 activity certainly when given at the right Doses and in our hands is highly toxic to cells and to organisms again you know if we have MISD doed by by mistake catalic

[02:07:05] Inhibitors in a mouse and a mouse will drop dead when you say drop dead are you talking about the same way where uh mitochondrial Inhibitors like cyanide which immediately cease respiration will kill an animal within seconds no it'll take usually a couple hours the mouse will stop moving it'll get cold will have seizures um but but it it will die but still profoundly and acutely toxic profoundly bad yes which rapm does not do so clearly one has to be careful of those molecules and the clinical experience has suggested that right these were molecules that were initially thought to be potentially good anti-cancer agents we we made some of the first ones and also were touting it from that but I think the experience has been that they have lots of side effects but I've always wondered can those molecules in a careful way be done to very much impact this system massively activate autophagy massively rewire this system maybe have epigenetic impacts very short and then come off of that I'm much more curious about that type of study and and and potential use because

[02:08:10] I feel that again with diet you can get close to uh to rap ayon's uh impact and and again this is my my personal belief with with some some has supported but what I know you can't get close to with diet is what a catalytic inhibitor can do yeah can I add a couple things onto that I think I think you said that in i'

[02:08:31] I've tried to make this point before and I think you you said it in a way that I've never thought about it or at least I've never said out loud which is which is important that um you know rap ay I think the point is that rap ay is very different than dietary restriction they're overlapping but they have lots of differences and and I think you're right you can't have the the same impact on mtor systemically in tissues with dietary restriction that you have with

[02:08:58] Romy I think the other side of that though that's equally important maybe is that dietary restriction does a bunch of other stuff that rapy doesn't do and the potential benefits and negative consequences of all of that other stuff I think are often not weighed into the the equation when people are thinking about diet H and comparing it to to rapy the catalytic Inhibitors though the point I wanted to make is that there's two one is most of these catalytic

[02:09:27] Inhibitors are less specific for mtor than rapy meaning many of them affect other kinases not all of them but many of them do and there's this whole class of what people call dual kinas Inhibitors that that hit other other kinases David is shaking his head so you can tell me why I'm wrong but but there are other other proteins that that some of these molecules that inhibit mtor will also inhibit and rtb 101 which we didn't talk about the future the subsequent studies from Joan at novaris and then when when she went on to restore bio there's this another molecule rtb 101 that I think would fall into these ATP competitive mtor inhibitor class but it also inhibits other kinases so the specificity for some of these molecules is less and I I don't know if we know in terms of the side effect profile file how much of that is due to mtor M torque 1 M torque 2 or other kinases that these molecules inhibit but I do think it is worth saying at least in the studies that Joan did at restor bio they did dose people with rtb 101 and did not see significant side effects so they you know you can ask whether they saw significant efficacy that trial actually was shut down but uh but it is possible at least for that molecule to use it clinically at dose is where there's some reason to believe there might be some efficacy before letting David chime in can I just ask a question to clarify that um in the rtb 101 trial um did they didn't they combine it with another agent they did with ever alignment so they had two arms one was the combination and one was rtb 101 alone yeah yeah yeah no so so um I think

[02:11:14] Matt look I'm sorry I meant to my my shaking was that I was agreeing with you and and and I was I actually was that that's study that that that manic did after I was confounded by that study and perplexed because this RTP which they 10 one they renamed I think it was nvp 103 which was a nardis molecule that's a dual mtor pi3 kindness inhibit actually a very dirty molecule I remember being on some advisory panels for novaris and really not understanding why this molecule even existed so you're right the ATP competitive Inhibitors are dirtier than rapm by far but not all of them in fact WTH had made a compound under the guidance of Bob Abraham who really the one of the

[02:11:55] Pioneers in mob biology which is exquisitely specific the the the the you can dial out pi3 kinas activity of the cathic Inhibitors but the kinas that was very hard to not also hit was DNA PK a kise involved in the DNA damage response and they managed the molecule we made Torin one we never managed to dial out

[02:12:15] DNA PK he did so this WTH compound is a beautiful molecule when FIS bought wath they deemphasized it in favor of dual activity Inhibitors which again I did not agree with but so I I do think there are some quite good molecules and that's the molecules that we use these very hyp specific ones and they are bad news for for an animal when when you and I think you know something I would this gets back to low hanging fruit that that hasn't been studied I would love to see somebody take a panel of all of the no and mtor Inhibitors in these different classes and just ask the question if you look in an animal model what's the relative benefit and side effect profile look like in the context of longevity I am confident well maybe I shouldn't sit

[02:13:07] I'm confident that at least in worms you will find things that work better than Rapa M because we've already done it I don't know about in mice but it seems like a really important question to understand the biology of these mtor Inhibitors in the context of Aging to know is rap ay really best in class or is it just the one that we've studied the most and that seemed like a completely unknown to me at this point I mean you would just have to guess that it's not Best in Class in the same way that you know the the the you know the first of anything it could always be perfected right I mean that would be your guess or yeah absolutely that would definitely be my guess it would be my guess too but but you know the balance between full mtor 1 inhibition total mtor 2 inhibition I don't I don't I don't know the answer to that and and one of the reasons I think this hasn't been done is that the catalic Inhibitors are actually very challenging to use they're very hydrophobic molecules because the catalytic site of Emptor is like a very hydrophobic site so everyone who independently made these molecules ended up with very greasy molecules that are not easy to dose in in a mouse very hard to dose you got to put them in detergents and all these all these things that the mice don't like either but I completely agree but I would do that study Matt in an intermittent way that's the way that I would want to to to do that to sort of mimic a really strong inhibition of this system and then release and see what happens um guys why do you think that they put forward rtb 101 I mean you made a point a minute ago David I mean it was probably more of a pi3 kise inhibitor I mean and a dirty one exactly like I I also was confused in the the problem is when that second study came out and it was a null study it somehow got interpreted as oh wait everus doesn't work which again there's no scenario under which I would make that interpretation but help help me understand that because you wrote If

[02:15:07] I recall Matt you wrote an editorial on this if I'm remembering correctly right so there were actually three studies so this the the the study where rtb 101 was used alone was actually the the third and that was their pivotal clinical Tri there was a second phase 2 in between the 2014 paper and the the pivotal where they used a combination of ever align us with rtb 101 and I you know I wasn't I wasn't in the room so I don't know exactly what went into the thought process of why use rtb 101 I've been told there are probably at least two factors that played in one was that in cell culture models there was some data that rtb 101 induced antiviral gene expression so there was some you know at least somewhat plausible biological rationale for for the end point that they were going after which was if I remember correctly at least for the pivotal it wasn't so much vaccine response it was subsequent infections and so the the thought was if you can both boost vaccine response and enhance uh resistance to subsequent infections that might be a combination that was that was useful so in the second phase 2 the rtb 10 1 showed a signal the rtb 101 plus ever alyus also showed a signal but rtb 101 alone showed a signal so the decision was made to go to the pivotal with rtb 101 alone and I don't I don't know the rationale for that you could speculate it might have something to do with patent life right and IP around you know longer patent life on rtb 101 clearer path to Market I I don't know for sure but that's what happened so there was no ever alignment in the the pivotal phase three there there are a couple things about that trial that are worth just mentioning um so one is that ever alus wasn't in there so the failure of that trial absolutely should not be interpreted as a failure of ramyon or rapalogs because there was no rapalog in that trial the other piece though that I think is is worth mentioning is that trial was only half completed and the decision was made halfway through to stop the trial because they were not hitting their FDA mandated endpoint which was patient reported infections not laboratory confirmed patient reported so they were not hitting that endp point and the decision was made to stop the trial halfway through that was actually November of 2019 I remember I was at a conference with Joan the gerontological Society of America conference when that news came down um uh I was upset I'm sure Joan was even more upset but if you think about where the world was five months later they might have made a different decision at that point with a drug that could potentially affect vaccine response and subsequent viral infections regardless that's all history but now Joan did go back and do a subsequent analysis on the data from that half completed phase three and in fact in those patients who got the rtb 101 there was a significantly lower risk of subsequent infection for certain viruses among them influenza viruses and Corona viruses not covid-19 because we didn't know about covid-19 when this was happening but

[02:18:19] Corona viruses as a class the people who'd gotten rtb 101 showed a significantly lower likelihood of a future laboratory confirmed viral infection so you know whether that trial was actually a failure it was a failure in the sense that they didn't get to FDA approval and they shut it down early whether it was actually a failure of the drug I think Still Remains TBD um which is interesting because this wasn't a rap ayon right it was one of these ATP competitive mtor Inhibitors but I think it's still a little bit clear if the drug itself actually failed to have an have an impact on immune function in in the population where it was tested but it but it was a very dirty catalytic inhibitor right it it impacts multiple pi3 kinases so absolutely yeah and I mean that makes it harder from the perspective of even if it did have an impact how is it working is it really through mtor is it through some of these other kinases is it a combination yeah we don't we don't really we don't really know cuz it is dirty so I always always worried that the change and sort of use of molecules reflected that that original study maybe maybe it had some issues that we're not aware of right because it it that first study that we talked about as a milestone study was was so amazing right that why wouldn't you have expanded upon that it never I never understood this but but I think what you said makes a lot of sense about yeah and I don't remember when ever alus came off patent but it it's been a few years now so the patent clock was ticking and I I I would speculate that had something to do with the decision I don't think that's a skeptical point of view I mean that that would be my aams Razer answer to that question uh for sure but there are now so many rapy and derivatives right that you could I still imagine you could have picked one up to to do it but who knows you have to guess go through a lot of preclinical studies and things so David you've talked a lot about the the the sort of the impact of mtor inhibition you've already talked about autophagy we've talked about uh a reduction of inflammation we haven't talked a lot about the tamping down of senescent cells and potentially the reduction of the there soluble or secretory factors um we have an impact on uh proteomics I mean lots of things are impacted you tend to think if I'm not mistaken that the atop the impact on autophagy is the one that might be most responsible for the kind of Life

[02:20:52] Property the altering benefits we see of that you want to expand on that a little bit and and and Matt I'm kind of curious to hear your point of view on that as well what do what do you think which Pathways plural would you rank order as the ones that are driving this and the reason I'm asking this I'll tell you where I'm going with the question in advance it comes down to biomarkers right a topic that the three of us have endlessly endlessly talked about right which is if we believe this is dominated by a autophagy then we need biomarkers for autophagy if we believe this is this is dominated by inflammation then we need better biomarkers for inflammation so so with that said I'd like to hear your thoughts sure so so I you know when you think of things Downstream of amor right you you can do a pub Med search and find mtor and rap and literally connect it to anything you want right and why is that right either there's a specific signaling pathway to that process or there's a simpler explanation which to me is that mtor is a reg major regulator of protein synthesis and if you inhibit mtor enough particularly a cal inhibitor you inhibit protein synthesis so you will impact everything and so to me there is the class of

[02:22:04] Downstream molecules that are impacted simply by impacting protein synthesis and and I I put those in a very sort of broad category that I don't know how to study them or think about them in any kind of specific way there are then a whole series of processes in which there are truly molecular connections direct specific molecular connections that MTR regulates and as you said Peter autophagy the self-eating of of of cellular components and destruction in the lome that came up earlier where we know that pathway we know how it regulates protein synthesis we know how it regulates transcription factors like

[02:22:44] TB right so so one of I think the if you had to put in the molecular Target of emor that's emerged in the last 10 15 years as very interesting and prominent it' be tab it's a transcription factor that what it does is promote the production of these lomes the these Recycling organel and so yes Peter I would put autophagy if I had to pick one process that is prominently regulated by Amor and probably accounts for some of its health benefits I would put autophagy part of that is based on a worm study that I'm sure Matt knows better than I do where they actually tried to look at that right they they did mtor inhibition and then they looked at Downstream

[02:23:27] Pathways genetically and found the biggest impact of perturbing uh autophagy part of it is based on common sense you know it it breaks down old things and allows their Rejuvenation the counter though to the statement that I just made is that I'm always asked why does mtor impact aging and why do other things not and what I always say is that if you make the analogy of an old house right you you can't make you can't prevent the Aging of an old house or much less rejuvenate an old house by having a plumber having an electrician right you need a general contractor that brings in all those people because an old house has everything wrong with it as we know or an old car has every part wrong with it and so I think to some extent we almost can't ask the question what is important

[02:24:17] Downstream of mtor because the answer is that mtor is special because it does a lot of things and therefore we can't find one thing that replicates Amur otherwise we would have already found those things right and so I guess Peter if you had to pick I'd say autophagy is the major one but I think the real answer is to why mtor and thus Rapa are special is that mtor does a lot of stuff and to impact the aging process you have to do a lot of stuff and this is why it goes back to that question that I always ask the real aging researchers tell me one thing in a Cell that's not broken with and the answer is there isn't one thing that's not broken and so therefore to fix or prevent that you have to act on many processes so sorry long-winded answer but it's very it's very helpful um what about you Matt where do you where do you end up on this question yeah I don't disagree with anything that that David said and I think the house analogy is it's a that's a nice way to think of it because it is the case that mtor globally regulates a lot of different things and it's probably multiple

[02:25:22] Downstream processes that play a role and I think what I would say though is that um autophagy being an important maybe a the most important single Downstream directly regulated uh mtor process for a bunch of different uh aging broadly speaking aging effects is not inconsistent with the idea that in a mammal or in a person the anti-inflammatory effects account for many maybe most of the functional benefits that we see when we treat an old organism old animal right I think both of those things can be true and it's probably the case that the specific effects of mtor may be different in different context different tissues uh different pathologies so you know for example uh in hypertrophy the effects of mtor on cell size may be most important um in cancers the effects of mtor on the cell cycle be most important those are tied into autophagy so I I I don't know that it I mean I don't know that we're going to be successful trying to point to one thing and say that's the most important thing David's absolutely right though that in celegans at least it's interesting because it seems to be the case that most if not all of the benefits of inhibiting mtor can be directly attributed to activation of autophagy but you go to yeast and it seems to be mostly the effects on global mRNA translation so again that may fit with the idea that context is is important here for which of these

[02:26:53] Downstream processes are weighted uh in a relative sense most importantly for the effects that we see in the in the context of Aging so that's kind of the way I think about it but again I think you and I have talked about this before Peter I have very much in in the last five to 10 years shifted my thinking particularly in the context of people and probably in other mammals towards the anti-inflammatory effects and particularly the ability of rap ay to knock down sterile inflammation in in the context of an aged animal that seems to me to that a lot of the the benefits that we see in terms of organ and tissue function can be plausibly traced back to that effect of Romy very interesting I mean I think that would lead us to think that boy if we really wanted to get a better handle on dosing we would we would want to look deeper into biomarkers of inflammation and we do have we have more that we can look at there I mean you know everybody gets their C reactive protein checked but we could be looking at a whole Suite of inter lucans and other cyto but when it comes to autophagy boy we don't have we we've got a whole lot of nothing I got it it's probably been three years now since I had a really interesting discussion with eileene white about this who's one of the world's experts on this and um yeah it was I don't think I got any argument out of out of Eileen that we really need uh a biomarker here because outside of the lab when you can you know afford to take tissue um we don't we don't have much going on I want to Pivot for a sec and talk about um and we've done this before

[02:28:29] Matt but again I think there are people listening to this who maybe haven't heard it can you tell us a little bit about what we've learned in Rapa as we've pivoted pivoted to companion animals so and we talk specifically about cats and dogs so what is it about cats and dogs that are interesting well first of all they're a heck of a lot closer to humans than than mice are but they're also not genetically in the way mice are they live in our environment not a sterile environment uh they consume you know food that probably looks a little bit more uh like the food we would consume at least in some cases um so so so tell us about what you've learned in this study which has really occupied more than a decade of of your of your research right yeah so there's two other things I would add about companion animals and and dogs in particular where my most of my work has been but but this is also true for for cats um one is they age more rapidly than people do right so that's super important because that that means we can actually measure outcomes of interest in the time frame that's compatible with a with a clinical trial um secondly they matter right more than 50% of people say that their pet is part of their family so there's sort of an intrinsic value I believe in developing therapies that can improve health Health span and and longevity of companion animals from from that perspective so just to make sure yeah what you're basically saying is even if we learned nothing about the longevity of humans this would be a worthwhile pursuit in the way nobody actually cares how long mice live or how long sea elegans lives right ex that's exactly right and and I would also say it's ridiculous to think we're going to learn nothing about the biology of Aging in humans from studying companion animals but yes even if we say that there's still value in in doing these kinds of studies and improving the quality and quantity of life for for pets so I've been involved as you know for a while now with a project called the dog aging project which Daniel promislo Kate creevy and myself um started depending on how you want to do the math somewhere between seven and 12 years ago um with the idea you know sort of around what what we've already discussed that there's a good rationale for companion dogs pet dogs in particular as a model for the biology of

[02:30:47] Aging but also to be able to assess Ramy specifically for its impact on lifespan and healthspan metrics because we can actually design a clinical trial and this is a real clinical trial double blind randomized Placebo controlled Veterinary clinical trial to answer the question does rap ayon slow aging increase lifespan improve multiple healthspan metrics in a reasonable time frame so we set out to design such a clinical trial we call it the test of rapy and aging dogs we've done two shorter term pilot trials also double blind Placebo controlled to establish safety to kind of work out dosing um and then started the larger clinical trial

[02:31:32] Triad a few years ago um which unfortunately coincided with the beginning of covid-19 so that was challenging but we continued to work through that and are making progress and so this is a trial that will ultimately enroll 580 dogs half get Placebo half get WAP aice the treatment period is 3 years um we're looking at multiple measures of Health span including cardiac function neurological function activity cognitive function there's a few others but I think most importantly lifespan is the primary end point so with that cohort size that uh length of treatment we are powered to detect a 9% change in lifespan which is Matt is that remaining lifespan or total Lifan an that's total lifespan okay so life expectancy it's a it's a bigger number for remaining life expectancy yeah so and the reason why we the reason why we settled on that 9% as you know Peter because you were instrumental in getting us to that point by helping to line up a a group of donors who who increased the size of the study the reason why we aligned on that percentage is because that's towards the lower end of what's been reported in mice and that's in fact what was seen in that 2009 study we talked about earlier starting treatment in middle-age in mice so again it's a big question it's unanswered even if rap ay extends lifespan in dogs and in people will the magnitude of effect translate that's a different question we don't know the answer to but it makes sense to start in the right ballpark in terms of what we think might be a reasonable thing to expect for longevity so that's why we went with that um uh cohort size couple of other things that are maybe worth just mentioning is that the dogs have to be at least 7 years old at the time of randomization and they can't be sick they can't have any significant pre-existing age related disease and and that's important because the vast majority of clinical trials that are done today whether it's in companion animals or people are disease specific clinical trials in patients who already have a pre-existing disorder this is a study of normative aging and so we felt it was important to start with a population that was at least age appropriate in terms of health status and so so that's that's the study um dogs are still actively any size limitations Matt yeah sorry so the dogs have to be between 40 and 110 lb and that's for the simple reason that big dogs age faster than small dogs so again in order to get the statistical power that we needed we are working in a population of dogs that are more rapidly aging than a smaller weight body size population one quick thing you know you always asked me if I take Romy and and and my friends asked me whether they should take Romy because they know you and that you take rap meon and I always say Well when Matt cabin's uh dog study reads out if it's positive I'll take rap meon so it's funny you say that David I say that to a lot of our patients as well I say look I again I have a relatively strong conviction it's modestly held um it will be a lot more of a strong conviction one way or the other and I'll tighten my grip on it in 2026 which is about the time when when we'll have the read out of this study so yeah think a lot of people Matt are looking to this study um potentially along with the work of Adam Solomon maybe we can just touch on that really really briefly as well as another model sure let me let me make a comment on that though um which is that I'm not sure that lifespan so even though we're powered for lifespan that's our primary

[02:35:08] Endo I'm honestly not sure that's the most important end point for evaluating potential efficacy of rapy in in dogs or people right I mean I think we want to think about this more broadly speaking in the sense that there may be some health span metrics that are particularly and potently positively impacted by people just also want to make sure there's no negative lifespan though that's the thing too absolutely so it's and again I I agree I would be shocked I mean again we'll we'll wait till the study's done I would be shocked if we see a shortening of lifespan from

[02:35:43] Rapa mice and treatment just given everything that I know to this point in mice and the data we've gotten so far in dogs it is possible and I totally understand that uh that that reasoning it would surprise the heck out of me if we see any lifespan shortening not to say that there aren't side effects from rap M but I don't think there's any reason to believe that I think it's just hey are we seeing yeah we're not seeing lifespan get shorter we're not seeing an uptick in cancer or something that was unanticipated so so yeah if you're neutral to positive on lifespan with these Health span benefits in terms of ejection fraction uh you know parodontal disase things like that that would probably be sufficient enough reason right okay so now the Adam study yeah so this is a super interesting study in a non-human primate called a Marmet marmosets are are an interesting non-human primate model because they aren't as long lived as reesus monkeys so Reus monkeys I think in captivity will typically live 30 to 40 years uh marac setss I think this is a little bit of a moving Target as people are starting to use marmosets more in captivity they're learning more about what the actual life expectancy is but it seems seems to be towards the I think low to mid- teens so significantly shorter lifespan uh in captivity so they make them that makes them an interesting model as a non-human primate uh to study aging and and so Adam for several years now has had an ongoing uh maret Colony uh in San Antonio um some of whom have been getting rap ay and I don't think they've published the data from that that study uh at least not the lifespan data so I don't think it's I don't think it's complete um but uh but they've already published some preliminary data for you know bioavailability blood levels some interesting data suggestive um and Adam has talked in meetings about the survival apparent survival benefits so far again incomplete study where it looks like

[02:37:41] Rapa may be having positive survival effects in marma sets so again I think if that pans out and and we actually see a statistically significant Improvement in lifespan from marac sets that's that's really important because now it's gotten to the point of a primate right which we don't have data for yet obviously closer to humans I think we also though have to recognize there's still a pretty big limitation from that study in the sense that it was done in captivity so you know there are some questions about rapy particularly again we've already talked about I don't think any of us believe that rapy alone at lower doses is a potent immunosuppressant but when you're out in the real world and exposed to all sorts of environmental challenges um it may be the case that the effects of ramyon are going to be somewhat different than what we see in the laboratory so so it's a huge it's a huge step up I would say in the sense of being in non-human primates but it still got that caveat that it's a a laboratory based study to me one of the big issues with the mouth studies in rap me is that these are sedentary mice who are getting fat who who are frankly depressed and so what what I always say about your study is the critical aspect is that these are free living animals who presumably are relatively happy and so the maret study sounds exciting but it does have that big caveat of sort of potentially more sedentary sad animals and occasion I actually frankly hadn't even thought about the potential infectious disease implications of it but but the the living in the human environment to me is the so the key aspect that I that I'm looking forward to study about yeah and I think it's hard to know how important those pieces are but you're absolutely right that you could imagine they're going to be hugely important and so yeah it's it's just a difference what was the dosing in your study Matt is is it 0.1 milligrams per kilogram weekly no so we uh we've done two the first one was was we tested two doses 0.1 milligrams per kilogram three times a week and 0.05 so half that dose three times a week and then we went to uh 015 MGR once a week and that's what we're using now and you know we could talk about why we why we made that decision this is a challenge anytime you're trying to design a clinical trial there's sort of infinite number of variations on dosing and how you deliver and and all of that um we decided to go with that dosing protocol 0.15 milligrams per kilogram once a week for the large clinical trial based on the outcomes from the two shorter trials um in terms of total dose so cumulative dose and we haven't really talked yet about what sort of become popular in the the for lack of a better word biohacking

[02:40:33] Community which is this once weekly dosing but based on Joan study the observation that once weekly dosing with ever alyus seemed to give similar efficacy with maybe lower potential side effect risk and from a pragmatic perspective because the owner are giving the the the drug to their dog we thought that it would be more likely that owners would be able to consistently remember to give the drug to their dogs once a week as opposed to three times a week and that's speculation but um but that was all of those things kind of wait in to that decision but I think I'm hopeing it doesn't come back to bite us on the ass but that's designing trials and that's where I'm going with it is if if you sort of try to triangulate between the everol study your studies Adam's studies and the itps yeah it you sort of coales around around 0.1 milligrams per kilogram weekly for a human which is kind of putting people you put someone my size maybe a bit more but it's probably like in the 8 to 12 milligram range for someone our size so I'm not sure actually about that so this is actually I was going to say one of my biggest concerns with our dog study is that our dose is too low we all we have to go low because you're you're also you're trying to weigh risk reward right and in people's pets risk is the tolerance for risk is extremely low so but I am concerned that because we're be we're we need to be so risk averse that we're having to dose lower than what might be the optimal dose and my real concern is we're dosing below what would be the dose you would need to see you know any statistically significant effects so that's my concern I don't have any data to point to to suggest that and actually have some data to suggest that even at the doses we're using in the in the two shorter trials we did see evidence for for beneficial effects but that's kind of the thing that keeps me awake at night when I think about the design of this trial the mouse the mouse studies again I haven't

[02:42:40] I need to go back and really do this conversion but my recollection of the mouse dosing was that it actually works out something close to 0.1 migs per kig per day in people not per week no that's that's absolutely correct it was 1.4 milligrams per kilogram per day is what the mice were actually given in the ITP which works out to when you convert that to human dosing which is the there's a conversion factor it works out to 0.1 migs per kilogram per day is what they were getting if they were humans so you're right they were getting much more

[02:43:14] Romy and yes that speaks exactly to the concern we have which is how do you know if you're getting enough and the only reason I think we may still settle on this weekly dose is we at least saw the positive immune modulation in with five milligrams a week of everolimus I mean right that's even less all I'll say is that to me the f one of the fundamental differences from what I hear and I have no no particular expertise is is that the mous stud is really are chronic dosing yes and and really the best evidence is the manic study for an intermittent dosing having a clinical output that's beneficial I know there are moue studies that have done that as well but but in some of these these larger animals so yeah so I think that's right I'd say there's two pieces right one is the dosing when you think about like daily versus weekly versus every other other week that sort of intermittent dosing but then there's the question of interval of dosing how long do you need to dose and so those are two different variables that I think are both kind of poorly unexplored even in the m studies to really tease out where you see different benefits or where you get the biggest benefits what dose ranges are you seeing in the wild so when you did that survey what what was what were you sort of seeing what percentage of the Raa users were on weekly doses versus daily doses versus tri-weekly and what what was the range of the actual dose yeah so I mean I think in a general sense it was kind of all over the place but um by far the majority were once a week and among those the vast majority were 6 milligrams once a week and I think there's some historical reasons for that that sort of you know has what become become popular in the the online sort of community where people talk to each other but where do you think that number comes from so I think it's partly from Janes study so it's close to Joon study which was 5 milligrams once a week of ever alus I think it's also because many of the people the first people to start taking uh rapy off label were patients of Alan

[02:45:19] Green out of New York and I think that was sort of his standard dose that he put most people on so I could be wrong about that but that's my impression is that's kind of how that became popularized for lack of a better word within the within the community but having said that there are there's a lot of variation around that both in terms of doses that people are taking once a week and then there's a you know fraction of people who are taking rap ayon daily um uh usually one milligram 2 milligrams um sometimes for you know purposes other than purely for aging so people who have uh existing autoimmune disorders sometimes people are taking rapamycin for that but um but in general

[02:46:04] I would say among the off Lael rapy users the majority are once a week and of those the majority are 6 milligrams um kind of it's kind of a bodal distribution there's a group of people around 3 milligrams as well but lots of variation around that what what were some of the higher doses you saw for the once weekly folks so I think our highest was up close to 20 milligrams once a week um again though it was a little bit difficult to tell how long people had been taking rap ay at those doses right so there you know again some people had been taking it I I think our the person who's been taking it the longest was many years like five I don't know about many five or six years so so uh but the majority were 6 months right and so these people who reported taking 20 milligrams once a week it could be that they just started doing that um so we don't and and a lot of people I mean as you know right A lot of these are n of one experiments with people who are changing their regimens as they go so there are some people who are taking you know six milligrams once a week but they're trying to build it up to some higher dose to see where they start to get side effects there are a bunch of people who reported taking grapefruit juice with their WAP ay because Gra fruit juice will inhibit cytochrome p450s and enhance bioavailability of rapy so you know even and I think the reason why I say that is both to illustrate the sort of nature of complexity of this this population um but also because we know there's going to be genetic variation in uptake of

[02:47:37] Romy and metabol how quickly the drug is metabolized and so the dose that somebody is taking may or may not really reflect the total bioavailability or the kinetics trough level Peak level things like that yeah the one thing I would caveat folks who are listening to this who are themselves taking rap a m is you know first of all it's not a cheap drug so I think the most competitive pricing you'll find if you're using good RX is works out to about $5 a milligram does that sound about right to you Matt that's that's about right yeah and so what what you're seeing a lot of are these compounding pharmacies that are saying well heck I can just make this for you um and I I'll make it for you instead of giving you rap immune which is even more expens if that's the brand name rap immune is the drug made by fizer or just generic ceramus um but I would caution people against using any compounded formulations here yes they'll make it a lot cheaper but it you have virtually no guarantee of the Purity uh or the concentration and we're already taking a huge leap of faith with this so unless you know and I we just will have a podcast that covers the the ins and outs of compounding pharmacies I'm not here to suggest they're all bad but but you you absolutely want to be able to make sure you have FDA certificates for what you're using and just kind of be careful with with the with the quality control yeah I would just add on to that as well um particularly with rap ay and and compounded rap ayon there is some data out there on compounded rap ay having essentially no bioavailability if it's not in an inter capsule so this is this actually goes back to the reason why the ITP took 20 months to start their experiment is rapy is unstable at gastric pH and so if compounded rapy is not in an inic coded capsule you're essentially going to get zero bio bioavailability yeah so just this is one where I think you splurge and get either ceramus or rap immune um last thing I want to kind of talk about on the potential interesting front which again

[02:49:38] I it's it's it's the real tragedy of not you know I always say this and Matt you and I dve we've all talked about this right if like if I was a billionaire what would I do i' literally just set up a research institute that would fund this type of work with no profit motive because nobody would care to fund this if you were profit driven but you know the fact that no one's really looked at the impact of rapy on ovarian aging is really frustrating when you consider that we uh and by the way you could also look at the impact of Rapa on spermatogenesis right but but just we're we're reproducing at a later and later age in life and fertility is such an important part of that especially as we experience population decline so anything that we could do to better understand how to preserve the Youth of sperm and egg would be really fascinating and I I I think there is someone looking at this in Brazil and someone looking at this here in the US but I haven't heard enough from it maybe you guys know about this more um but do we know anything yet about this yeah so again we can go back to the mice and it's pretty clear in mice female mice that you can delay or probably even reverse ovarian atrophy up to some some point in life with transient rapidy treatment actually restore reproductive capacity to sterile female mice through this sort of a a treatment it's interesting though in male mice it's the opposite so you actually seem to impair spermatogenesis and potentially indu sterility so so it's worth just noting that may be differences in the male and female why do think syst I don't know

[02:51:22] David do you have a an idea on on this I was I think it goes back to what I mentioned before if you ask what cells are most impacted by rapy in Vivo what is their defining set of characteristics it's always the most rapidly proliferating and that I think is what defines spermatogenesis versus oogenesis which by definition is amongst the slowest processes we we uh we have and so um that's you know I always assume that is you basically you need a certain rate of growth anabolism when you're proliferating quickly that you just don't need when you're proliferating slowly and therefore you impact those cells and so that's my so I think you're right Matt like from the studies I've looked that clearly spermatogenesis male fertility is negatively impacted at least well on rapy I do I think there's at least one one paper that showed that once the mice come off of rap ayon there may actually be a preservation of sperm quality in male mice so again this gets back to dose and duration and transient versus continuous but um but it I think you're probably right about that the mechanism potentially just boiling down to cell cycle and the ovarian one I always wonder and this is in general what I always wonder about rapy and sort of its potentially anti-aging properties is how much is simply a delay because you're you're slowing the cell cycle and the progression of cells versus a true

[02:52:45] Rejuvenation and so you mentioned a true Rejuvenation and that is very impressive that's what you're seeing right no and and this is so this is not my data but but and I don't know that the papers have been published yet but they've been presented at multiple meetings there's one that just struck me as so profound where you can actually see structural

[02:53:02] Rejuvenation of the ovaries from a uh atrophied state to a to a you know what at least at a morphological level appears like true rejuven of the actual or the the ovary wow which is hard to understand right because presumably when you're fully atrophied you have no oos sites left to to rejuvenate and to so this is where I think it probably depends on how far how far down the path you've gotten right and I I don't know that that's been even carefully done has anybody looked at rap ayon

[02:53:32] Administration and antim malarian hormone level for example um you know once let's say a woman is already in her amh decline but hasn't fully bottomed out to zero could you rescue some of that I mean cuz that if you look at the physiology of that it is is a monotonically decreasing function and it is very Steep and if you could simply stop it from declining that would be remarkable let alone turn it in the other direction again here's an example of like you could study this for hundreds of thousands of dollars these are not like large sums of money and you know but you it would have to be paid for by somebody who's just genuinely obsessed with knowing the answer and not realizing they can't make a buck off this right so so yeah so so we talked about the human studies that are going on now so the one I'm most familiar with is out of Colombia so yinu who uh directs the reproductive aging Center of

[02:54:28] Columbia and Zev Williams are leading this clinical trial that's one of the biomarkers that they're looking at I don't think they have any data yet but um and this was a grant that was funded by the impetus grants uh foundation so so these are you know smaller grants uh but like you said you can actually at least start to answer some of these questions and it doesn't require tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to start to gather some data so so they um have a clinical trial that that is ongoing I don't I don't know I've actually got a call with them next week so I don't know how far along they are except I do know that there are some patients in the trial now um looking at women with premature ovarian failure and it's a double blind Placebo controlled randomized clinical trial with Rapa so I think that will start to address you know get more data around safety in a younger healthier population and hopefully start to get some data around potential efficacy for ovarian function in people um I want to just mention though I mean I'm I'm I'm extremely pleased that the impetus grants

[02:55:36] Foundation funded that trial they're also funding a periodontal disease trial out of the University of Washington um uh I'm grateful to them for doing that um from like a scientific perspective um but I'm also extremely frustrated that the funding for these kinds of Trials is so small and these trials are you know let's be honest they're underpowered for what we would really want to do if you really want to answer the question you know you're not going to get there with

[02:56:02] Trials of 40 people it's just that that's not enough and so PE the researchers are doing the best they can in the system that we're working within but you know what happens is you end up with these small clinical trials that give a hint of efficacy and show no problems in terms of safety but then it takes another 2 years another 3 years another four years to get a grant to take it to the next stage and that's why it ends up taking two decades with something like rap ayon to actually get to An Answer whereas if this was a rapalog an M torque one specific rapalog you could go out start a company and raise money to to to do a more accelerated path and I'm I'm I I'm not I

[02:56:45] I don't mean to dismiss that approach but we we have a perfectly good drug here with lots of human safety data that probably works and it's it's frustrating to say the least that things have gone so slow it really is because people don't appreciate what it takes to go from IND to phase three approval and the fact that that's already been done for this molecule and basically all you're really doing is a series of new phase two and phase three trials on an approved drug is such an enormous

[02:57:18] Tailwind um that that I share your concern I I David one kind of last thought from you you're quite close to the landscape of this you've personally been involved in the development of a number of Rapa logs um what is your take today of the landscape in this Arena you know it's funny Peter right because it's it's so funny how the winds change right so I would say 10 12 years ago if you went and said I want a Target mtor the universal response was we have rapidy it's off patent it's cheap no thank you let's move on I think now there's almost been a complete reversal as Matt kind of alluded to right you can come up with small differences in rap me which you know you can still sort of patent protect and apply them to much more Niche applications and and people are potentially willing to fund them these are not the mega biotechs that are being started but certainly enough to to get things going and so I think there's a general consensus that mtor matters as a

[02:58:24] Target what is frustrating to me if I if you know Matt mentioned his frustrations sure I think graab me and its derivatives are great and we should do exactly what Matt was saying and in somehow incentivize that I personally think though there's actually a whole bunch of other Targets in that pathway that may be more beneficial for example you know one thing we didn't get to here it's and Matt alluded to this it's very clear that the nutrient sensing the response to nutrient deprivation is not just mtor at all in fact the nutrient sensors we found clearly talk to a whole bunch of other processes and so if you want to get closer to that nutrient deprivation

[02:59:01] State one has to go to those and so right now the way I read it is people are willing to invest modestly in molecules that are rapy and derivative derivatives G they still though have the mindset mtor is drugged and therefore if you want to go to other components of the pathway which I think we don't have time to discuss them would be more interesting there's really not an appetite for that gentlemen I have a list of pages in front of me of topics that I wanted to discuss with you that extend far beyond

[02:59:36] Rapa and mtor we've very very briefly touched on a couple of them we've we've talked a little bit about epigenetics we've talked a little bit tangentially about some of the other Hallmarks of Aging uh we've had h T of other questions that are remarkable questions that seem so basic and fundamental and yet it's amazing we don't know the answer to them questions such as why do different organisms age at different rates um why do different organisms of similar size have different lifespans these are all some of the most interesting questions in biology and questions that we collectively as friends uh discuss all the time privately but I think it would be really enjoyable to to have one of these discussions publicly in this way so I think the only thing to say here is we should just probably sit down collectively and do this again much sooner than when we plan to go back to to rapanui which uh guys I have that on the calendar for uh for 2026 so uh but let's let's find time between now and then to sit down and and do a part two of of this discussion which uh I hope was half as enjoyable for you guys as it was for me it was great Peter thank you so much it's always so much fun to talk to you and Matt to to hear all your your your thoughts thank you yeah anytime guys this has been a blast I like I like the three-way uh podcast here Peter works yeah or we could do it in person the next time guys it's it's even more fun and Pur definitely yeah all right and remember Peter when we go back to Easter

[03:01:00] Island we got to bring the plaque I know we are bringing the pl uh we went to the place where W the soil sample was collected there was supposed to be a plaque and the plaque was stolen so uh we're going to do that yeah we will indeed all right guys thank you so much thank you thank you [Music] w
