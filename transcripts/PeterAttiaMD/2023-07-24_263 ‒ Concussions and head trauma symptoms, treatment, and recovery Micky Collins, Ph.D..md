## Transcript

[00:00:00] there's a lot of misinformation out there about concussion and I think it actually hurts outcomes a lot of times clinicians that aren't aware of the recent advances in knowing how to treat this clinicians that don't know how to do the right evaluation and there's a lot of mismanagement and mistreatment of this injury that leads to very poor outcomes again and you're going to hear it from me over and over again if you bring me a patient with concussion I I can pretty much tell you I can treat that and get get that patient better and get them back to the sports they love there are highly effective treatments with this injury hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter attia

[00:00:45] well Mickey thanks so much for uh for making time to sit down I know you're particularly busy today so I really appreciate it um this is a conversation I've wanted to have for quite a while it's a topic that comes up over and over again in my life personally and even professionally whether it be patients or children of patients things like that and that's basically that of head trauma and particularly uh you know what you know what happens when someone has a concussion what are their options and um so I think before we get to that I'd kind of like to give folks a bit of a sense of your background how did you how did you come to do this foreign it's a really interesting question and it's kind of a long-winded response but um I went to college and didn't really know what I want to do in life I had a bunch of family members that were

[00:01:33] Physicians and in the medical field um I've also went to college to play baseball as much as I did to be a student and I was playing baseball my junior year and my coach came up to me and said Mickey if you don't declare a major today you're going to be ineligible so I was like okay and I was taking a neuroscience course at that time like a biopsychology course and it kind of hit my buttons when they needed to be hit and I was very intrigued by it so I just kind of dove in and studying biology and psychology and and really the neurosciences and graduated college

[00:02:14] Went to went to graduate school and know I knew I wanted to do brain Behavior studies and I got involved in a a program at Michigan State University I got my PhD from there and studied in Clinical Psychology with a emphasis in neuro clinical neuropsychology which is a study of brain behavior and took some of the Medical classes there through

[00:02:37] Michigan State but also did a lot of you know psychology clinical psych and Neuroscience courses and combine that into my PhD um and maybe two or three years into studying that at Michigan State I said to myself I really miss Sports and I wanted and I somehow wanted to combine traumatic brain injury in sports into something and no one had really done that before really I mean there wasn't there was no concussion specialty when I went to school a period uh and in fact the hooks are just just to make sure I understand that Mickey you're you're meaning that even a patient that has a concussion in a sport if they saw a neurologist that neurologist wouldn't really have any particular Insight on it this field did not exist in 1998 or 99 97 when I was in school this field simply did not exist honestly when I arrived here at UPMC in 2000 um I I really didn't know how I was going to make a living doing this I didn't know if I was going to be able to see patients I didn't no one would care in my research I mean it was a very there was very little Traction in anyone studying this topic like literally nobody we had the first clinic in the world here at UPMC and that was developed that came I came here in 2000 that's when we started the clinic but long story short back when I was getting into this I I wanted to study concussion or mild traumatic brain injury and I somehow want to involve

[00:04:13] Sports and it right now if you think back I mean that sounds counterintuitive because everyone it's a hot topic now at the time no one could care about it but that was around the time that Troy Aikman and Steve Young and um Paul Korea remembers that name Ricky Craven uh race car driver um and and others started to talk about this topic of concussion and I remember watching Al Michaels on

[00:04:44] Monday Night Football talking about Steve Young's concussion in 1997 or 96 whenever it was and he basically said no one knows anything about this injury this topic and there's a lot there's just a lot of speculation but no one really understands about the injury and I said to myself at that moment not to be too dramatic here but I said to myself at that moment that's what I can do because it was a perfect sort of marriage of brain trauma and sports which is what I want to do for a living and long story short I ended up having a mentor a guy named Mark Lovell and a guy named Joe maroon he's a neurosurgeon they were my mentors and

[00:05:25] I was at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit at the time doing my fellowship and Mark Lovell came into me and said hey Mickey do you want to move to Pittsburgh and I'm like not really but why and he said well there's they're starting an orthopedic big Orthopedic Sports Medicine Center there they want us to do a concussion program there and I'm like you know let's go check it out so we came here to Pittsburgh and long story short I came here with my mentor Mark Lovell and Joe maroon is here is a neurosurgeon and the three of us started this program in 2000 and that was at a time when when I mean we had no patience no one could care about concussion literally we started researching it slowly but surely we published many papers on it published a big paper in

[00:06:09] Jama in 1999 actually I was the lead author on that paper where we looked at college football and concussion and it was at Michigan State University and we did some baseline testing with guys and I tell always tell the story It's Kind of a Funny Story like I wanted to do research on college football players and

[00:06:27] I was like okay we're gonna Baseline test these guys if they have a concussion repeat the testing to see what we can find and I naively thought I'm just going to go to the medical staff of Michigan State and say Hey I want to work with your football team I did do that but they said well we're interested but you have to meet with the head coach to get approval so I went into the head coach's office and that coach was Nick Saban and that was the first coach I ever Broach this to and he said you know what I think that's a great idea and we researched this at Michigan

[00:06:58] State we then started working University of Florida we worked the University of Utah ironically came to Pittsburgh and worked with them all that data we collected we published and that was published in Jama in 1999 which was one of the first groundbreaking studies of looking at concussion in sports and that ended up getting us here to

[00:07:20] Pittsburgh and then we started growing this pit this program in Pittsburgh and when I the first five years I swear I worked in a cubicle and I would see maybe two or three patients a week if that and I was doing research Etc and now fast forward 23 years later we have 20 000 patient visits a year to our program we've published over 450 500 papers we've written books we've given talks around the world and it's probably the hottest Topic in sports medicine so it's been quite a ride uh I'd like to think that we've learned a hell of a lot about this injury over that 23 years and hopefully we can share some of that wisdom today well that's an awesome overview and I think it speaks to uh you know an interesting and familiar sort of path in medicine a lot of times people you know what looks completely unappealing and uninteresting becomes the most uh remarkable you know direction and you know to pursue I mean whether it's you know immunotherapy and cancer that you know in the 80s looked like a total no man's land a graveyard for research is now clearly the most promising therapeutic in oncology so let's let's get to some of the semantics I mean I think everybody's heard the word concussion but what actually is it what is the diagnosis how subjective versus objective is it what are the criteria so the word concussis literally translates from Latin to

[00:08:42] English to mean to shake violently and if you think about your brain as like an egg yolk inside a neck shell you know the brain is is is inside this hard you know cavity and if you have acceleration deceleration or translational forces that are hard enough the brain is going to shift inside the skull and that shifting of the skull is actually what causes concussion when the brain moves inside the skull the membrane to the neuron will stretch and when that membrane stretches this little little chemical called potassium which is supposed to be inside the neuron will leak into the extracellular space and when that does there's an increased demand for glucose or energy that occurs due to the release of potassium at the same time does it influx a calcium so calcium leaks across that same stretch membrane goes into the cell and when calcium goes into the cell we get vasoconstriction and decrease cerebral blood flow so at the very time the brain's demanding more energy due to the hyperglycolysis we get an influx of calcium vasoconstriction and decreased cerebral blood flowing decrease energy

[00:09:44] Supply and so what concussion is is a mismatch between demand and supply of energy to the cell now this is not enough to cause cell death while area and degeneration there's no structural changes to the neuron there's no depth of the neuron but the cells struggle to operate at their normal efficiency and we've now learned that when that energy problem happens different systems in the brain can be decompensated and that decompensation of certain systems we've now learned there's different types of concussions there's actually six different types of problems we see following concussion and that those different types of concussions help to determine how we treat the problem so as a clinician my job is to find out where the aberrant signal is coming from and what system is decompensated and then we have to apply the right treatment to the right problem none of anything I just told you we knew in 2000 none of it and so we've now really learned a lot about how this injury occurs we we understand the pathophysiology fairly well not completely well as animal model work that's been looked at with that and we more importantly we now clinically know how to evaluate this injury in a way where we can kind of figure out what's happening and then apply a more targeted treatment to its true to its treatment now one thing is Peter is that we don't have a biomarker right now for this injury we don't there's no blood test that's ready for prime time there's no serum serum marker there's no Imaging this is not seen in MRI it's not seen on pet scan it's not seen on functional MRI it's not seen on MRI it's not seen on Meg it's not seen on EEG there's no Imaging studies right now that definitively help us with this diagnosis and um even CSF fluid if you could access it no and we're doing that but no all those things are looked at people are very smart people are looking into those things and researching it but I do not have a biomarker to measure this injury it's it's at the cellular level it's an energy crisis there's no structural changes in the brain that we see following concussion and everyone is like searching for that biomarker but right now we just don't have it and I don't see that happening in the foreseeable future I mean there's a lot of good work being done on it there might be a panel of biomarkers that we look at you know but in this discussion of certain certain markers may help us but no at this point in time there's nothing I would tell you that's ready for prime time just to go back to the beginning of this so make sure I understand this um you have this uh movement of the brain relative to its its uh protection in the skull the membrane of the neuron stretches so presumably it's you have a passive effusion of potassium out of the neuron as a result of that is the demand for glycolysis so that you can actively pump potassium back in against unfavorable gradient correct okay so that's why you need glucose more

[00:13:03] ATP Force potassium back into where it doesn't want to go and then tell me about the calcium why is the calcium uh is the calcium just following a gradient across the stretch stretch membrane at that moment I don't know if we have an answer to that but yes that's my understanding of it and when that pulse when that calcium goes into the cell you know we get a vasoconstriction decreased rubber blood flow and this is very clearly an energy crisis for what we call a metabolic mismatch that occurs to the cell the important thing at this point is we don't feel the cells die from this they're just operating at a different level of efficiency and what we literally see happen with this is different systems in the brain that require a lot of energy don't work as efficiently and they will literally decompensate from that energy problem and that's given us some good understanding of how to kind of approach this injury actually it's it's uh we can get into the different problems we see from concussion but yeah it's basically these systems that aren't working as efficiently as they should how Global versus focal is this type of injury so if you have two injuries if you have two athletes uh and by the way

[00:14:16] I think we're going to talk a lot about athletes but the reality of it is you can get into a car accident and have the same injuries this happens a lot more in non-athletes than it does athletes uh but you know we use Sports as a laboratory it's a great petri dish to study this injury but this applies to slip and Falls car accidents all kinds of older people fall and boy that's a real problem that no one's really addressing so keep going I'm sorry yeah so so let's just say we took two individuals who at the macro level appear to have a very similar insult yep is this process occurring across the entire spectrum of neurons or could two people say no no actually this is occurring far more in the temporal lobe in you and it's occurring more in the frontal lobe in you and and is it uh clearly there's going to be a clinical diagnosis that's going to be required to differentiate that but again just at the pathophysiologic level what's the what's the diffusity of this it's an interesting question I wouldn't look at this as more like this affects the hippocampus or this affects the prefrontal gyrus or whatever I wouldn't look at it that way I'd look at this is it more effects systems in the brain and

[00:15:23] Pathways in the brain and so there's really no known like you get hit in the head here you have this symptom that's that's Antiquated in terms of how we think about this it's more systematically looking at how the brain's functioning okay so now with that said interestingly we do see that posterior when people hit the back of their head you see a very kind of specific presentation of problems from that that I can get into later um but there's really no like you hit your head this way you have this problem rather Peter and this is important concussion fights dirty like whatever you bring to the table that's weak seems to be affected more more more generally in patients in other words there's pre-existing risk factors to have a worse outcome from this injury that will probably be quite surprising to hear for people and not only those risk factors not only put you at more risk for Less

[00:16:19] Force causing concussion but they tell you what kind of concussion you're likely to have if you do have a concussion for example we talked about the the different types of concussions if you have a history of car sickness in your past we've published a lot of data showing that those patients are more likely to get concussed and have a vestibular problem following concussion if you have history sorry just to make sure I understand that they're more likely to get concussed or if they get concussed they're more likely to have vestibular symptoms is it both both correct yeah less force will cause injury in those patients um patients that have issue migraine less force causes injury and it's more and you're going to get on that migraine pathway if you have a history of lazy eye or strabismus um you're going to go down the ocular pathway and yes unless force causes injury if you have a history of anxiety you're going to go down that pathway more ubiquitously so there's almost a neuronal reserve thing here you know we talk about cognitive reserve and movement Reserve when we think about

[00:17:26] Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease respectively you're now talking about a concussive Reserve I I think so I don't know if I'd use those terms and I'm familiar with that terminology and it's been around for a long long time and I I guess it sort of applies to this um so researcher out of UCLA kind of coined that phrase cognitive Reserve but yeah I mean generally speaking we're getting the Weeds on that but I would say yeah I mean you're you're more vulnerable with these different risk factors and you more likely go down different

[00:18:00] Pathways and girls are more likely to have concussions than boys um neck strength plays a role with that hormonal influences can play a role with that and we've also know that girls are six times more likely to have migraine and have car sickness in boys and so they're more at risk for this these problems sixty percent of the girl of the patients that come through our

[00:18:21] Clinic are female 40 are male the reason why is because they're a more vulnerable population and we see a lot longer outcomes in females than we do males because of some of those factors how long is the susceptibility to a subsequent concussion higher um following a concussion so I mean I'm sure everybody who's watched football highlights has noticed I think it was a quarterback for the Dolphins last year I mean just had a series of devastating concussions and you couldn't help but think was the subsequent concussion really a result of not being you know better from the first one I mean how long is that um that vulnerability present yeah not talking about that case specifically but generally speaking there is a definite vulnerability when you're recovering from an initial injury in that less force will cause more serious outcome if you're still recovering from the first event and do you ever get back to

[00:19:20] Baseline yes absolutely um I I firmly believe and we've published a lot of papers on this that concussion is a treatable injury I firmly believe that if you manage the injury effectively and treat it fully we don't see repetitive chronic cumulative problems I firmly believe that the best way to prevent problems with from concussion is to manage it effectively when you have one and we are very good now at determining recovery and how what that looks like and how we that looks in our examination how that looks with the testing that we do and the data points that we use

[00:19:58] I am a big proponent of kids playing sports I'm a big proponent of really manage this injury effectively again getting kids back to the sports they love because it's a very healthy thing for them to be doing and we haven't found problems down the road in patients that are managed effectively now the key here though

[00:20:17] Peter is to manage it effectively when you have one and you don't want to Stack these things up and people that do can get in trouble with it and this is becoming a very specialist kind of thing to see you want to go to someone that knows what they're doing to manage this injury effectively when you have one you want to make sure you get the right assessment done the right tools because there's really there's there's definite morbidity when this isn't managed properly for sure let's go back to the the the the person the athlete the non-athlete whatever who has the who has that injury so we've already established we have no biomarker right so correct this person gets their

[00:20:56] Bell rung be it in a car accident or on the football field and it's a clinical diagnosis so tell me if you're at the sidelines or if you're in the clinic when the person shows up the next day what are they typically complaining of and what are you doing to make that diagnosis so there's approximately 21 different symptoms on the field that you can see following concussion and it depends on what type of concussion you have um there are signs and there are symptoms of injury signs are what you outwardly observe symptoms of what the patient reports signs of concussion include loss of consciousness it includes confusion it includes balance issues includes vomiting those are all signs of injury symptoms of injury are dizziness fogginess or feeling detached feeling one step behind light sensitive noise sensitive nauseous fatigued blurred vision double vision fuzzy

[00:21:57] Vision headache headache of course yeah thank you for that one um another uh you know post-traumatic Amnesia retrograde amnesia loss of memory before the injury loss of memory after the injury any we've done a lot of research looking at these different signs and symptoms and their their relative ability to predict outcomes

[00:22:18] I'll give you 20 bucks Peter if you tell me the the one the on-field symptom that best predicts a longer recovery from concussion I mean I would have guessed loss of consciousness but that seems too obvious yeah yeah that would be uh that would be obvious and it's incorrect actually on-field dizziness is six times more predictive than any other symptom we're predicting a longer out from concussion and this is the second symptom that best predicts outcome is fogginess kind of feeling one step behind attached removed dizziness is six times more likely to cause a long longer being a month or longer recovery than it than is losing consciousness um wow yeah right um and you know what's interesting about that is this is this it's really interesting is that the symptoms of injury way better predict poor outcome than the signs of injury and the reason for that is because if you lose consciousness it's very unlikely you're going to go back to play you know like you're not going to get put back to play if you lose consciousness unless you're in some archaic sport you know and or in some geographical area that has been exposed to this information right so when you lose conscious as you get taken out of play and you're not going to get put back to play that may be why these symptoms predict worse outcomes because a lot of patients tend to play through their injury and we just published the paper and we've published a series of papers in Pediatrics Jama and other journals where we looked at we we asked the question if patients have a head injury and they have symptoms of concussion what happens if we take them out of play immediately or what happens if they continue to play and what do their outcomes look like and so we did this very cool study sorry this is not done prospectively this is done retrospectively retrospectively right because it's hard to do prospectively because yeah of course right but retrospectively we looked at a very large database we had about I think 300 kids in the sample 150 of them had symptoms or signs of concussion and they came out of play immediately and then 150 of them continue to play after having those signs and symptoms okay the people that got taken out of play immediately their average recovery time was 18 days and patients who returned to play and played for just 15 minutes before beyond the point of their injury or point of having symptoms their average recovery time was 44 days so just playing 15 minutes through this event added almost you know close to a month onto the recovery and now how are you how are you able to control for the severity of the initial event presumably there's a bias there right which is that the kids who came out right away

[00:25:08] I don't know you know they maybe they uh were more in tune with something you know I mean it it it's hard to do that without randomization right we did we did control for a lot of factors no group loss Consciousness more than another group no group had more symptoms than another group so we were able to statistically control for that but very and it's such a big difference 18 to 44 days is a big enough difference that even if it's not exactly that there seems to be a signal somewhere in there there is and then we did another paper follow-up paper we looked at dose response and it's really powerful so for every minute you try to play through your injury you add on like seven or eight days of recovery it's it's quite powerful and so yeah you don't want to play through this stuff you know and and a lot of kids and parents may not be aware that getting dizzy on the sideline is the most powerful predictor of outcome or feeling foggy or feeling tired or you know blurred vision double vision I mean

[00:26:10] I played Sports my whole life as I'm sure you did Peter I you know I wouldn't come out of Play If I had those symptoms I probably wouldn't report it at all you know and we we need to do a really good job of educating parents on that but at the same token I want kids to play sport I'm not fear-mongering here I I truly believe this is an injury that's treatable and we can get kids back to the sports they love but it just shows you the differences and outcomes when it's not managed properly initially early on and and then we're getting now into all our research looking at how we treat this injury which we're doing really well with and we can get kids Better Faster by applying certain treatments and get them back to place sooner well I definitely want to hear about that and I think that's where most people's you know gonna ears all perk up but let's go back again to these different types I think you mentioned that there are sort of six different types is that so basically based on presentation um and based on subsequent testing that you might do you would then elucidate these these six different types is that how it works yeah so we do an evaluation where we ask about symptoms obviously do a very good clinical interview we have a physical exam that we do called the volumes stands for vestibular ocular motor screening we do impact testing and often familiar with the neuroconive test it's a computer-based neurocon of test that has been FDA approved that allows us to quantify and look at the the concussion in a more objective way looking at their cognition there's different neurocognitive correlates that we see with these different types of concussions Etc but you put all this information together and yeah and we're doing research now looking at these different you know phenotypes and different problems we see from concussion but each of these different types of concussions are going to have different symptoms they're going to have different

[00:28:00] Pro different risk factors um different therapeutic you know techniques to treat it and different outcomes and different return to play sort of situations so um the different do you want to I mean getting into it I'd love to hear them yeah let's hear what they are so there's the six different types of concussions cognitive we actually call it cognitive fatigue the second is vestibular which is not the ear it's more the central Pathways in the brain you know the vestibular system is is a very significant system in the brain that starts to inner ear and then kind of goes the Deep parts of the brain we're talking about more centrally derived problems from the from the central part of a similar system or the brain part the third type of concussion is ocular which is your eyes working together as a team it's not your vision as much as ocular motor the fourth type is migraine which is what it sounds like headache with nausea and or lighter noise sensitivity and other symptoms as well and then the fifth type is anxiety the sixth subtype is neck you can have some of these symptoms coming from the neck um not very common but you can so those are the six different problems we will see from concussion now patients may have one of those problems or they may have all six they're not mutually exclusive um and the more you have the more difficult it is to treat but you are going to treat each of those different each of those problems in a in a distinct way or in a targeted way and that's you know if there's 30 different types of knee injuries why do we think there's one type of concussion you know and but yeah it's it's we're starting to really be able to better identify kind of where the Signal's coming from with this injury and is there um an age and or um gender difference between these yeah um well first of all you may not be aware but we published a lot of data on this the Adolescent brain if we looked at high school kids versus College athletes and then College athletes versus professional athletes the high school kids take the longest to recover from concussion the college athletes take the second longest and professional athletes recover more quickly than the other two there's a lot of sort of vulnerabilities of the Adolescent brain to this injury you got to be careful of and but there is an age relationship that we've published extensively on what do you think that's a result of do you think that the younger brain has a different hormonal milieu do you think yeah do you think that that's the biggest driver of that uh distinction

[00:30:39] I I don't know and we're doing research in that now we're actually doing a really cool women's study on concussion looking at some hormonal influences and we've found that menstruation can change after a head injury and that was the first question that was going to come to my mind is it would be so interesting to understand how a woman's menstrual cycle and therefore you know not just menstrual cycle but also like where is she ovulating where is she in the follicular and luteal phase because the estrogen progesterone swings in those phases are enormous of course it begs the question are those hormones protective right yeah and we actually are we we're just about ready to Embark the first women's study on this injury we're collaborating with McGee hospital here at UPMC with our clinic and it's exciting work we just got a grant to look at that but we have published a paper already in Jama neurology I believe where we showed that uh the menstrual cycle does change uh relative to patients that don't have head injuries so this there's a lot to learn that's a cool thing is again we started doing this work and when no one cared about it and now there's too much work to be done and everyone cares about it it's it's fascinating and what what do you attribute that to by the way how much of that do you think um is is an indirect or even a direct consequence of the attention that's been brought to brain injury through the light of CTE vis-a-vis the NFL yeah it's an interesting question I mean clearly the spotlight in this injury is iridescent you know and clearly the NFL is a very powerful Enterprise and there's a lot of eyes on it and there's a lot of discussion open discussion on this topic which is a good thing in a lot of ways it drives science and it drives awareness but too much awareness without a solution is called Hysteria and we see that happen with this injury when the reality is is that there's a lot of misinformation out there about concussion I think it actually hurts outcomes a lot of times clinicians that aren't aware of the recent advances in knowing how to treat this clinicians that don't know how to do the right evaluation and there's a lot of mismanagement and mistreatment of this injury that leads to very poor outcomes again and you're going to hear it from me over and over again if you bring me a patient with concussion I I can pretty much tell you I can treat that and get get that patient better and get them back to the sports they love there are highly effective treatments with this injury is this the sort of thing where there's a relatively finite window in which you or the physician treating has to be able to access the patient and the further a patient is from that window absent the

[00:33:29] Natural History resolution the more difficult that gets okay so I'll answer that with data um we just did a study again published in I think it was in Jama neurology as well where we looked at what factors best predict outcomes from concussion um you know migraine is a huge Factor predicting outcome history migraine to certain symptoms that predict outcomes but we looked at all those things the the one factor that best predicted outcome was how quickly they get into our Clinic if they were seen by us within seven days that was the best predictor of someone who got better from their injury because we can apply our treatments quickly and if you do wait it's harder to treat and but

[00:34:12] I I still will argue even if you're a year out two years out three years out from this injury we can treat it effectively the great majority of the time it's not irreversible you can get patients better even if they've been living with it chronically Peter today I mean I saw patients all morning I had 20 patients on my schedule before our podcast um I just saw a race car driver from

[00:34:36] Phoenix or someplace and they've been going through this for two years and miserable we will get that patient better they will be normal when we finish treating them there's nothing I'm seeing that worries me about them if you can without giving any information that would identify this individual can you give a bit of a sense of this as a case study so presumably two years ago this guy was involved in an accident yeah I was involved in an accident um didn't really had the all the

[00:35:06] Hallmark symptoms of vestibular problems what type of accident by the way was this one where it was just a coup Contra coup injury where he whiplashed I mean you know we wear a Hans in a car which limits our recoil now I did the video on it and this isn't at the highest levels of racing so I'm not sure sure you know you know and we do work a lot with those patients but this is a this is a small

[00:35:27] Track event or something where the patient got somehow got hit in a way their car rotated and went backwards into the wall okay in this video I actually saw the video of the head and their head you know hit the back of the headrest and there was no loss of consciousness but the person immediately felt foggy the slow wavy dizzy they had a headache uh they felt fatigued uh they had bilateral blurred vision early on but no loss of consciousness no memory loss no confusion they obviously the car was totaled so they didn't race but they didn't also get medically evaluated after this they kind of went about their lives and continue to have those symptoms and went back to racing two weeks later and got it in another accident and had the same problem occur same mechanism even and that's when everything obviously got worse and when they sought medical attention but they've been living with that for two years they have not improved they came to me today they're having everyday headaches that can get up to an eight out of ten light sensitive noise sensitive foggy they don't like busy environments they can't they don't like exercising because they get really dizzy they get headache they get sick to their stomach they've got a lot of car sickness they have a lot of sympathetic nerves this this sounds debilitating oh this is this is this this is destroys your life it destroys your life and this is a person who is not racing anymore they're not working because of it um they have massive sympathetic nervous system arousal where they can't sleep at night they're very foggy um very very worked up um and they very much are isolative they don't want to be around other people because that triggers the vestibular problems and so they become more reclusive you know they find themselves exercising minimally they're socially very inactive they're not preoccupied with their mind so there's a lot their thoughts are going so fast because the nervous system is racing so they're in their head all day long and it cross you know migraines and so you I mean that's what I just saw this morning Peter and I do it all day long and this is an injury that is this causes so many problems in patients so notwithstanding the fact that this poor guy has been needlessly suffering hope you know for a couple years tell me in Broad Strokes what are what are you going to do to help this person and um and and what's a Time course that you would give him for a reasonable expectation of recovery um okay so we saw the patients today and we have a very good evaluation we do and the cool thing is we're very used to seeing out of town patients here a lot of my patients are out of town so they have five appointments in one day I'm the point guard of it but we also have a vestibular therapist here we have what's called exertion therapy here we have a psychiatrist here we have a behavioral optometrist that we can use um we have neck people we can use so it's all under one roof so people will have appointments schedules throughout the day they come to see me I did the evaluation I kind of find out what was going on but what we're able to identify our evaluation today is the patient has a significant vestibular problem that has not been treated and the vascular system when it's not working well is going to cause a lot of dizziness it's going to cause a lot of fogginess it's going to cause environmental sensitivity busy environments will bother them they don't want to exercise because movement bothers them the vestibular system is responsible for interpreting motion and when that system doesn't work remember this injury decompensates that system that signal comes through aberrantly and it will trigger all these really icky symptoms it's like a bad car sickness they feel now the vestibular system the same Pathways in the brain that control that system mediate our sympathetic nervous system and so the patients will also have massive sympathetic nervous system arousal fight or flight right you know so thoughts go faster heart rate increases they get a lot of cortisol a lot a lot of problems going on from the nervous system and that's all triggered by the head injury and so they're living in this fight or flight situation and then when patients go into certain environments where they feel crappy it not only triggers the vestibular problem but it triggers that fight or flight response and patients will then in a very pavlovian way avoid those environments and then they don't want to work they don't want to exercise and what do you think happens it triggers migraine because patients that have a massive sympathetic nervous system arousal they get headaches people get migraines when they're stressed and people get migraines where they don't sleep consistently and people get migraines when they don't exercise consistently that's why people get migraines and so what started off as one problem with a vestibular problem becomes an anxiety problem or a sympathetic nervous system problem and then it becomes a migraine problem and then migraine actually feeds back through the vestibular Pathways in the ocular Pathways so you can also have a lot of problems from that secondarily to the migraine does that all make sense to you it absolutely does and it's it's it's uncanny in how much it reminds me of an injury that someone very close to me had which was uh riding a bike down the side of the road 25 miles an hour you know 40K so really at a good clip and a runner jetted out between two cars didn't you know was probably listening for cars but didn't think about a bike and there was a head-to-head Collision so cyclists head into runner's head um I knew the cyclist not the runner they both were devastated by this injury this the runner took the brunt of it had a complete fracture of the face um but the the cyclist was you know for two years couldn't be uh couldn't be in a room with the TV on um you know any noise that the kids made was

[00:41:27] I mean just would make this person very irritable so it's it's very similar to what you're describing yeah that's because it's similar Peter because that's the pathway these patients go down and it's very predictable how they go down this it's not only pavlovian meaning they're conditioned to go on this pathway but it's all biological it's it really triggers these things in a very robust way and it's a very very very the these people describe it because

[00:41:58] I've now spoken with a couple of patients that have gone through this they describe it in as Stark terms as someone would the most severe mental illness which is to say I'm not myself anymore so whoever I used to be that person is gone I am this new person that has nothing in common with the old one and it's all in the wrong direction now

[00:42:19] I mean what percentage of people are are of of all comers and concussions how many are this severe the patients that come see me from out of town almost all of them um because they haven't been treated and now some come to me and they're actually feeling pretty well they just want to know if they can go back to sports after having x amount of concussions and some of those patients aren't sick like that but yeah if I I have on my schedule every week I have something like

[00:42:50] I'll see upwards of 70 to 100 patients a week with this injury um I've got on my schedule slots for probably 12 to 16 out of town patients a week probably 80 of those patients are as sick as what we're describing here so it's not so what will be what will be the next step for this gentleman okay that we're talking about so we can treat all of that but it's completely antithetical to how you think we treat it so what's the one word

[00:43:28] Peter that comes to mind when you think about what should I do when I have a concussion what's that word rest you're exactly right and you're absolutely wrong in how we approach this injury I'm oh for two Mickey no you I set you up there but but if you look at like the literature over the years it's like oh you have a brain injury it's an energy problem you need to rest that patient that makes all of this worse when you take that tact because the way we treat of a similar problem is by retraining it it's not rest the way we treat anxieties by increasing parasympathetic nervous system arousal which is exercise right you know it's regulated sleep it's you know the way we treat a vestibular problem is by ex by retraining it so I want them in busy environments I want them exercising we got to get them on a good sleep schedule we gotta treat the vestibular problem with very targeted Physical

[00:44:25] Therapy we have exercises that treat that we actually have what's called exertion therapy here if you come see me with a concussion I don't care how sick you are I am working you out and I'm doing it aggressively a lot of times we take a very active very targeted very exposure-based model to treating this problem but you need to see a specialist in how to do that because you can do it the wrong way and make patients worse it's got to be very targeted in how you approach this with patients and every patient's different and it's breaking down in different ways there's different types of vestibular problems there's different types of oculomotor problems there's different types of personality characteristics Etc that you have to account for when you're treating this injury but at the end of the day if you match the right treatment to the right problem you can get better from this and that's what we do all day long here is is treat those problems what I find interesting is that be it two years ago in the case of this this gentleman you know that injury took place right so you have the energy crisis takes place the vasoconstriction takes place the mismatch of supply and demand takes place is it likely the case that if you could biopsy his brain today or let's be even more creative you could put yourself onto a nanoparticle spaceship and enter his brain today everything looks totally normal at the cellular level yes or do you think that it's still microscopically aberrant I don't know the answer that I wish I did but my suspicion and based on everything

[00:46:04] I've learned about the pathophysiology of this is that we should see a normal brain structurally and anatomically and even physiologically um it's just what happens when this injury happens as to what systems are affected and then you can kind of go down these Pathways if it's not treated appropriately and that's what ends up happening it seems that of those six phenotypes you described this vestibular one is very problematic because it seems to amplify the other ones but again am I interpreting that correct yeah you kind of are I mean we actually have done research on that if you looked at the most common types of concussion we published a study on this as well the the most common problem we see after concussion is post-traumatic headache and migraine that's the number one profile that we see this oh no I'm sorry I apologize let me retract that the number one profile that we see is anxiety and then migraine and then vestibular and then ocular and then fatigue cognitive fatigue so we actually have done work on that so anxiety is ubiquitous across this injury and that is what is the most common clinical profile that we'll see is that nervous system issue it's it's interesting though because you also said if I recall that no uh symptom predicts a worse outcome more than dizziness and that of course makes me think well dizziness is so tied to vestibular right and I agree with that so there is something about this vestibular problem that by the way would also amplify anxiety so you know you know how we do research and we look at the numbers and you publish that my gut is the vestibular stuff carries the day with this injury the great majority of the time or at least it kicks it off Peter you know like a lot of times I'll see patients right it's a vicious cycle that spins out of control from that exactly I would agree with that I'm not going to over generalize to every human being because there really is it's a very different presentation a lot of different people like I'll see people that come in here that have an oculomotor problem that no one's identified and have no vestibular issues they have no migraine they're completely normal except they can't focus when they look at their math homework and they get headaches in the front of their head and they're tired that's an oculomotor problem that we can fix pretty easily and that's just a PT program yeah we have to retrain the ocular system and we have exercises that we've you know that can do that very effectively um and so we see those patients but yeah the vestibular stuff is is ubiquitous and but there's patients I see where the vestibular problems clearly kick this off but that's not present anymore it's all migraine and anxiety but it came from that that beginning if that makes sense and it sounds like your friend there that got that horrific bike accident that sounds terrible by the way um like it sounds like he's gone down that profile you're right I mean here's what's amazing after two two and a half three years maybe yeah he just kinda got better that's good and and um yeah I mean maybe part of it is that he did double down on exercise nutrition and sleep that's it yeah yeah he started getting the right information from someone but that patient Peter if you send them to me a month after this entry I would have had them better you'd have saved him how much like within how many months how many months is he better if I had seen him the first week after the injury now listen I don't wanna I don't know the case was there a subject sure sure but in general but in general uh we could have gotten better in definitely weeks not months wow for sure yeah so this this gentleman today that you saw he's gonna go back to

[00:49:55] Phoenix or wherever he's from after he's had this amazing eval um what's his homework assignment meaning what or the actual types of pts and activities he's going to do and when do you see him again so I'll see him back um in uh four weeks they'll come back and see me um and he has been given a very detailed set of vestibular exercises to complete every morning and evening he has been given an exercise program uh we pretty much kicked him around the gym a little bit and got him moving when this vestibular system breaks down you have to move in certain ways to treat it and we're very good at doing that we're in sports medicine so we know how to move people and we've given them very specific workout that will treat over that will train that vestibular system and while we're doing that we're also increasing the parasympathetic nervous system by doing exercise so it's killing two birds if that makes sense and exercise also treats migraines so that's three birds we're killing by doing the exercise stuff he'll do that workout program every day how long will that be how many how many minutes a day will he spend exercising I have I'm going to have him walk in the morning for 45 minutes and he does that very rigorous workout in the afternoon and it takes about 45 minutes to an hour and he's to do that every day until I see him back wow can you give me an example of some of the exercises he'll do in the afternoon there's for this patient he had a horizontal vestibular ocular reflex problem so this is your vestibular ocular reflex and when he moves his head side to side he can't stay tracking when he does this correct and he also will stir him up with dizziness and fogginess and headaches um so we have him doing like a Russian twist where actually he's got a ball and he throws it against the wall so we have him sort of really kind of train that vestibular system we have him doing planks with head turns we have him doing lateral shuffles you know that kind of stuff and when you have more of a vertical plane thing we're doing a lot of burpees you know we're doing a lot of different things like that where it's more linear or you know you know vertical or rather than horizontal movements this system will break down in distinct ways um and given he's a race car driver that vestibular ocular reflex when he's looking over his looking side to side like that affects his racing that's his money maker he's better at that than I am that's why he's such a good racer right you know so that injury affected the very system that makes him who he is right so but we can retrain that by giving the reaction so what this looks like he goes home does the vestibular exercises morning night does our work or workout program night

[00:52:31] I want a regulated sleep schedule gets up same time goes to bed same time no napping um I want him to do exposures to busy environments grocery stores restaurants parties whatever I want them doing a lot of external activities I don't want them internal I don't want them like thinking about his symptoms I don't want him ruminating because the nervous system is so fired up downtime makes this all worse so we're going to challenge him there's three different types of exposures I want them to do every day in terms of busy environments and exercise and different ocular things it's a very detailed program that's all written down and they go home and do it and I don't want to talk to them for a month uh and then he'll come back and see me sometimes we do telemedicine a month later but this guy's coming back to see me because he's pretty sick we have medications that can help sometimes with this depends on what the problem is but there's meds I'm not going to do that I don't ever try to do meds initially we want to see if we can treat this behaviorally and then we'll do meds if we need to what what are some of the the meds that might be kicked in I mean are there meds that help with sleep for example like trazodone or yeah I don't like trazodone too much because the sleep is coming from the nervous system problem so you're treating a secondary Problem by treating by putting them on Trazodone sometimes it's an SSRI sometimes it's a tricyclic sometimes it's you know so there's different meds that we'll use for that there's certain ssris that are a little more effective than others in treating the nervous system profile I don't like it which ones are uh Sertraline is a medication that can actually affect not only the vestibular system but the nervous system as well so we've had decent outcomes with that but sometimes you need a Wellbutrin sometimes you need an effects or sometimes you need you know Lexapro or escitalopram or whatever there's different meds that will help with these problems but and we have a psychiatrist here that's phenomenal is this one of those things where it's just kind of empirical and yes you have a hunch as to what you're going to do but if in a month it's not better you you sort of abort regardless of what you the data say we follow these patients very carefully and I will see them every three to four weeks until they're normal whether it be via telemedicine and they need those follow-up appointments because they can get off the rails with this stuff some people aren't as compliant as they should be you know some people fall they sometimes they hit walls with migraine or anxiety or different problems but at the end of the day Peter and I'm not just blowing

[00:54:57] Sunshine we can get the great majority of these patients better it just needs to be done in a very targeted and diligent way but I there's I don't want this to come off as whatever but there's not a patient I don't believe I can treat I mean I really truly believe you come to me with concussion I'm Gonna Get You better from this and it's how many of the how many of the male patients come in with hypogonadism as a result of this so something shuts off in their pituitary and all of a sudden they're just not making testosterone anymore for example there's there's so many Downstream things that can happen from a rampant sympathetic nervous system it affects every bodily organ we have right you know it affects the gut it affects hormonal influences it affects everything we can we function as as temperature regulation migraine there's so many different things it affects there's a lot of Downstream problems that we can see from this I haven't looked at that topic um would we find something perhaps yeah it would be so interesting how the HPA I just would wonder how the HPA axis functions after especially in cases like this gentleman where there's such a chronic insult um that I I can't help but imagine if both centrally and peripherally there's some manifestation of this and and to your point like you wouldn't want to just get into a game of whack-a-mole where you're just treating all of those things right you'd want to put all your effort of course into like what's the central problem here how are we going to address the root cause yeah thank you for that because yeah if you treat the root cause those secondary Downstream problems don't occur and that's why seeing these patients early can really lead to better outcomes and we don't see those problems happen in the first place

[00:56:44] I want to ask you about a couple of other things that I get asked about a lot for which I have no answer right so one of them is the use of hyperbaric oxygen um have you guys studied this yeah and I'm not a believer in it um and it's not something that's going to reverse the problems we see with this injury and quite honestly

[00:57:04] I don't want patients doing Superfluous treatments that aren't well founded empirically because it leads them into this sort of anxiety sort of model where they're just feeding into the problems and we see that a lot with this injury and and I don't blame them because no one's getting them better so they're trying all kinds of different things but no I will not have patients do hyperbaric treatment with this injury because it just leads to more searching and seeking that's not targeted and we see patients that want to do hyperbarics but there's no data that has compelled me to tell you that hyperbarics would have any effect positively or negatively on outcomes from this injury yeah and the one thing I always discuss with my patients they're usually asking me in a different context which is hey does hyperbaric chamber improve longevity and they always point to this very poorly done study in Israel that supposedly showed that telomeres got longer in a hyperbaric chamber although

[00:58:01] I have to break it to them that telomere elongation has nothing to do with longevity but the point I always make to them is the one of opportunity cost so if you know we're here in Austin there's a there's a hyperbaric chamber in town so if you want to go and do Hyperbaric you know work you got to go drive 30 minutes to get there you're going to spend an hour in the chamber at two atmospheres and then you're gonna drive back so you just put two hours a day into this for four or five days a week and so the question is even if you're completely cost agnostic are you truly time agnostic what could you have done with that time vis-a-vis improving your health and in the case of longevity I mean if you spend half that time exercising that you're going to get you know 10x the the value and I suspect in the case of your patients the same is true right if they you're not you're asking for 90 minutes to two hours of their time in total to do the brisk walk in this vigorous exercise well you know the that's that's more time than they would put into a chamber and and of course the data it sounds like our that the chamber isn't efficacious is that true you know another question I get asked is if you could get into a hyperbaric chamber the day of the injury would that move the needle has that been studied no because it's hard to study that um but to my knowledge no there's no compelling data in any way shape or form the Hyperbaric treatments to be effective at treating this problem and I think you just stated things very well Peter I agree entirely with how you just sort of conceptualize that and to add to it what do you do when you're in a hyperbaric chamber well you think about crap a lot you ruminate yeah yeah and we don't want rumination with this it doesn't go well another treatment option that I've had an interest in um is the use of synthetic ketones specifically acetoacetate or beta hydroxybutyrate being in the system if one could do that prior to an injury so again this assumes only in certain cases you would do it it wouldn't help you against the car accident because you don't know when you're going to have a car accident but if football players were drinking you know had synthetic ketones in their system such that they had one to two millimole of BHB coursing through their uh through their system at the time of an injury there's at least a very strong theoretical argument and there's some animal data to suggest that could ameliorate some of these symptoms because of course you immediately have a solution to that energy that short-term energy crisis in that you don't have to rely on glucose you get 70 of that injury from from Ketone have you looked at any of those data no um we're not doing animal model work here nor are we doing that sort of research

[01:00:50] I don't to my knowledge that has not been done I think theoretically it's interesting um there's a lot this injuries is such a hot focus on it I'd be interested to look at that specifically in the literature but I'm not aware of any research that but it it makes sense but yeah I mean I guess you to study that rigorously you'd want to have a pool of presumably athletes where the frequency of concussion is high enough that you could basically set it is it safe to say like I don't know

[01:01:22] Collegiate uh high school or Collegiate football players would have the highest uh incidence of concussion yeah football leads the way um but it's it's but women's soccer is you know is very high as well women's basketball is High um but yeah football is the most actually the sport that carries the highest risk of concussion in terms of

[01:01:45] Lifetime incidents what do you think that sport is Logan I would have to guess boxing no no uh 90 of equestrians have concussions over the course of their careers so a question I love that I'm now oh for three just we got to keep this quiz but given that tell me why are they falling or is it the bouncing no it's not the bouncing it's the falling and the horse is a very large Beast you know you fall from a high degree but but given that the goal of boxing is to render your opponent concussed

[01:02:17] I would expect that probably is even higher than equestrian sports but the research just hasn't been really good there because a lot of patients don't report the problems that occur um obviously boxing is a very common sport when this happens so this is a very common injury I don't know if you realize Peter but 1.8 to 3.6 million concussions per year alone in sports sports and recreation in this country per year it's crazy it's very common what is the natural history of this if untreated so let's start with what percentage of patients that sustain a concussion and let's just take all comers so we're not going to differentiate how they got their concussion whether it's in a car or on a horse or whatever yeah what percentage will end up like the gentleman you saw today where this thing ain't getting better until he sees a specialist is that like five percent of people 25 percent of people I I wish I knew I don't no one's done that kind of work we don't know the denominator basically we don't if you walk today in my shoes you'd think it was very common because they're coming right you have a huge selection bias obviously of the sickest people bias so basically but I I really do feel like a lot of kids will will be fine after concussion but there's certain meaning that they probably work out of it and they're fine you know I mean

[01:03:43] I don't know about you but I've had moments in my life where I remember playing sports and getting hit and feeling foggy and dizzy you know and and I didn't have any problems from that that I'm aware of uh so this happens I think fairly commonly and kids are fine but there's I think certain certain risk factors certain personality types certain biomechanics it's a it's a Confluence of factors that end up with these patients ending up down this pathway where they can really get in trouble with it so and

[01:04:18] I don't think it's that all that infrequent I mean it's it does happen Mickey do we know anything about the effect of concussion on subsequent risk of brain disease so one of the things we talk about a lot on this podcast of course is dementia both Alzheimer's dementia and of course all other types of dementia everything from Lewy Body to you know small vessel Etc do we have any insight into a relationship between those does a if two people who are identical in every way in terms of predisposition and whatnot and other factors one person sustains multiple concussions in their life the other does not do we know if that has any bearing on risk there's been some pretty good research done on that a lot of work done out of uh uh Mass General in Boston

[01:05:10] Grant Iverson's written really well on this topic and the studies that have come out from him and his group and I respect that group we we can see some relative increases in anxiety in some of those patients but overall the studies have been pretty good about showing this we don't we're not seeing any proclivity towards dementia with these patients or proclivity towards Lewy Body or poorclivity towards other neurodegenerative illnesses now it depends on what research you're looking at as you know the the research world is highly variable um and you know you look at other camps that would support that people that have repetitive head injuries will end up with you know chronic traumatic encephalopathy and but those are you talk about selection bias I mean they're studying patients who are donating their brains because they have problems and so we have a study going on right now here at UPMC

[01:06:19] I think it's one of the best controlled studies done in the area where we have a number of form of NFL players a very large sample size coming to us and we're doing a three-day evaluation we're doing a full neuropsych battery we're doing really fancy Imaging with them we're doing lumbar punctures we're looking at CSF we're looking at different biomarkers we're looking at sleep study we're doing a full Deep dive on their neuro neurological health I mean like the deepest dive you could do and then importantly we're matching them to controls that haven't had the exposures and we're doing a very well controlled study looking at the prevalence of neurodegenerative issues in patients that have had repetitive head injury versus patients that have not and we're year two and a half into that study right now and we're just about to dive into our first statistical analysis looking at all this information so this is one of the better controlled studies out there right now and there are other groups doing similar work so we're going to have very good scientific answers on this question and then relatively near future in the next several years you'll see studies come out from these different groups and that's why we do research you don't want to get your research in the New

[01:07:42] York Times that's for sure you want to do well-controlled empirical work which we're doing and I think we're going to have a very good understanding of this issue and more clarity to it and then relatively near future is it and I know that CTE is not your area of expertise but is it your intuition that CTE is the result of untreated concussions that accumulate repeated injuries the the speaking of the New York Times as my source of information my vague recollection of this was the idea that CTE was not so much the result of major concussions but basically constant accumulated you know sub-concussive injuries uh but but again

[01:08:27] I could be totally misremembering that no I think you're remembering it right now whether that's scientifically accurate or not it's a different story um and I don't know the answer to that and that's why we're doing the research but but the the science hasn't evolved to have a definitive statement on these issues in my opinion and what I know anecdotally is I see patients who are absolutely convinced they have

[01:08:57] CTE that get better with our treatments and don't have problems after we treat them and there's nothing worse than patients that think they have some debilitating life-threatening disease where there's no possibility for help it doesn't go well in those patients when in fact a lot of the problems that we see there are treatments and a lot of patients aren't aware of that and it's very sad to see that happen and we see that a lot that's kind of an amazing thought I never really imagined that but it's it's certainly possible that there are going to be a lot of people who either played Sports professionally or at a very high level who could easily think that they're in the stages of CTE and maybe they're not maybe this is a concussion that hasn't been appropriately treated and of course take that a step further we see patients that are suicidal from this and it's very scary where this will take you because remember we're talking about patients that have biologically derived sympathetic nervous system arousal and high anxiety and they feel horrible they're not working they're not exercising they're not regularly with their sleep they're not social they're ruminating all day long I mean the suicide risk in that population is very very high and so you wonder where this leads to and some of the suicidality that we see in patients like what percentage of those patients didn't have those problems but they believed they did and that's the function of again when I talked about earlier about how when you have an increased awareness with no solution [Music] it can really lead to a lot of Hysteria and unfortunately we can see that and it's very devastatingly sad to see that in some of our patients and um

[01:10:54] I think we need responsible science to lead us to better answers to we really understand this and I understand the need to talk about the stuff in the media and like you said it earlier like we see so many patients because of that awareness right and that's a good thing I mean it's really leading to a lot of people getting help that wouldn't have received help but on the flip side it can be very dangerous as well there's gonna be a lot of people listening to this Mickey who are parents right so they're gonna be they're they're they're athletic Heyday might be behind them they're not taking the high risk uh activities their risk of concussion we'll talk about later because that's going to be the car accident the fall uh literally I know somebody the other day that was bending down to pick something up under a table and when they came up they had that enormous posterior whack at the head sustained a concussion there but in thinking about their kids who are playing sports whether it's you know soccer football you name it what is the best advice you offer to those parents so they're saying um I think Little Billy or little Susie has a concussion you know just based on the symptoms uh we just took them off the field right away do we need to come out and see you in

[01:12:09] Pittsburgh how many other centers of excellence are there in the country where we could go and get this level of bespoke treatment that's a hard question to answer Peter but it's a great question and yes there are centers around the country that do a really good job with this injury and you want to start at places that have experience and they call themselves concussion clinics or specialty clinics

[01:12:33] I think they're much more equipped to do the work than a general pediatrician I mean you might want to start with your pediatrician but you if you have specialist clinics in your area you want to start there um because they're familiar with the literature and the tools and and by and large or what very well equipped to do to manage these injuries approximately how many of these are there does every

[01:12:53] Major Medical Center have one now isn't that crazy we were the first program literally in the world doing clinical work or studying this injury and now I would say that every major Geographic you know area has a center like this now which is really exciting it's crazy isn't it um blows my mind is talk about that it's only 20 years later you know so yes this does exist in most places uh if you're in rural Idaho or something you may not have access to it but you know now that telemedicine is a medium that's widely used I mean you have that option available a lot of times Etc so the the access is better than it ever has been with that what what are what are kind of the just just off the top of your head kind of top five programs in the country that that you would say would be great places for people to start if they're willing to travel and there's availability obviously your program what would be the other five that you would put on that list another program I have an incredible amount of respect for is a

[01:13:51] Nova in Washington DC one of my former fellows is there we've had 33 fellows train under us under me and they're at various sites around the country I think they do it most of them do a really really good job um I would say off the top of my head um uh I think Boston Children's does a pretty good job overall um

[01:14:15] I know this clinics down in Houston Texas that do a good job this clinics in Phoenix that do a really good job just clean the clinics in California that do a good job I mean one of my fellows is in North Dakota right now doing great work I mean they're they're out there you could even go to our website and kind of find out who we train and where those patients are there's access to places but there's there's really good programs out there I have great respect for and we're actually collaborating with a lot of these programs and doing research as well so which is a good thing and would your advice Mickey to that parent be so let's just say you know the child experiences a concussion on Monday afternoon is your advice to them you know what why don't you just kind of keep the kid doing his thing her thing and if in two weeks it's not better go see the specialty clinic or D is your advice no go to the clinic right away on Tuesday I agree with that but it's again based upon our research the earlier we see someone the quicker they get better got it and you do want to start these treatments pretty quickly and I would say if you can be seen within seven days of an you know the first thing you have to do Peter is make sure there's not an intracranial bleed right I mean like yeah yeah you still do the medical thing you got to make sure this you know the red flags aren't there Etc and rule that out but once that's ruled out

[01:15:31] I do think seeking Specialty Care within a week of injury is going to lead to a much quicker outcome which is what we're looking so basically it's never too early and it's never too late to seek help for this is what I mean I completely agree with that yes yes does all of that apply as we now move from the kid to the parent so if it's me and I'm out there playing with my kids and they somehow talk me into climbing a tree which they often do but I fall whack my Noggin same thing if like let's say I go to the ER we get the CT scan I don't have a bleed there's there's nothing going on but I'm let's say I feel totally fine

[01:16:10] I'm like I got a bump on my head but I feel fine would you and I'm medically cleared should I go and get evaluated or only if I have a symptom yeah if you feel fine I wouldn't necessarily feel that's necessary no but um again the symptoms can be subtle you know what we talked about yeah that's that's that that's my point is like without someone in the ER who's going to do the real oculomotor test or whatever

[01:16:32] I I can speak to the symptoms but I can't speak to the signs on my own correct yeah and it's even hard to speak to the symptoms you know but dizziness fogginess fatigue light sensitive noise sensitivity headache obviously difficulties falling or staying asleep nausea car sickness difficulty in busy environments cognitive issues you know all those things can you know I mean but as long if you don't have any of those problems and no live your life man it's it's okay you know but it can be subtle that's for sure but it's not gonna bite you Peter you know it's not like I don't wanna like it's something where if your symptoms are are pretty nasty and they're not getting better yeah you better see someone right I mean you want to get in the sooner you get in the better it's going to be if the symptoms are very subtle and improving I'm not that worried about it honestly you just don't want another head injury while that's going on and so that may be a reason if you're a weekend warrior you're going to pick up basketball game you want to play in the next weekend you probably want to get it checked out to make sure this everything's normal if you're not a weekend warrior you're not going to hit your head again and it's getting better I'm not necessarily sure you need to see someone okay do you know anything about the role of the apoe4 genotype in terms of susceptibility to concussion or any traumatic brain injury so apollypoprotein has been looked at with this injury and I haven't we have there is no compelling data to suggest that would put you at greater risk it's not augmentive concussion plus apoe4 allele leads to X

[01:18:10] Y or Z so no I wouldn't say there's any hard data suggesting that to be a big risk factor although it's an interesting one to look at and I don't think the research is definitive nor is it comprehensive in looking at that but no nothing to date has been I raised that issue in the JAMA paper we published in 1999. that's the same place I went when

[01:18:33] I wrote that paper is like people need to explore that relationship but nothing has been found to be definitive there no and I guess the last thing I want to just chat about is a little bit more of an understanding of what you said about the the older folks so yeah we we talk a lot about this on our podcast right which is once you hit about the age of 65 your mortality from falling uh becomes really high it's actually surprising when you look at the population adjusted mortality uh associated with Falls accidental Falls and um we talk about it mostly through the lens of hey here's all-cause mortality that you know in the first year post of fall of and that results in a fracture of the hip or femur um one of the things that's happening in the Aging person of course is their brain is shrinking a little bit and their skull is not so presumably that's making them more susceptible uh they're gonna have more movement to the brain within the head is that is that why we're seeing a greater susceptibility in an aging population in addition to the fact that they're obviously more susceptible to a fall I don't know it's a great Theory um but yeah I mean obviously we see atrophy in that population

[01:19:42] Etc um and the other thing is there's a lot of unprotected Falls in that populations a lot of sinkable events in that population uh and there's a lot less motor control when you do fall and so the Mecha the biomechanics are going to be more violent in that population also cerebral spinal fluid is not as robust in that population so you don't have as much protection of the brain moving inside the skull either so there's a lot of reasons for it um but oh my goodness is that an understudied area and boy is it a huge problem that we see day in day out in our Clinic I have a definite passion of working with older people that have this injury and we're doing some of the first research looking at concussion and geriatric population and it's a very rewarding population to work with because you can treat it it's so exciting to see someone I just saw a 90 year old this morning Peter that fell and they want to get better so bad they have so much energy how long ago did this person fall about eight weeks and they're not well tell me about the fall what was the following if I remember right they had a syncopal episode where they hadn't hydrated well maybe a little stress going on in their life uh dysregulated blood flow you know dysautonomic stuff they get up from going to the bathroom collapse hit their head on the on the on the linoleum floor fall forward off the toilet correct face first facial fracture small subdural bad concussion fortunately no intracranial intervention the the blood from the subdural reabsorbed but they're left with this pretty bad concussion um very very dizzy in bed very very dizzy and life don't like busy environments feel fatigued all the time bad headaches they've never had before a lot of anxiety that they're not even aware of and of course they're living alone they're living alone at the time and now family members are around they have to get support from them and they get enabled and they get really protective they think they're going to fall again so they don't move as quickly and of course the vestibular problem doesn't get treated because they're not moving they're not doing anything they're not exercising they're not going to busy environments and so the anxiety levels are up they have benign positional vertigo that no one ever noticed that's why they're getting really dizzy in bed we can fix that and what we get them in the right

[01:22:18] Physical Therapy the right vestibular therapy the right approach we get family members on board and tell them how to approach things and get them more active and challenge them more and make sure the parents aren't protecting them as much as as they you know overprotecting them and explaining how you treat this problem and oh my God they do really well it's it's amazing it's very very rewarding to treat a patient like that and we'll get that person better and they'll be they'll look great here another few weeks hopefully and again they this this person will be doing how much exercise as a part of their rehabilitation program walking for now um you know they're not a fall risk we looked at them see our civil therapist and on a fall risk which is good so we've given some balance exercise to work on we're getting some Festival exercises to work on tell them to go to grocery stores don't carry don't hold on to the buggy you know walking up and down the aisles challenging themselves going out to busy restaurants going back to church you know explaining to family members how to approach all that stuff it's really cool to see this stuff wash off the patient when in fact they they are helpless they don't think they're ever going to get better they think their life's over like literally and they think it's the beginning of something the beginning of the end you know yeah beginning of the end for sure tell me your research is mostly funded through NIH we got funding from a lot of different places but we do have NIH funding we have funding from the NFL we've got funding from uh Centers for Disease Control there's a really cool Foundation here in

[01:23:53] Pittsburgh called the Chuck Knoll Foundation um for the former coach Chuck Noll I talked a little bit about Baseline testing uh Chuck Knoll was the Steelers were the first team to ever do Baseline testing and Chuck Knoll was a huge proponent of treating head injury the right way and Joe maroon had a lot to do with that but anyways the the Chuck Knoll Foundation gives out grants to for researching head injury and we've received a lot of funding from that um and many other Grant sources I it's it's pretty cool it's a pretty hot topic and so there's a lot of monies available to study this which is exciting and do I assume you mentioned this but I assume you have neurologists in your group now as well yeah we have a um we have a few but uh you know neurology and they do and there's neurologists do a phenomenal job of this injury okay but you're not trained about concussion in medical school that's not in the curriculum so just because your neurologist doesn't mean you know concussion just because you're a neurosurgeon doesn't mean you know concussion this is the new science new information and that's why it's really important to see a specialist just don't assume that you go to one of these people that are going to know this injury because most of the time they don't how many Fellowship programs are there in the U.S now for uh training concussion Specialists so I mean what

[01:25:17] I'm hearing from you is you have a neurologist that would have to then specialize in concussion you you have a psychiatrist you have vestibular therapists or oculotherapists I mean everybody basically has to be under a concussion training umbrella how many places are there besides UPMC I would say conservatively 15 to 20

[01:25:37] Fellowship you know maybe 10 to 15 Fellowship programs that's off the top of my head that would do training specific to this topic so it's not that many um but they do exist well Mickey this has been really interesting I know you've got a busy day in clinic so we were lucky to get time with you today but I uh I want you to get back to those patients I cannot believe the volume of patients you see that is staggering it probably also speaks to how amazing your team is and it's it's sort of like you've got that kind of uh almost the executive physical situation where people can come in for two days and they can see every doctor in the in the medical center um it sounds like it's that it's that fine-tuned um I I came away from this discussion actually um far more optimistic I don't think I had nearly an appreciation for how positive the prognosis was even in those patients with long-standing concussion with the right therapy I I really uh I thought it was the exception and not the rule that one could get better if you were two years out and still suffering no Peter it's been great I've really enjoyed it actually and you do a phenomenal job with what you do and you have an interesting job you get to hear a lot of different people talk about a lot of different things and I think you conceptualize this very well and I really appreciate your time it was a lot of fun thanks Mickey do you want to ask me one more question just to see if I can go oh for five do you have any other trivia for me we'll just leave it at over four stick with the offer here yeah
