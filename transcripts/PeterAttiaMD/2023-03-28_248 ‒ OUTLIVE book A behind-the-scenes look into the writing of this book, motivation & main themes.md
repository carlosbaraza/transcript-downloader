## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music] AA Peter Bill how you guys doing doing all right doing good this is the first time we've ever done three people in person so we'll see how it goes but uh it should be fun and I think what we're here to talk about is the book so by the time this comes out the book will be out which is still kind of crazy to think about more so for probably both of you who have been much more involved in the process than me but I think what we did is we collected a ton of questions from the audience on wanting to understand the process of the book who bill is what the cover means what's talked about all of that stuff and so we collected those questions we're going to cover them today and it should be kind of a fun way to learn more about the book what's involved kind of that inside baseball story about it so with all that said I think the first thing we should start with is Peter how's the voice doing uh I would say it is like 80% of the way back to normal do you want to tell people who are maybe unfamiliar how the book tried to kill you through your voice I think the book has tried to kill us in many ways but I think most recently um between reading the book for the audio book and then getting some virus and then having a hectic travel schedule to try to do some podcasts I basically just developed the worst case of laryngitis and a had a fenil abscess that uh caused my vocal cords to stop working yeah which in your profession you kind of need so it's good that they're made their way back yes but I will say this I really enjoyed not speaking for two weeks sort of a vow of silence kind of thing I mean it was just amazing I was like it was amazing how many things I got to tune out like people would I'd hear people call my name and I'd be like

[00:02:04] I can't do anything about it so I'm just gonna sit here how did the family take that did they that to their advantage they absolutely loved it the boys were what was really funny was the first couple of days everybody else got very quiet in response to me being quiet so I actually it's very interesting um one of the few times social media turned out to be insightful and helpful um after I posted

[00:02:26] I think the second video of the direct laryngoscopy someone uh a very astute actually a several several commenters said hey Peter by the way don't whisper because that was basically all I could do I could go like I could sort of do this and they said don't whisper whisper is a bad form of phonation it's actually teaching you the incorrect movements either don't speak or speak normally but at the lowest volume possible and I was like that sort of I was like well that really makes a ton of sense because my my throat was actually starting to hurt from all the whispering it was you know utilizing muscles incorrectly and stuff like that so anyway so I'm talking very quietly and my boys who as you know are not you can use a lot of words to describe them quiet is not would not be on those lists definitely not one of them they got so quiet in response to me being quiet that I was like we got I got to figure out a way to to just do this enduringly yeah next time you have like people over you need to just be under control you're just Dad can't talk again yeah so you learned a a parenting hack yes totally the you are with your kids the quieter they are back treatment one of the questions that we'll get to later is will you ever write a second book which you say no I'm curious what Bill thinks but maybe if you do that could be the the parenting hacks 101 just lose your voice um so I think we'll kind of get into it we have a lot of questions to get through but the first one which I think makes the most sense on which to start with which is relevant to the book sitting in front of us and the cover is

[00:03:59] I think people would ask you know we understand outlive and what that means but where does the science and art of longevity come from and why was that so important to include in the title well I mean you know that the the title was actually an evolution so the um the first title I had in mind when I wrote my Manifesto which was an awful title but it was the longevity

[00:04:25] Manifesto which of course for obvious reasons got scrapped immedi mediately but the working title during call it 2016 when we were shopping The Proposal around was the long game so that was kind of the working title that pretty quickly got replaced by outlive for I think obvious reasons and i' think I've talked about why I like that title so much and why I don't know we never really even questioned it right I don't think there was ever a point where we thought of something else for the main title yeah I mean I think there was a moment when I think a previous publisher questioned it yeah but I think it's it's just very evocative and it's very simple um and it's an action yeah yeah and you think you know could mean different things to different people but I think of like you're going to outlive your expectations or outlive your parents or your grandparents your fate is not set in stone is kind of yeah kind of the idea so to your question about the subtitle um you know Art and Science is a pretty common term people understand that this is the Art and Science this is the Art and Science but I felt that there were two things that needed to be communicated one the study of human longevity is part science and part art but the science should come first so that's why I wanted to flip that order and say it's the science and art of longevity um and I think in the book we make a pretty good case for for where where the application of each comes right why this is not you know if this were you know if this were a book about

[00:06:09] Mouse longevity it could just be the science of longevity because in mice you can do all of the definitive experiments and answer all these questions and in humans as is readily apparent we will never know definitively uh what what the answers are and therefore we always have to have some art involved so Peter another question we got is you often talk about longevity having two components the lifespan piece which is how long you live and the health span piece which is how well you live the lifespan piece is kind of covered a little bit with the outlive um but we did get a question someone wondering was it purposeful that healthspan didn't make the title or kind of what was the thought process there see I think outlive encompasses both truthfully I I think you know to Bill's earlier comment um out living is more more than about the um chronological years of life it's about the quality of life as well and so I think next the most common question we got as it related to the cover is can you explain the cover art and I know for those listening or watching it went through a lengthy process of a lot of different iterations so do you maybe kind of want to talk about that why you ultimately settled on this and kind of to you what it means yeah I think um the cover is interesting because there were there were two things that in the back of my mind were enormous stressors as we got closer and closer to the Finish Line um and by that

[00:07:45] I mean basically by about the spring of 2022 so about a year exactly a year ago you know we had a manuscript that was we knew it was too long it was probably about 190,000 words at that point so we knew it was going to get a big haircut but we knew we basically had the book at that point but these two things that kind of nagged at me and kept me up at night were how could this be represented in a cover and who is going to read this book for the audio book those two things just created such a lowlevel anxiety for me I can't even you know talk about it and so as the spring turned into the summer and our publisher is like okay like we need to get on this cover thing and they've got kind of a checklist of okay for the book to come out in March we have to have this thing designed by here and D D

[00:08:38] D D D um I just didn't even have a sense of what one does because I couldn't you know as Bill can say I have very strong opinions about everything I couldn't even offer an opinion on the cover right all I could say was I wanted to be elegant I wanted to be kind of timeless I don't want it to be too busy like I had vague ideas of what I wanted and as you know I'm a font fanatic so I kind of understood the fonts I wanted but no sense artistically of what was wanted so then

[00:09:13] Bill uh sent this is probably August right he sent over an email of a guy named Rodrigo Carell who I'd never heard of before but you sent over I think his website yeah my sister is a book designer and he's like a big he's revered in in those circles and we looked at some of his designs I recogn the books and I was like yes yeah this is this is elegant and while that's happening in parallel the publisher is churning out um designs as well and I'm kind of like okay there's a couple of these that are I could see iterating on um and basically we were we just we weren't really making a ton of progress until we I think just collectively decided and and really I I think uh bill has contributed a lot of things to the project but if I was going to say the single most important thing Bill contributed was being adamant that we engage with Rodrigo and this was late in the game this was October if I'm not mistaken and I remember where I was I was on a flight and I got an email from Bill and um it said something to the effect of because we were looking at something that I was almost going to capitulate on it was a design I remember what the design was and I basically was saying it's a solid seven out of 10 and I'm too tired to do anything about it and bill was like this is man we've worked way too hard on this book to have a seven out of 10 cover I think we just we just we just we go and get Rodrigo and it doesn't matter how much it costs and it doesn't matter how much it slows the process down we do it and I was like yeah Bill's right I don't want to regret this I don't want to I don't want to be sitting here in 10 years going why did we do that so then we reached out to

[00:11:16] Rodrigo had a long call with him and I guess this is what makes great artists great artists is even having this call just talking with him about the book he didn't have a chance to read the whole book because it's long and I mean within three days he threw up 30 covers and they're all different totally different they're all sort of evocative

[00:11:45] I mean there were some there were some images that I liked and that you liked and other people liked and but different ways to kind of evoke this concept of longevity and outliving and um living better and all that stuff which I mean it's really easy to also get that wrong visually like the I was telling Nick about the Korean cover of uh of my book spring chicken that portrays a fat guy on a beach chair like frying an egg and that's supposed to me longevity so there's many ways it can go off the rails so I think he there was something about this and and I think I don't think this was your favorite at first at first it was but it was in my top six so I remember he sent over 30 and I think we each decided to pick our top five or top six this was on for all of us it had a very different font there were a number of things about it that were different at the time and I think the font threw me off the first time round font guy yeah font guy I'm very particular about my fonts and to make a very long story short we ultimately decided this was the one we were going to make the winner and you know I wish I could sit here and tell you that the blue green yellow pink all signify something I can't tell you that what I can tell you is it signifies a bunch of things to me right it signifies kind of a keyhole that you're walking through it's a passage um but it also looks like a Target and that's a big part of this there's a very subtle theme in this book about lots of metaphors that revolve around archery um anyway I could talk about it at length

[00:13:33] I'm not sure Bill what what you think it's it's different I showed it to different people like my partner Martha and various other people and everybody kind of liked it but they had a different reason to say I like it because it's like an aura yeah I like it because it's like you're going into the into the

[00:13:50] Beyond into into the future you know the little guy there let's not forget him he's an important part design so it's different things to different people and that spoke to the art side of it science in art so and I think that that's again I think that speaks to what Art Is Right art means different things to different people and and in that sense I think the cover I I just wanted a cover that I would like to look at and um I have certain books that I love looking at their covers and so I wanted this to be one of them yeah and it is interesting too as you kind of mentioned like what makes Rodrigo so good and when we saw that list of 30 you were just every time you would look at another one you're like this could easily be this there literally wasn't a bad one on his list of 30 that's the thing like every one of those was reasonable and there were a handful that were exceptional and there was one that was perfect yeah yeah it just shows people who are experts at their craft how good they are and how they can think so differently and this cover yeah it turned out really really well and I think I drove everybody absolutely insane with all the font changes I made I was GNA say I think to say you're fanatic about fonts does not do it justice how fanatic you are about fonts yeah one little inside baseball thing here if you go with this font the commas work out to be much crudder and so I was like nope we can't do that we have to use a different font for the comma because the the comma I really wanted to be serif to a sand serif font otherwise and everyone was like I me only Rodrigo was like yeah that totally makes sense everyone else was like Jesus

[00:15:36] Christ yeah everyone everyone else was like this comma is gonna cost this book not actually getting done because the cover won't be done on time um so I think it kind of pivots to the next question and Bill you hinted that a little bit but a lot of people were kind of curious you know who is Bill gford like what's his backstory how did he get involved in the book so do you kind of want to give a little rundown of kind of who you are your story and then ultimately how you initially got connected with Peter in the project which was six years ago now it was um end of 2017 yeah yeah I got an email out of the blue from me right yeah yeah yeah and I knew who you were because I had read your you know I knew you were and I I think in particular I'd read your insane 13p part series about cholester this is epic uh and in I had read that in the course of researching my own sort of more personal book about longevity spring chicken which came out in 2015 I thought I was done with longevity honestly but this seemed interesting but sort of to reel back I'm I'm um you know like where other kids dads were throwing the football passing the old baseball around like my dad took me to the library so I became a a writer eventually and I just love writing and words and I thought I would be a like a poet at one point when I was in college but then I I realized I like writing to people and sort of connecting with people and evolved um from sort of General journalism into writing more and more about sort of scientific and medical topics and writing about like sports performance and then doping and cycling and then more General Health related topics and then got interested in like

[00:17:32] Peter did you know you reach a certain age and you're like huh what is happening here you know I'm not the guy I was 10 years ago and there's this interesting process going on that's this big sort of biological mystery it's super fascinating and it has not been solved it still has not been solved um so yeah so ended up writing about longevity and

[00:17:57] I ended up writing I write a lot about athletes too so I found myself writing about older athletes as well like Phil May the skier came back to racing when he was 50 so I followed him around he was competing against 22 year olds so so that kind of that kind of longevity kind of fascinates me as well and Peter I actually don't know if

[00:18:19] I know the story but you mentioned you first reached out to bill so what caused you to do that throughout the writing process well so in 2016 I was working with an agent uh this book got sold to a different publisher and um you know I was the author of the book and um I'm working on it nights and weekends you know while

[00:18:41] I'm doing my day job and I finally have kind of the first part of the book to submit it was just under 40,000 words and I submit it to my agent who then submits it to the publisher Now by this point the editor who had bought the book had left so there's this woman um who was at the who's at the publisher and I I seem to like her and I I I thought I thought she really got the concept of the book but unfortunately and I guess this is not uncommon in publishing within a couple months of me coming on with the publisher she gets a better job at another publisher so she's gone so now another another editor basically comes on and it's now her book but shees doesn't really have as much invested in it and so I submit this first section to them and it is met with a very lukewarm response um and they really had two huge criticisms of it um the first was it's too technical um and I you know I I can I can see see why that's the case the second was there was no story in it right there was no narrative it was mostly just a scientific treaties on the subject matter and so then my I guess both my agent and the publisher said look we think you should bring a co-author in who can help massage and smooth this out and make it you know a a better book for the lay person to read so I said okay how how do we go about doing that' and they said we've got a long list of people to introduce you to I said 'g great so sure enough the cording began and every this is back when I was in New

[00:20:33] York constantly because I was you know this you know was back when I traveled a lot to to work there and so basically every week that I'm in New York I'm meeting another author and usually what would happen is they would send me one of their books I'd you know read as much of the book as I could get through or skim it or something and then sit down with them um and I kind of went through five or six of these and it just I was like there's no way this person gets it like this person has no clue what I'm trying to write about and this is not going to work so then I talked to Bob Kaplan and I said Bob here's the problem what do you do you have any ideas he goes yeah let's let's go find somebody who's already written about what you find interesting and see and the very first thing that I remembered what year did you write that Bloomberg piece on Rapa was that 2015 that came out um 2015 yeah early so 2015 it's actually interesting that you wrote it back then because this was still sort of preh hype of Jos science yeah but there was an article in Bloomberg yeah I guess 2015 that you know because I was obsessed with this stuff I read everything that came out and this was the first one that

[00:21:54] I read that I was like this is a very good article most of them were so simplistic they just missed the point but this was a very good article um and so I said to Bill I I said to Bob I said this is the guy because he already gets it I'm not going to have to like you know explain to him this that or the other thing or at least I said like my intuition is that he will get it and I don't did I contact you through Twitter how did I I do remember reaching out to you was it through your website or you just emailed me yeah yeah yeah so somehow I just got

[00:22:30] Bill's email maybe it was on the article and I I I don't remember what the email said but I do remember we met for dinner on the upper side one day in late 2017 Y and I think I probably just said everything I just said now which is you know and and and by that point so what did I send you to read what was the version I had sent you at that point I think it wasn't the 38,000 word it was more like I think I probably by that point 5000 something and you know interesting

[00:23:02] I was just thinking about it like I think some of the DNA of that is definitely in part one y like if you did a you know text analysis you'd probably find some bits of that sprinkled in there it you know it had the sort of the Central Central ideas in in part one yeah you had a start but you know starting is super hard and then keeping going is even harder and then figuring out that you're done is the hardest of all so you had a start I had no idea how hard this would be I mean I I I I'm sure every first-time author says that but this was so much more difficult so much more time consuming um than than anything I could have imagined um I do remember in the the early days we spent a lot of time in front of a whiteboard indeed in my office yes and that was the easiest way for me to communicate kind of broad

[00:24:07] Strokes was um you know this is how I think of these as pillars this is how I think of these as foundations this is this this is that yeah we had a lot of pillars and Foundations yeah Frameworks lots of Frameworks and I feel like that was kind of the easiest way I think to get us on the same page about how I was thinking about it but the structure that emerged in the final book which is basically you know three big sections they communicate you know each important and builds on the other I feel like that didn't really crystallize until gosh I mean 2019 I don't 2018 is a blur to right like I don't I don't remember the the difficulty I mean I do in some ways but but clearly there was a so if version one of the book was what we just talked about the sort of pre-bill then there was version two which was the book that got written basically from the beginning of 2018 through the beginning of 2020 yeah yeah and it even in that period so the two things I remember first of all I remember you ordered about half the menu at the Turkish restaurant and the waiter was like all for you this was back when I was eating just one meal a day so so it was like I would fast all day and then basically throw down 3,000

[00:25:42] Galleries at dinner yeah so I was like this is whatever this is going to be it's not going to be dull and um then the other thing is sort of we had a a basic template we kind of outlined okay what's the book going to be it's going to be you know 25% kind of this part one this kind of the manifesto stuff and then it was going to be basically a biology of Aging book I mean that was kind of where where we were going you know the rap ofy stuff and the kind of mechanisms that that you know the

[00:26:17] Hallmarks of Aging you know almost like the molecular you know cellular level stuff and then we were like you were like um you know 10% T any tactics in it I maybe 5% tactics make an appendix with a couple tactics in it 100 pages on tactics what did the publisher say when you said I'm actually not going to tell anyone what to do in this book they were they were they were apoplectic and what do you you know you mentioned it was so hard to kind of write and it obviously took a very long time what do you think was so hard about the process was it translating the science into something that was more of a story was it figuring out how to verbalize the Frameworks was it just getting what was in your head cohesively on paper I think there are a couple of things so first of all I love writing

[00:27:13] I've been you know in blogging for for as long as I can remember but that's a very different style of writing you know bill was talking about my 13-part cholesterol series you don't have any constraints when you're blogging you can go as deep as you want to go because you are attracting an audience of similar weirdos who are going to go as far down the rabbit hole as you will take them and so I think the biggest struggle I had switching to this kind of writing and it's so funny for me to look at this version of the book now and compare it to what I was writing in 2018 and I remember Bill really tolerated a lot of my stupid things that I was writing and and what the basic basically how he tolerated it was he made a lot of footnotes he was like all right I really want to delete all of this but we're going to make it a footnote and of course four years later or three years later I was the one deleting those footnotes and I was like this is so gratuitous like it doesn't matter that much and and that to me is a remarkable

[00:28:23] Evolution I guess that everyone has to go through you know Bill presumably went through this 30 years ago go right but for me that was new that was like no but I do need to explain the extracoporeal circulation of the liver in this section and Bill is like I don't think that's really important and I was like no no bill you don't understand if the reader doesn't understand portal blood flow here they will never understand why glycogen gets there and he's like Peter

[00:28:51] I can assure you there are seven people who give a about that and I was like no no bill it's important he's like all right let's make it a foot fine let's make it a footnote I was pissed and then of course two years later I'm like that's so goddamn irrelevant get rid of it but you have to know it though be to be able to write intelligently like you have to know it and you have to know what's going on and but then you also have to decide like like you have to know it's you know you're talking about like getting in the weeds right yeah and you have to know all the weeds to write well about science but then you also have to and I think ultimately we both got pretty good this like get pretty harsh about like what you're going to leave out and we left out a lot of stuff like I mean so much it's like stories it's the it's the uh I mean I think I've told this story before but I remember when I was writing probably my first or second scientific paper you you do a lot of experiments most of which don't make it into the paper and I forget who it was that told me this I think his name was Dan Powell was one of the posts that I was in the lab with and he said you just have to learn how to kill your babies you're you're going to throw out 90% of this and I just think that that for me was hard getting to that point of but will the reader if the reader doesn't know all of this you know stuff below the surface can they appreciate the piece of the iceberg above and I I think ultimately the readers will determine if we've struck that balance correctly I think we have um and I'll tell you why I think so I think it became readily apparent when I read the audio version of the book

[00:30:38] Because when you're reading it out loud it's very different from when you read it the way one edits their own writing because you're you're you're obviously reading it much slower and you realize the unnecessary interruptions of endless footnotes that are you know incremental in what they're adding yeah it's kind of it's interesting to hear you talk about it because I can't imagine I haven't read the first iteration which I think you said practically none of it made the final version right certainly in direct content absolutely not in spirit some of it but yeah I just can't imagine what it was is if you handed them a whole

[00:31:25] Manifesto zero tactical advice and literally explaining every little Nuance of the liver like I would just love to see the face of the person who came in after that publisher left and read this and just was like what the hell are we gonna do with this thing I'm I'm sure they were freaking out so I think it makes sense to kind of talk a little bit you mention it there but there's three main parts of this book right so let's talk about what ultimately made it into this final version do you kind of want to walk through what the structure of the book is kind some of the content we don't have to get into detail but just kind of what people can expect to read about yeah I mean look there's three parts uh

[00:32:07] I think the first part sets up the structure of the book it gets the Frameworks across you'll certainly as a reader understand the problem statement right and and I again I think you can't solve or even attempt to solve complicated problems if you aren't asking the right questions and you don't have the right Frameworks that's something that we posit very clearly here and that's really what part one is about and that's not just explaining what longevity is and isn't but it's explaining something called medicine 3.0 which is the vehicle through which you pursue this thing then um part two um sorry I guess the other thing in part one is we I'm blanking on where the delineation occurs but I think part one also includes kind of some of the scientific underpinning doesn't it or does that all get lumped in part two I think that's part two with the part two part two is probably the most technical part of the book where we get into the scientific underpinning of everything coupled with get to know your opponents basically right so so there's no denying this a big part of this book is trying to figure out how to live longer now not in terms of science fiction living longer but

[00:33:28] I mean I think we argue very convincingly that a person reading this book who puts these principles into practice is is is really thinking about elongating their life by 5 to 10 years but to do that you really have to understand what are the things that are coming to take your life so we kind of go through all that in part two um and then part three is how do you put this into practice it is that which I initially didn't want to write about but ultimately think um um I I I don't know I think that I think that section just turned out better than I ever could have imagined it yeah it kind of organically evolved and kept growing and um changing uh but you know it going back to part two I think we were we were looking at um you know because we're both fascinated by centenarians we were looking at that chapter and kind of hammering out that chapter we kind of had a little bit of a

[00:34:28] Revelation where was like wait how it's not like a big mystery how these people live to 100 when most people live to 80 you know they get heart disease much later if at all they get cancer much later if at all or maybe never and they get neurodegenerative disease neurodegenerative disease later or never and so it's kind of like that's the ball game right you got to figure out how to delay all of those diseases that which you call the horsemen right so then we had to and we didn't even contemplate writing these chapters at the beginning and then we decided we have to because we have to like like you say like know know the enemy know the opponent that's right yeah the first version of this which is the first version that we wrote which is the second version of the book was way heavier in the molecular science of Aging so we came at this much more more through let's go really deep into autophagy let's go really deep into nutrient sensing Pathways let's go really deep into all of these things which of course I found super interesting but um ultimately we pivoted much more towards this Insight which is there are two completely different strategies to live long one is figure out a way to extend the period of time you live once you have a disease and by the way that's everything medicine 2.0 does we're going to wait till you have a disease and we're going to figure out a way to just drag you through that and keep you from dying okay that strategy worked a little bit strategy two which is medicine 3.0 is no way we have to figure out the time we have to figure out a way to drag out the time you live without a disease and to understand you can't enter you can't play that game if you don't know everything about these diseases you have to become so intimately familiar with each of the horsemen and um and of course therefore each of those Horsemen has a very robust chapter as I'm listening to you talk I'm kind of curious do you think for as tough as it was to write the book and all the pain to go through that process over the years do you think how you practice medicine with your patients kind of what we talk about on the podcast like weekly newsletters how all that structured do you think it would evolve to what it is if you didn't write the book I I mean I I think they help each other for sure I I think um I mean you can't write well if you don't think well um and you could argue it's hard to think well if you're not able to write well so I think the Relentless process of streamlining and figuring out how to get to the point sooner all of those things would absolutely forc me to to reconsider how things were Happening by the way I think a lot of what's written in there comes out of just the conversations I'm having with patients I do in fact I know there were certain times when I even asked patients um hey do you mind if I record our Zoom today um because I I just want to be able to go back and listen to how we talked about it and they'd be like sure and so I would you know walk them through all of their cardiovascular disease risk and then go back and listen to it after and go okay Yep this is the way I would this is this is a good version of this talk because I give the same talk to patients constantly but sometimes they're sometimes they hit better and sometimes they don't and so having some recordings of those was really helpful to to kind of go back and remember how what worked I think the when you started the podcast I think it was about six months yeah about six months into the the book writing process

[00:38:23] I think that gradually that made you um more cognizant of of how to communicate science and medical topics I think maybe by Nature you're you're a very datadriven kind of mathematical guy and you'll want to maybe just present like numbers and you know facts straight up and I think doing the podcast you kind of learned how to how to how to kind of speak and and you know introduce these subjects in a in a more sort of userfriendly way it was an interesting progression yeah that's true we did start the um the the the we started the podcast in June of or yeah June of 2018 and I remember in the summer of 2017 so before we were still working when I was still working on version one I was effectively podcasting but without podcasting in other words I was flying around interviewing people you know okay you know go Going Up To Boston to meet with David sabatini meeting with Matt cllin me with the posts in their Labs sitting down and recording these interviews with them and it was effectively my foray into podcasting without but it was all for the book you know these were all just interviews that were used to sort of Drive the book um and yes what an evolution in that that's another we'll save that for another discussion but boy how how difficult podcasting is too yeah it's kind of funny because some of those initial interviews ended up being some of the first podcasts we released that's I think we did end up using at least three of probably a dozen of those as actual podcasts and I think too the interview the first interview we did with inugo and Rick Johnson that stem from you wanting to go talk to them for the book yeah yeah and we just kind of double dipped yeah so it is kind of funny to think about you know a lot of those interviews would would you'd come back and you'd be like you got to listen to this bill you got to listen to and you go you know so th those fed into to the the not only the writing of the book but sort of the evolution of thinking behind the book so and it kind of fits in with a question we got asked quite a bit which is it took you six years to write the book there was a lot that changed in those six years as it relates to science there's a lot that's going to change in the next 10 years and you when you announced the book you kind of wrote about your goal with this book is it would still be applicable in 10 years so kind of people were curious you know how do you think about one writing a book that can stand the test of time to you know what changed a lot in your mindset and where did you evolve in that whole process I mean I think a lot of things changed in me in in the six years um some of them just obviously very personal things some of some of which

[00:41:22] I've written about in the book um but I think more it has to do with emphasis right so there were things at the beginning that were much more the emphasis in my mind and other things became more important over time uh so for example at the outset of the writing of this book I probably placed more of an emphasis on nutrition than exercise as one of the important drivers one of the important levers we have at our disposal and I would say that my views on that have flipped I think that exercise has a bigger impact than nutrition and certainly on the positive side nutrition can have a pretty big negative impact but once it's corrected it's doesn't have this enormous upside whereas exercise has an enormous downside in its absence and an enormous upside in its presence so that's you know that's a you're you're reading a different version of this book than you would have read six years ago with respect to that um or two years ago yeah exctly one year ago obviously you know a book this book written five years ago would have not had anything about emotional health there's not a lot on it but there's there's something on it and it's and I think it's relevant um I think it's very framework focused which I think lends to a more Timeless piece because Frameworks or scaffoldings are there upon which to place information and substitute information so if the framework says delay the time that you do not have disease that's relatively Timeless as a strategy now we're going to learn different things about these diseases I in 10 years my hope is that you know one taking one example liquid biopsies should be a heck of a lot more valuable in 10 years than they are today that's going to completely change our approach and our efficacy of screening so so you'll have a different tactic that you'll use in a toolkit to go about the strategy but the goal is still the same so you're talking about liquid biopsy is for cancer detection yeah yeah so if you can detect cancer much earlier it's a treating it's a whole different thing y yeah and it's it's interesting because anyone who's listening to the podcast for a long period of time will know like hear you talk about things in a different way as you learn more information and I think sometimes a natural reaction from people is to be frustrated at that being like well why did you say this one time and then you kind of change your mind like you know but I think to what you just said which is really important it's probably worth spending a few minutes on it is you focus heavily on objective strategy tactic and that's probably the reason why in the initial version it had zero tactics which a lot of people are probably like how do you write a book that doesn't tell people what to do but for you it's how do you write a book that tells people to it's all about objective and strategy because as new information comes in the tactic may change but the objective and strategy doesn't do you kind of maybe want to talk people through how you think about that objective strategy tactic because I think it is applicable for anyone who's going to read the book to really understand that for knowing how to take this information and still make it applicable years down the road not just months down the road well there's a whole chapter on it in part one right which is like why you know why is it that we spend so much time hammering this idea and um it's a simple concept but it's amazing how often it's ignored so for starters you do have to define the objective and um I won't say any more on that now but again the objective you'd be amazed at how many people would struggle to Define their objective you know oh I'm taking this 27 different supplements because I'm hacking my you know whatever and it's like okay what is your objective and if you can't clearly state that then there's so much fog around this the strategy is very important and um again you know there we open each chapter with a quote but of the quotes my favorite has to be the one that opens that chapter which is the sunzo quote about uh strategy or what is it is the uh uh objectives sorry strategy without tactics without strateg is the noise before defeat or something that's right that's it and um so so we go to Great Lengths using lots of examples to really help a person understand the difference between a strategy and then the tactics that they employ um and we do this because we say the tactics are the most malleable things here they're the things that are going to change the most and to the your previous question those are the things that have already changed the most right so give you another example right like how much emphasis did I used to place on fasting how much emphasis do I place on fasting today totally different um the I am positive that there is some set of drugs that I am either not taking now or don't even know what they are now that

[00:46:41] I'll probably be taking in 10 years and similarly there's probably something I'm taking now that in 10 years I'm going to say the evidence for this sucks I'm not going to do it so you know if I can't take that and anchor it back to a strategy which is the reason I would take this or wouldn't take this is because it feeds into the one of these three overarching principles that guides this objective um then I'm I'm really just doing a bunch of random things that aren't in concert but you're also able and open to changing your mind so you know one of the things I noticed early on is like you're not like a dogmatic person if you get information or a new interpretation of the existing data that kind of causes you to to see something differently and fasting is is a big one and Frank I was a little bit relieved actually because I knew I was going to have to do it myself just to be able to write about it but wasn't looking forward to it but then you kind of got off the fasting I think it had it had served a purpose for you yeah and and again there there's still times when I think it makes sense but but yes just as one specific example of you know this isn't something that everybody needs to be doing and one of the questions we got was what areas of the book do you think within the next 10 years will evolve the most you know you mentioned there like liquid biopsies and cancer detection is there anything else that you kind of think about when you write this book if you're like if I was going to update this in 10 years and I had to make a guess on which sections I would want to refocus on is there anything that you would think another way to think about it is you know what in this sphere are you kind of really excited about progress in the next 10 years I do think that um we've taken we've gone out on a you know taken a very aggressive posture on cancer screening right for the for the reason that bill alluded to a moment ago which is um certainly in doing research for this book and getting really deep in the weeds there simply is no ambiguity that the earlier you catch cancer the better your odds are at treating it while it remains local um given the exact same hystology of cancer treating it when there are a billion Cells versus treating it when there are a 100 billion cells with the exact same therapy has such dramatically different outcomes that there should be no question about that and so you you basically have to put yourself into different camps are you of the mindset that we will come up with systemic cures for cancer regardless of size and stage in the next couple of decades or do you think it is more likely that we will get better and better at finding cancer when it is smaller and smaller and treating it with existing therapies now those don't have to be mutually exclusive but the question is which one of those do you think is more likely and I think the latter is much more likely and you know we present it as such right you know goal number one don't get cancer goal number two if you do get cancer catch it as early as possible and then and only then goal number three is we get into what are the most promising things so I think that's another area where I you know what we're seeing right now with immunotherapy is so exciting and I think we are right on kind of the verge of unlocking the next layer of immunotherapy right which is once and by the way I think this gets to another part of your question which is what else would I be excited about in 10 years that is not in this book because I think it's too soon for prime time but if we could reprogram immune cells so you've heard a lot of talk about reprogramming well reprogramming gets talked about Non-Stop and there's so much nonsense there but there is one subset of the human body that if it could be reprogrammed would change the the game and that's the immune cell if and and by the way that's much easier to reprogram than like you know your heart or your liver things like that in my opinion because of how easily we can access those cells if we could epigenetically reprogram te- cells I I think it's a totally different game when it comes to cancer therapy and and cancer incidence I think yeah I I would say maybe uh neurod degeneration yeah but but that's someplace where we're we're kind of nowhere in terms of effective treatments for um Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease hopefully better data on prevention you know right now we've taken and we do this in our practice as well we're taking very much a kitchen snc approach um which is there are a handful of things that especially for dementia less clear for the movement disorders there are a handful of things that unambiguously reduce your risk of dementia um there seem to be at least three four if we were going to be right clear exercise uh management of lipids on the ad and dementia side sleep and not having diabetes those those things you can take to the bank we talk about 27 other things for which the data are not clear yet to have more clarity around that would be great and as someone who's not in the scientific field when how you talk about cancer makes a lot of sense in the idea of if the goal like if you have better treatment the earlier Catch

[00:52:39] It you want to screen as early as possible but you talk about in the book kind of the difference between medicine 2.0 and 3.0 and how that's not the case now why why do you think that's I don't want to say controversial approach to it but why is that not the Norm because from the outside looking in it's hard to poke holes in that idea do you mean why is the traditional view of cancer screening different from kind of the view we present yes um I think if if I'm going to be fair and charitable to the outside view it would be that it's being we're we're basically asking two different questions okay so I think the question and the solution that we're proposing is at the individual level um the the outside view I think is at the is at the population or societal level so there was a recent study um that got a lot of attention in Europe I think it was published in the New England Journal of Medicine that looked at uh colonoscopies um the study took a large group of people and they were randomized into two groups so one group was standard of care don't do anything the next group was suggested that they should have a colonoscopy in the next decade okay at the end of the decade they were compared for rates of colon cancer and colon cancer mortality and all cause mortality and while there was a slight benefit to the group that were recommended to get a colonoscopy it was nothing to write home about the the relative and absolute difference in colon cancer and colon cancer deaths while statistically significant didn't seem very clinically significant and opponents of colonoscopy said look this is proof positive colonoscopies don't save lives the route of it is no it's proof positive that telling people to maybe get a colonoscopy once every 10 years when by the way I think less than 40% of them actually did probably doesn't save lives that's very different from the example and the approach that we take I mean you know I'm 50 I've already had three colonoscopies I get them every three years and I will continue to do that until my life expectancy is so short that it becomes irrelevant and um again totally different approach um so we we have to con and am I suggesting that you know everybody get a colonos every three years of course I'm not right what I'm suggesting is that everybody think about their own risk-reward tradeoff and decide what's the what's the cost benefit analysis so there's an enormous cost to doing that my insurance company doesn't pay for most of those they've paid for one of the three um there are risks of bowel preps right you can you know you do these you do a bow prep prep in a person who's significantly older who runs risks from the electrolyte abnormalities that come from those things all of those things have to I I certainly wouldn't want my 86-year-old dad getting a colonoscopy under any circumstance that ship is sailed right he the bow prep alone could injure him let alone the sedation of it so so one has to be very thoughtful and measured in how they think about doing these things um and I think the the long answer to your question is I think when people talk in blanket statements like cancer screening is um they're generally speaking through the lens of policy and population and it kind of leads to another question we saw come through quite a bit which is you know sometimes on the podcast it can get technical can kind of get in the weeds a lot of people were curious how is the book compared to that in terms of technicality is it something that obviously if you're an MD PhD you're going to be able to understand but what about for just the Layman do you think they'll be able to get as much out of the book and was that kind of the hope and how you wrote it and my guess is we can get Bill's response too I was actually G to turn this question over to

[00:56:39] Bill first and and then I'll I'll throw I'll chime in but I'd like to hear Bill's thoughts on that I have a strong thought on this well I I think we're both fascinated probably you more than me but go with you know we kind of can kind of go down these rabbit holes of of you know the technical details which I call the alphabet soup you know once you start streaming together a lot of acronyms like uh apoi and you know PN and all this stuff it turns into alphabet soup um and I sort of think of the podcast is like your playground to to go deep with these scientists and it's tremendously valuable right because they don't have really other a lot of other you can't go on Fresh Air as a scientist and get into that level of detail but um I would say it's considerably less technical than than the podcast but the you know the basic message and the kind of the large you know we cover a lot more ground so we can't really go deep too deep on any one particular topic like I was listening to um uh the the episode about

[00:57:49] HDL super interesting but like mind-bogglingly complicated and we just didn't have the time or the need to go that deep and you know I do hope that you know they figure out how to enhance the function of AD HDL but yeah probably some sections actually that's interesting the cardiovascular section pretty detailed we go pretty detailed in that section we and again I think part of it is we're we're trying to add enormous value in writing this right like there's there's a lot of kind of me too books out there on this subject matter and by me too I just mean like it's just another book that is literally adding no value saying the same thing yeah saying the same thing and and our goal here was like there's no chapter in this book none that should ever just be another version of checking that box and so on the chapter of atherosclerosis I mean yeah I think we do go probably deeper than certainly our editor would have wanted um I think she was kind of to her credit just accept the fact that she might not understand every word of it but um it's you don't need to necessarily understand every word of it to understand what to do about it and and and if you do want to go deeper because we do get into HDL and we do comment on the fact that HDL functionality is not captured by HDL cholesterol an HDL particle number an apoa concentration and all of those things and we do have to talk about the mandelian randomizations and what they've taught us with respect to HDL cholesterol and what they haven't taught us and things like that so um that's probably yeah that's probably a little more technical than maybe the average person would want but but I I you know I I think that overall this book is very readable by a person who is curious and I agree that it is definitely a notch below the technical um depth of what we often do in our podcasts it's not it's not meant to be a textbook either but kind of the way I think of it is you want people to learn thing learn more than they expected without even realizing that they're learning you know kind of like package it in a story or a metaphor and the arcoris chapter is is a good example of that because you know most people know everybody knows about good andad had cholesterol and I think Peter got a little triggered by that and we just we're just going to go to town and in the writing process what was it how was that like between the both of you in sense of were you often trying to keep Peter in check in terms of the scientific aspect of it trying to bring stories in kind of how how would you both do that throughout because obviously the book is I mean it's a good chunk now it clearly could be four times as long if you went into the detail that you could go so kind of where in the writing process did you decide okay like this deserves to go deep this doesn't was there ever disagreement about that or kind of how did that work yeah I mean I think Bill um always thought about it through the lens of the reader and I think there was a very healthy tension between us on those things for sure um and I say healthy because it was never I don't I don't think I think both of us would sit here and say never once did we have a disagreement that was about ego right we had lots of disagreements about content but it was like Bill saying I don't think a reader needs to know this and

[01:01:46] I'm saying bill I think a reader does need to know this and it wasn't about like I want to put this in because it's mine like it was never about that kind of stuff so so yeah I think there was always a great and healthy tension about that um I think once you know there's a backstory here which I we didn't really get into but this book basically got killed in 2020 and then it died it like it was left it was left for dead and it only got Revisited with a whole new publisher and a whole new editor and a whole new process and so that process which went which was now 2021 into 2022 introduced a new player into the mix which was our editor at penguin and um I I don't have anything to compare

[01:02:36] Diana to as far as other editors but she struck me as relatively hands-off I I is that would you would she be described as more of a hands more of a conceptual editor as opposed to a line editor yeah and she gave great sort of um you know guidance and um you know she had some give and take but I think between you and I like we it took us about 6 months to kind of get the right voice and register right like how who are we writing this book for yeah and I I think you weren't quite clear no I think initially I was

[01:03:14] I'm writing this like I would write a scientific article I'm writing this like I would be writing in a journal a scientific journal for people who know and I think Bill initially was like no no no we're going to write this more like I'm making this up it's not what was actually said but like we're going to write this for USA Today and I think in the end we probably settled on you know the New Yorkers the New York timesthe Wall Street Journal like it's it's halfway in between and it's the right voice it is and again I go back to I finally realized it's absolutely written the way it should be based on how it sounded when I finally read the book out loud which by the way we dodged a bit of a bullet because I was given this advice by Sam Harris a couple of years ago and I didn't follow it because

[01:04:04] I never had the time but Sam said to me do not do your edits silently when you were editing this book read it out loud and yeah that's good writer's advice yeah and I was like I mean I acknowledged what he said and I never had the time to do it because when push came to shove this is like nights and weekends and if I got to get through a 5,000 words section like I don't have the freaking time to sit there and read that out loud and so as we got closer and closer to that reading my anxiety was peing because I was like I haven't actually sat here and done this exercise and there were a lot of last minute edits that came out of that probably many more than anybody would have been comfortable I mean I think you said 400 really yeah we you pushed it to the very end yeah and also not not only like line edits but also like hey we just saw this study about about tow deposition can we put this in Bill's like no oh my God no room crazy but I think just kind of going back to something you said like a lot of times you you kind of come up with something or some idea or there would be some new study about to can we put this in it's like Well we'd find a way to do it right the that worked and kind of weave it in massage it in yeah but but a lot of times it would be you know you realize like something so significant might only warrant a sentence in a book of this nature and yeah I I think that was just a general process of getting comfortable but it is the way these things need to be done and I really I'm glad I'm really glad with the way this turned out because if this had been written in the voice that the first version had been written in it would have been accessible to so many fewer people it just would have turn off to people I mean I think you know the feedback again from that first version was not just that it's so technical but there is no story in here there's no protagonists there are no

[01:06:15] Journeys there's nothing to follow and um and that was one of Diana's insights like what's the thread that pulls the reader that was her big what the PS through the book and they were there we just had to kind of expose them let them kind of shine you know one of the questions we get asked a lot which is you've often said this is the only book you're ever going to write and a lot of people are like there's no way and I think even

[01:06:45] Bill joked that he doesn't think this is the only book you're going to write and whenever people would ask I'd always be like oh there's not a chance Peter writes another book like there's no way but as I'm hearing you talk now kind of thinking to myself how do you not write another book in 10 years on an update to all this so how do you because I know you you went into this being like look I want to write one book I want it to contain everything which is why you did the objective strategy tactics like we talked what makes you think that you'll actually never write another book me again I think if we're being reasonable people we could never say never right right um I just think a couple of things would have to be true for me to write another book so i' say that um one thing that would have to be true is I would have to have something to say like you you I think this process is so difficult at least I mean I see these people that write a book a year and I don't understand how they're doing it um so I again let's just put those people aside but for someone like me to do this with the unbelievable inertia that required to do it the the desire the drive to need to say something must be so great that that you have to be able to overcome that pain so so that's that's condition number one I would have to have something so overwhelming to talk about the second condition is I would have to be at a different place in my life than I am today I would not want to repeat what I have done for the past five years which is work on something so difficult on nights and weekends this has been um I think it's just been it's just it's

[01:08:33] I've paid a price for it that is probably higher than I would like to have paid and I don't want to do that again so so I think the second equally important condition is I will need to be at a point in my life where I'm not working 247 and writing this will not kill me meaning it's not something I have to do nights and weekends I can write it during the daytime and that just means my life looks different than it looks today right that means my kids are a lot older that means I'm not working as hard on my practice or other things as I am today where those are my jobs and this is my hobby so I think if those two conditions were met if I had something really amazing to write about or update or tweak um and I could do it in a civilized manner I would be open to it one of the questions that we got came through which I thought was really interesting and fits well with thread you just went on is is did you want or need to write this book because you could mention it there there's obviously no shortage of books on health books on longevity whatever you want to call it and so what going back to the framework you just laid out what do you think to you was so important to say that you were like I need to get this out there and I need people to have these insights I think it's hard to speak to the motivation at the set because when when I started this in 2016 it was you know two years before having a podcast so it never occurred to me at that time to have a podcast I probably would have had a podcast and maybe if I did have a podcast I wouldn't have thought to write a book because in some ways a podcast is an easier way to communicate it's less formal but it's easier right you can and you can communicate much more through a podcast so I think the more interesting question for me to think about is let's go back to where we were in December of 2020 bill so so basically in this in February of 2020 this project is nuked it's dead we're done Publishers fired me and nobody wants a book about longevity in the pandemic anyway yeah yeah it's like it's it's over and I'm over it right like I'm so frustrated that uh and I feel bad that I've wasted so much of

[01:10:55] Bill's time cuz he's put in two full years at that point and he's going to have nothing to show for it right like he's not going to have a book to show for it um for me personally I don't care like I don't need a book whatever um and so I I don't know Bill and I probably didn't talk for nine months it was sort of done like it I mean I was like you know I felt bad and but he you know and

[01:11:21] Bill didn't make me feel bad or anything like that that was just the nature of things right we so so we kind of that was the end of it until late late late 2020 when Michael Ovitz somehow asked me about it and I don't know what brought it up we were talking about his book which I love and somehow it came up that oh I

[01:11:45] I'd kind of written a book too but you know it sort of got scrapped and he was like oh send it to me and so I called bill and I was like hey Bill do we still have the G that has like whatever the last version was of that thing before it died and he's like yeah I could probably find it and I was like do you mind sending it to me so he did and I sent it to Michael and I remember this was around Christmas of 2020 he read it in two weeks which is saying something because it was a pretty long ass thing yeah and he said look man this has got to be published and I was like well we don't have a public sure and I explained all the you know how much hair was on this dog and and then the rest is kind of History he just said well yeah yeah yeah no no he goes look I you know we'll get this published um so that's really the the question then becomes why at that moment in time did I go back in the ring because I was clearly out of the ring I was I you know um and by that point we had a podcast I mean this was not like I wasn't looking for things to do and honestly I think it kind of comes down to some of the stuff I write about in the very last chapter of the book I think I think there was a a coming to peace with some of some of my demons and a realization that I wanted to do it I really did have a I I really had a strong desire to put this material out there in basically the form it's in now which um turned out to be such a blessing i if had it not been for getting fired by the old publisher had it not been for covid had it not been for all of the crises that emerged this book looks a lot different and truthfully I think it's not as good um but to answer your question I I think it was want more than need but I don't think that want really found its why until the end of 2020 the beginning of 21 yeah bill so hearing that I mean what are your thoughts on that process and also during that nine months of Silence to you did you ever think the book would see the light of day I think deep down I

[01:14:10] I knew that it would because there had been so much work that went into it and there was so much that's original and interesting and amazing in it that I I I felt like it would be a tragedy if it wasn't published and I was kind of depressed and sad for a while that it it wasn't so I was very glad to get your call about your friend Michael Ovitz wanting to see it I was yes this is going to happen and you know I think it was kind of interesting watching Peter kind of like become a writer in certain ways you're talking about like working on nights and weekends and you're just kind of tortured by this thing that's like hanging over your head and it won't go away and you have it has to be good it has to be perfect right and so one of the stages of that process is deciding that the whole thing sucks and you know there's all kinds of stories about writers throwing their all their manuscripts in the fire and like ah you know and and it's a process you have to go to and go through and especially in science writing right there's there's like a first draft that that you know we we call it like the shitty first draft and you you have to write it and it doesn't mean you're a shitty writer or a shitty thinker it's just you're just getting it all out there and then it's like what do we got right and then the process you think you're done right because I remember finishing the first draft like okay sweet I'm done and I think at about that point you had sent me an espresso machine I was like this was nice of

[01:15:46] Peter to send me this espresso machine now that we're done but we weren't done weren't even close you know you got the first draft it's like you the first half of the marathon like don't put the sticker on your car you got to run the other half of the marathon before you're done so yeah it was a it was a marathon and and like a marathon anybody who's run one or swam one or bike you know done these things you know that the physiologic halfway point is not the exactly actual halfway point like a most my wife just ran a marathon recently and uh uh we you know in training for this I mean it was all about the training for the physiologic hits and in that 26 miles you don't physiologically hit the Half Point till 20 so you'll hurt as much in the last 6.2 miles you will it will be as difficult metabolically and physiologically in the last six miles as the first 20 were and I think the same as I exactly the same for this writing process right the what we did in the last n months was more valuable than the previous five years right and I I kept telling you that through the process like you got to trust this process yeah you got to trust it and it's going to get a lot better in the last six months than in the first however many many years and that's just the nature of the

[01:17:12] Beast I remember this summer U sorry last summer so it was July of 2022 um we were on a pretty tight deadline at this point so this was when penguin said this book has to come out in March and if you reverse engineer that the manuscript needed to be final by the first week of September and we were six weeks away from that and there were gaping holes in this thing like you could drive a tractor truck through some of the holes in this thing and I had a feeling that I have not had since I was on a very difficult swim in 2008 2009 where I was in the water and nothing was going well this was actually early on after I tore my laum and I was in so much pain and um the current was moving in the wrong direction everything was going wrong and you know these things are very psychological you know you you you it's just like running it's like cycling I mean once your brain is hurting like nothing nothing goes right and I remember at one point realizing I still had seven hours to swim and every stroke

[01:18:36] I felt like someone was sticking a dagger into my shoulder and there was just a part of me it was like I don't want to do this anymore I just don't want to do this and I remember thinking for at least an hour all I thought about was quitting all I thought about was just getting out of the water all I had to do was put my hand up and touch the boat and I was disqualified and the swim was over um and I didn't you know for better or worse I kept swimming I don't think it changed anything in my shoulder I'm still going to need shoulder surgery regardless but I came back to this in

[01:19:10] July of 2022 and I remember talking about this with Jill and I remember thinking in the next six weeks we will have to work so hard to get this thing submitted and we don't have a choice now meaning we can't stretch that out for six months it's you have six weeks to finish do what you can in six weeks and

[01:19:36] I remember saying to Jill I'm so torn right now because I am so tired I don't want to do anymore and I know that for I know that our publisher would accept this right now as is because it's good enough yeah but in my mind it's not good enough and the only way this thing is going to be good enough to what we think it deserves is

[01:20:01] I'm going to have to kill myself for the next six weeks everything I do will revolve around this and I will have to rewrite and rewrite and chop out and do and do all these things and I just I just remember saying to Jill like I want to quit right now I ju I've never wanted to quit so bad and quitting this is a soft quit it's just a saying I'm gonna back off it's not that I'm not gonna finish

[01:20:27] I'm just gonna back off and I'm glad that I didn't I don't know how you felt at that point but that's I really like I'm done with this I don't even know if I care anymore nobody most people won't notice the difference between this version and the version we might be able to get to in six weeks yeah I I think one one thing we share in common is is maybe you're more than me but like a kind of um all like a perfectionism and to me that goes to the the sort of the level of the writing right is this that I would be going through every single sentence like is this the best way that this sentence can be cast or are these in the right order you know how are we structuring this I was doing that constantly and and spent that most of that summer doing doing just that and it was um yeah it felt like in a pretty deep hole and the deadlines looming but you know deadlines are good right because like nothing would be finished yeah without a deadline so at a certain point you have to like take your hands off it and say all right this is this is this is what it is it did get a lot better even between then and and you know when they finally yanked it out of our our cold dead hands um it got better got a lot better more readable yeah that was that was the proverbial darkness before light was that August September was really hard um but I'm and that's what I think every person was trying to tell me before which is you have to trust how much this is going to converge at the end yeah it's kind of funny hearing that timeline Because by the time this comes out we I've released a podcast with

[01:22:24] Ethan Weiss and you guys were talking about blood pressure on it you were like you know Ethan my blood pressure has always been normal but in August I started taking a reading and it just was higher but I could calm down and he was like well did anything change during that time you were like yeah I had a book deadline so it's kind of funny to just see how much this book has trying to kill you along the way of not only the blood pressure The Voice just every little bit of stress yeah yeah ironically yeah let's talk about the Audi book you kind of mentioned it there I know you struggled a lot with should I read this or should I not and part of it was you know you said yourself like sometimes like reading that much like you'll struggle with it was not only that it was the time aspect the commitment what made you ultimately decide to read it because the overwhelming feedback we got from the audience was they didn't want to hear someone else read this book if it wasn't you and people and I think this is where kind of having your own podcast probably hurt you is everyone knew your voice and knew what it sounded like you weren't a voiceless figure who was just a writer so what made you ultimately decide all right I'm going to go do this audio book well I mean first I should explain why I didn't want to do it and I think I had some pretty good reasons for not wanting to do it uh first of all I'm not a great um out loud reader um I think I do have mild dyslexia um

[01:23:58] I I certainly do when it comes to spelling so I can't spell if my life depends on it um and when you hear me read even to my kids like you know Reese is eight so he can read so if I'm reading to him he's catching mistakes that I'm he's Catching words that I'm flipping back and forth um so that was one reason there was just like this is going to be very hard for to do the second is I did the math pretty quickly meaning I had figured out how long it took me to read a page I multiplied it by how many pages there were in the book and I knew that I was going to basically be in a recording studio for two weeks I also knew that that meant that that was the one week a year that I kind of wind down is between

[01:24:46] Christmas and New Year's I was going to be in a recording studio all day every day and I just knew how I felt which was I'm exhausted I'm exhausted and I don't I actually need a week to recharge I don't need two more extra weeks of work the third thing was when Rick Rubin was in town visiting over the summer he was beginning the process of recording for his audio book and he had a sound engineer set up a studio in our basement so he was beginning to do his read they he and his family stayed with us for a couple weeks and one day he was like hey why don't you go in the studio with my engineer and just read a bit and see how it goes and I was like all right that's not a bad idea so I did and I read it and I sent it to you guys and you guys finally acknowledged what I was saying which was yeah that's pretty rough like dude there's no intonation in your voice like you're you sound like a robot reading that so now we've got confirmation on my worst fear which is

[01:25:44] I'm a lousy reader coupled with all these other things and I you know so so so that those were all the reasons I didn't want to do it and I think those were all very compelling so on the flip side of that I I don't remember who suggested it if it was you or somebody suggested that I at least meet with this woman named Stacy

[01:26:08] Snell who I guess is a kind of a freelancer but works for penguin and she would be the producer director of my Audi book and maybe Stacy had just said let me let me go and spend an afternoon with Peter and do some coaching so sure enough one day in this is probably like November she comes over here and we do some reading and for two hours we read but she coached me on reading and she gave me some really amazing tips that seem so self-evident but uh they made a difference so for example first is read slower right and and I should have known this because I consume virtually all of my books in audio first and then certain ones I go back and read in paper but I listen at about 1.8 to 2x depending on the author and so in my mind that's the

[01:27:03] Cadence of an Audi book but if you ever actually go and listen to an audiobook on Onex I mean it sounds like this so what she reminded me was you know it needs to sound pretty slow at 1X speed the other thing she said is and she could tell right away she's like you're not present when you're reading it's clear to me how bored you are of this book and I can't blame you for it you've read every word a thousand times but your boredom is showing in your reading she's like a good reader reads this like it's the first time they've seen these words she's like you have to get there I was like

[01:27:50] Wow and she's like oh and by the way reading slow makes that easier the slower you read the easier it is for you to be present with every word so armed with Stacy's feedback I I decided I'm going to do this um and so a couple days before starting it I had a session with one of my therapists and obviously one of the things you talk about in therapy is like what are you what are you worried about what you know what's what's going on in your life and

[01:28:23] I said well you know I'm really worried in you know a couple days I start this reading process and so Katie said well what's your why why are you doing this and let's write those down so I had three reasons why I was writing this and I wrote those three reasons down on a piece of paper and those were with me in the recording studio and the three reasons were very simply um one the the listeners of the podcast will expect this and deserve it uh in other words you know we feel really grateful obviously I don't need to just say this but you know we have a very loyal group of listeners to this podcast um and to your point there's an expectation that the person who whose voice they listen to is the one that reads it U and I think it's a I think it's a correct expectation I think they deserve that um the second is a pet peeve of mine when I'm listening to technical books that are not read by the author is how many mistakes there are when things are read incorrectly it bothers me to no end I mean I remember listening to One book where the author had written the word causal multiple times and every time the word causal was misread as casual o it's like how that got missed I don't know but but you know I thought about how many technical words are in this book and I was like I'm going to lose my mind if a person and I basically said I'm going to end up having to be in the recording studio anyway to make sure everything is said correctly um and then the third reason was just a very personal one which was you know right now none of my kids are old enough to appreciate this book none of them are going to read this book anytime soon but one day they will and one day they might listen to it um and and in fact I thought further and this is kind of a weird thing to think about because we don't normally think this way but like imagine

[01:30:19] Hemingway had read some of his audio books and now like distant relatives of hi could could listen to it and listen to him reading it and I thought like long after I'm dead my great grandkids could still listen to this but they'll hear me reading it and I think that would be more valuable than hearing someone else read it so it was really more of like something for kids and grandkids to one day have but it's also you know there there are a lot of stories in there about yes your early life and your your medical career and you know some there's some fairly dramatic you know ER stories and you know your story is kind of like embedded throughout the book and especially in the last chapter um so I think it would have like you had to read it you just didn't realize it yeah I think that's true but it is a daunting and and kind of terrifying uh task at the same time but

[01:31:22] I don't know are you glad you did it oh I'm 100% I'm 100% glad I did zero regret on that um and and just glad with the way it turned out glad with the you know having Stacy there in my ear for the whole thing was was incredible I I I couldn't imagine if I had to do it with somebody else yeah it's it's funny is there'll be a lot of times where you'll be like um you know we'll be like Peter you got to do this you'll be like no I suck at this like I can't do it and it's like okay yeah yeah like just go ahead and do it you're like okay and you send it it's like yeah this is totally fine and I think that's what we all expected when you sent over the sample from the studio in the basement I remember listening to it you're like he's right and I was like this is bad like there is no sugar coating it like yeah it was and

[01:32:07] I remember talking to Lacy and I was like I honestly think it's so bad because people hear him talk on the podcast and clearly you can speak but you sounded like you'd never read anything in your life and like you were a caveman dropped in and you were just like what is all this stuff around me right so you've got these phonetic symbols and like go yeah and it was it was just a conversation of yeah we we can't let him do this this is this is going to be embarrassing um but then

[01:32:36] Stacy came in and really cleaned it up and I I know I listen to some of the audio and it it does sound really good so to see that progression maybe down the road we'll release a snippet of the initial just so people can hear the difference of it because it's it's blackmail material yeah it's it's strong well actually really we got to make sure

[01:32:55] Stacy does it before after on her website or something like working with me will get you from here to here before and after that's funny and you kind of talked about it earlier where you know reading the book caused you to make some edits some some edits which 563 or was it 863 lit I think that's the closest

[01:33:18] Bill and Diana came to wanting to kill me I think if they could have if they could have killed and nobody would have found out about it they probably would have and been like oh God so tragic that something happened to Peter this week well you know anyway ously we uh we'll we'll publish this book with your name on it we'll release it as is I think there there is a little Easter egg in the audio version as well that's a little different too which probably also led to some of Diana's stress do you kind of want to talk about that piece of it sure so the before before we turned the book over to penguin so back when you know it was in the the old version that died um you know it was a very similar structure to the way it is now just a much longer less elegant version um but there was an ending to that chap so so the end of the book the 17th and Final Chapter had had an ending and um I loved it bill was sort of ambivalent um when Diana saw it she hated it she was like I don't get it this sucks and I was like what do you mean you don't get it I even like sent her YouTube videos to help her understand it to get the reference she's like I don't get it it's the dumbest thing I've ever seen this is awful and at this point bill was like I kind of see Diana's point like I I I don't think it's good and I was like yeah and I was like all right fine so they took it out so we took it out and this is you know this is months ago like it's long been forgotten so I'm in the studio finishing and I finished the whole book and I said to

[01:35:06] Stacy I said hey Stacy do you want to see the alternative ending and she's like what do you mean and I was like this book ended with a totally different thing it it where you see it ending now they're used to be a whole page after this and she's like oh really let me see it I was like let me see if I can even find it so I'm like rumaging through my computer and I find it and I I give it to her and I'm like read it and she reads it and she's in tears and I was like what do you think of that ending she goes I think it's beautiful and I was like well what do you think do you want me to read that and we can decide if maybe that goes in and she's like yeah I'd go so I went back in the booth and I read it and I go home that day and

[01:35:52] I email Bill and Diana and I'm like all right guys and by the way you got to put this in context they are at the point of wanting to kill me for changing words at this point literally I'm like can we get rid of theth here and uh you know this word needs to be like this versus this like and I'm saying I want to add another page and a half to this manuscript like it's going to screw up everything and I won't get into the details of those conversations they were not pleasant but sufficed to say the answer was oh hell no and so I accepted the fact that it would never make its way into the written version of the book but I said but would you at least entertain this being in the audio version and they were like of course not like you can't have the audio version and different from the written version um and I and we kind of left it at that I think but then I asked Stacy to send it once it was edited and I just forwarded it on to bill so it sounds good the way you read it so I was like this sounds this is good this is moving tried to find a place to kind of massage it in or put it in someplace maybe not as the ending but but someplace in the manuscript and it that kind of didn't work CU I mean that without going into detail like that last chapter probably evolved the most of any chapter in the book and we kind of got into a place where it was working and and that part had dropped out so we kind of decided as a compromise to leave it in the audio as the kind of like director's Stanley cuber director's cut you know um I think it's great yeah but you know honestly like I I feel like as far as print like the last few paragraphs of the book and especially like the last line is something that like sticks with me and I think about that I think about that every day that line and I won't say what it is but every day when I walk the dogs I think about that I think when I'm thinking about like what's what am I going to do today like how am I thinking about this day and and the week to come and everything I I that line sings in my head so yeah so I think I think I think we captur The Best of Both Worlds I think I think it makes sense um I think it would have been even even if we thought it could have been shoved in at the end I think it would have been logistically impossible because of how it changes the pages of the book and stuff like that so

[01:38:33] I think it's an elegant way to do it and and I know that also if people are anything like me like a lot of times you want an audio book and you want the paper book you want to put your fold your pages you want to mark it over you want to you know um do that kind of stuff so um I think it worked out just fine and I I was I was you know frankly

[01:38:51] I was glad you were on some level that you were making like little line edits and stuff like cuz you know it it it makes it better you know there's always stuff you can find that that you know I did a lot of things that probably didn't even notice but you know no it it it got so much better I mean it it there is like a huge Sprint at the end to just make this thing sound right and you're you're getting these like PDFs from the publisher like okay your book's done here's your PDF just proofread it and see if there's any spelling mistakes and of course I think we kind of both went to town on it it typically I guess I guess the industry standard is you would do three passes on the PDF final copy so they you know once you were out of working into you know you know word doc you're into a f a fully types set PDF copy and it's expected that like the first round of passes on that you might find some mistakes the second by the third round there's none we got up to six or seven passes on a PDF

[01:39:53] I mean these people are going you know they were incredibly patient with us the lovely people at penguin Random House worked very hard to absolutely they were accommodate all of our last minute changes and they also Now understand why we say with you the only thing you do in moderation is moderation that's right um and also it's just really funny to just think about the aspect of they probably thought of you like a child like we left

[01:40:20] Peter unsupervised to record this book and he just totally went off script um and speaking of things that kind of you joke like what could go wrong did go wrong voice everything else you want to talk about the first day in the recording studio what happened God so we had two recording studios to choose from in Austin and I don't know I just was like Stacy's like it's totally up to you which one do you want to do and I was like well this one seems a little closer to my house than that one and given that I'm going to be over there every day uh let's minimize the commute so we went to the closer one so first day we go in there and um I I sit down and I just we just jump right into it and right right out of and you read I'm reading the book in chronological order of course um I just hear like a weird little hissing sound and I call out to the engineer and

[01:41:17] I sayhe do you hear that and he says yeah but that's not being picked up on the recording I said okay and I can I can get over it like it's annoying but it's like I can I can work through it so I keep reading get through the introduction get through chapter one I'm like are you I mean it's getting louder are you're sure it's not being picked up on the mic he goes no I can tell you it's not being picked up on the mic and I'm like yeah this can't be right because I can hear it with my ears off the off the speak like you know you're wearing a headset in there and it's not coming through the headset it's it's what I'm hearing in the room and I know how sensitive the mics are in those

[01:42:01] Studios I mean they're insanely they're so sensitive that if you're moving your feet on the floor it's being picked up so we keep having this back and forth where he keeps insisting that this is not being picked up and I I I just finally said like I don't I'm not going to tell you I know your world but I know how record works and if I can hear this with my ears off sound in the recording studio it must be picked up and then he kind of pivots and says well we'll be able to strip it out in post and I'm like okay so it is being picked up so finally I'm one paragraph away from finishing the third chapter which was all we were going to get through that day that's a big day to get through the intro and then three chapters but they were short chapters but so it's a full of reading and I remember this I had literally one paragraph to go and we were done for the day and he goes you know what I think we are picking it up I'm like what goes I think there's a it's a grounding issue so to make a long story short we ended up having to go to the other

[01:43:11] Studio anyway because they we couldn't record there and they assured me that they would be able to fix that in post and they could not so when I finished the book they were like you got to come back and reread that first day again but I think that also was a good thing in a weird way because I think I was a better reader by the end than I was at the beginning and so in a in a way I got a day to practice where it didn't count yeah it is it's funny how it ended up you ended up getting a free practice run which at the time I don't know if we thought of it that positively like wasting a day on something you were dreading doing but I think the audio version ended up really well you know one of the last questions that we got which I think is a really interesting question based on the whole conversation we had and I think we can start with you bill because I'm curious what you think as it relates to this which is looking back at everything that ended up in the book did you have a favorite chapter that you guys wrote is there anything that stands out where like for whatever reason you really look back fondly at that chapter so it's sort of like um picking favorite child but um gez uh so there are these these four chapters kind of core chapters about The

[01:44:38] Horseman diseases right metabolic disorders atherosclerosis heart disease cancer and Alzheimer's disease and those were kind of they were not in the original plan um and kind of the way those all came together um it was a huge heavy lift to try and like understand each one of these disease processes really and it took a huge amount of research and me spending time with Bob Kaplan who was kind of our a research Guru for for the the book project and just kind of hammering these things out um yeah that that was that was pretty intense a pretty intense experience and I feel like a real sense of accomplishment about how those chapters all came out I feel I feel really good about them but as far as like the chapter that that progressed the most from like most improved I think is is the Final Chapter um and just from where that started to where that ended up I I think um I think that has to be probably my favorite favorite chapter it's interesting because you didn't like that chapter initially I know that you and Diana both didn't that was probably your least favorite and and

[01:46:02] Michael was like you know in the early discussions we had Michael was like is is this it should be a separate book is this part of this book or is this part of a different book the second book you're going to write and I didn't agree with that either but it it had to change and and you know I'm always thinking about like like Nick said you know where the the reader is coming from like you said um so that chapter ended up being one of my favorites probably my favorite I think there were sections of various chapters that I really like I think that I think that the insights that come out of the AOS sclerosis chapter are so important and probably have the potential to save more lives than anything else I I really think that um I don't pull any punches in my in my views on how we are mistreating you know this condition and why it does not need to be the leading cause of death no chance of that and I I do think that in a and that's also one of those things where earlier versions of it didn't get to the point quick enough they had too much in it that didn't matter enough and it was really a very late late addition was that the really clear pivot to the causality stuff at the end that I think is a much more insightful way to talk about it so I'm very proud with how that turned out I think for me the exercise chapters there are three chapters on exercise which speaks to the importance that that plays in this book and that was probably the one where even as recently as like July or August of last year I was like I don't see how we get this to the Finish Line like I don't see how this gets done and we were trying at that time to do too much and um and when we when we instead focused on what we could do in a book because again it's not a picture book right this is not this is not a how-to exercise book where you're gonna have like a picture of every single step of like here's how to deadlift here's how to do this here's how to do that and we were trying to do all of that in writing at one point it had an incredible level of detail just wasn't wasn't happening just couldn't make sense like you can't explain these things in writing and so I think a big aha moment we had was a let's restructure this which we did

[01:48:43] B let's simply make a page of videos that explain some of these things so that we don't drown the reader in anatomic kinesthetic lingo that won't actually serve the purpose and so when I look at how those three chapters form together and coales around the centenarian de cathlon in the marginal decade I'm I'm

[01:49:12] I'm really proud of that and you mentioned Bob's name a few times kind of both of you but I know this was uh Beyond just the two of you there was a lot of people involved in the research the writing the science piece so anyone else kind of because one of the questions that we got was you know how many people do you think were involved in the writing of this book well Bob did the heaviest lifting in terms of the because because you know

[01:49:39] Bob was working on kind of the research full-time so basically the way it would work is I would be writing and I would be saying Bob I I remember there was a study that sort of had this like I mean the endnotes on this book are probably 500 right so there was just a probably more than that right um so I would say

[01:49:59] Bob you know can you go and find me the citation of this study I kind of vaguely remember reading it a year ago blah blah blah blah blah or it would be you know I want to write about this is the answer this or this Bob can you go figure it out so this was you know this was really important research that was being done but then the other thing that that had to be done was all the factchecking and one of the things that I took as as wise advice from other authors who had written scientific books is you can't just rely on a publisher to fact check your book they can fact check some things but you have to have an independent person to come in and do scientific factchecking so we had one analyst named

[01:50:40] Vin Miller who did a lot of that work because Bob was too close to it at the time right if Bob's the guy pulling the citations can't have Bob fact check it so had to have a separate analyst that was working on factchecking and then once we got into a much much later version then we had Bob go back and do specific certain fact checks on certain things which also meant and God bless

[01:51:09] Bob because this was long after Bob had left he came back and did a night weekend like he was the guy that organized the endnotes and that was another thing that just gave me chest pain like I mean the I mean me too unbelievable thought of what it would take to organize the endnotes to this book and the Version Control problems that we had with multiple different documents I mean it was so stressful um and by the way it should go without saying people are going to find mistakes in this it's it's impossible that we got it all right it's impossible that we got every end note perfectly I I guarantee you we we have a citation in there that we got wrong um and you know that's why you have second and third editions to books and you know so folks should let us know when they see those things and um and we'll do that but um I think we did as good a job as as as as as one could do in this regard and you know having a lot of people to to shoulder some of those lifts I spent a lot of time kind of kind of putting my head together and on zooms and and going back and forth with

[01:52:17] Diana kind of when you were off doing things and kind of trying to work out the kind of literary side of of the book and how to structure it and how to how to make these different chapters kind of move better basically as better way of putting it um so I worked very closely with Diana and Bob actually Bob would give me the full research download on on literally I'd say like hey Bob like I'm I'm trying to understand how apoe works and boom a g do would appear the next day with like tons of sites and studies that just go down the go down the rabbit hole with Bob about that so he was great with that yeah Bob has a endless number of G dos I would love to know how he stores all of them because you asked Bob a question you are getting a g do yeah in response I spent like weeks we probably all spent weeks talking about the the monkeys the caloric restriction monkey studies I'm glad that they stayed in the book I was really worried that the

[01:53:24] Bethesda Wisconsin monkeys were going to get chopped but in the end found a great place for them and it's a fantastic story to tell there there are a lot of folks in here that that you know that I put in my acknowledgements and um in fact you know it's pretty unusual I think that an author will read the acknowledgements in the audio book but there was no hesitation in my mind it it when we finished the book and I said I'm going to not just read the epilogue but the acknowledgements they were like oh that's unusual a lot of authors don't but um you know it's I it's a it's a very sincere heartfelt thank you to a lot of people who have played an enormous role in sort of my broad education on this topic which has been going on for more than a decade and also some of the the real specifics U so so you know broad education you know the podcast guests again the podcast started basically as a research tool for the book um and then of course one of the things

[01:54:26] I do mention in the acknowledgement section which is true and interesting every single person that I ever sent a chapter out to for technical feedback and review did so there's not one person that I sent a chapter to and every chapter of this book every technical chapter has been reviewed by a technical expert in that field at least one yeah at least one that's right and and often times at least you know more than one there was not one example where I said hey dear so and so can you read this cancer chapter can you read this Arro chapter can you read this where that person didn't come back with Incredible feedback um and I'm

[01:55:08] I'm I mean the word is overused but I'm humbled by that and that means a lot to me and um I think it makes this book a better book when you decided to read the acknowledgements did they try and get you to read the footnotes as well or is that not did that not make the audio book you know it's funny um and Bill you probably don't even realize this but I took a hit or miss approach on footnotes some of them I read and some of them I actually didn't oh the ones at the bottom of the page the true footnotes in the bottom of the page now which obviously we took 98% of them out you were delighted I'm sure and of the remaining ones some of them I just felt they don't flow with the text like

[01:55:47] I I'm trying to put myself in the mindset of the reader and or The Listener rather and you know if the if the footnote was so tangential that it would be difficult to get back into the book I didn't read it yeah there were some funny funny tangents that maybe didn't need to be read or yeah yeah exactly I think there was one about making all your your dates read Richard feineman I definitely didn't read that one the audio book yeah

[01:56:13] I don't even know if that one stay and stepen Rosenberg you made them read the transformed about immunotherapy well Peter Bill anything either of you want to end with as we kind of end the podcast and again the The Hope going into this wasn't to answer specific questions about the book I'm sure we'll do a podcast down the road which is once people have had time to dive into it like answer specific questions yeah we'll do we'll do we should do a book AMA at some point and obviously you know I've been on a few podcasts already for the book and the coming months I will be on many podcasts we have a number schedule where we'll get into the book uh into the subject matter but but yeah I think this was a unique opportunity to talk about the something we'll probably otherwise never really talk about little behind the scenes yeah yeah you know I would say it was it was an honor and a pleasure to work with you and um I learned a lot obviously but like as far as like thinking and rethinking about these issues was was was was you know exciting adventure and a little tough to get it on the page sometimes and get it just right but I'm I'm I'm proud I hope you are too proud of what we have come up with I I really am bill and I I think it it's hard to imagine this having worked out any other way um so I'm glad that all the way back in 2017 they they said Peter this will be a better book if you write it with someone and that you know they even back then trusted me to go and find who that person was and I I I think uh I think this is the this is the best book I could have ever been a part of so thank you Bill [Music]
