that matter he's the co-creator of e60 on espn he's also the director of the espn 3430 documentary the last days of night looking at the untold story behind the scenes story of bobby knight and the events that ultimately led to his termination from indiana university i wanted to talk to robert for reasons i will explain in this podcast because you may be wondering what the heck does this have to do with longevity or anything that has to do with living better and the short answer is i can't really explain that in a sentence or two but it becomes very clear throughout this episode why i wanted to talk with robert who i would consider to be one of the experts now on on sort of bobby knight we talk about a lot of things here but most of it really is about the investigative work that went into the last days of night and of course some of the things that robert learned along the way and basically the 15 years of his career prior to that and why i think that prepared him to be the right person to do this there's one note i want to make before we jump into this which is there is a lot of profanity in this that's just the nature of what this episode is about so it's a little graphic at times and there is quite a bit of profanity so i just want folks to be aware that if that upsets them in any way shape or form i apologize and without further delay please enjoy my conversation with robert abbott [Music] hey robert it's awesome to sit down with you today you're one of the few people that i just sort of randomly reached out to who actually responded to me so i was super excited that day when i sent you a direct message on twitter and the next day you said yeah let's chat and i really appreciate it because i know responding to random strangers is uh is always buyer beware i'm really excited to do this cause once you reached out to me i listened to some of your podcasts and i said i'd love to do it so i'm ready to go we're going to talk a lot today about a guy named bobby knight who i suspect most people listening to this know a little bit about and maybe even know a lot about and i suspect some of these people will have even seen the unbelievable documentary that you produced with espn the last days of night which we'll get to in significant detail but but i think to understand the work that you did there maybe people need a bit more of an understanding of who you are as a journalist and some of the other things that you have done so i'll start with perhaps the most pedestrian of questions but what drew you to journalism growing up i was always a fan of sports and i watched a lot of tv so i think it was natural that i got into sports television i went to florida state university i was to be honest in my early life golf drove my life i was a competitive golfer i played in the future masters junior orange bowl tournament of champions all the major tournaments for young people or juniors and i decided to walk on and try to play for florida state so i went there for golf that lasted about a year it was just so much work and i got redshirted played in a couple tournaments and once i gave it up i got into media performance or the communications department at florida state university and specifically media communications was media performance i wanted to be an on-air kind of sports caster and i took a journalism class ironically at florida a m university florida state didn't offer it and i was just fascinated by it it interested me i never thought that's where my career would go my career started once i graduated i had done an internship at cnn sports and i had done one at a local tv station so the day after i graduated i started at the local tv station as a cameraman an editor an on-air reporter i was like the nighttime reporter they would send me to city commission meetings and a lot of things that bored me to death and i would always be like send me to the high school football game send me the high school basketball game or the college game so i always wanted to gravitate to sports i got laid off ironically from that first job they canceled the 11 o'clock news got rid of three quarters of the staff they decided to play mash reruns instead because they would get the same commercial dollars in for mash and they didn't have to fund a 30-person newsroom so i went back to cnn i started there as an associate producer then a producer and i started to gravitate into becoming a storyteller first and foremost i love sports and the drama of sports and the stories of sports but after i covered a number of world series masters you name the event that became boring and i don't want to say unfulfilling but who wins and loses is pretty simple and i always wanted to go deeper i always wanted to go deeper so i started doing profiles becoming a feature producer traveling around the country and spending time with people i just love the psychology of sports what makes someone great what they have to sacrifice to give it up and that's kind of what shaped my early career at cnn was the reference experience where you were deciding okay i'm going to do a profile on such and such an athlete and you finally get to meet them and there's a letdown because of either just their personality and doesn't match what you expected or the depth or introspection that you would be hoping is there isn't there i would say i've had that experience myself not just with athletes frankly sometimes with people in other professions where when you don't know them you create a persona of them that's probably unfair you meet them and you're sort of like that's arguably the most uninteresting person i've ever met did you ever have that experience with athletes when you were doing this dozens of times countless times interestingly i started a cnn excuse me sports in 1987 on around 91 they wanted me to go up and head up the new york bureau that fell through at the last minute and my boss at the time jim walton called me in and said hey i'm sorry it fell through i really wanted that to happen would you be interested in covering the olympics and i said sure i grew up as a kid watching the olympics watching olga corbett nadia come in each all of the profiles and i didn't realize this till i was much older probably in my 40s maybe even my 50s how much of an impact that had on me like i sat in front i was fascinated by their human stories which roon arledge did dick ebersol has since done and when i got that job exactly what you said came true it was my dream job and i went and met a number of these olympic athletes and i want to say more often than not that may be a little unfair but to become great many of them were one-dimensional and they weren't interesting to me they were either a speed skater or skated in a circle for six hours a day went home rested and came back and skated for two more hours or weight lifters i remember i did some pieces on some weight lifters and i'm like what do you do what do you do for fun and they wake up at six and they have their workout then they go and eat then they rest then they work out again and doing those in the early years when i did a lot of profiles for the olympics i remember the people who fascinated me because they were just different and i realized that's what i'm drawn to people have a story to tell the way i describe it is i'm only interested in a story if it's an onion if you can just peel off layer after layer after layer after layer and the more layers you can peel off the more interested that character is to me i did a piece on a swimmer gary hall jr lived out in phoenix and he was just a free spirit he had taken a vw bus and redone it and i found that fascinating we shot it it's very visual he would wear a boxing robe out in shadow box on the blocks he was just a character and i loved him and i loved the three four days i spent with him and one day we were there and i said oh what do you do he goes i skateboard a lot and he's like hey let's bust my little brother out of school so we rode along with him as he walked into the principal's office and said hey my brother has a doctor's appointment i need to get him out and need to get him out now and he came and we were skateboarding and his little brother was holding onto the bumper of his vw bus as we're rolling down the street and guys like gary hall jr fascinated me and so i always gravitated to people like that i did early on in 91 the winner of 91 for the 92 winter olympics i went up and did i spent some time with the jamaican bobsled team hung out with them was just great because there were a bunch of characters did a story on prince albert who drove for monaco their bobsled team the latvian bobsled team because the wall had just come down communism had ended and i didn't know this but most of the gold medal winning drivers for russia were latvian so for the first time in their life they had pride they're like if we win a medal it's for latvia not for the soviet union so when you peel away the layers that's what interested me as a storyteller i always try to gravitate to stories like that so let's say it's 91 and you're up and running on these other things by this point bringing the story back to our main character bobby knight he's already won three national championships right bobby knight at this point is probably in his early 50s he's coached the 84 olympic men's team so he's got a gold medal and three national championships to his name including that epic season i i forget which one it was maybe 70 76 was 75 when they went undefeated as well 75 was they lost one and then 76 they went undefeated so how much were you paying attention to this guy bobby knight back in the early 90s i was a sports fan as a kid in the 70s so i don't remember the undefeated season but i do remember isaiah thomas winning the national title in 81. i do remember him coaching the olympic team in 84. i remember vividly reading john feinstein's book a season on the brink i just graduated college i love to read books and i read a number of them not just in sports i read everything on the vietnam war i could get my hands on across the board and i remember grabbing that book and devouring it in a few days and i was fascinated by him he would in the book feinstein painted a picture where knight would ride somebody i believe it was daryl thomas and call him a [ __ ] and you've got no guts or whatever and then thomas would go back to his locker and he'd open it and there'd be a box of tampons in there and i was just like whoa i couldn't believe what i was reading and yet as i thought about it at the time and this is the book came out in 87 as i thought about it the book ends feinstein ends with a line that says it always comes back to the question that ends justify the means and i remember closing the book and in my own mind saying yes he's won three national titles an olympic gold medal and i've never heard a player speak negatively about him so when i closed that book i said yes the ends do justify the means i had no idea that 13 years later my boss would give me an assignment that ultimately i would be asking that same question and presenting it canada to the country you see to me that's probably one of the most interesting coincidences of this story right is that that book comes out as you said it's sort of 87 whatever you read it immediately and at that point in time you see the part of the iceberg above the water again as you would learn later and we would all learn through your work even in 87 there were plenty of indications that there were players who had they been asked would have something different to say than maybe what was presented but i really love this thing that 13 years later your world collides with this guy in a way that you couldn't have imagined and of course in the intervening time a lot would happen you would go on to cover the atlanta olympics which in and of itself is kind of an amazing story not just because of the bombing but all that went on there so fast forward me a little bit from call it 87 into the 90s what else are you working on and perhaps more importantly how is it helping you prepare for what might turn into be one of the most difficult assignments of your career after reading that book and leaving the local station going back to cnn covering a lot of sports in the moment and you name the event i've covered it and you have to turn stories quickly you know a guy hits a home run in the bottom of the ninth and within 30 minutes you have to have the story written and sent back to atlanta and then to the world as a journalist i learned to make decisions quickly not always the right one but you get a ton of at-bats and you learn i always like i said earlier gravitated toward telling the story of people and the psychology of people and what makes them tick i used to sit around nick charles and i traveled the world he was the the lead anchor in cnn sports i remember vividly being at the cooperstown for the baseball hall of fame and sitting on the back porch and nick loved his wine and he's having wine and cheese and we're just talking and we we were knocking around names of people we wanted to profile and we talked about bob knight we both wanted to go fishing with him wanted to hang out with him just to see what made him tick and look inside because not knowing it at the time but he was that onion to me that i knew if you peeled away layers that he would be a fascinating character again not knowing that in 1999 four six eight years later i would be asked to look into him prior to 99 for the first handful of years i was at cnn i covered events then i became a feature producer the olympic producer and then i started getting special projects i did some documentaries for cnn i did one on title nine which is about it's you know shoe leather reporting they were getting rid of then swim programs gymnastic programs to try to balance the scales of title ix with football so that was some long-form storytelling where you spend a lot of time on a story i also did one that i didn't know the impact it would have until actually i did this film i did a documentary called field of screams and it was about the first documentary was so successful for cnn and we did it on such a small budget that the documentary department for news wanted us to do more the world cup was coming to the united states and i was fascinated by soccer hooligans and so i had pitched a story like is this going to be coming to america i read the book among the thugs if you've never read it it's a great read it's a literary kind of editor who immersed himself amongst the soccer hooligans in england and went into the psychology of how those riots start and it was fascinating to me and that's what i wanted to do but my bosses said no it's not really going to translate to an american audience but the idea of kind of fan violence in sports did so my film became much more about stalking death threats i went and we spent some time jim huber and i with mitch williams who gave up the home run in game six to lose to the toronto blue jays he and his wife talked about what it was like this was the guy that played for the phillies yes he was the reliever wild thing mitch williams yep real character again you peel away layers he was a character he said what he would think and to sit there and listen we went out to a ranch he had a ranch out in texas and he and his wife were there explaining what those days were like during the world series he had given up the home run he was back at his home in new jersey and he had gotten tons of death threats and his wife said we lived in an old house and the floors creaked and she said i remember vividly him walking around with a gun in his hand because the wind's blowing outside and things are creaking and people had been outside the house and so i tried to take people inside because we hear it we hear somebody gets a death threat it doesn't really sink in but to really have someone take you behind what that threat is and how it impacts them mentally and emotionally was fascinating the other thing i looked into is stalking this was part of it it was kind of like why fans will riot after winning the world series of the super bowl what will happen when a fan sends a death threat to an athlete and the other one was stalking we looked at the monica seller stabbing i ended up meeting two of the more fascinating people i've ever interviewed dr park dietz runs a threat assessment group in san diego and he's the psychologist psychiatrist and i'm probably going to get his title wrong who spent 40 hours interviewing jeffrey dahmer so he could prove that what he did was saying the thought process of what he did so he couldn't use the insanity plea so just to talk to him over lunch was fascinating to me and the other one was dr gavin de becker and at the time he was the one that every star went to if they got death threats or threatening mail madonna letterman all the stars of that era and i followed the story of katarina vid who stalked for three years so you asked me how these things prepared me this is i spent nine months on this documentary it wasn't two days three days three weeks three months it was a long time so these documentaries prepared me in how to tell a story at an hour level how to tell a story at a two hour level all the different places you could take kind of a narrative yarn so i had done those two documentaries at cnn those two things probably prepared me the most for what the assignment i was going to get in 1999. now in the 90s were there other examples that came to you that would ultimately serve as basically reminders of this idea that the cost of excellence in sports you know were there other examples of sports or athletes even that you covered where you could say hey have we gone too far in society have we let this athlete or coach get away with things simply on the basis of their greatness and maybe we need to revisit that i can think of a couple of examples in retrospect although i will admit at the time i was blind to it who came to your mind who are the two that came to your mind i think mike tyson comes to my mind i grew up as a huge boxing fan like lived for boxing absolutely the single most important thing in my life from the age of 13 onward when you think about the mike tyson of the late 80s and early 90s i mean an incredible talent who was completely out of control and in retrospect of course now with the wisdom of being an old man it's a very clear understanding of what a traumatic childhood he had and how that childhood would produce a knife that is very sharp on two sides right on the one hand it made him an unbelievably rage filled fighter and he built up an armor to make sure he could never be hurt again but without fixing any of the underlying problems he basically was going to be a non-stop herding machine outside the ring as well that's certainly one example that comes to me i think the other one just sort of looking back would probably be tiger woods i don't follow golf that closely but when you look at everything that sort of unfolded in tiger's life call it 10 years ago you get the sense that this guy who was such a prodigy may not have had enough people around him that could say hey let's revisit how you're gonna sort of live your life and things probably just got out of control but again when you're so dominant and you're winning and the money is there and the titles are there i think it's easy to overlook these things so i guess i'm not saying these things to be critical of the athletes i'm saying them more as with a little bit of wisdom i look back and go huh that's interesting and of course knight i think will end up being arguably one of the most extreme examples of that kind of goes back a little bit to the onion where people why do you like andre agassi but not pete sampras because people whose great moments and worst moments aren't separated by that much are not as fascinating but you get somebody like knight who in one area is brilliant and a genius and he's exceptional at so many different things and he's so flawed in others that's why people like tiger tyson and knight fascinated me i didn't spend any time around mike tyson we had a group that did a lot of our boxing ironically i was going to go out for the tyson holifield fight but when he got arrested and incarcerated for rape that fight never happened that was going to be my first time out there but when he got out of prison i did a a show for espn of him returning to the ring and i was fascinated by him and to this day i am i have a curiosity i think like you into what the environment and the situation that forms these people there's things that as you eloquently said that it sharpens the knife and it's on both sides good and bad and i always wonder with mike if he was surrounded by better people would his better character traits have come to the surface i think you've seen mike in the last five to ten years that he does have a sensitive side he does have a caring side he's not a horrible monster but there was years where he acted that way when i did that documentary i spoke to the president of hbo sports at the time and after the interview ended he told some stories of mike and his guys renting hotel rooms suites in philadelphia and just marching as many women through there as they could in a three-day span told you things that the general public didn't know what was going on and he was surrounded by people i think the challenge is when when you're a cash cow for everyone they're worried about you making money they're not really worried about you and the underlying things that you need to work on that you mentioned because that doesn't make them money they want to get as much money out of you as they can so they're going to let you do what you want until that gravy train of money runs dry and i think that's sadly what happened to mike with don king or rory holloway i always felt that when you go back to the beginning of tyson's career i mean look there's probably nobody who was able to look at him purely as a person including custom otto who was really a father figure to him but there was a guy back involved in his life early on steve lott most people probably wouldn't recognize that name unless they're real aficionados of tyson history back in the mid 80s but i always felt like steve lott was probably along with maybe even teddy atlas were kind of people that could have kept tyson on the straight and arrow he was also managed by these two guys that were ridiculously shrewd and created kind of a grotesque deal where they took a third of his purses which was legally permitted but obviously by any stretch of the imaginations completely disgusting but one of the two tyson did have a fond defection fork i named jimmy jacobs who died in early 88 the other guy bill caton he had no relationship with and i always felt that the end of tyson was actually the death of jacobs because d'amato died in 85. he'd already by that point kicked teddy atlas out of the camp actually d'amato did which was a huge mistake he'd canned steve lott on the basis of don king sort of brainwashing him and then jimmy jacobs dies and then this is all before the sphinx fight the sphinx fight was really the last fight in my opinion where he went in as a great fighter and everything thereafter was sort of downhill let's turn to bobby knight let's talk about when this first became the lead thing for you so is it easier i guess maybe you could give people a little bit of a history of what's happening tonight in the 90s and then how you're getting brought into it he won his last national championship in the late 80s and in the 90s he still had good teams 20 win seasons but he started getting bounced in the first or second round of the tournament and again other than being a sports fan i was never assigned to cover him i was never but i followed it like probably the rest of america you kind of just kept waiting for him to get that player or get that sign a class that would put him back on top he had gone from 76 to 81 to 87 there's five to six years in between each of those so in the early 90s you're like oh he's gonna come back and he just wasn't and other than just being a sports fan he really wasn't on my radar then in 1999 luke wrecker announces he's leaving indiana for those people who don't know luke wrecker was the leading scorer got the most minutes he was kind of the star of the team what year was he a sophomore he was after his sophomore season he did leave that's when my boss steve robinson i was at this point at cnn i did the olympics i did special projects and then wherever they needed me because i like variety i get bored doing the same thing all the time so hey you need somebody to cover the world series i'll go if you need me to do this i'll go hey if somebody's going on vacation need a line producer in the studio they'd plug me in there for three weeks so i had variety i had come back from a site survey in sydney australia for the 2000 olympics i went ahead a year in advance to set everything up for cnn and i just gotten back and my boss said oh what do you want to do we're just talking about it i don't know a day or two later steve called me in the office and said hey luke record just left indiana and we talked about it and he said why don't you look in to why he's the third mcdonald's high school all-american in the last two and a half years to leave the program and he's the most popular player there getting the most minutes normally somebody who's unhappy leaves a program your leading scorer usually doesn't leave and i remember sitting in steve's office not being very excited at all about this assignment i was just like it's going to be a waste of time steve and i talked about how we thought it may be more of a story on aau basketball and how these athletes are coming out of high school with inflated egos big sense of themself and they can't play for a guy like coach knight anymore they have a sense of entitlement so we thought the story may kind of focus on that the explosion of aau basketball how these guys are stars now at 16 17 and 18 and they're not willing to be coached in college anymore i vividly remember walking out across the newsroom of steve's office back to my desk just not being that excited thinking it's going to be a waste of time and maybe for the listener robert give people a bit of background on bobby knight's coaching philosophy you know starting at west point himself obviously winning a national title really being a guy that coaches a team not a star even though stars came out of the program like what about his coaching style led you to the conclusion that hey a 16 year old high school star might just be not willing to be coached under that system what was your preconceived idea i thought what i think most people in america thought is these guys just aren't tough enough coach knight came out of orville ohio he went to ohio state he was a role player on their national championship team with john havlicek lucas etc and shortly after that he went on to army to coach by the age of 24 he was the head coach at army and then from there he went on to indiana and he very much took what he learned at army and applied it the sense of i'm going to break you down to nothing and then build you back up into the person i want you to be so he was hard on players it was team before i or me or you it was very much about his system it was very much about unselfish basketball playing defense moving your feet it was about sharing the basketball it was about there's no stars on my team other than isaiah thomas i mean the 76 team had a lot of great players but isaiah thomas was probably i don't want to offend anybody who went to iu probably the only transcendent player that went there isaiah was a little different but the 87 team again they had steve alford etc but there was no superstar talents so night was all about team basketball and he was very hard the portrait i had of night in my head and the knowledge i had of him and the assignment it just kind of added up that these kids weren't tough enough they're wimps they're soft they're pampered they're entitled and they couldn't take it and that's kind of the message that was put out when they left a year and a half two years earlier neil reed had left and they said he wasn't tough enough and then jason collier had left and then you know there's whispers and rumors of why etc and then it wasn't until wrecker left that my boss said wait a second something's going on up there and steve had a great sense steve robinson had come from sports illustrated when cnn and sports illustrated merged to create cnnsi a sports network and he had headed up their investigations for the magazine so he had a great sense for news it wasn't me i didn't think this was a story he did and he said go look into it and so that's the mindset i took into it i knew who knight was i knew how hard he was on players and i just thought what i was going to find out is these guys just didn't want to do it and they wanted to go somewhere where a coach would just roll out the basketballs let him play let him be the star not play defense maybe not even work as hard so i wasn't excited i didn't think there was anything there there so when you show up is wrecker already gone yes is reed still playing at this point in time and reed went to where reed went to kentucky if i recall right reed went to he was recruited by kentucky but he went to southern miss okay and collier was already gone as well he had gone to georgia tech to play for bobby kremens so reed when i called him he had just finished at southern miss collier was playing at georgia tech and wrecker was transferring at the time he was going to go to arizona got in a horrible accident in colorado he decided to stay closer to home so he enrolled at iowa after i started looking into it so steve called me into the office the morning after the announcement that wrecker left interestingly wrecker faxed in notice to coach knight at midnight sent a fax at midnight saying i'm not returning it happened to be when coach knight was leaving for a trip for cuba and it was just like that's a weird way to say i'm leaving that interested me a little bit so the next morning my boss says hey did you see the news luke record just left start making some phone calls go up there and try to figure out what's going on why are really good players leaving indiana and bob knight's program that was the assignment and what i've learned since then is all great investigative assignments start with a really simple question why did somebody break into the democratic national headquarters that led to the resignation of richard nixon it's a simple question and my simple question was steve said go find out why good players are leaving coach knight's program and it was as simple as that it wasn't an investigation it's just a question and we thought it would take us down this society kind of a look at society entitlement it was not an investigation at all at the start but it became an investigation with a couple of my first phone calls i did a lot of reading two days later it was a sunday night i called and neil reed's dad picked up and he and i talked and he didn't hold anything back terry told me everything and this was off the record or on the record it was off the record again i was just trying to understand the story and then i called neil that sunday night and neil and i talked for about 90 minutes and in the film for those of people haven't seen it i saved everything i can't tell you i probably had a dozen notebooks from the 18 months i reported this right took notes on people's phone calls and everything and i saved them all they were in a box in my basement for 15 years and when i did the film i went back and just opened the box sat here in my office with three cameras on me and just went through every single thing i pulled out it took like six or seven hours and it just refreshed my memory and it became the spine of the film so terry reid spoke to me and then neil spoke to me and what did neil tell you on that first call he told me why he went to indiana he loved indiana his father was a basketball coach his father much like coach knight was a hard ass his father admired i think probably loved coach knight's style and terry was very much a coach in the mold of bob knight so much so that the family moved to bloomington for neil's beginning of his high school years freshman and sophomore then he moved back to louisiana and neil became two-time state player of the year he never made another visit he knew he was always going to go to coach knight he wanted to play for coach knight neil was a tough-minded kid the tougher it was the tougher he got he wanted to go to coach knight play for coach knight because he wanted to go play for somebody who's going to push him and make him better and he told me you could just tell the love he had for indiana basketball and specifically coach knight and that's why he went there and then we started talking about why he left and he just took me through his three seasons there and he started painting a picture of what it was like day after day after day after day there was three things that stuck out to me that became the spine of my reporting in 1999 and 2000 when i was at cnn one was that at a practice one day they were running a drill larry richardson was a big man and coach knight had always taught neil the point guard hey talk to your team command their presence command their attention you're running it and he always wanted him to talk to the players during the play so they ran this play where neil threw a bounce pass into larry richardson larry made the layup and coach was like that's great larry that's great great and then coach knight laid into neil why the hell didn't you call out his name why didn't you talk to him why didn't you basically direct him to what to do he gave all this praise to larry and then just laid into neil in kind of an unrelenting fashion that was coach knight's style and neil said i did and knight was like no you didn't yes i did no you didn't yes i did and then neil made the mistake if you look at it as a mistake to say larry did i and larry richardson said yes you did and that embarrassed coach knight and that's when coach knight according to neil at this time came at him and grabbed him by the throat that story interested me because if it was true it's an assault i kept talking to neil about the aftermath and other things that had happened and he told me two other stories that jumped off the pages of my notes one was that one time he had kicked the president of the university miles brand out of practice anybody who's been around indiana basketball knows that practices are closed you're not allowed in there unless coach knight lets you there's a padlock and a chain on the doors no one's allowed in to see what he does so one day the university president was there brought some people in on a tour and was kind of talking out loud to hit the group that he was with and coach knight said something to the effect of shut the f up i don't come into your office and talk while you're trying to work get the hell out of here and miles brand and the people you're with got up and left and looking back i don't think coach knight like literally got in his face and said it i think he said it out loud for the whole gym to hear he may have not even been looking at coach brand but the message was sent at that point i was like holy [ __ ] you've got the balls to throw the president out of practice like who's running this school and then the third story neil told me is one time they were playing real poorly and they were in the locker room and coach knight came out of a bathroom stall with his pants around his ankles with toilet paper in his hand and he had wiped himself and he showed the toilet paper to the players and said this is how you guys are playing you're playing like [ __ ] and he brandished soiled toilet paper to the team and those three stories i mean jumped off a my notes that night and jumped through the phone in the 90 minute call we had so i had this all on background off the record not for attribution but as i wrote in my note to my boss steve i said to him and i read it in the film i go i think he's going to tell me this on the record one day and so that first phone call that i made to neil reed and when he picked up the phone all of a sudden it turned from a story in my mind about society entitlement of aau basketball players are they willing to be coached is night too tough to an investigation did these three things happen can i confirm that these three incidents took place so when you get off that phone call what does your intuition tell you does your intuition say this kid is making this up he's a disgruntled former player or does your intuition say this is possibly right the ends no longer justify the means which way are you leaning at this point 50 50 because exactly what you said ran through my mind i'm like he's probably disgruntled is he exaggerating did it really happen but he described them in such detail that there was a lot of validity to what he said and again part of what i've learned is if you're going to do a good investigation you can't get too excited and you can't get to that like you just have to be even keel and the one thing i'm proudest of is during this process i just kept my nose to the grindstone i never really looked up we can talk later there's three times i kind of popped my head up and saw what was happening but the rest of the time when i got off that phone call exactly what you said was rushing through my mind is a disgruntled player who's out to get coach knight or is there truth to this and that was kind of my mantra and as i say in the film i got on a plane the next day i talked to my boss and i'm like i gotta fly to indiana and i'm looking out the window and i was like is he lying to me is this kid lying to me or not as i looked out the window that's what i was thinking and i was also thinking that if he's not there's a story here that's when i got interested after that first phone call with neil i said i have to figure out if he's telling me the truth and if he is telling me the truth how do i turn this into a story where people are willing to sit on camera and talk about it so where do you go from there do you go to collier do you go to wrecker how do you i assume they're going to be an easier place to start than any currently active player right basically what i did is i took a big step back and i said i have to understand indiana basketball the first person i interviewed is gary donna he passed away just within the last two years and he's the first person i sat down with and he started hoosier basketball magazine for those people who don't follow high school and college basketball it is the thing in the state of indiana high school basketball is the heartbeat of that state and he follows high school basketball every season he puts out the definitive thing on high school basketball so he knows all these kids from seventh eighth ninth tenth grade all the way through high school so when i spoke to him it was the first interview i did he just told me what he knew about it and what he said that made my initial reporting and is also in the film is that coach knight is like dr jekyll and mr hyde that he can be the most charming brilliant person in the world and then when he gets behind the closed doors i told you his practices are closed when he gets behind the closed doors he can lose it and he wants nobody to see that side of him and and what you said earlier you'd see the tip of the iceberg but you never saw the whole iceberg underneath so everything he told me led me to believe that there may be truth to what neil said but again as a journalist gary donna wasn't there so he can't confirm any of those stories but he painted a picture in an environment i think there may be some validity to what he said the other thing that gave me a sense that what neil may have said is true is because gary donna told me he said i've known these kids many of the in-state kids and even the out-of-state kids who come there he follows recruiting so that they talk to him a lot of them had gone to the school and they'd see him at an event or a high school game and they just talked to him what's it like what was your time like so they talked to him because his magazine doesn't print that right so he just told me story after story after story so that was the baseline that first interview kind of was foundational for me that it gave me a sense of what it's like and why the administration is afraid of coach knight it didn't confirm what neil said but he painted a picture of an atmosphere where what neil told me now i understood that it may have happened and it could have that environment exists now look it wasn't like bobby knight hadn't said and done things up until the point that we're talking about now that weren't already putting in a mental league beyond what you're hearing from from neil reed right i mean in 1988 he made a an absolutely ridiculous statement to connie chung on air that i mean to this day i still can't believe it a human would say that let alone a guy would say that and still have a job you remember the statement of course yes ironically connie chung was doing a special on stress and they pick coach knight because he has a stressful job or whatever somehow the topic of rape came up and coach knight said something to the effect of if rape is inevitable lay back and enjoy it and what he went on to say is hey you can't control it the plane's down you can't do anything about it he would have been fired within 15 minutes in 2020 if that came out and probably in 2005 and probably in 1995. but in 1998 he was the most powerful man in the state of indiana i was aware of that incident i was aware of the chair throw a number of years before during a game where he threw the chair across the court while someone was at the foul line i didn't know the impact of it and to be honest peter i didn't realize how important that moment was until i did the film 18 years after my reporting what i learned by having 18 years of hindsight is that at that point knight had won three national championships an olympic gold medal in 84. in 1987 in my reporting i had uncovered that the bloomington faculty council was so offended by the john feinstein book that they wanted to look into knight's conduct and they put together kind of a bill of rights for athletes that said no coach should verbally or mentally abuse their athletes and i uncovered this this was in 1999 during my reporting and i was like wow they knew about this in 1987. and i'm reporting on it in 1999. the timeline is they were looking into kind of reprimanding coach knight reigning him in knowing he's out of control and what does knight do he wins the national championship now they cannot put a saddle on there's no way the horse is out of the barn and it is so far down the road that there's no coming back he was a legend he was the most powerful man in the state so when he said that with connie chung there was a huge outcry initially the president released a tempered statement that said something to the effect of coach knight's quote does not reflect indiana university it was very middle of the road kind of it didn't chastise him or go after him and what coach knight did is he went and interviewed for a job at new mexico and as alex sander wolf sports illustrated basketball writer he's written so many books on basketball one of the best minds in the sport in my film he said it was a shot across the bow at the president coach knight was like really you're going to put out a statement about me i'll go to new mexico and let's see what happens all of a sudden the entire state is up in arms now attacking the president not attacking coach knight for what he said but attacking the president like you're gonna drive away bob knight he just won a national championship three national championships an olympic gold medal and so that shot across the bow gave knight the power he needed to survive up until 2000 if that makes sense they knew about him in 87 they were trying to do something he won the national title he makes a horrible statement to connie chung in 88 but he survives all the way until 2000 and that's because he basically showed who was boss in the state the president of the university wasn't coach knight was and a number of presidents changed during his 29 years at indiana but coach knight remained and that's why he was allowed to exist through the late 80s and early 90s all the way up until 2000 did his behavior publicly get worse over time i mean you go to youtube and you can find no shortage of best moments in press conferences and you could watch that and come away thinking there's not a press conference where this guy is not unhinged but presumably those are just the highlights so it was clear that he had unbelievable disdain for the press when he didn't like their questions i mean he was unbelievably rude in a way that you just don't see it even amongst professional athletes there were many examples of him just telling a reporter to go [ __ ] themselves like you're a [ __ ] idiot i mean what the [ __ ] shut the [ __ ] up that's a dumb [ __ ] question right yeah yeah showing up to a press conference with a bull whip telling everybody he's going to whip his players with it you know as you said throwing chairs having an african-american player this was at the ncaa tournament i believe it was calvert cheney he had a player bend over and he went and he's like you can't touch me i'm going to do what i want to answer your question as media grew from the 70s the 80s to the 90s up until 2000 we had greater access to him i don't think he fundamentally changed people have asked me this a lot was he the same person in 2000 as he was in the early 70s when he went to indiana and i said fundamentally he was the same what i think changed was he had success at army he came to indiana had immediate success took him to the final four in the second year won a national title in 76 won two more in olympic gold medal so the ends justified the means during that run from when he first got to indiana up until 1987 but when he started getting eliminated in the first or second round of the tournament and these incidents became more and more public i personally believe he took it out on his players and said it can't be me i won three national titles olympic gold medal it has to be you and if you put yourself in the position of those players i don't know if what he did to neil reid's class was any different than what he did to kent benson's class or isaiah thomas's class but you'll put up with a lot of [ __ ] all year long and if you win the national championship you forget about a lot of it and you're a hero forever but when you start losing in the first and second round of the tournament you're less willing to put up with that so did he change did he get worse i think what i've come to understand is in the early 70s and 80s right when he'd push you to your breaking point he'd throw his arm around you walk out of practice say something to you for 15 seconds and it all went away and you're willing to run through a wall for him and next thing you know they're fitting you for a national championship ring and you're like hey it was all worth it but in the 90s instead of throwing his arm around kids there's the tirade that was caught on audio in 91 he took it out on them and anybody can google you know bob knight audio locker room yeah this is the one uh for the purdue game but there's an interesting point about that robert which is any player that was asked about that doesn't remember it specifically because they basically say something to the effect of that happened every day that just happens to be one that got recorded but that's what every single day in the locker room was like it's not like okay that was a really bad day and we were really playing badly and he went a little too far but it stands out and i remembered it's like nobody actually remembers that discussion that's one of my questions to richard mandeville who played for five years for coach knight i said you've heard the audio on the internet and he immediately said that's what i wish everybody who was watching this would understand that that's every day and what interests me because i recommend everybody who listens this go listen to the audio and you hear the f-bombs and the geds and all the profanity but listen to how many times coach knight says i or me here's a guy who from his dazed army it's about teen it's not about an individual it's not about i it's not about me and that's what everybody in the state of indiana and that's what i admired about him that it was about teamwork but in that you will not put me in that [ __ ] position again i've had to sit around for a year with an eight and ten record if you do that to me again i will run you it's i and me i and me i and me i and me and i think that's where coach knight possibly changed in the 90s he had been so successful that when he started not being successful in his mind it was it can't be me it's got to be my players and then he wasn't throwing his arm around him he'd push him to the breaking point in the 70s and 80s and then reel him back in just enough to push him again to reel him back in to win titles but in the 90s he didn't do that and then come the tournament they were mentally and physically done and they wanted no part of winning a number of players told me that in the 90s when the ncaa tournament would come probably the greatest three weeks in sports for people who love basketball we didn't care if we lost yeah we wanted to win but if we lost we knew we didn't have to go to practice the next day so the silver lining and losing was the season's over and i don't have to listen to that again and that's why you saw him lose often in the first and second round in my opinion you make a really important point here which is there's this view that knight is this guy who places the importance of the team at the highest level but i think you hit the nail on the head i think this was really about his ego and i think that whether that was something that changed from the 80s into the 90s i can't speak to that of course perhaps nobody can but i think a lot of people who give off this aura of team first team first team first are really quite ego driven when you really get underneath the surface and that's a great example there are times when i find myself doing the same thing there are times when i find myself being so ego focused so focused on myself that i sort of lose sight of what the purpose is with respect to others and if you stay in that state for a very long period of time it's a bad place to be you're going to behave badly and the other point you make is that really he had lost all sense of checks and balances there was nobody in that guy's orbit that could offer any sense of sanity do you have any sense by the way of what his private life was like because it's one thing for a group of 20 year olds who worship you to show up and take that type of abuse but do we have any sense of what his personal relationships were like with friends with family and was he able to sort of put some sort of restraint in place with respect to his anger in that setting do you have any indication of that the only indication i have is he was divorced once previously when i started doing again after i spoke to neil reid after i flew up to indiana at first and did a basic kind of round of interviews to get a sense in the lay of the land literally i backed up all the way to army and started talking to people who knew him there why he left there it didn't point to what my assignment was was why did three players leave in the last two years but i wanted to get a sense of that i wanted to understand him from head to toe at one point i got a phone call and was put in touch with a professor at the school who on background he has since passed away so i can share it at the time he was on a hunting trip with coach knight in argentina and he said i don't want to go public but i just want to make you aware that i was there in a hunting lodge with he and his son and coach knight got in a fight with his son and i don't have my notes in front of me i don't know if he dislocated his shoulder and bloodied his nose but it wasn't pleasant the professor told me described it to a t of what took place at the time i had done my reporting and cnn had done our initial report it was a 16 minute piece alleging the three things that neil had told me that coach knight had grabbed him by the throat he'd kicked the president out of practice and he had brandished soiled toilet paper so it's front page news around the country everybody's attacking cnn me neil reed anybody in the piece and so i start getting phone calls from people i'm put in touch with this professor who said hey i don't want to go public but i want you to know what i know and again much like neil he told me everything and i went to my bosses and said i gotta fly to argentina to find out if this is true and we didn't have huge budgets at cnn sports at the time we were getting attacked as if we were going after night so my bosses said hey just we can't go down there we can't make it look like we're out to get him and i go i'm not out to get him but people are calling me so i kind of went around my bosses a little bit and called a stringer a stringer is in the news businesses we have contacts at different places countries cities towns around the world that aren't on our staff but if we hire them for the day they'll do work for us so i found out a stringer for cnn and i called i said can you go over to this hunting lodge and can you talk to this person here's the phone number this this this and the stringer came back and said he confirmed what happened he runs a very high end lodge he doesn't want to bad mouth is very wealthy clients but he did confirm to me that he drove them to the hospital and said to coach knight you're no longer welcome here and that really to me you talked about the tip of the iceberg or what we see you asked me about his private life and i'm like that was evidence to me that he couldn't control his temper in his private life and i wanted to report it i had two different people who wouldn't go on the record or confirm it with me at the time so i couldn't as a journalist i can't report it because i can't definitively confirm it so what did i do i called christopher simpson christopher simpson was miles brand right hand man he was the vice president of kind of media communications and he was the voice of indiana university for miles brand so i'm like well at least i'll let him know that i know so i start poking as a journalist poking and prodding and people i'll never forget it was the day where they would ultimately announce zero tolerance and i may be getting ahead of the story but i'm on the phone with them and i said to christopher simpson i said if coach knight can't control his temper so much so that he would harm his own son how can you as a representative of this university ensure that if mothers and fathers around the country are going to send their sons to play for him that they're not going to be safe and i was appalled at his answer i was walking on the sidewalk outside of the was the center in indianapolis where they're going to have the press conference and i remember pacing up and down the sidewalk and he said robert that has nothing to do with his coaching and i about jumped through the phone at him and i said how can you not see the connection and the correlation if he can't control his temper and we'll do that to one of his sons how can you ensure that kids who come here to play are going to be protected we went back and forth at it that day but that gave you a sense of where the university was in trying to do damage control and protect them so what ultimately gave you and the senior leadership at cnn the confidence to publish the story and when was that so 99 you start looking at this how long did it take and how much digging did you need to do before you were willing to write this and and i don't want to give the story away but there's a tape in here somewhere and i can't remember if the tape came before or after the publication of the piece all back up to april of 99 is when i get called into steve's office luke record just left the third player in two and a half years to be gone talk to neil that sunday night several days later fly up to indiana and literally for the next nine months or more i'm reporting it and other than peripheral people no one's going on camera no one wants to speak out against coach knight and as i said in the film i could hear and feel the fear in their voices as i spoke to them and that's something that fascinated me as a journalist i'm like why are they so afraid of this guy why will they tell me everything on background or off the record or maybe on the record but not for attribution which means you can use what they say but not tie their name to it that drove me that actually drove me for a long period of time i said there's something here and i have to be patient and i have to give steve robinson my boss credit because i did a lot of different things during this nine months but he allowed me to pursue this story at my tempo because i knew if i called you peter and you told me a lot of things and then i give you the full court press a week later trying to get you on camera you're probably going to say no i had to play and develop a relationship with each individual and they're all different so i had to kind of keep everybody on the hook until i could start getting i knew if i got one person on camera i could probably get the second if i got two i could get the third and if i got three i could get five but who was going to be the first so i interviewed professor murray sperber i interviewed other people in and around campus and i basically to be honest i had the story the first night i called neil reed those three things became the backbone of the story i just had to confirm it so you asked earlier at one point i early on i called luke cracker would not speak with me and even speak with you on background nothing at all no no and what about collier i spoke to luke's mother on background and i spoke to others who told me that luke wanted to quit after his freshman year and he and his mother went in to speak to coach knight about hey he doesn't want to play here anymore and coach knight basically said i'll change i'll change i'll change i understand i'll change i don't want to lose him and so luke decided to stay and year two nothing changed so at the end of year two luke wants out so i had a sense of his story through other players through his mother and then i call collier and i was based in atlanta at cnn in downtown atlanta at the cnn center for anyone who knows atlanta georgia tech's two miles away three miles away so i get his number and i call him and he as i say in the film he's like no no not interested not interested not interested and as a investigative reporter you just don't want them to hang up because if i can keep them on the phone for two minutes i can keep them on for five and you can't keep them on for ten unless you can keep them on for three so you just try to tread water and i was like well how about background i'm right up the road let's grab a cup of coffee i'll take you out to the dinner i'll do it like i'm just trying anything to get him to say okay i'll talk to you and he was no no no no no and i just i said jason i'm not going to put your name out there i'm just trying to understand what it's like to play for coach knight and he goes you know what it's like to play for coach knight and i had heard this a number of times before and usually it would lead to an hour conversation so i'm like oh i've broken through and he goes go rent full metal jacket and then he hung up on me and for those of you haven't watched full metal jacket it's about an army recruit someone in the military and they have a drill sergeant that is just relentless on them and the army recruit goes crazy kills himself kills the drill sergeant and so i had seen the movie but right after luke said that i was taken back as he hung up the phone and i went i think it was the blockbuster still existed back then rented the movie brought it home and watched it again to try to understand what he was talking about and that was the extent of my conversation with jason collier you want to know what it's like to play for coach knight rent full metal jacket so i did i now knew that jason wouldn't speak with me luke wouldn't speak with me for now so i started going through the roster that year and i started trying to track down charlie miller he was neil reed's roommate at one time he was a guard kid out of miami and it took me forever to track him down i called miami made a number of phone calls down there i heard he was playing in sweden and finland and started calling teams over there and all of a sudden i can't even remember how i found out but i heard he was in chicago and i tracked him down and he said yeah i'll talk to you and that was a huge breakthrough for me because he went on camera first i don't know 10 15 minutes in the interview told me how much he loved coach knight he had the respect for coach knight coach knight gave an opportunity other people didn't he was just praising coach knight and i asked him about neil reid and why he left and he said yes he did put his hand around neil's throat i don't think he should have do i think he choked him no but i don't think he should have done it so he confirmed that there was physical contact and he did it on camera and that was a huge breakthrough for me when i got charlie miller on camera and once i got charlie i was hoping pretty confident that the dominoes would start to fall that once you know i could go back to neil and say hey charlie miller confirmed what you said so you're not going to be out there by yourself and i had called richard mandeville i mentioned earlier he had played for night for five years and i had spoken back and forth with him a number of times and he said no i'm not interested blah blah blah and i came back and i said hey i spoke to charlie mellor i spoke to neil reid would you now go on camera and then he sat on camera and so did neil read so those are the three players that i got to go on camera you know it's probably worth pausing for a moment because i'm sure the listeners sort of sitting here wondering what is it about bobby knight that's so interesting to me right on this podcast i think the reason and i don't even know if i really explained this to you robert when i reached out to you but i'm a perfectionist and i've been that way as long as i've had any sort of conscious awareness of anything i mean my mother tells stories about me as a kid doing things that my siblings didn't do as far as just being such a perfectionist and also i've had i've had a terrible temper my entire life again one of those things that i didn't know how to explain it especially because neither of my parents have a bad temper and neither of my siblings have a bad temper so it's always this sort of weird thing like if i'm five years old and i was building a big lego tower and it broke i'd smash it into a million pieces and i was just utterly pissed off beyond words when i couldn't do something perfectly my guess is there are probably a lot of people listening to this who can relate to that because that phenotype can lead to some pretty good accomplishments right you can become pretty good at sports you can do really well in school you can do really well professionally but it comes at a great cost and i think now that i'm older i'm becoming more and more and more aware of that cost so much so that in the past year one of the biggest kind of breakthroughs i've had in therapy which was very difficult i consider it the single biggest step function i've ever experienced in my life was becoming aware enough of my inner sort of monologue not dialogue but monologue with myself and i was actually going through my journal because i journaling as a pretty big part of what i sort of do to kind of keep track of myself i came across a sort of an entry from maybe seven months ago where my therapist said something to the effect of look your lack of self-compassion is really extreme i want you to sort of personify that entity inside of your brain that is constantly berating you i want you to become more aware of it and i want you to actually give it an identity and without hesitation the identity was bobby knight and that assumed the name so now in the journal i could refer to bobby knight and what bobby knight says to me luckily i've been meditating for a number of years and meditation gives you enough of a pause or at least an awareness of the inner voice so now i just had to listen for it and it was really shocking what it would say over some of the most trivial things people who list this podcast probably aware like i love archery i love you know race car driving all these things even a mistake in one of those things which are completely inconsequential right i'm not a professional anything like i do these things as a pure hobby but just what i would say to myself when i make a mistake it would never be ah try again better you know do it better the next time it would be you [ __ ] idiot you are so bad at this how dare you practice this hard and still be this shitty i mean what is wrong with you can you imagine being this bad at something and caring as much as you do talk about it you know and it was just this never-ending insult and so this idea expanded into something of how like we're all made up of these different pieces of our personality you have sort of the child in you you have this adaptive child you have this entity that's trying to become a functional adult but unfortunately what i realized was hey the chairman of my board is bobby knight and it's going to be really hard for me to make progress in life when the chairman of the board inside of my head is bobby knight and somehow seeing your documentary is i think what allowed me to come up with this idea you know again be able to put a name and a face to it in a character so that i could literally picture bobby knight in my head screaming at me every time i made mistakes and that was step one but then step two was learning to offer an alternative explanation which was basically my way of saying you're no longer the chairman of the board thank you very much in fact you can leave the boardroom now now you're still going to be knocking and you're going to be very loud for very long we're going to a place where you're not allowed to talk to me that way and eventually when you stop talking to me that way i'm going to stop talking to others that way i'm going to stop talking to myself that when those other things so i throw that interjection in because i want people to understand like where my fascination comes from with this because i just don't believe i'm alone in this and while bobby knight may be one of the most extreme examples of the outward manifestation of this i suspect there are many people who can relate to that inner critic that is brutal and this sort of lack of compassion we can have for ourselves fascinating to me because there's a number of similarities and words that jumped out to me that make what you just talked about so connected to coach knight the similarities are you talked about a lego tower and you would explode there were stories of coach knight he read every book in the library when he was a kid supposedly and he'd play board games with his grandmother and she'd let him win because if he didn't he'd throw a fit and the first thing that came to my mind is that story when you're telling me your story so the similarities and the connective tissue and you using him as a character and a name to define it he's a perfectionist like you said he has a terrible temper that's actually was his greatest undoing is his temper i to an extent have some of those character traits so i could understand coach knight my dad was great but he was a direct communicator who would yell and it would be tough i knew he loved me so it wasn't didn't go that deep into me i get frustrated quickly when things aren't perfect when things don't work out well i can have a temper i'm a perfectionist i could understand coach night at a level the one word that you use that jumped out to me a number of times was awareness the awareness you've come to realize is powerful and if you're not aware aware of it you can't help yourself or help solve it and when you said that i wrote down that a story came to mind i interviewed dave kindred when i did my film i didn't want to interview night haters or people who love knight i wanted to interview people who had known him for a long long time and knew the good side and the bad side the dr jekyll and mr hyde and dave kindred long time journalist at the atlanta constitution i think usa today he's known him since the early 70s and he told me a story where he attended a basketball game in the mid 70s indiana versus kentucky it was a famous game where coach knight and joby hall kind of met at midcourt on the sidelines and knight kind of cuffed him on the back of the head there was a photo of it it was a big deal and dave kindred kept asking knight about it in the press conference and knight would not answer it and got angry and got frustrated and so kindred leaves the press conference and he goes to write his story so he goes back out onto the court where press row is and he's writing his story with a couple of other writers and here comes knight walking across the court and kindred looked at the other sports writers and said this isn't going to go well this looks like trouble not in a bad way but just observationally and he said knight sat down with him and he said how do i get myself into these situations and he went on to tell how he and coach knight he's like how does this keep happening to me which led me to believe that coach knight had an awareness of his flaws as early as the mid 70s unlike you he didn't try to address him maybe he tried to and just couldn't but that story i found fascinating it didn't fit into my reporting because my reporting was on the teens in the 90s why those three guys left but it was a story that never made the film never made everything but really told me a lot about knight that he very early on knew that there was something in his nature and his character and that he had a temper and that he would keep putting himself in situations that maybe after they were over he'd look back and go why the hell did i do that but he never got it under control and it ultimately led to his downfall 25 years later but he was aware of it i interviewed an amazing therapist named terry real for the podcast and we've spoken a lot about this idea of the anesthetic that is anger so anger is actually kind of an interesting emotion because in the short run it is actually quite anesthetizing it overcomes a lot of the inadequacy that underpins it inside there's a hollowness i think there's a void that needs to be filled there's a grandiosity that stands in the place of a true inner strength the anger kind of fills that void and numbs that pain in the short run but it's immediately followed by quite a bit of shame if you're any reasonably sane human being which is to say you do not have true psychopathology you have to feel shame after these outbursts there's no way that knight isn't screaming at his players every single day and shoving toilet paper with [ __ ] in their face and leaving the locker room thinking i'm a great guy no he's feeling ashamed of what he's doing and as a result of that he's beating himself up more and it's creating this greater and greater vicious cycle of needing greater grandiosity to overcome that shame which leads to more outbursts of anger that's a very difficult cycle to break and i don't say that to make an excuse for him in any way shape or form or frankly to make excuses for me and in times when i've found myself on those roller coasters but i can just say from personal experience and from observational experience of countless people it's hard to break that cycle without somebody else to help you do so you really need a person who can challenge you and push you or sometimes you need a devastating crisis i trained in surgery and i i knew people that i trained with whose anger was so bad that they got into real trouble basically became an existential crisis a threat to their career if you don't get your anger under control it will threaten your career so my guess is it's just a combination of all of these things in that sense he became a victim of his success his success kept him far enough away from crisis that there probably wasn't enough impetus to change until it was too late you're exactly right and for people who didn't see my original reporting on cnn or the film that crisis all back up to april of 99 the following college basketball season i released my first story and it has neil reed charlie miller richard mandeville a number of other people and they make those three allegations he kicked the president out of practice he branded soiled toilet paper and he grabbed neil reed by the throat chokes neil reed so those are the allegations in the 16 minutes indiana rallies the troops everybody says it's not true and we can go back to it in a minute but i'm going to jump to the crisis so i do that first piece i do a second piece and we can talk about in a minute where i actually get the videotape that's proof that he grabbed neil reed by the throat and that changed the entire narrative of the nationwide story explain for a moment how that makes it to you because that's i mean look at this point people who haven't seen the documentary i hope are going to see the documentary because it's very powerful for reasons we haven't even got to yet by the way that changes the game and it's out of a movie how this tape makes it to you i do my first 16-minute story making those three allegations indiana all the players the university everyone even people in the media push back and say it's actually not true cnn's out to get him a lot of it wasn't directed at me or i didn't pay attention but it was directed at neil reed anybody in the piece in cnn in particular once i had heard almost immediately almost a year before when i heard about the choke i was told that a tape exists of it because indiana tapes all their basketball practices they have student managers up in the stands on the sidelines and they videotape it and coach knight analyzes it at night has his assistant coaches analyze it shows it to the players it's just part of their process so if something happened on that court chances are it was captured on video i had heard about it forever and it's just i don't know it's my style as a reporter that i never want to ask for something if the percentages are that the answer would be no so i didn't pursue the video because i thought if i pushed or asked about it much like i said if i was talking to you peter and tried to push you to go on camera and i gotta know then where do i go from there i work every one of my sources how i feel i can best connect with them gain their trust whatever so i had heard about the video i was in indianapolis to do a site survey for the final four it was going to be in the final four that year and i made the rounds with a number of my sources at the school and i went out and had lunch and a few beers with one of them and a source invited me back to their home and i kind of knew what may or may not happen but i never let on and somebody goes hey i want to show you something i'm like oh what do you want to show me and so i saw the tape of practice from high above coach knight going towards neil reed neil reed's head snapping back and even in that moment i didn't ask for the tape i didn't ask for it and people who are listening this may say how the hell do you not ask for are you idiot or you're [ __ ] because for a month now cnn's under fire or my reporting is under fire i just i wasn't sure that the answer would be yes here i'm proud because i've been in this business for 33 34 years and i've tried my hardest and i'm not perfect but i try not to use people i try not to use people to get something and i think because it took me almost a year to report this people got that sense with me who would the more i talk to somebody and it's not on the front page or it's not in the news the more they trusted me so what would they do the more they would tell me the more they would tell their friend you can trust this guy oh you should call this guy oh you have something you should call robert that's how i got everything i got in the story so in that moment where i watched the video that kind of vindicate my reporting and shut up all the critics i didn't ask for it and it was just an instinct of mine a number of days later i remember it vividly we were watching an episode of the sopranos my wife and i and the phone rings and it's my contact talking about some stuff that was going on and i said ah just send me the tape i won't use it until you get a lawyer and so i made a deal with that person in the moment actually to be honest let me back up i had a conversation i said let me call you back i called lester munson who people may know from espn i hired him at espn he used to be he's a lawyer he was investigative producer for sports illustrated somebody i'd work with at cnnsi had the utmost respect i go if there's anybody i can trust it's lester he's a lawyer i said hey lester here's the situation i may be coming into a possession of a tape that may or may not be perceived as stolen by somebody i want to make sure i don't do anything incorrectly and how i get it blah blah blah he gave me some great advice the tape shows up at my house a number of days later it's vindication for all my reporting from the time you get the tape until the tape is made public is how long you gave the university a heads up first right because they had dug their heels in and said you guys are wrong yeah they had dug their heels in everybody was attacking neil cnn me anybody in the piece that monday i'm at augusta national for the masters so monday tuesday wednesday i'm doing all the pre-story coverage for the masters but because this night thing is a number of weeks before our first piece it aired i was kind of scheduled to leave the masters and come back i come back on a wednesday and the tape had arrived in my mailbox i knew what it was i popped it in but i didn't really even have to look at it but i actually didn't tell my bosses i had it and people may wonder why because i had given someone my word that i wouldn't run it until the person got legal advice and called me back and i trust steve robinson and jim walton with my life those are my two immediate bosses worked for jim for 14 years and steve quarterback this whole investigation with me we're literally the only two people who are involved there was no reporter no nothing at the end we had an editor that put it together but it was just steve and i so i trusted them impeccably but i didn't know if somebody upped the food chain would say we have that tape cnn's under fire we're running it i never wanted anybody to say that i lied to them and that i use them so the only way to prevent that from happening and probably being in complete control where as a producer i am much of a control freak i didn't tell my bosses i had it that's wednesday thursday friday morning i get a phone call i remember it like it was yesterday i was walking down the hall of my house the phone rings and i pick it up and i can tell them on speakerphone and i hear this is so-and-so so so so so so so-and-so and it's a law firm a bunch of names and i'm like ah here's the moment of truth did i make the right decision or the wrong decision because i'm in possession of a tape that vindicates my reporting but if this phone call goes in another direction and i keep my word i may never be able to show it but my instincts told me i was doing the right thing so this long conversation back and forth and i explained here's how i think it'll all go down i kind of convinced the people on the phone call that the best thing to do is let me air the tape so i go into the office later that day and i walk into steve's office and i say i got the tape and he's like what rick davis he's the head of standards and practices at cnn i've been there god probably close to 40 years he's still there and he was involved in all the reporting of the first piece and he says it in an interview i did with him for the film he's like we got the tape like keith so freaked out that we had it so i bring steve the head of sports jim walton who later became the president of cnn into a room shut the door and i play it for him and i remember steve going holy [ __ ] and i remember jim who was the president of sports would go on to be the president of the network he just looked at me and he said you know if you did that at cnn you'd be fired immediately and we discussed what should happen and they said hey you got to start working on a second piece and we want to air it monday this is friday afternoon so i'm sitting there going oh okay so saturday i'm starting to think about how i'm going to put together this follow-up piece to my original 16-minute piece i had just been at augusta national on monday tuesday wednesday and for those who are not members of the media which is 99.9 of the people listening to this when you cover augusta you can drop your name back then it was like into a fishbowl in the media center and they'd pick 20 names out of that bowl who could play the course monday morning after the tournament was over i'm starting to put together this piece on saturday and i get a phone call from my colleagues and my best friends who are covering the event and they go dude they drew your name you got a tea time at augusta national nine o'clock monday so i have to call my boss and say i know you want this piece on monday but please for the love of god can i play augusto and can we air it on tuesday and my bosses were so good they said yes but i hope people understand why i didn't tell my immediate bosses because i didn't want somebody to overrule their decision and i never wanted anybody who placed their trust in me to think i [ __ ] them and the only way i could ensure that a hundred percent is was to hold the tape and not let anybody know i had it so we air the piece i put together the piece on tuesday when i get back we're gonna air it on wednesday or third i think we were gonna air it on thursday my bosses say we have to call indiana so i've been reporting this story for almost a year my bosses say in order to be fair journalists we have to give them a chance to respond i had been battling them for nine months to a year and i go we don't owe them anything they should see it like the rest of the world like i wanted to throw a haymaker and just have them watch it on tv like everyone else and to rick davis's credit jim walton's credit and steve robinson's credit they push back pushback pushback and say no to be honorable journalists to be fair we have to give them a chance to respond so they called indiana and i kept saying i don't think this is a good idea and i said what if they slap an injunction on us for having stolen property then we may be in possession of a tape that we can't air so there's back and forth between us and they're all my bosses so they're going to win i knew they'd win but i just kept presenting a front plus it was probably personal frustration of all of the roadblocks and hurdles that christopher simpson specifically and the lies he had said to me over the nine months ten months of my reporting or now it was over a year actually of my reporting that i didn't think we owed them anything so we call them and four individuals get on two private planes three come out of bloomington one was on vacation in key west and gets on a private plane the president of the board of trustees and they all come to atlanta when i had gotten the tape i arranged to have neil reed fly into atlanta to view the tape to verify it so neil flies into atlanta i watch the tape with him i take him into his studio i play the tape with him he has a microphone on i'm interviewing him while it's playing probably do 40 minutes of an interview with him watch it over and over again talk to him about it i need to get neil reed out of cnn center because the four indiana board of trustees and vice presidents are on their way in they probably passed on i-85 coming to the airport and from the airport about 40 minutes after i put neal in a cab sent him back to the airport they arrive did neil come by himself no he did come by himself i called neil and i said i have something you may be interested in seeing there's a ticket waiting for you i'll have a ticket waiting for you i'll have a car waiting for you so we paid for him to come to cnn but he came by himself and i had spent nine months with neil i had talked to him over those nine months before the initial report had come out now it was another month later i had talked to him probably a couple times a week sometimes it was just we were just shooting the brace and neil later did an interview with espn for another project about it and he told them yeah robert and i became friends we just started talking and that's my style if you're real with people and they trust you they'll tell you anything and neil told me everything and i never reported i never hung him out to dry i never betrayed his confidence in me in fact when i got married during this whole time and i went on my honeymoon with my wife to turkey and then like a cruise through the greek islands and i called neil before that and then i called him from my honeymoon to say hey i'm in europe he was playing in holland at the time i go can i come by and interview you this is before the first piece aired so he and i had talked forever so when i called him and said will you come here he would kind of almost do anything i asked him to so he came and watched it and then 40 minutes later the indiana two members of the board of trustees and two vice presidents of the school including christopher simpson came to cnn center to watch the tape what was their reaction as i had predicted to my bosses but they didn't believe me at the time i said you can't trust them specifically christopher simpson so we literally go into a conference room it's frederick icorn who used to be the president of the indiana bar association john waldo who's the president of the board of trustees christopher simpson and terry clapex is a vice president oversaw the athletic department the reason i thought they may slap an injunction on us is because frederick icorn was the head he was the head of the indiana state bar association at one point so i knew he's a lawyer they may try to legally stop us from doing anything so when we sat down it's myself steve robinson my immediate boss and jim walton the president of sports on the opposite side of the table of these four and literally as our butts hit the chair on our side of the table christopher simpson miles brand's right-hand man says we understand you're in possession of stolen property that belongs to indiana university and we want it returned immediately i was like holy [ __ ] you have balls coming into our office and [ __ ] dropping that bomb and i kind of looked to my bosses and i was just glanced and i was kind of like now you know what i've been dealing with for the last year for me i was like you didn't believe me and i'm not going to be able to paint a picture of how powerful the next 20 seconds was but without missing a beat because literally he dropped a nuclear bomb in the room that normally would have put 99.9 percent of the people on the defensive steve robinson my immediate boss without missing a beat there was just a breath of silence and he said and i'm not going to do it justice but in the most even keeled emotionless tone just said something to the effect of well i'm disappointed that you would come in here and say that we were kind enough to invite you down to view this tape if you'd like to pursue legal action we'll escort you out the door to the bank of elevators outside i'll push the button for the 13th floor and you can speak to our legal department but before the door opens on the 13th floor this tape will be on cnn sea international headline news we'll send it out to 300 affiliates around the country now did you come here to threaten us or would you like to watch the tape in my 34 years of being a journalist i've never seen a more powerful moment by someone i worked with i mean christopher simpson came in with a lot of balls and my boss literally there was just a breath of air and then he just surgically castrated him and he just said no what would you like to do and so then there was some conversations back and forth i don't think they expected that answer for steve i looked at steve with as much admiration as any journalist i ever did in that moment i just went wow like how did he not get emotional how did he not attack them but he just surgically cut their legs out from under him castrated him and said do you want to watch the tape and then there was some back and forth where indiana's representatives mostly christopher simpson said well we'd like to watch it in private and at first jim walton said sure we don't have a problem like that and then i cleared my voice i was like and jim looked at me and i just shook my head and then we adjourned for a second and steve jim and i walked out and i go i don't trust him and i said oh by the way my source said don't ever let anybody see the actual tape because it may give them a clue as to who shot it where it came from blah blah blah blah and i actually i made dubs the tape but i was actually showing them the exact tape so they couldn't say it was dubbed altered or anything i'm a journalist i'm like you i'm a perfectionist so i had the tape in a vcr and so we walked back in and jim my boss said hey these are going to be the ground rules if you agree to them you can watch the tape as many times as you want what happens in this room is off the record robert will be in here with you and operate the machine but we're not going to let you watch it by yourself so they agreed and then i didn't think about it at the time i'm 35 years old i think at this time jim and steve leave the room and i didn't think about it until years and years later when somebody asked me about it and so i'm sitting in there steve delson he's a investigative journalist he worked for espn for years he wrote a book and there was a chapter on this and he said robert was left alone in a room with four men who wished he was never born it was a great line and i was like i never thought of it until i read it in his book it's the four of them and me i had spent a year covering this i knew everything that was going on in indiana i had the tape i didn't think anything of it in the moment and once my bosses leave one of them starts asking me again everything's off the record in this room so one of them asked me how many games have you been to how many this how many that and all he was trying to do i am probably much like you i'm a perfectionist my mind races and works really i make connections very very quickly and i'm like i know what you're trying to do you're trying to find something that you can use to undermine my credibility to do the story and i just said hey everything in this room is off the record do you want to sit here and ask me a bunch of questions or do you want to watch the tape and then christopher simpson said he wanted to see the tape he was sitting across the conference table for me in this big room and he got up you got to understand i was frustrated that whole day because i didn't want him there you know i had argued with my bosses you shouldn't bring him here christopher simpson's lied to me for a year i don't trust him then they came in and dropped the bomb so i'm sitting there going i didn't want this situation to happen kind of meaning i didn't want them there i just wanted him to see it on the air he gets up and he starts going towards the tape machine which i had on the floor in the corner like i was in between i said sit down and he didn't took another step or two and i said mr simpson sit the [ __ ] down i don't care what my bosses say if you don't sit down right now i'm going to unplug that machine walk out to my car and drive back to my house and you guys aren't going to see this tape do you come here to see the tape or did you come here to ask me questions you come here to look at the tape you're not going to see the tape sit down you want me to do it at that point it's probably the only time i really lost my cool it was like 10 seconds and i just told him to sit the [ __ ] down because he was starting to piss me off to be honest i'm like you don't come into my office and tell me how things are going to go down and so he sat back down i played the tape they watched it a number of times they didn't say anything and even if they did it was off the record so i couldn't report it and then we had made an agreement when jim said you could watch the tape and then afterwards robert will interview one of you so i played the tape for them we adjourned the meeting and then i went into a studio and interviewed john walda he was heading up the investigation by the school he was the head of the board of trustees i think for five weeks or so he had been investigating it as it states in my film my first story came out a month before john walda head of the board of trustees was quoted in the indianapolis star saying i put no stock in what neil reid says if cnn's saying it then i don't believe it something to that effect so he's on the record as saying he doesn't believe the guy and then he's placed in charge of the investigation into the guy's allegations so my first question to him was you've now seen the tape do you put any stock in what neil reed says and john waldo was really good i got to give him credit he was a broken record of just saying we've seen the tape we're in the middle of investigation it's going to be part of our investigation no matter what question i asked him he gave me the same answer you got to understand for 10 months i had been waiting to interview anyone from indiana and hold him accountable and so he started to frustrate me i'd ask him is that conduct you want your coaches at indiana to do we've seen the tape we're taking it part of our it was just this broken record after about four times i knew i was going to get nowhere so then i got to be honest it was just more of self-satisfaction for me because i kind of had him so i kind of wanted to squeeze a little bit the balls like i was just for the longest time i wasn't not proud of it but i wondered if i crossed the line as a journalist so i said what do you say to people who want to send their sons to play for bob knight is that what's going to happen to him we're going to look at it and so i asked a couple of personal things like to piss him off and prompt him and ironically i heard christopher simpson behind me say to my bosses he can't ask that and once i heard i got a reaction out of him i was done with the interview i asked about four more questions just to prolong the agony of him standing there and then they left and we put the story on about two hours later where we had neil watching it we had the four members of indiana university watching and we did our follow-up piece and it was front page news across the country everybody had a still of the grab everybody had it but it was a pretty eventful day having neil reid come in and leave having them come in and leave and having to turn the story around in about an hour or two after that how long would it be after that before you realized what you missed the first time which was when you sat down with neil and neil watched the video with you you comment on this i think it's actually the most powerful part of the documentary but i don't recall how long after you realized what you sort of missed that first time it's certainly understandable why you would have missed it there was a lot going on that day it was getting neal in getting neal out getting the bozos from indiana in getting the bozos from indiana out getting the story out the legal stuff the heated emotions there's a million things going on but the human tragedy of this is a guy reed has to sit down and watch over and over and over again one of the most traumatic experiences of his life and for anybody listening to this who's suffered trauma it's bad enough once and for most people they never have to see it again or have a visceral reminder of it again and yet neil had to watch it over and over and over again you notice that later i noticed it immediately i had spoken to neil for 10 months to be honest he had probably told me things that he probably never told anyone else like that's how close we were with regards to this incident this moment there's things he can or can't tell his parents he didn't really speak to other teammates once he left indiana he had no contact really with any of them in the moment i knew how difficult it was for him in the moment i knew how much he trusted me i knew how far i could push him maybe the right wrong word but dig and pull it out of him i knew in the moment how painful it was for him but sadly the focus of that day and to answer your question probably 15 or 16 years later until i really i truly honestly noticed how i [ __ ] up or what i didn't do you have to understand as a journalist you have to be impartial i can't be neil reed's friend i have to report the story but in order for him to trust me i have to spend a lot of time and have this trust he would tell me anything and everything so when the first story comes out and he's under fire i spoke to him for a month after that and then when he comes back in and watches it the purpose of that second story was to say we did a first story where this young man alleged these three things and everybody said it's factually incorrect oh by the way it was correct and here's why you can see it for yourself the trainer for indiana university after our first story came out said the choking thing never happened you can give me a lie detector it never happened we lined up all the people who discounted our original story and our second story as i say in the film just focused on the journalism of was what we reported right and was what neil reed initially said to us was it factually accurate and that's what the second piece was what i say in the film is i missed the human story sitting right in front of me i didn't miss it i knew it was there because i had developed a relationship with neil if i could turn back the clock 20 years or whatever i probably would have done a follow-up piece with neil several weeks several months whatever later to say what was this like personally but the original story was about an investigation and a journalism to show wrongdoing it was pooh-pooh denied and attacked the second piece was to say no it was factually accurate the third piece i should have done was this was the damage it did to this young man and as i stated in the film neil and i stayed in touch for a number of years after that and i probably erred on the side of in the moment keeping him somewhat at arm's distance there's this balancing act if you get too close to story you're going to make mistakes if you become friends with the people in your story your credibility is going to be questioned and there's a fine line to walk looking back as a human being and that's why i devoted so much time to it in the film is when i was asked to do this film one of the first things i did was take out the box where i had all the materials from my reporting and i watched that and hilary horgan who was a producer on the film with me she had worked with me a number of times at espn i had hired her to work on shows i had done she was in my office when i played it she watched the 40 minutes and said you could just hit play and watch that 40 minutes i can't take my eyes off of it to answer your question in a long roundabout way that's really the moment when i was in this office with hillary and she watched it and she just said oh my god look at the trauma on him look at this and that's why when i went to do the film i showed everybody it and i confessed that i [ __ ] up as a journalist and i did the journalistic part of the story but i missed the human story sitting right in front of me which was neil it's just got the saddest ending in a way i mean it's sort of a bittersweet ending as you walk us through in the in the documentary which is that neil seems to go on and do okay i mean he marries a wonderful woman he has these great kids he's coaching kids in high school playing basketball he seems to be an amazing coach the athletes love him and he dies of a massive heart attack at the age of 36. you just couldn't script something like that it's so tragic and so while there's a part of me that thinks how amazing is it that this guy who is so traumatized so humiliated manages to not pass that on to others and that's a big deal most people who traumatize people are themselves traumatized and he could be someone who stopped the cycle at such a young age is amazing to me and yet i don't know not knowing anything about him i i can't help but wonder was he able to sort of reconcile all the horrible things that had happened and why did he have to go so soon i thought that was the most powerful thing again as i look back i saw so many things 16 17 18 years later as i put the film together and relived my reporting from long ago and one of the more powerful things to me was what happened that caused neil reed to leave indiana took everything from him he once told me he said robert i don't know what's worse never having your dream come true or having your dream come true and it turning into a nightmare and that's what happened to him his whole being from probably six seven eight years old on you can see him in the film in a bob knight basketball camp t-shirt when he's under 10. his whole life was to go there play he said it was an out-of-body experience for him to put on the candy striped sweats at indiana and walk out on run out onto assembly hall so when it turned into a nightmare for him he questioned his entire being and everything that his life had led to to that point when neil reed left bob knight didn't lose anything but a point guard who he quickly replaced he still had three national championships an olympic gold medal he was still in the hall of fame and yet all these years later he never overcame indiana firing him for that and yet neil was able to put it behind him for 20-plus years knight wasn't able to put that firing behind him he finally returned to assembly hall last year but it took him 20 years to come back so he held that grudge for 20 years whereas neil struggled for a number of years but ultimately put it behind him and the abused as you point out the abuse didn't turn into the abuser i went out to california to the high school where he was a teacher and a coach he only coached basketball one year he coached football he was mainly the golf team coach and i talked to a number of students i talked to the principal i talked to the athletic director in many ways he was the pied piper at that school he would walk through the courtyard and everybody would go hey coach hey coach hey coach they said he had an infectious smile and it was everything i almost think neil turned into everything he wanted coach knight to be and everything he wanted from coach knight while neil was at indiana everything he yearned for and a number of the players have said that a lot of the players i interviewed in the late 90s to a man they all said i didn't have a relationship with coach off the basketball court if you look back to the guys on his 75-76 his 81 team his 87 team many of them have had relationships over the years with him i think that 90s era because they didn't have the success he turned on them and never let them get close enough to him i think neil became the coach that bob knight never became yeah he's won three national championships in olympic gold medal and he's in the hall of fame but the kids at pioneer valley high school loved neil reed and i'm not saying that because i'm biased or anything i went out there and i was shocked by the emotion they still held for them i interviewed one student who said he's been gone four years i still have the last texts he sent me on my phone i've never deleted him it's a kid who's a golf pro neil helped him get a job he played on the golf team for him he said neil was a nike guy he goes every day i only wear nike so i have neil i have the nike swoosh on my chest or my armor and my hat to remember how i got here it was neal there's all these stories that just blew me away as to the man he became before he passed away and at such a young age that's the part that just amazes me is to put yourself back together after all this it's humbling you sent me an email a month ago maybe longer and i couldn't believe you dug it up which was the last tweet that neil sent about 10 days before he died do you remember that yeah do you have it in front of you because i don't i can recite it but if you have the exact wording i do so it was six days after jerry sandusky was found guilty in the penn state scandal and it was 10 days before neal died he tweeted i now realize that kids deserve to be punched spit on choked and raped in the shower so a select few can be worshiped like gods when i first started doing research for the film i came across that and it literally took my breath away i mean i read it and read it and read it again because i found it on twitter on his twitter account and then i cross-referenced like when did he write this and i went oh my god it was 10 days before he passed and then i'm like why the reference to rape in the shower and then i googled the timeline and i was like oh my god that was right in the middle of the jerry sandusky the penn state football coach who's now spending the rest of his life in prison for taking advantage of young men and one of them that was detailed in the court in the shower and when i read that what it told me is and this is before i went out to pioneer valley high school in california to see what became of neil reed i'd stayed in touch with him for a number of years i'm asked to do the film i come up i read this tweet and immediately i'm like he died a tortured human being is what that tweet kind of said to me it never left him it aided his mind it aided his heart it aided his soul he never escaped what happened to him at indiana and yet when i went out to speak to his wife kelly i actually interviewed his two daughters which was amazing i didn't include it in the film out of respect for them but it's something that kelly will have forever them talking about their father i was amazed because i went out there having read that tweet and when you read that tweet what do you think of when you know neil reed's story and that's what was in his mind and that he tweeted 10 days before his death what comes to your mind it's everything you said which is he is still he still has ptsd and yet when i went out there that's what i was expecting to hear i interviewed his best friends i interviewed guys who were in the office with them in the athletic department i interviewed all the kids i interviewed the principal she said he worked here probably for three years before i even knew that was him the kid who got choked kelly told a story his wife where they were wrestling around on the bed once and she's like he's so much bigger than me i kind of went up at him and just by where they were her hands kind of went up and was kind of near his throat and literally he just stopped and she didn't say turn white but she noticed a distinctive change in him and i included that in the film because it showed me that he did have ptsd and that moment never left him even where he's in a playful loving moment with his wife that flashback still came to him i had seen the tweet so i knew even 10 days before he died it was still in his mind and his heart and his soul and yet when i went out there the story i uncovered was the exact opposite that he had kept it from everyone and he kept it locked up in a way and even his best friends would say he rarely ever talked about it he didn't bring anybody down he didn't wallow in what had happened he wanted to move on from it and admirably he did what do you think knight's legacy is going to be i mean i guess just for posterity we can finish the story somehow to the amazement of any sane person despite having video evidence that knight choked a player which by extension effectively means every other allegation is true somehow this university and its infinite wisdom decides not to fire him and instead in arguably one of the top 10 acts of cowardice in the history of at least the modern civilization it comes up with this goofy idea of well you get one more chance but it's going to be under a zero tolerance umbrella i don't think it took very long for him to violate his zero tolerance right it wasn't it later that year it was in the fall of 2000 that he grabbed another kid's arm and i don't even want to go into the story it's so idiotic but the point is it didn't take long for him to violate zero tolerance he got fired and i gotta tell you i hope that the kids that chanted his name and cursed the kid who got grabbed that ultimately led to his firing and all the best i hope those kids are able to watch the videos of themselves 20 years ago and at least have some some degree of appropriate shame and remorse for the way they behaved he goes on to coach eight years i think at texas tech before retiring and i don't know he's done some commentary work on espn look he's at the end of his life now he's 80 at least to my eye doesn't look too healthy what's his legacy i think it's mixed i think it's very mixed i want to back up one thing because you spoke earlier about having a devastating crisis that kind of brings an awakening to someone in a perfect world my reporting of what happened my getting the tape could have been that moment for coach knight i'm an optimist and at that point as much as i had battled indiana when they placed him under zero tolerance which means if you do you know we're going to wipe the slate clean you've been here 29 years we don't want the faucet just to keep dripping of all these bad things you've done over the 29 years we're turning it off but if there's one more drip if there's one more outburst you're gone you would think that would have been the devastating crisis that would have given him an awareness that he had to get his temper under control and all these things but it didn't when he grabbed a student that was a public violation or breaking of zero tolerance i was getting phone calls almost immediately after zero tolerance of the ways he was breaking zero tolerance he wasn't showing up to functions i think what ended up happening with coach knight is he met with miles brand and kind of for lack of a better term begged and pleaded for his job miles brand gave him one last opportunity partially i believe because what he had accomplished at the school and partially because he believes indiana the university system was partially responsible for allowing it to happen so how can the school allow it to happen forever and then all of a sudden say you're out of here because of this and again as a journalist i try not to take sides in it but i see his thought process and giving him one last chance and in a perfect polyanic world he changes the people around him keep him under control and he breaks dean smith's record for all-time wins in indiana and this is a learning experience for him but it was anything but immediately after zero tolerance and keeping his job he resented the people at the school he resented from everything that everyone told me he was like how dare you humiliate me like this after everything i've done for the school for 29 years winning national titles graduating young men winning an olympic gold medal like how dare you question me and that's where it becomes about i and me and he's a bully and all that stuff so this could have been that devastating crisis that you talked about earlier the hope was that it would be but immediately after it wasn't i was getting phone calls one of them i got that i talked about in the film was that he was suspended for three games and had to pay a thirty thousand dollar fine so he met with the head of the university council for the school dottie frapwell to decide what games he was gonna sit out how he's gonna pay the fine five thousand dollars out of six checks however they were going to do it i was told he screamed and yelled at her called her the c word did this this this this this and so i get a phone call that this happened so i can't report it because i don't have two eyewitnesses as a journalist me i like to have three or four verify it so i can't report it so what do i do i pick up the phone and i call dottie frapwell and it was a great phone call because i don't know if it was her assistant whoever picked up the phone because dottie frapple's office i goes daddy there yeah she's standing right here may i ask who's calling i go robert abbott from cnn and ask what this is regard to oh a meeting she had with coach knight i'm put on hold daddy can't come to the phone right now can i take a message i said yeah have her call me here's the number because i don't know this is true i've heard it but i don't know as a journalist i can't report it i don't know if it's true my phone rang in less than a minute and it was christopher simpson vice president of the school and i remember mouthing into the phone you dumb mother blankety blank like how stupid are you like i wasn't sure it happened but the fact that he called me back within like 30 seconds told me yeah now i'm pretty sure it happened now i got to find out if it did and when he was ultimately fired it was put in one of the reasons he was fired that exact moment he berated her etc etc which he denies by the way if you look at jeremy sharp's interview with knight i mean just pathological lying just pathological lying probably to the level of what a psychopath is capable of right again when i go back to what we talked about early what fascinates me in a story is an onion you can peel away layer of layer upon layer of the genius the brilliance the perfectionist that is bob knight i will say this i interviewed and spoke to a lot of players throughout his tenure there and i can't think of one that was a punk he recruited really really quality individuals i remember after my original reporting being how impressed the body of people i spoke to were and i interviewed angelo pizzo for those who don't know as a screenwriter he wrote the film hoosiers which is based on mylan basketball gene hackman plays the role that was kind of fashionable bob knight he also wrote the film rudy the notre dame kind of walk-on football player i interviewed him and the reason being is hoosiers came out right before he won the 1987 national championship and angelo told a great story about the academy awards his film was up for i think two academy awards dennis hopper was up for one sorry for the tangent but it's an interesting story so angelo's an indiana grad and so is i believe it's david onspar as co-writer producer or whatever they did the film so it happens to be the academy awards are being played the night of the national championship game in indiana wins and is now in the national championship game so angelo pizzo has to decide do i go to the academy awards where my film's up for two i think it was up for tennis hopper and score musical score something like that or do i stay home and watch my beloved indiana so there was a rehearsal for the academy awards and they gave dennis hopper like a sony watchman and they said hey when you're there for the rehearsal can you turn on this soda any watchman and see if you can get abc or nbc whatever the network is that's going to show the game the night before so hopper's in there for the rehearsals and he's like there's no way there's so much rf in this building you'll never get a signal so the two directors writers producers of the film stayed home to watch indiana and didn't go to the academy awards when knight wins the national championship that night he invites angelo pizzo to a practice and angelo tells me the story he goes i go into assembly hall and like i told you it's usually locked and you're not allowed in there he's sitting way up high and he sees knight looking at him and he's like god i felt so uncomfortable and awkward should i be here and he's such a great storyteller and he says he almost gets up to leave but he stays and then a trainer comes up to talk to him right at the end of practices coach knight would like to meet you he says he walks down to coach knight and they start talking i liked your film blah blah he goes what are you doing he goes why he goes i'm going on a retreating [ __ ] and you're coming with me so he gets in a car with coach knight i think they drive to chicago or maybe they got on a private plane and then flew to chicago i forget but he basically spends like the next 10 hours with knight as he goes on a recruiting trip and he said he talked about russian history with knight for like six straight hours and the reason i bring this up is in many ways coach knight is brilliant a genius he's as only god can do gives some of us amazing gifts in one area and so many flaws in another pizzo's talked about how smart he was they jump from topic to topic mostly about russian history and he goes i consider myself a russian history buff knight blew me away with the stuff he knew we rarely talked about basketball and that's the genius of coach knight how well ready he was how he can motivate people but ultimately like icarus he didn't understand his flaw and he flew too close to the sun he couldn't control his temper dave kindred who i mentioned earlier says on my film he goes he had an anger in him i don't know where it came from or why it was there but it never left him and that was ultimately his undoing robert the story is it means so much to me on so many levels and it is a cautionary tale even though knight is a very extreme example of this i don't think i would have gone to the lengths to have this podcast with you if i didn't believe that others could benefit from sort of a deeper examination of this the work you did on this was was amazing i'm so grateful you did it first and foremost for neil i think you probably deserve at least some credit for the fact that even though neil's life was taken too soon he was validated he got to spend that last 12 years of his life the last decade of his life knowing that what happened hopefully he understood it wasn't his fault which is easy to say because cognitively of course it wasn't his fault but that's not always easy to understand as a victim so first and foremost i thank you for what you did for someone i've never met but have great affection for and obviously for the rest of us who have benefited immensely from such an unbelievable story i owed it to neil it's as simple as that i owed it to neil at one point one of the cuts of the film i got some feedback from espn and one executive said you need to cut that neil reed part down to maybe one minute and i was kind of like over my dead body it's what gives the film its heart and soul i screwed up 16 17 years before by not telling his story sooner and i feel i owed it to him to make his story part of this film because when somebody trusts you like that i'm working on another film now where that trust is almost even greater for the situation the person i'm gonna profile is in it's a weight it's a weight on you and as a journalist you don't want to let that compromise your objectivity i think as a 35 year old journalist at the time i think i kept neil possibly too much at a distance not personally but at least to the rest of the world i felt like if i did a story then i was doing it because i knew him not because we were friends i was just like i got to be careful i got to be careful and i'm angry with myself because i was too careful and by doing this film at least i told neil people who the real neil reed was who the neil reed i came to know was and as i say at the end thank you for trusting me to tell your story that's what was the most important thing in the last days of night to me is the ending and that's what gave the film the heart and soul of it it is about bob knight but it's not about bob knight it could be about a local sheriff it could be about the president it could be about anyone but it was really about a young man who somehow found the strength to put it behind him and someone who would have all the success in the world more success than anybody could ever imagine and that human being couldn't put it behind him and to this day as angry bitter as a temper neil was the opposite and that jux position has always amazed me as i look at this story the one kid who had everything taken from him was able to move on and the one person who in reality had very little taken from him yes he had his job maybe some humiliation but he still had three national championship olympic gold medal hall of fame he just couldn't move beyond it and it tells you about the
