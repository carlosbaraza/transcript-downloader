## Transcript

[00:00:00] We're spending $1 trillion on K through2 education, but our ROI is quite low. Why are we doing so poorly? The standards just keep going down. If you're a B student, you are from 3 years behind to 7 years behind. Where did this virus infect us? The best analogies we always use that parents totally understand is sports.

[00:00:19] Everybody in sports is like if you're not doing well, go back and do the basics. You think it's the current material, but it's your prerex, right? It's your foundation. It's so easy to fix. When you use these, you know, learning science-based AI tutors and the apps that we have, kids can learn 10 times faster.

[00:00:38] You would still say that 95% of all eighth graders in the United States could be what today is considered top 10% performance. The most important part of education is a motivated student. 2-hour learning is motivational for every kid on the planet. Our competition is Fortnite and Tik Tok and we need to use things like Genai to create such compelling content for kids. They've created a narrative that says I can't do math. Once it becomes this mastery based system, it's a decision, not an inherent capability. And there's this mental view of oh, I guess I am a smart kid. It's like the kindling that leads to the fire. What's the simplest unlock to fix education in America? It would be this.

[00:01:20] Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive Podcast. I'm your host, Peter Aia. [Music] Joe, thank you so much for making time to come over today. It's nice once in a while to have a guest who is local and doesn't have to travel so far. No, it's great. I super appreciate it. You know, look, people are probably wondering like, you know, how does this sort of tie into health and medicine and and this is a topic that's a little bit about outside of that, but but really it's not because it's where we're ultimately going to go is education and you can't have a great system of health and medicine if you're not educating um kids today, right? The the people that you know are learning today are going to be the ones taking care of us. Uh so I think everybody should have a vested interest in this in this process. Of course, also many people listening um have kids um across various spectrums of learning. But I think before I get into that, your story is just so interesting and I know you don't really like telling your story because I know this cuz I know you so well and all you want to do is talk about the work, but I'm going to force you to tell your story a little bit. So, where did you grow up?

[00:02:23] So, uh moved around. I was born in Minnesota and I moved around every couple years uh and mostly up and down the east coast. Um, my dad worked for General Electric and wherever they had a factory, uh, whatever town we'd we'd moved there. You obviously did very well in high school and you wound up at Stanford. So, what what were you what did you what did you major in?

[00:02:42] I majored in econ. Uh, I did not graduate. I dropped out, but I would have been uh uh an econ major. I mostly picked it because it was easy uh in the in the Stanford curriculum. So, what year were you in when you dropped out? So, I would have been class of 90, 1990. Um, I would have been uh and I dropped out between junior and senior year. I I was I'm sure my junior year professors were like, he's not really engaged and probably misses too many classes. And, you know, for me and just a little bit on the background was, you know, when I was in high school, I wrote a paper on AI and you know, one of the parts of the the paper was about expert systems and old school AI, not what we know today. And uh there was a part like one paragraph called neural nets which is sort of today's AI and I was like this is decades away.

[00:03:32] And so I then went to Stanford and literally I was in a class with uh professor Vagenbomb who's considered one of the fathers of expert systems and old school AI and he's just talking about how this is you know you can build these incredible systems and they'd be worth you know millions of dollars you know if you could figure it out. And so, you know, a uh some classmates and I, we dropped out, you know, and started uh

[00:03:57] Trilogy. And the story around that was just it was the first AI company, we didn't call it AI back then because it had a bad rep in the '9s to sell a billion dollars of AI products. Um, and so that's how we got our start. Um, and eventually leads to, you know, today's story. Yeah. So, so again, you I always find it amazing when people are dropping out like with one year to go, right? It's sort of like why didn't you finish it?

[00:04:22] But you must have a strong conviction if you're saying I'm going to forego my Stanford degree to go and start this company that can't they can't wait a year to do this, right? Sure. Well, there's and so back to this story because I I had, you know, my dad there's a famous Forbes uh headline that's like you're a cuz my dad was very clear what a I was being by dropping out. And you know it's the the issue was I felt there was a time to market issue. It was a race, right? And I was just like I I'm sitting in Spanish class. I don't care, right?

[00:04:53] And my market's going to run away without me. And there's this huge opportunity to go build this company. And it's just it's that tension where you thought now with 2020 hindsight, it took us over three years to build the product and we thought we could do it much quicker. And so there wasn't a time tomarket issue. with with with hindsight, I could have stayed. Um, but back to that pressure, I just felt it. I didn't want to miss it. I had to go do it. And so that's what actually led to the

[00:05:20] And did you guys come and set up shop in Austin right away? Yeah. Well, not right away. So, we dropped out and did the whole, you know, we couldn't raise funding. Silicon Valley back in the late ' 80s was not given money to dropouts like us. And uh, but we literally lived in a garage. You know, we had, you know, classmates who had like have a house and we're like, can we rent your garage to live in it?

[00:05:39] Uh but then uh in ' 92 we moved down to Austin. Actually John Lynch who was one of the co-founders was like look you know if we're going to be poor a back then Austin was cheap. It was like it's a lot cheaper than Palo Alto so let's go move down there. And so that's actually what led us led us down here uh to

[00:05:58] Austin. When did this idea of finding your next you know I guess is it uh is it David Brooks who wrote that book the second mountain? Right. So if your if your first mountain was was Trilogy, this incredible business, which really we're not going to say much more about other than the fact that it basically created an an unlimited essentially war chest of capital that you were then able to go and deploy to your second mountain, which is this passion around education.

[00:06:27] Yes, you always had an interest in AI, but when did these two become the next frontier come together? So uh back to education. So, uh, 10 years ago, 11 years ago now, uh, McKenzie Price started Alpha in Austin. And, you know, it's this still radical idea back then, you know, and one of the things I've learned as principal of Alpha is that parents want their kids' education to be however they were educated. And I was the same way. I went to Catholic school. My kids are in

[00:07:00] Catholic school, you know, and Mackenzie's like, "Look, look at this great new school I got. It's gonna be awesome, you know. And I was like, Mackenzie, I'm that's weird. Like at when she started, it's literally in some guy's garage. I'm like, you know, her co-founder. And I'm like, I'm not going to the weird school. Sorry. And it took her two years to actually convince me to move my daughters over. And you know, they sampled it one time and literally loved it, you know, and they came back and said it was they did it after their

[00:07:33] Catholic school got out before they went to summer camp. And they came back and they're like, "Dad, we don't want to go to summer camp. We want to still go to alpha." And I didn't like school enough to want to. Yeah. You weren't going to miss summer for school. That sounded crazy to me. So anyway, I was like, "Okay, that's actually a really good sign. We should move over."

[00:07:48] And that was 10 years ago. than how I but my discussions with Mackenzie always was like this is awesome but it's not scalable and and and yeah just what did alpha look like 11 years ago when you first peered behind the curtain the other co-founder Brian right and he had this philosophy he had these rules like when so when I sent move my kid over to Alpha I said Brian what are the two things I don't believe about education that I need to understand he's like first kids must love school they must love school and I'm like sort of spinach sometimes, dude. Like, no, I I

[00:08:23] He's like, "You're wrong and you'll figure it out." And I was like, "Okay." And then his second is your kids can do so much more than you expect. And I'm like, "Oh, I'm I sort of have really high expectations." He's like, "They're going to blow you away on what they can do, and your expectations are too low."

[00:08:42] And so, you know, he was, you know, uh, setting it up. It really, it was 20 kids, right? They weren't in a garage after two years but you know it is alternative they would use a set of apps right to do academics but you know they'd have you know the teachers right would help academically if needed um and then they would have all these life skills they check charts um and life skills so it was some academics and then workshops and life skills and that was you know 10 years and the 20 kids that are in there are what grade slash age range.

[00:09:19] Yeah, they're going to be from uh they're probably second grade to fifth grade was probably the range. Sixth grade, somewhere around there. And you know, and they're clustered sort of like the one room schoolhouse, right? And you know, you go in and it is crazy. Like he's like, "Oh, they're doing spelling bees." I'm like, "They're walking on their hands, you know, they're doing handstands across the room." And he's like, "Yeah, watch how they do And literally they would, you know, have to buy try they'd try to walk across the room in handstands but recite all the words on their spelling v is doing it right and could they make it all across and the kids were just having a ton of fun right and uh I was always like are they really learning and sort of all the academic side but you know testing showed they were.

[00:10:05] And what was the state of technology? What what you you referred to some apps, but what what was the state of educational apps 11 years ago? Yeah, they were um there was things like Dreambox and uh Khan Academy was out and so they were static. I mean static in the sense that um um they weren't adaptive I guess is maybe they weren't or they're the problem with old ones and actually even a bunch of them today is you know now we know with learning science you know all these much better ways to do it. Their standards of mastery were too low. um uh their their implementation of learning science was too little, you know, if if you look at them, but they were good enough that you could, you know, get your way through.

[00:10:47] But back to some of the problems, like when my oldest, you know, first took her seventh grade test, um you know, standardized test, she failed it all, you know, and so sorry, this is after being in the alpha program. This was she had been in the alpha program. Yep. and with with those apps. Got it. And so the apps were, you know, janky and not all there. Um this is before I got involved uh except as a parent and you know she failed her seventh grade you know test and standardized test state standardized test and you're like oh wow so something there was a mismatch and there's mismatch they just you know you can use apps you know and people say how does alpha get all these results because there's a lot of people who try to use these apps and you're like these apps have gaps and holes and you know figuring out how to change that was a lot of what how I got involved and you know what I've been doing the last three years So your foray into this is obviously then in this logical way through the experience of your own kids.

[00:11:46] I want to just take a step way back and talk more about education in general. So I I I don't think anybody listening to us now is unfamiliar with the idea. Uh although this is it's not particularly popular at the moment. We have enough other things that are going on in the world that have people up in arms, but it's it's sort of cyclic when people sort of look at the data and realize that the United States is not doing well in uh primary and secondary education.

[00:12:15] Um or I don't know if those are the right terms, but whatever it is up to K to 12, whatever. I don't know if secondary is considered college, but we we start to do pretty well in college, right? Uh relative to the world, but but getting to college, we're not doing well. And it's it's it's this is further um I think the the point is is further made when you look at the dollars in to results out. So I I think we're spending what $1 billion pardon me $1 trillion on

[00:12:44] K- through2 education which is about 17th of what the world spends and of course we don't have 17th of the population. So there's a huge mismatch there. Um but our ROI is quite low. So it's it's actually kind of parallels the healthcare spending thing right where we on a per capita basis we spend more on healthcare than anybody else and yet we're actually not producing the best life expectancy. So, let's dwell on that for a moment. Why does the United States spend so much money on K through2 education? Um, and maybe more importantly, why are we not getting the results, at least if we believe we're measuring the results correctly? If the results are to be determined by these tests that all the

[00:13:25] OECD nations take, yeah, why are we doing so poorly? That's a really complex answer, but there's there's a set of them, which it is it is true, right? our academic performance continues to go down uh across it. As an example, there's this test uh NWA MAP test. It's a nationwide test. You know, when I was a kid, I took an Iowa test. This is equivalent one. You know, millions of kids take it and they just updated their 2025 norm table. You know, the last one they did is is 2020. um you know every 5 years they update the benchmark and

[00:14:01] America knows less now. So your average eighth grader in 2025 knows less than the average eighth grader in 2020 who knows less than 2015. So you can't just blame co on that like this is a continuing trend. It's it's a continuing trend. It's continuing to go down. There is one actually anomaly which is uh in both the 20 when from 15 to 20 and 20 to 25 there's one one group who actually goes up and that's your 99th percentile. So the top 1% academically in America in K through 12 continues to increase. Right?

[00:14:36] Those are your IV league bound kids continue to go up. Um uh now but everybody else is is um uh going down. Things are getting easier in tests. You know the the AP tests in high school that you take. you know, they reormed them in the last couple years and they normally against college kids because it's like, okay, if you take an AP test, that's like a college class, right? And so they say, well, what do college kids know? And they're like, oh, college kids know less. So now our AP test is easier, right? And so it used to be at alpha, if you were going to be in the honors track, you had to get a four or five on an AP. Now we're like, oh, you just need a five because the fours are too easy, right? Just the the standards just keep going down. And you know, I'll give some more data just, you know, I just gave the academic talk. Um, we had hundreds of families at Alpha across the country.

[00:15:31] We have campuses now everywhere. And, you know, start the last couple weeks. And so they all come in, they take a placement test, you know, and I got up in front of all the parents and I was like, "Here's the message, and it's going to worry you, but you should take away that you're, you know, $40,000 private school, they've been lying to you, which is if your student has an A and you've been getting straight A's on your transcript, that student in our tests, right, is anywhere from one year ahead, that's great, to three years behind.

[00:16:07] This is an A student who's three years behind. And when we talk about three years behind, if they're a seventh grader, that means they're missing a significant number of questions on the fourth grade test. If you're a B student, you are from three years behind to seven years behind. So, you've been paying your price.

[00:16:25] Let's let's give an example of what this means. I I have a great sense of this because, you know, you and I have been through this together, but I want the I want the listener to understand tangibly what that means. Let's put that in terms of something mathematical. So let's talk about what that implies for a B student in seventh grade mathematics. What concept could they be possibly missing?

[00:16:48] Yeah. Yeah. Well, I they don't know their multiplication tables or division tables. So, one of the things that's happened in sort of K through2 education is they've decided that memorization is bad and that memorizing you don't need to memorize your multiplication tables anymore. You're just going to use a calculator. You know, that's not what learning science says. That is not you.

[00:17:12] If you're going to do higher level math, you need fact fluency. And if you think of cognitive load theory, right, you have a certain number of working memory slots. And the level of complexity of the math problem that you can solve is going to be based on how many slots you have and right how you're using them.

[00:17:28] And you know one of the few places in in in brain chemistry is if you uh have memorized something to fluency it doesn't use a slot. It doesn't use it. And so you can do higher level math, but if you have to use your slots to say 7* 8 is 56, you're now trying to do higher level math and you're using it up on the wrong things. So you if you want to do higher level math, memorize your math tables, right? And your division tables to fluency. And that that's like the most simple obvious thing we could do in this country is just change that, right?

[00:18:03] Just go back to what we used to do. And you're like scores keep going down. And you know if you even get in and even this and this is like the most extreme example is you know we had a student who had a 740 math SAT. So again just for listeners who might not be familiar with that the score is 800. So 7 740 would be a very good score.

[00:18:23] What percentile is that? Uh I'd have top 10%. Okay. Yeah. 90th percentile easily. 770 is like a top 1%. So maybe in top 5% I'd have to um and uh so great score. Yep. She cannot get above it. And when we we we do game what we call game film, right? You review why you missed the test, why you missed the questions on the test, right? One thing as an example that's common in sports, right? Game film.

[00:18:50] People don't do this in academics for some reason. So they she would just go through it and she's like, I know what that is. You you decide was it a careless error? Yep. Did you not know the material? Yep. She's like after the test she could get them all done right given time. And what happened was is she was overloaded and made careless mistakes. When you're right, working memory slots are overloaded. It reflects actually in careless mistakes. So if your students making careless mistakes, you're like grit and discipline. You're like, you probably don't have a fact fluency somewhere earlier that if you just go fix that, all of a sudden those careless mistakes go away. So she literally went back to third grade, learned her multiplication and division tables, right? And back to convincing parents, that's really hard convincing students and parents to your 740 math student needs third grade material.

[00:19:40] She then got a 790 math after she memorized it because she stopped making the careless errors. She knew all the material before she was overloading her working memory, right? And the learning science is like that's that's her issue. And in our system, we can identify that and fix it. and seemingly crazy, you know, that you can go back and and memorize your tables and get up there.

[00:20:04] And I remember another story, Joe, that we kind of bonded over a couple of years ago, which was the the student that was really struggling in uh in entry level chemistry. Yeah. And I mean, I can I I think anybody who's been through chemistry can empathize with that. first time you're doing you're going through physical chemistry and you're trying to balance the chemical equations and and this this kid is dying and they think the problem is

[00:20:32] I'll never it's chemistry the problem is chemistry and you came in and said no actually the problem is fractions you didn't master fractions in third grade or fourth grade or whenever fractions are introduced and you're failing chemistry because you did you for this exact reason we're going to go back and fill the gap in chemist in in fractions and this will become easy for you and of course that's what happened and math science knowledge is hierarchical right and this is back to mastery which is we've why we do poorly we've given up mastery in this country why um we're a timebased system right at the end of third grade you're moving to fourth grade and at the end of fourth grade you're moving to fifth grade and we don't hold kids back we don't we just we've said we're just going to move kids through no matter what Um cuz it's time cuz there's all these other social issues, right? And you know, oh my god,

[00:21:28] I can't have my kid hold back the pressure on the school to relax the standards. You know, 80% of kids at Harvard get an A now. You know, it's just grade inflation. You know, grades look like this. Yep. Standardized test scores look like that, right? And it's just we've just got and for whatever reasons we've done it but in a timebased system you know and here's part just even grading you know there's this concept that you know okay you got a 70 you know you can pass an 80 is a B right that's great okay my kids would be student 80 the problem is you know if you only have 80% you know knowledge you're creating all these holes and it all compounds where eventually and it starts to when you hit algebra or chemistry right that you're you think it's the current material material, but it's your prerex, right?

[00:22:15] It's your foundation. And you know, we talk a lot about parents because a lot of this is, you know, we all grew up in this timebased system and just the old system. And so this new way is very different, but the best analogies we always use that parents totally understand is sports, right? Just like game film. We're like, review your tests, figure out what's wrong.

[00:22:33] Mastery is the same one, you know, which is if you're the point guard and you lose the ball 20% of the time going down the court, the coach isn't like, "Let's work on the advanced stuff." They're like, "Kid, let's learn how to dribble." We don't need to worry about dunking yet. Correct. No dunking. Like, let's focus on right get up to 99%. Get to mastery that you know how to do the basics.

[00:22:54] Everybody in sports is like, "If you're not doing well, go back and do the basics." Well, academics is the same way. And if you apply that same logic, right, but in a timebased system with a teacher in front of a classroom, right, you can't get every kid to mastery, right? And that's when we get into like the new solutions and and why we get these crazy, you know, kids can learn 10 times faster. It's because we're able to get out of a non-mastery, non-timebased system or a non-mastery timebased system that has a teacher in front of a classroom.

[00:23:28] Right? Teachers are great. teacher in front of the classroom's bad. Um, you know, that that dynamic. And so, uh, but and to your point, hierarchical, you know, chemistry is just algebra with advanced word problems, right? Physics is literally calculus with advanced word problems. You know, algebra is basically advanced fraction manipulation. You can give kids a fraction test and predict their algebra score, right? And then fractions are how's your division and multiplication tables? Do you memorize them to fluency? And so it just keeps going down the whole track, you know, all the way down. And so part of what you have to do to fix the system, right, is figure out age grade. Oh, wait. I'm an eighth grader in algebra and knowledge grade. Wait, I don't know. My fractions are different. And so, you know what? A teacher in the front of a classroom, though, it's not their fault, right? I'm a teacher. I'm an eighth grade teacher.

[00:24:22] What do you teach? Eighth grade material. Yeah. and I have kids who don't who who don't who who don't know some third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh material. What do I do? Right? And this is why, you know, and um so many people hire tutors, you know, after school at private schools, right? There's, you know, it's crazy. We have all these people go to private schools and hire after school tutors because the school doesn't teach them. And you know, the tutors just like, "Okay, I'm going to go give you the earlier grade level material. That's it." Um, when we talk about kids, all these hundreds of kids coming in who are, you know, 3 years behind, seven years behind, the second part of what I tell the parents is that's freaking you out cuz nobody wants their kid this far behind, but it's so easy to fix. The remediation on this stuff is no time at all. That when you use these, you know, learning science-based AI tutors and the apps that we have, kids can learn 10 times faster. 10 times faster. So when you actually look at material there's 180 school days right hour a day plus homework so couple hundred hours most of grade one subject right per grade level takes our alpha kids between 20 and 30 hours to finish an entire grade level to mastery.

[00:25:40] So you can take fourth grade math and be like, you got 26 hours, kid. You do an hour a day of homework. You're 26 days away, right? 22 hours is seventh grade and sixth grade. 22 each, right? For math. And Joe, would this work if, and again, as just as a thought experiment, if each student had one teacher, the private tutor? Yeah. If you could put a private tutor in front of a student for 22 hours over the course of, you know, whatever two months or one hour a day for 26 days, are you confident that that individual, and of course, we'll talk about why that's not practical, but that that individual, if skilled enough, could navigate and weave that child through. if you give me a few more hours than what I just gave you because the AI can do a little bit better than than than most tutors. But yes, fundamentally the paper that was written when I was in high school about education like so learning science and we didn't you know learning science has been around for 40 years they've been writing papers there's 10,000 papers published by all the schools of education and you know

[00:26:44] Stanford and you know all over the place that is we know kids can learn two five or 10 times faster right we've known it in you know blues two sig Bloom's two sigma is a seminal paper and he just said if everybody got a personalized tutor was his First point and second they did it to mastery. They worked to mastery.

[00:27:06] Right? So mastery based not tenure based. Correct. Just you have to know the material before you advance and there's an individual tutor to coach you. You will get two sigma better performance which is right your leftmost part of your curve. Your worst students are going to be at what today is considered the top 10%.

[00:27:24] And two sigma performance. You said to me once four or five years ago something and I'm curious if you still stand by it, which is at least through the end of 8th grade, there is not a single student in the United States that cannot achieve complete mastery in mathematics to score above the 90th or 99th percentile in the national test.

[00:27:48] Yes. So, and I think I said that to you three years ago and I would hesitate I just for argument sake take out the bottom 5% just to stop all the arguments. Okay. All right. So 95 you would still say that 95% of all eighth graders in the United States could be what today is considered top 10% performance. They can get to master in mathematics.

[00:28:12] In mathematics. Yeah. So just let that settle in for a moment. Right. like that just that seems to fly in the face of everything. I want to go back and close the loop on something before we continue this discussion which is I still don't have a sense of what's changing right because we've always had a timebased system not a mastery based system. So what has gone on in the last 25 years because that's not the change. What is why are why why are scores why are standards well the fundamental answer is standards are lowering and part of it is parents right here's so

[00:28:45] I'll I'll give you you know three years ago when I became principal you know I would sit down with parents and I'm like we have this cool engine it's going to teach your kid twice as much in the 2-hour block twice as much now they have to use the apps right and engage with it and you know your your students not using it right, so they're not learning 2x. The parents are like, "Yo, you stop.

[00:29:10] Don't pressure my kid to learn 2x. Don't pressure them." You know, I'd be in a parent meeting. It would literally be, you know, mom, dad, and Johnny. And I'm like, look, when, you know, when he misses a question, he doesn't watch the video, right? Or he's scrolling and just guessing. If he just watched the video, he'd learn twice as much. And the parents would say, "We're not interested in that." Now, so why are they hundreds of hundreds? Well, um the rest of the things parents want life skills, community, a school is a bundle of which academics is one piece.

[00:29:43] And for the most part in America, except for less fewer than 10% like less than 10% market share, less than 10% of the parents, right? Fewer than 10% of parents really care about academics. that 90% of parents are like, "Oh, well." Um, and so that was an eye openener to me. And hundreds of parents of meetings later, I literally we switched our pitch, which was 2-hour learning, the same engine cuz he just flipped the You're like, "It's two-hour learning." And look, we're trying to get Johnny out of here in two hours so he can do these cool workshops and do what he loves, right? And that flip. Parents are like, then all of a sudden they're like, "Johnny, what's wrong with you? Why aren't don't you want to get out of here and do the cool stuff? And so it's it's back to you know the most important part of education is a motivated student and you know for us 2x learning is not a motivating idea except for you know sort of the top kids but 2-hour learning is motivational for every kid on the planet right and that's if you had to say our my biggest unlock was that realization and you know the product became codeename time back give the kids their time back because that is the most precious right that for 12 years we waste kids time. We know that kids sitting in a lecture-based classroom right retain maybe 5%.

[00:31:12] It's that bad. It's that bad. And so like being 10 times better, you're like I need them to remember 50%. Right? I just I there's still, you know, it's it's that bad. We know it's that bad, right? It's not personalized to them. It's not to a mastery. All these bad things. Um, and so we're wasting their 12 years. And you wonder why kids don't like academics and they're not disengaged and all these things is we're wasting their time. And so for this it's like great just they're going to learn two in two hours. Now they're still learning 2x, right? That's just not the part we pitch. And so they're learning 2x in two hours. And then you free up the rest of the day. And so we get all our kids, right? Our score is at alpha school. We're all top 1%. Right?

[00:31:52] Academically our our classes are top 1% in the country. There's no school academically who's as good as alpha um you know in the country and the reason is is using this model right and we've we're just implementing all these concepts that have been written in these learning science papers for 40 years.

[00:32:11] Is there is there a challenge to the intensity that's required in those two hours? So I'll give you an analogy. So, I get asked all the time, uh, hey Peter, look, I've read that, you know, I could just do one set to failure once a week for each body part and get most of the benefits of, you know, grinding it out for, you know, 10 to 20 sets per body part. And I say, look, well, that's a little bit of an exaggeration, but there's some truth to this, right? Like, if you could truly do one to two sets to absolute failure u per exercise, yeah, you're going to get great results. And they're like, well, Peter, why don't you do that? And I and I say, "Look, to be honest with you, it's really freaking hard to bring that level of intensity to every single set of every single workout, every time you do it." Um, and there are a bunch of other reasons that

[00:32:56] I actually kind of like being in the gym or whatever. But, but the point is, um, it's true you can get great results in much less time, but for many people, the intensity is not something they're willing to rise to. And and so I guess the similar question is if for two hours a day a kid can learn what a traditional kid is learning in six to seven hours a day and actually do it better. Um is there something that they have to be able to bring from an attention span perspective that is very difficult or not something that is you know Yeah.

[00:33:30] Yeah. And so the answer is it's not difficult but they have to want to do it. So motivation. So if you know if you talk to an educator, there's two things you need. You need a motivated student and you need to put them in lessons of the correct difficulty. Not too easy, not too hard, right? That's back to and edte and why, you know, taking this a little bit. Why doesn't edte work, right? Back to these apps and you know, test scores keep going down, but everybody keeps buying edtech. And the answer is edtech does that second piece, that 10% piece of put them in the right, you know, lessons very well. Our AI tutors do it even better. It can figure out very easily what a kid knows and doesn't know and say age grade, eighth grade, knowledge grade, fourth, give them fourth grade lessons, right? And so that part's great. Now the second part is to the point of my parent meeting.

[00:34:19] How do I get them to engage with the app? Right? Because I'm spinning in the chair. I'm not paying attention. I'm talking to my friend. I'm scrolling Tik Tok. Right? I'm doing anything except focusing on it. And so what is there? Motivation is 90% of the solution. And for us, that's why time back is so valuable, which is the kid has to engage with the apps for those two hours or they don't get the rest of the day. They don't get their time back, right?

[00:34:47] They'll just sit there wasting their time. I mean, we literally in our app have a waste meter and it just coaches the kid, right? The AI like we can get into the AIS and stuff and chat chat bots are terrible. like chat GBT rolled out to America students they 90% of kids use it as a cheat bot it's all cheating that we don't have a chat interface in ours but one of the things our AI does is it watches the kids screen and coaches them up and it's like look you're scrolling the article and guessing not going to learn that way right you're skipping this right and it's going to coach them of how to learn better and if you have a motivation for the student to actually learn better and be effective. They're very happy to do that, right? We have a sports academy that we just we just opened 10 10 of them around Texas and these are middle schools, right? D1 bound athletes, you know, kind of and they come in and they do the two hours in the apps, right? And then once they hit it, you know, and they go green where they've done the lessons, right, they get to do sports all afternoon. And so you can take kids who are like,"I hate school. I skip school. You know, absenteeism is huge."

[00:35:59] And when they get to do that, all of a sudden they're like, "I'm totally motivated." Right? We It's only been a couple weeks that we've been open. But you get notes from all the parents who are like, "My kid always was sick, never wanted to go, everything. Now he's waking me up and is like, let's not be late." Right? And it's because they have the motivation to actually learn. And so now, now you so that's the most important. You can do that for everybody, right? And motivation really really does matter and alpha is designed around how do we motivate kids and the biggest motivators time back. We also use a lot of other ones. Um but that's that's the biggest thing that makes our system work and when then when you talk just is there also extra juice of the intensity right we measure do kids get through our apps 90 or 95% first time right right where we're not making the lesson hard where we want to make sure the lesson's not too hard where you don't have to have too much intensity. Yep.

[00:36:56] Right. Now we also have a What is the sweet spot? Is it 90% between 90 and 95% is where first time right? Yeah. So actually a little bit there's a thing called the zone of proximal development which is what an individual student should be in. You want to keep a student in 80 to 85% correct questions which is different than first time right on getting through the whole lesson. You want to be in the zone of proximal development which is you know if you're at 99% it's too easy.

[00:37:24] You're not learning right. If you're getting 99% of the questions right, uh, you're just regurgitating what you already know. If you're missing and half the time or twothirds, you know, you're only at 50 or 60, right? You get disengagement, right? It's too frustrating. Like, I'm out, right? We literally video game developers are the world's experts on this on engagement of how do you engage? And, you know, they'll tell you, you know, always winning, always learning, you know, and that concept. And 80 to 85% is is where that is. So we're measuring you know the way to maximize learning is a unending stream of content right both educational questions right and learning content that is at 80 to 85% accuracy um you know and and this gets into stuff that we're we're building is you know if you sit in a Stanford lecture you're going to retain one to five facts ideas and concepts per hour. our current learning engines depending on what the subject we're at 20 to 40 you know we have stuff that we're working on where when and Gen AI is the driver of this we'll get to a 100 facts ideas and concepts an hour right think of an endlessly scrolled Tik Tok list except engaging and good content instead of the the poison that that is and so the learning science part is we know how to get knowledge into kids' head 10 times better than the current educational system, but it it takes a whole rebuild and back to kids when they love school, they're going to engage in the app because the whole day is great.

[00:38:59] So, let's go back and talk a little bit about education science, right? You've alluded to it a couple of times. Um, tell me what is what 90% of people would agree with. Right. There's nothing that I was going to say tell me something that is unambiguously true about education science, but but let's let's soften that a little bit and say tell me something that 90% of people who study education, study the science of learning would agree with. 90% would agree that individualized tutoring and a mastery based standard is the best way to teach kids, right? It's it's dramatically more effective than a timebased system. um that the concepts in learning science, zone of proximal development, uh spaced repetition, right? Um you would get uh the testing effect, right?

[00:39:57] That actually asking kids active learning is better than passive learning, right? That retention of sitting passively in a classroom is the worst way to teach a kid. Um they're going to all of those things. Um what else are really well-normed you know cognitive load theory um is a newer area of learning science that's you know sort of developed in started in the '90s and this is the how many working memory slots do you have and then how many reps does it take to move from working memory slot you know short-term memory basically working memory slot to long-term uh they're all going to agree by the way it's so interesting to me that this is that there's any dispute around that when you see the effects in sports like the sports illustrates that

[00:40:40] I think more than anything else. Um, you look at the difference between like a Tom Brady versus an exceptional quarterback who's a very good quarterback. And it's the it's the processing speed, right? It's not I mean, it's not how fast or how far he can throw the ball. It's his processing speed that sets him apart. It's it's the cognitive bandwidth of what he's doing.

[00:41:06] And it's this this is I mean it's actually the same in in Formula 1, right? If you look at what separates the very best in the world from very good, it's it's cognitive bandwidth. It's the guy who actually doesn't have to think at all about driving. Mhm. And can still drive at the limit while he can use all of his cognitive reserve for strategic decision-m and and overtaking something like that. And so like that fluency stuff just there's no there's nobody in learning science who's like it's better if they don't memorize their multiplication tables even though our school system you know has abandoned that and that's that's you know p private it's not like oh these private schools are you know the private schools are bailing on it too it's not just but why was that decision made um back pressure from you know there's that's parental pressure again my kid is not happy like one one of the so I there's three things I tell so this is another one of the sort of codd of the you know this is just and there's three to come to an alpha school now I have a conversation with parents I've sort of fried you know when he gave you those two things but I've add a third a third one to it which is you know first your kid must love school right really love school and we measure literally measure would you rather go to school or go on vacation like super high standard right we should have kids love school for 12 years right and they're going to be there your childhood why why do we not have that standard The second is your kid can learn in two hours, right? Twice as much as sitting in class for six, right? You your kid can crush academics in just two hours a day. Crush it. That's the second thing you have to believe to come to Alpha. And the third, and this is where the controversy parts, but it's true, you know, is the key to your kids happiness is high standards, right? And that's the one that a lot of people do not believe that they think the key to my kid's happiness is low standards. And the problem with low standards I can't virus come from where where did where did this virus infect us?

[00:43:07] Well part of it is if you actually you know the parents want to protect their kids right it comes from parents from a a good place which is I don't want to see my kids struggle and fail on their road to success. They don't want to see that. Like I I talk about, you know, the cycle as a as a principal, I can tell you kids struggle, fail, sometimes cry on their road to success if they're supported by a caring, loving adult. Right? That loop, if you ask any child development expert in the planet, right? You can type that all in chatbt is the key to kids development, the key to their self-confidence, the key to their resilience, right? The key to their growth that they go through the cycle of struggle, fail, right? on the road.

[00:43:52] It's a hero's journey. It's a hero's journey. It's it's woven into everything. And back to your point on sports. Everybody, why do you 50% of America's like, you know, where my kid learns life skills? And when you talk about life skills, teamwork, leadership, grit, hard work, it's in after school sports because that's what the coach does.

[00:44:10] My kids's going to go through that struggle and I went through it when I was playing sports and my kids going to go through that and that's where you learn it. And they have this view of that's the only place you learn. in school. That's such an interesting point. And and the reason it doesn't happen in schools is because in a timebased system, everybody thinks good grades equals high

[00:44:30] IQ. And so it's fundamentally that IQ is what determines grades. And so I don't want to pressure my kid cuz who knows if he's really this, right? It's not fair, right? And so I don't want to put that pressure on them. You know, one of the magic unlocks we have, right? back to everybody can get to you know that much higher performance right is a masterybased system you know if you take the best kids you know and you you're like who are the kids who do get in the Ivy League right they're basically the high IQ kids who also have high conscientiousness big five conscientiousness right they're grinders right they just right they just crank through it naturally um and those are the kids who do well and so if we're rebuilding education to fix We have to take those two constraints away, right?

[00:45:20] And so a mastery based system takes away IQ, which is every kid, you know, just the conceptual leaps that are required to get through K through 8. Actually, by the design of Common Core just aren't that big. That does not mean everybody can go be a nuclear physicist at Stanford and design all these things, right? I'm not going to that's that's there is areas where you do need more cognitive everybody in math there's a a point they reach y just I can't I can't do the processing but I'm K through eight it's designed that everybody can do it everyone will do it everybody can do it so if you and yet just reflect on that for a moment Joe think of all the kids that are in sixth seventh and eighth grade who are good students in other domains they're doing well in English they're doing well in history they're conscientious just they work hard but they they've created a narrative that says I can't do math and let I'll we'll dive into that and we'll get into the the second thing of how we we also use our motivation model to undo the conscientiousness limitation. You you have to use more extrinsic motivators to let people who aren't high conscientiousness still perform like somebody who does. So those are our sort of magic unlocks on those two things that we think can fix education. But your math thing, I got I got to give these examples. So, you know, it's an epidemic of kids who come into middle school, you know, predominantly girls. I have two daughters, right? Who come in and they're like, I'm not a math science girl. And there's just like society's like accepting it. Like that. And okay, let's go read all the learning science papers about how middle school girls can't do math science. Okay, there are none.

[00:47:02] There's none. That doesn't exist, right? There's no such thing. But it's this total meme that they they believe. And so part of what our job in middle or when they transfer in high school is to fix that, right? That there's this concept of oh, I'm an art girl or I'm an English girl or whatever it is. And it doesn't girl boy. There's just there's no difference.

[00:47:20] And so like our we have uh some seniors uh this year, you know, the first one uh she's uh her big project that she does at Alpha Alpha, you do these big Alpha X projects. She is doing the first all teen uh produced created musical for Broadway, right? She sourced all the song and songwriters off uh Tik Tok. She can fill a thousand person venue. You know, she's trying to raise it up so she can do it. So, she'd be, you know, I'm an arts theater girl, right? 790 math

[00:47:55] SAT. We have another girl, right? These are seniors. She's, you know, uh, trying out to be Miss Teen USA, right? 790 math SAT, right? Third girl who is doing a, this is my daughter, right? She has a, you know, uh, I call her Tik Tok girl, you know, she's got millions of likes on Tik Tok and tons of followers. She's building a, uh, app to teach teen boys how to ask girls out on dates cuz teen boys are terrible at that. Um, right.

[00:48:27] Top 1% as team math, right? that there's this concept that these people can't learn it. You're like, they all can, right? There's just no. Now, what do you have to do when they come into middle school? They do. They don't know the multiplication tables, right? They don't know the prerexs. They are going to struggle in algebra, right? And so, you're like, okay, let's go back. Let's fill them up. And all of a sudden, once you fill the holes, all of a sudden, they can do it. And then once you know algebra, right, you're like, oh, I can do chemistry, right? and I can move from, you know, because you K through eight science, there's no math actually.

[00:49:01] It's all just memorizing facts, you know, ignous rocks and, you know, the planets and stuff. Um, once you get to high school, that's where, you know, biology is still more memorization, less math. But then chemistry and physics are all math-based, calculus and and algebra. And so, you have to get these kids the prerexs, but then all of a sudden they're like, "Oh, chemistry is pretty fun, right? Oh, I now that I know calculus and I can crush calc BC." all our kids in high school, right? If you want to be on the honors track, it's five on CalPC, right? And totally doable, right, for everybody. And so this whole thing, you know, our freshman coming in by the end of the freshman year, they're 1410 on the SAT, right?

[00:49:41] Which, you know, 1350 is top 10%. Right? I mean, these are freshmen. These are freshmen. Like, and most schools don't I mean, that's better than most junior seniors. Most don't publish their freshman results, right? and uh and we can get freshmen there, you know, and you and and once it becomes this mastery based system, how high you go becomes a decision back to your effort.

[00:50:03] It's a decision, not an inherent capability. And so when you break that link, like alpha kids are just like in a mastery based system, they're like, "Oh, it's just more work. It's not I'm not smart enough." Right? And that is the unlock that we have to have and why we have to move to a mastery based system because you just need kids to be like, oh, so if you want to be in the non-honor, if you're in normal alpha high, right, 1350 is the minimum SAT, right? You got to get to it. Top 10%. If you want to be in the honors track, it's 1550. And we're just like 1550. I mean, that's top 1%.

[00:50:38] Yeah. Oh, yeah. And but it's it's just a decision. Do you want to do the work to get to 1550, right? From 1350, right? And so this so it's just that look, I'm willing to put in this many more hours this year. Yeah. No. Uh so back to my uh uh my youngest daughter who's just took the SAT and you know uh it's she's top 1% but she's not perfect 800 and she's like she literally was in she's asking the AI she's like how much time will it take for me to get up to the top to a perfect 800? And you know, at that level, it doesn't really matter for getting into college. But she's like, just out of curiosity, she's like, well, no, she's like, you know, dad, you know, all those STEM boys, you know, they think I'm this dumb

[00:51:25] Tik Tok girl, and you know, if I get an 800, I get to mog on them the rest of their life, and I think it's totally worth it. And so, she's literally, but it's just a decision. She's trying to decide. It'll come back and it'll probably be 20-ish hours, probably. I don't know, some some manageable number of hours. And she'll just be making a decision. Am I going to put the reps in, right, the practice in to get there, right, so that I can have this ego boost basically because she really loves it or no? Okay, you know, I'm going to do something else with my time. But that's where, you know, in these mastery based models, you know, versus, you know, in a teacher in front of a classroom model where you're a timebased system, you're like, I don't know how to get there, right? There's no path up. And you know when we when you log in to our system, it literally tells you, you know, in two hours a day, you know, you're three years behind. So you first come in, you're like, you're three years behind.

[00:52:16] It's you're like, "Oh my god, that seems insurmountable." You're 20 to 30 hours per grade level. So you could be 60 hours behind. If you're three years behind, 60 hours, that's it. You're 60 hours away. And you're like, "So if I do an hour of homework and two months, I'm there. I'm caught up." Yeah. I'm caught up.

[00:52:35] And now back to incentives, there's some kids who are like, do I care that I'm caught up? But it's easy to incentive to want to catch up, right? And you can figure out, okay, what do we have to do? You know, one of the things we one of the things Alpha is known for, whether infamously or not, is we use extrinsic motivators, right, to drive Yeah. We use money. Time back is the most important one. it's more important than money is, you know, sort of the, you know, the

[00:53:03] Westlake track where you got to do, you know, honors track where it's, you know, six hours a day and eight zillion homework hours. I don't think you can pay a kid enough to like love school by going through that versus, you know, we're two hour actually, and just be clear, we're two hours a day for a non-honors track. We're three hours a day for honors back to the 1550. It does take more time. Um, but we will take middle school kids, like this is this is a middle school active program. We have kids come in and we will pay them $1,000 to get to top 1%.

[00:53:35] And you know, I there's a lot of stories, right, around this where kids view, look, I can't do that. It's not I'm not the smart kid. I'm not the math science girl. I can't whatever it is. And well, if you get there and do these lessons and we're just going to keep giving you lessons and you do the work, you're going to get $1,000. you know, you're the we'll pay kids, right, coming in middle school $1,000 um to get to top 1%. And the point of this is, you know, what's even more important than the academic knowledge, it's their internal view of themselves that changes that kids come in and say,

[00:54:13] I'm not a math science girl. I can't be top 1%. I can't do this. Whatever limits they have. And a lot of education when you talk about it is, you know, holistically you're trying to take limits in kids and release them, right? And have them understand you're limitless. You can do all this. And this is the best way academically we found to do it. And so they come in and the AI is going to say, "Here's all the lessons you need to do to get to top 1%." And just go through them. And that motivation will get all these kids to top 1%. And the number of stories we have, you know, I have one of my own daughter, but all, you know, the alpha families where their student is like they come back and they're like, I didn't realize I could be top 1% and my personal self-confidence and view of myself that I had to do hard work, right? You had to do the work right now.

[00:55:03] I'm, you know, I I And then once you take a middle school kid who's top 1% as they go into high school, they're not going to give it up because and there's this mental view of, oh, I guess I am a smart kid, right? Or I'm a capable kid, right? And that unlock is so valuable. And so for us, that's when, you know, we think, you know, juicing it with money.

[00:55:25] I mean, we spend 20 grand a kid in this country per student, right? and you're like in middle school give a kid $1,000 in order to have them realize there is that the height there's no limit. Why does why would most people I assume listening to us have sort of an uneasy feeling about that? like they can't reconcile what you just said, which is, well, wait a minute. On the one hand, I know we're spending $20,000 per year per kid on these kids, and we're getting nothing for it. And you're proposing we give them a couple of those thousands of dollars strategically to incentivize half of the equation, which is them having the motivation to do this. And yet, that's going to make a lot of people feel uneasy. Why? So there's a view uh that there needs to be an intrinsic love of learning for it to be pure and that if you it has to be intrinsic not exttrinsic and that if you're buying it it's sullied and not good right it's just it's wrong it's fundamentally wrong and you know and that is a common view are there any data that would support one view being favorable to the other how would that be studied there there is a set of papers that have written that show that you know if somebody is not intrinsically motivated or is intrinsically motivated and you pay them they lose intrinsic motivation.

[00:56:43] Now that's not the case that we're sitting with. We have kids who aren't motivated who aren't intrinsically going through it, right? They need the boost. Um, and if you actually ask alpha kids, and maybe we'll do a study someday, no parent who has their kids at alpha thinks, "My kids lost their intrinsic motivation." If anything, it's the opposite because now they think they're capable. And those papers don't talk about is how much of the issue was, I didn't think I was capable. I now realize I am. And I get this crazy intrinsic boost around it. Right? I my youngest daughter again would be this example which is you know she came in to middle school you know at uh she hit top 10%. And her by the end of 8th grade sorry this was before this is going into seventh grade.

[00:57:38] Okay. She was top 10% coming in. So she had been there but she's like dad I'm not like my older sister. I'm not top 1%. Right. That's just not who I am. Right. I'm Tik Tok girl. you know, if we're going to And I was like, you know, uh, you know what I know, you know, love more than anything is shopping.

[00:57:58] And I'll bet you $1,000 that you can't get to top 1%. And so, she literally would fill her Amazon cart with $1,000 of stuff. And in the morning, she'd then look and look at the lessons she had to go through and she'd do it, right? She'd just grind through it. Now, back to this thing. It's, you know, we had a lot of family discussions around this cuz my wife, right, she was like, "Wait, there's two things, and this is most parents are are like this. There's two things here. One, you're setting 1% top 1%." And most parents are like, "That's too hard, right? And, you know, why are you putting that pressure, you know, for on on the kid? And number two, it doesn't feel right to pay a,000 bucks to get this. This is just We're all brought up that there's something wrong." And so, and but back to the thing. So she does it. She hits top 1% literally buys everything. But then she sits down right with my wife and she's like, "Mom, I know you didn't like us doing this, but you need to understand what this has done for me, which is I never thought I was as smart as my older sister and now

[00:59:04] I realize I can do everything, right, that she can do and it's totally changed my internal view, right?" And that element there of right her and now back she's also the one now who's top 1% on the SAT trying to decide if she wants to do the extra work to get a perfect score right that their that change in their view of their capability that unlock is so valuable and I believe we should do this for every kid in

[00:59:31] America right that but that's the dynamics of why people don't like it and it's you then just have to decide if you can use exttrinsic motivation whatever it is buy them concert tickets buy them right go shopping, whatever, whatever motiv screen time, video game time, whatever it takes to get the kid to realize I can go be and learn all this and be top 1% when I previously didn't think that, right? And I go through that struggle, fail, sometimes cry on the road to success loop. That then unlocks my human potential. And right, the point of education beyond academics, right?

[01:00:07] You're trying to unlock human potential. And this is just a great easy way to do it. And it it's not available system. Yeah, that's the thing. You don't it it's not necessarily something that has to happen indefinitely. It's it it's what I what I think makes sense here is that it's it's an unlock that then creates a new state of awareness that therefore becomes self-perpetuating. So in many ways it's like the kindling that leads to the fire.

[01:00:34] You don't need kindling indefinitely. Sometimes you need kindling. Exactly. that I think that's I'm going to steal that from you because that's a great way to think about it which is I'm not paying her to to decide to go get a perfect score on her SAT. I don't need the extra, right? It's intrinsic, right?

[01:00:48] It's her decision. It's her capability. She just needed that kindling to to to jumpstart it and un whatever block was in the mind, right? You're all right. Good coaches, they're like, "How do I unblock them?" And that's what this does. Uh, you know, and since we're on this of paying, I'll give you my my second one, which if I um uh the secretary of education is coming down next week to meet with

[01:01:10] McKenzie around alpha stuff. And if there's one thing to fix education in America, just the what's the simplest unlock, it would be this, which is and it's all around whole filling and and paying kids, which is so when I first started, um I wanted kids to go back and who fill, right? We call filling, go back and do your prerexs. And so I'm sitting down with the seventh graders, the boys. And

[01:01:37] I'm like, "Guys, you could get 100 or before that." I'm sitting down with them and you know what does not motivate a stu seventh grader? Doing fourth grade. No kid wants to do that, right? No one wants to be going back. And the only people who want it less than the kid are their parents. Yeah. Their parents are like, "Every parent in

[01:01:55] America has been trained my kid needs to be at grade level, right?" Which once again, the learning science does, right? That is not right. get your kid to master the basics and if it's pre previous material, give it to them. Um, and so I and I tried to convince parents, look, your kid needs a whole fill if we're going to get this thing whole thing working and stuff. And I basically ended up giving up on the parents. And so then

[01:02:17] I went to the seventh graders and I was just like, okay, here we go, guys. You could get a hundred on the Texas Star, you know, our state test. They're like, no way, Mr. Leebot. I'm like, no, no, no. Well, in centure I'll give you a $100 bill for 100 on the test. They're like, that's still impossible. I'm like, no, no, no. There's a catch, any grade level.

[01:02:41] They're like, I can take a kindergarten Texas Star and you can give me 100 bucks. I was like, well, it starts in the third grade. They're like, I'm in. They take the third grade Texas Star, they get 100. I give them a $100 bill. They're like, a fourth grade? I'm like, absolutely. Same thing. 100 get 100.

[01:03:00] By fifth grade, they're running into they got 75 to 85, right? They get 75 to 85. They holes. And I'm like, well, do you want the AI tutor to generate the lessons you missed? And they're like, well, let me see how many it is. They're like, I can do that in a week. They're in, right? Get the hundred then, you know, and on the way sixth and then seventh grade and for $400. $400 and you brought a kid up to grade level up to grade level. But more importantly, they all think they can get and know they can get a hundred on the state test, which used to be only the GT kids and the smart kids get it. Like if you survey incoming alpha parents and say, "Can your kid get 100 on the Texas

[01:03:43] Star?" Fewer than 10% say yes, they can. After you've been at Alpha a year, 90% of kids are like, "I can totally get a 100red on Texas Star." Because they've done it right. our building, you know, over there, you know, gets more hundreds on the Texas Star than a school district of 100,000 kids, right? And it's just because we have a mastery based system where you tell them. So our advancement now and is built into our system is we'll actually advance a kid if they get over 90, right? What is our mastery standard? It's in the 90s. So you have to score on the state test above a 90 to move on to the next grade level material. But we also have a hundred for a hundred. And so the kids are like, "Okay, well, I guess I'm just going to get the hundred because I want to get the $100 bill." And so you have this concept where and it just changes them where I could advance.

[01:04:33] That's an interesting experiment in and of itself. It's it's sort of what we would call a natural experiment because it's not randomized, which is if the kid is motivated um basically just to do the bare minimum, they're going to just take the 90, right? And so you so and if you make it a hundred it just back to there's a little reality of bring your parents and everybody along with you on this crazy journey we're on and so that 100 lets us out of it which is you know when you get to the higher material and you've done 90 our app's still going to go back and fill those 10% cuz it's the best way to learn but it's just get them advanced let them go and and do that but the hundred the kids all just do it because they know they can and it just gets the right mindset going which is why our kids literally for the SAT. Everybody thinks, you know, oh, you can't get perfect scores. They're like, it's just some extra work, right? Like fives on

[01:05:24] APs. People are like, that seems impossible. Like, oh, how many hours is it, right? It takes 75 hours to go through like AP world history or AP uh US history. It's 75 hours. And they're like, oh, I got, you know, 15 hours left to get a five. And so, you just change the concept that these, you know, now there's some upper bound where there is, you know, conceptual understanding and everybody can't get there. But K through8 curriculum, what would change education in America? We can totally do this. So, let's now talk about the AI piece, which we haven't really explicitly talked about. And and you you you you said something to me once that I think was actually remarkable, which which you used you compared it to medicine, right? You compared education to medicine in terms of an unlock. So, so talk a little bit about that.

[01:06:09] You know, if you go back, you know, to um the sciences, right? And whether it's biology or medicine, chemistry, physics, all of these had periods in the wilderness, I'm sure doctors bloodletting and things like this. But there was the invention of an instrument, right, in each of those that allowed more precise measurement that unlocked and inflected the science, right? And medicine had theirs. I don't know which one you thought.

[01:06:38] I think I Yeah. When I've heard you discuss this, I think it's the light microscope. If you were going to talk about one instrument that took us from what would what I describe as the dark ages of medicine 1.0 into medicine 2.0 which is where we are today that inflection point came primarily around without the light microscope it couldn't have happened. Sid Muker wrote very eloquently about this in his most recent book, The Cell. But basically, until we could actually start to see microscopic organisms, we couldn't really handle germ theory, right?

[01:07:09] And until we could eradicate germ theory, we couldn't really live past about 40 on average, right? There were just too many people dying too young. And so that one piece of technology unleashed an entire change in the way medicine has been practiced which of course has spread out far beyond infectious diseases but but that's I I think it's impossible for me to imagine a scenario whereby we are alive today in the way we are without that right so and so when you when you look at AI that learning science these papers have been written for 40 years but they all start with this doesn't work with a teacher in front of of a classroom timebased model, right? You need to change it up.

[01:07:52] So, you had the solution, you had the conceptual solution for the last 40 years on how to fix education, right? But there's been no technology to make it happen. You can't microscope. You we haven't had our microscope. And AI is finally that microscope because of a couple things. The first is, you know, before, you know, your effect size when you put an experiment, you know, into a classroom, you're like, well, is the teacher teaching it correctly? you know, is it, you know, using space repetition correctly? Are the students engaged? You know, do they have the prerex? You just don't know. And so your environmental variables dominate your effect size. And with AI, right, you could you get two things. You get absolutely precise teaching. You know exactly what is being told to the kid. And then second, you have this closed loop measurement. You can measure what do they know and what they don't know. And so you know the prere, you know all of it. And then you can create you can do science you can create this closed loop. So our system right we rolled out our new system time back you know to the student to to all our all our students this year a couple weeks ago and like our math curriculum we believe this year is going to be uh better kids will learn more in 20% less time and we know that because we've been measuring it and we looked on last year's math and we're able to say okay we have this idea okay the kids what percent learned were they 95% rate how long did it take each kid to go through the lesson, what do we need to change?

[01:09:21] What learning science concept can we put in the lesson, right? That's going to then allow them to learn better and faster and what's going to change the scheme of their brain, you know, not cramming, but really understanding this. And then, okay, they took the standardized tests. Oh, look, it did work, right? And you can just create this closed loop system where you're able to do science, right? And that be nobody else has that. And that's the that's the problem, right? is we need to create that system but to do that you have to give up like the most treasured notion in the world which is the key to good education is a teacher in front of a classroom right one of the things that's true about education you know 200 years ago before there was tutors right you had you know Socrates and Plato and

[01:10:06] Aristotle and Alexander the great and all the elite had tutors right and then 200 years ago like we have to educate everybody the only way cost-effectively to do that is teacher in front of a classroom And that is all any of us know, our parents know, our grandparents know. We've all been in that. And it did great things because at scale we have educated people that never would have been educated before because what fra I mean I wouldn't have I wouldn't have been one of the tutored ones.

[01:10:31] Correct. Right. And it is and you can go to the poorest school district in India and there's a teacher in front of a classroom, not a very nice building. You can go down to whatever private school that's charging you $50,000 teacher in front of a classroom in a very nice building. But that model is all we know and we think and great teachers matter. And this is always the part with our new model and

[01:10:52] AI tutors that I I I want to take a second here because people get freaked out. Adults 20 years from now parents are going to drop their kids off at a building and in that building are going to be other kids and adults. And those adults you can call them teachers, guide, coaches, whatever you want. You know, we think the day will be very different. But that concept of a school with teachers and other students, that's not going away. We're not moving to this

[01:11:22] AI robot terminator, you know, whatever. That's not that's not what's coming. Kids are going to you're going to drop the kids off at a school, right? And it's going to now if we do our job right, you don't sit in class for six hours a day and have this miserable experience that kids love it and all of those. But back to the the science of it, we now with AI, right, can have a one-on-one relationship. The AI knows what does the kid know? What do they not know? How do I give them this lesson?

[01:11:51] And if you look and if you want to talk just about where we're headed, the future is even, you know, Gen AI is changing everything. That was the the part for me that I saw which is I can craft personalized lessons for every kid that takes into account you know what goes into the LLM sort of on the technology side you have what what are you trying to teach them what's the curriculum what is their knowledge graph what do they know and what do they not know what is their interest graph right what are they interested in because actually if I know your interests I can engage it oh you want to learn baseball I You love baseball and you want to learn stats.

[01:12:33] I'm going to term it in that and kids are going to get engaged. Do it. Oh, you're the fashionista who's, you know, I'm going to teach you fractions. Is the app already able to do what you just described? So, where we are today in 2025, we generate static content with human review because we still have too many hallucinations.

[01:12:51] Okay. And so, we're not we're not there. Now, in 2026, we expect we'll be able to do it. There is one meaning just to make sure I'm putting this in perspective. So, my 8-year-old, who is that kid who loves baseball, and all he does is talk baseball stats. He's a literally, he is a walking baseball statistic.

[01:13:09] Do you know so and so hit 326 and this many home runs? And do you know he was able to hit 477 feet blah blah blah. So, he will be able to get to know his AI tutor. They will figure out in short order that the way to his heart is baseball. And anything that you can teach in baseball terms, he's fixated.

[01:13:28] Exactly. And AI will be able to give him a lesson to to pursue mastery, but under the guise of baseball. Under baseball. Right. Amazing. And it's just and we all know this, which is you're always that's what teachers are always trying to do is how do I get what the kids like and associate with it. But at scale, you don't have 30 kids who like all the same things, you know, etc.

[01:13:50] So here's an example of what you can actually do today. There's if you um we have a there so static you know you have hallucinations and so you don't you don't want to release those yet but we have a dynamic um reading generator it's called teach tales and the goal of this is to get kids to love to read. So if you take a third grade boy who's like I hate books right I hate books I'm not a book guy and you're like what's your favorite movie? Uh the Avengers. Who are your soccer buddies? Okay. And you create the AI generates a choose your own adventure where you're saving the world with your soccer buddies and you know they have to keep clicking each be an Avenger and EP1 and literally and the Lexile level right the difficulty goes up it knows right so it's keeping you in the zone of proximal development within 10% of you know what you know your Lexile level kids will sit there and click for an hour right just totally engaged non-stop reading non-stop and just all of a sudden you know because we do have a reading problem in this country people don't read books and all these

[01:14:52] This is the kind of thing where Gen AI is going to be able to suck kids in, right? And you know, our competition is Fortnite and Tik Tok, right? And we need to use things like Gen AI to create such compelling content for kids that's related to what they care about. That also teaches, okay, I got to teach you fractions, but we're doing this baseball thing, so you're fine, right? You love that. Um, you know, there's a whole program that a lot of people in finance where, you know, uh, and there's there's actually a program where they have a mother daughter thing back to a different way to try to solve it without an AI tutor where there's all these finance moms who teach their daughters poker in middle school and they're like,

[01:15:33] I'm going to get them into poker to teach all these skills and the math skills and all the things that aren't being taught in my school. But with us, we can get that engagement level where the kids are interested in it. And to give you a couple examples and I'll use uh some of our high school kids. So, you know, when you transfer into, you know, uh Alpha High, your knowledge of history is very limited, which is if it's in the musical Hamilton, you know, it occurred.

[01:16:02] And if it didn't occur, you know, if it's not in a song in Hamilton, you don't know it, you know, because we don't teach history very much anymore. And but all the kids know Hamilton. They all sing songs. So our our US history, AP world history, they literally used AI. They did this on their own. It wasn't our stuff. They used AI to generate here's all the facts. You know, there's nine units in US history. For each unit, they created a song and they said, give me all the facts that I need to know for this unit. And they pumped it into Sumo, which is an available, you know, song generator. And they got they created just their own album of songs.

[01:16:40] And they all would just sit around and sing the songs and, you know, learn the facts that way and do it in a way they all were very interested in, right? And they all got fives on their AP because you can do it to mastery and and so Gen AI is going to allow us to create this awesome dynamic content that's relatable, you know, and focused on what or uh applicable to what kids want. The other part is you know there's a learning science concept also builds a van frameworks of you know the fastest way to learn is basically analogy and so do you have a knowledge graph right this is the a in the ABC so so Dean

[01:17:15] Schwarz's book which I guess we're going to link to that in in the show notes goes through a toz everything that learning science has come up with exactly right so he has so Dean Schwarz from Stanford right school of education one of the leaders in the field right has written a book and he's like here it is you know um and every letter has a different one but this one a is analogy is one of the ones I remember and analogies right where that's the fastest way to learn and so if you know what a kid knows like part of we have a content team when I talk about those hundred facts ideas and concepts per hour what they're using as reference is they're using Tik Tok memes as cuz kids know Tik Tok right and they know what's on Tik Tok and you're like well let's take what we're trying to teach them and use something they already know And that's actually the fastest way to have kids learn concepts. And so those are all coming. Then even when you talk even further, the part we don't have in yet, but you know, our our team's working on it is we also take into account, we will be taking into account the cognitive load, right? This of their brain, which is we know we're going to be able to create a lesson that where we know how many working memory slots you have. We know what you know to fluency and what you don't. and we're not going to give you a question that's going to overload your working memory or we also know how many reps you need, right? And GT kids need fewer reps and so we're not going to bore you by giving you too many reps to memorize it. Conversely, we're going to make sure you have enough reps if if you need them. And so this personalized learning where you're generating the content dynamically um I is going to be just this crazy unlock for these kids. Um, and you know, five years from now, everybody's going to look back and be like, "Okay, well, obviously, you know, kids can learn 10 times faster." You know, it's we're we wake up every day and they're just like, you know, it's like Neo in the Matrix, right? Where that's a physical upload.

[01:19:07] Ours is, right? Using learning science concepts, kids can learn 10 times faster. And when you think about that, you have 12 years, right? You have 12 years to fill your kids' head with cool stuff, knowledge, right? because they have to hang out in that right in their brain for the the rest of their life.

[01:19:26] And we've allocated 12 years to fill it up. We just need two hours a day at 10 times faster. And all the kids can have more stuff and more cool stuff about stuff they like in their heads to mastery level levels none of us as as parents could ever imagine, right? And still give the kids their time back for the rest of the day to do all other things. about three years ago you sort of decided like that you know you got to step out of trilogy right like it's this incredible company you've built um are any of your co-founders still there I think it's you're you're sort of are they no so I people who've been so three years ago sort of the transition was when Gen AI came out right which was three years ago neural nets are here finally and you know that was an unlock for me where I had seen McKenzie's great school and seen, you know, my kids in there and there were issues like my daughter failing her seventh grade test and stuff where the apps aren't good enough, you know, and all those issues and I'm like, Genai will allow us to take the magic of alpha, make it better, and scale it to a billion kids, right? Because there's there's lots of good educational things that just don't scale. And so what this was was my realization.

[01:20:41] This was your light microscope. This was it. Light microscope's here. Okay. I've been doing software. So I went to my team who've been there for 25 years. I'm like, "Guys, for 25 years you've been telling me you're better than me. We'll see. I'm going to go be a principal." And so they run it. You know, I'm now, you know, chairman and I am now literally the worst shareholder you've ever seen. Cuz I'm like, "Guys, I need more cash flow. I need more dividends to fund this whole thing. You know, Mackenzie needs $300 a million dollars to open up all these schools. You know, where are we going to, you know, get it for her?" So, so how much of your money have you spent on this now?

[01:21:18] So, I took on three years ago, I took a billion dollars out of Trilogy sort of as my first lump sum and said, I'm going to go use this billion dollars to figure out what I can with education and fix as much as I can. Now, what's crazy about that is a billion dollars is not enough to fix education. It's a trillion dollar industry and we obviously have made incredible headway, but we have to go back to building schools, right? Back to

[01:21:44] Mackenzie, she's opening up, you know, 25 schools, 25 alphas around the country, right? She needs hundreds of millions of dollars for that. We're opening up these sportsmies, which needs hundreds of millions. We're opening up 500 gifted, talented schools, right? So, you know, the total capex that's going to be required. The second part is I'm going to do this the next 20 years, right? I got 20 years in this, right? My job is to go fix education, right? and make get it to a billion kids and give kids their time back, right? Change change use the light microscope, use AI to totally change the first 12 years of, you know, a billion kit.

[01:22:21] Now, at what point, Joe, do the two systems have to merge? Because one of the reasons that you're having to deploy such insane amounts of capital is because you're basically rebuilding things that are technically already there. I mean, we have buildings, we have schools, we have guides, they're called teachers, we have all those things, but you're creating a new system of infrastructure. But I assume you don't want to scale.

[01:22:44] You don't want to have to build the scale to a billion. At some point, this way has to merge with the existing way. At what point does that merger take place? Well, my view is there's a point of if I had perfect randomized control trials with, you know, back to a billion kids. I don't know, do I need 10 million kids going through it for everybody to be like, okay, this looks like it works.

[01:23:10] But the bar is so low. I mean, I guess that's the thing that's amazing to me, right? And I think about um places in medicine, right, where massive clinical trials are necessary to to to change the direction of something. Usually when the state of play is so bad. So let's let's talk about an example which again I don't use this example to be offensive offensive to people that are within education, right?

[01:23:35] But like let's look at HIV in the 80s and early 90s. It was a death sentence. Like the bar was pretty darn low when heart therapy highly anti high highly active antiretroviral therapy came out in 95 or 96 and that I mean that's it like boom we just changed the protocol now of course pharma is easier than education in the sense that it's you know a simple intervention it's a you know but who's pushing back right when you say hey guys what if we just prove this out in a million kids Right.

[01:24:10] Like why do I need 10 million kids to prove especially with Yeah. Especially if they're spread out over a broad enough socioeconomic background. Exactly. And so back to that's my sort of our next phase, right? And why I'm doing my first podcast in 20, you know, years is that uh there's a lot of there's a lot of impediments to it. Let's go back to that discussion of parents don't care about academics. So, we'll start there and

[01:24:39] I'll we'll do that. Second, believability. There's been edtech pitches, right? Everybody every five years, edtech's going to solve the world. And, you know, technology is always going to solve the world and it doesn't solve it. And so, there is good well-earned natural skepticism of, you know, there's a lot's just go let's just and let's just take it right.

[01:25:00] Evil billionaire tech guys trying to fix education are the right the it's a meme. No, it's a meme like make a movie. And so the skepticism should be super high, right? And it is. And so that's part of what the job is and why it takes a billion dollars to we have to go prove it across every right across everybody. Um, and in a broad way. So completely agree with that. But let's talk about some of the problems with it, which is, you know, let's talk about academics right here in Austin, right?

[01:25:33] There's there's been three failing middle schools in Austin, right? And you know, I look at if I was a superintendent of a school or principal of a public school. I mean, like I I want to be really clear that's like a hundred times harder job than mine because, you know, I'm a product guy. People who come to my school are aligned with what I'm building and my offering cuz it's you get selection effects.

[01:25:55] People come to Alpha are like, I know I'm going to have screen time for two hours cuz if you don't, you don't come right. But at public school, you know, these two schools are Fs for five years. They're not educating the kids. And the superintendent, you know, he made his first proposal, whatever, months ago. He's like, "Well, why don't we shut these schools and we have these a better schools right by and the kids just go to the school where the kids are learning, you know, and literally the protests that have been from parents, you know, and it's, you know, and you listen to them, you know, and you know, it's the mom who's just like, "Look, I know that seventh grade math teacher. she's probably not teaching math very well, but my older daughter had her and that she changed her life and so you know what and my kids can walk to school and it's community and so if they don't learn seventh grade math so much so what and so the you know the superintendent you know he's you know you if you take into account the community feedback which they're supposed to all of a sudden you have parents who are like I care about other things cuz school's a bundle and so that makes this hard so there's one just do they even want it the second is obviously just skepticism ism of this doesn't really work and you know why don't we do randomized control tiles or pharmaceutical caliber stuff with education because there's all these ideas of what work we we have a lot of ideas that we're rolling out like no multiplication tables that somebody should have done control child to realize that's a really bad idea right and so all these fads in education because it's not science right the learning science is not if you actually ask one of the scariest data points if you want this go. There's 3 million teachers in the world. They're not taught learning science.

[01:27:33] They're not taught learning science. And so, you know, these concepts will be new to them. And so, back to how do we fix it? We have to go teach all the all the teachers about learning science. Do do you get push back on that point? Do you do you get I mean, how much time do you spend talking with the teachers that are in the trenches right now? Um, I'll give you an analogy from my world, right? So, you know, I talk about this idea of medicine 3.0, right? So, we're medicine 2.0 has been amazing. Like, it's an amazing run. You and I wouldn't be alive without it. Literally, we would be dead by now. Um, but I would argue like it's time to move on. We've plateaued. Like, we got to do medicine 3.0, right? We have to unlock the next thing. Um, but when I say that, I'm not being critical of the doctors who practice medicine 2.0 cuz I haven't met many of them who wouldn't in a heartbeat say, "Look, I wish I could do medicine 3.0, but the system I'm in doesn't allow it.

[01:28:27] I can't get reimbursed to practice medicine 3.0. I the entire system of billing and coding and diagnostics and prescribing, it's all predicated on this system. Uh it's predicated on make the diagnosis for the disease, treat the there's no prevention. I I I I don't get paid to, nor do I have the education to learn about nutrition, exercise, all of these other things that are necessary in medicine 3.0. But if I could wave a magic wand, my bet is 80% of them would be like if there's a way to fix the system and the structure such that I can be balancing my practice between 2.0 and 3.0, I do in a heartbeat.

[01:29:05] Do you have a sense? Have you got enough reps with teachers to understand if you had that that proverbial magic wand? How many of the superintendents and the teachers would say, "Oh my god, I'd love to be to transition from being a front of the classroom um teacher to an in the classroom guide who's helping the student with the AI with their personal

[01:29:26] AI tutor." Correct. So the answer is it is at least 80% like same example which is teachers. No, no, because we have you know our guides, right? They're ex-teers, right? I mean, and we got into this whole name naming thing, but you know, do you call them teachers if they're not doing academics and and what whatnot? But fundamentally, you know, when they tell their story of what they do all day and let's just talk about teachers specifically, right? Teachers are great and critical and teacher in front of the classroom is bad, right? That's it's and it's the but to your point, it's the system that's very similar analogy. It's the same thing where you know teachers right they got into teaching to transform kids' lives. They did not become a teacher to grade the seventh grade science test right and so let the

[01:30:13] AI do the seventh grade lesson and the science test and you connect with your kid right your students. So during our two-hour blocks, we do 25minute pomodoros, right? Our guides, ex-teers who don't, they're not in front of the class lecturing. They literally take the kids one on- one, you know, and say, "Hey, don't do you know your uh language today. Come sit down and talk to me for 25 minutes. How was your weekend? How'd the softball tournament go? Hey, you don't seem as motivated lately. What's going on?" And they connect with them, right? And they're the ones right our guides do to right they provide motivational and emotional support. They set high standards and high support. They're the ones guiding these kids right through the journey. And that's why teachers became teachers, right? They didn't I I want to write a lesson plan. Nobody woke up and said that's why I'm becoming a teacher. They did it because they want to transform kids' lives. And that's what this new model does, right? And so when they see it, they love it. Right?

[01:31:14] So that's what you know we one we pay more but also the parent the kid the teachers see our model and once they really understand it and talk to our existing ones they're like this is awesome I love this and so there isn't resistance now at the systems level you know so I've talked to a lot of superintendent and they're like what what do you want me to do with this what am I supposed to do they're like I to our what do the kids do the rest of the day right this is the problem. This when you talk about it, this is a rebuild around the school day.

[01:31:48] Yep. It's not six hours a day in class, right, with teachers and moving kids between class. Two hours a day of learning in the screen and four hours a day of life skills, work, sports, and all the sorts of other things that are going to be imperative to create well balanced kids, right? And you know, our life skills curriculum is leadership, teamwork, storytelling, public speaking, right? relationship building, socialization, right? Grit and hard work, entrepreneurship, financial literacy, right? Those things. And they're doing workshops in the afternoon, right?

[01:32:20] They're, you know, this is if you go to Mackenzie's Instagram, it's, you know, kids climbing rock walls, you know, in kindergarten or they're running 5Ks in second grade or the fifth graders launched a food truck, you know, and so there's all these different things running tough mutters eighth or eighth graders, you know, do that stuff. And so you're like, if you're a superintendent, you're like, "Okay, my system's not set up for this." And there's just there's no end right now. There's no demand from the parents because it's it's not proven. It's not obvious. And even and let's even get out of public school, okay? Let's go just talk about super high-end private schools, right? You can go down the street and try to get convince this super high-end private school and say, "You have all the flexibility you want. There's no vote.

[01:33:00] There's nothing. You should transform." and they're like, "Oh my, this seems like a bridge too far." Right? And so that's why my my view of my job. So is that why essentially Alpha exists as an independent school at the moment is you just need to get the scale of wholly owned alphas that that build this out and at some point the others probably the private schools have an easier time joining the model. Yeah. And and and eventually the hope is of course the the public schools do so as well.

[01:33:32] Exact everybody. So I got 20 years and I got to get a billion kids. So you got to, you know, 80 90% of kids are in public school. You got to get it to public school and provide it to everybody. What What is the current cost to cuz I'm sure you're hemorrhaging and losing money at the moment. What is the current cost to deliver uh the education to a school to a child and does it vary by their grade like a middle school?

[01:33:56] Stepping back and so for our job is and that's why we're opening across country in every city there's going to be this alpha exemplar, right? the high-end where you're like this is what's possible now it's also one where it's money no object it's really expensive and back to the things today my AI I'm using the latest models is you know we're real time streaming video to to coach kids you know it's 10,000 bucks a kid and so it's $10 per kid per year in just AI just in the AI cost it's too much now

[01:34:25] I absolutely believe and our our team's going to deliver it where you know sometime in the next three years maybe five. You know, everybody on the planet will have a tablet that's less than $1,000 that will teach them everything they need to know in 2 hours a day or less. And the compute will be what do you think?

[01:34:43] Local. It'll be local. It'll be local. Yeah. So, you'll be on device. Like a lot of our stuff right now is vision models where we're looking stuff. You there's ondevice and the all the hardware manufacturers are putting their AI chips on device where we're we'll hit that. Wow. Um, and so you know, and and I'm sure there's still be some stuff in the cloud for higherend stuff, but you what the Common Core curriculum through 8th grade on device less than $1,000. That's absolutely coming. Uh, and then and then then the second part is, you know, and part of what Alpha is is because it's this high-end expensive stuff, you're like, let's reinvision what a school is from the ground up, right? So we sit around, you know, I'm a product I'm like what makes what would make a school 10 times better than you know old school that that we went to you know and so we we sort of have five dimensions that we do and the first is kids must love school and we literally measure more than vacation like that has to be it and we get 50ish% of kids depends on the vacation depends on the workshop if it's really good 50% of kids who are like yeah I want to I want to go to school instead of vacation I have plenty of parent well my highlight as a principal because, you know, in in May uh this year, twothirds of the high school kids sent me a note and they're like, "Can we keep Alpha High open this summer cuz we don't want to take a summer break cuz we love what we're doing." Right? The girl doing her, you know, Broadway musical. She's like, "This is I I want to keep coming to school and doing it, right?" And so, you know, we're, you know, back to my world where I was not into school. I was, you know, sherking and my dad, you know, I'm like, "Make a place where kids love school." Um, and vacation's a good standard. Number two, kids need to learn 10 times faster. We just we need an engine that teaches kids 10 times faster. And so our AI tutor based on learning science teaches kids 10 times faster, right? And between five and 10 and we'll get it up and you know, so that's the second part so that you can then that gives you the chance to give the time back. The third dimension of a school is what are if you academics isn't everything, right? To developing kids everybody knows that. What are the life skills that every parent says that is what I wish I knew? And some are, you know, traits, behavioral traits. I hope they they are love learning and are self-driven learner, right? You want things like that. And I want somebody who uplifts others in his classroom and behavioral and is an independent person.

[01:37:09] Others are like those ones I talked about where you're like, "No, I want entrepreneurisism and financial literacy or I want storytelling, public speaking, those those type skills." And so the third is have that curriculum, the suite of skills, the suite of skills that every parent wants. So we actually have spent, you know, the last three years developing life core, right? The common core curriculum for life skills that cuz I have four hours a day to fill, right, with all this awesome stuff that kids can do. And it's just amazing what they do. Like if you take Atomic Habits, right, that book of 1% better, most people don't read that till after college, right? And then they're like, "Oh, this is a way I can really develop." Last year, you know, our guide

[01:37:51] Faith second grade guide, you know, she sat down and she was working on her her workshops, you know, her life skills. She's like, "You know what? I want to teach atomic habits to all the second graders because the concepts they all can understand." And she's like, "You know how I'm going to do it?" I'm like, she's like, "I'm going to have all our second graders run a 5K in under 35 minutes."

[01:38:14] And that interest I'm like oh no okay the parents are not gonna like that right that's too hard back to high standards they don't want struggle fail it where's that road to success part and what percent are going to make it and so I was she's like don't worry it's to I can do this she was a UT athlete and she's like we totally can do it she was a like a head cheerleader or whatever she's like everybody can do this and so she sits down with the second graders first day and is who who can run a 5K? And they're all like, "That's impossible,

[01:38:47] Miss Faith." The parents all are like, "That's impossible, Miss Faith." She's like, "Well, I signed you all up for the jingle 5K, you know, at the domain." And so she goes out to the track and the first day they walk it and they walk 5k. She's like, "Okay, so we all established you're going to finish the race, right?

[01:39:04] And then the next time they ran a quarter lap, walk the rest. Next time half a lap, walk the rest." And by December, right, all the kids are running the race, right? And you know, when they cross the finish line, just that achievement back to the key to your kids happiness is high standards. That's a really high standard, but they loved it. And they did have to struggle and go through and learn this, but they also learned that life skill of 1% better, right? And so the second graders like, "Dad, I can do anything. I can do 50 push-ups. I'll do one today and two tomorrow." And, you know, build up. And that skill, that life skill, we don't teach kids in school. It's a great life skill to have. And if you have half the day, you can do that. So that's the third element of like how do you build a great a great school. The fourth element, and this gets to the teachers, what would make a teacher 10 times better than what it is today? And the answer is well, not grading science tests all day and you know, writing lesson plans, but instead connecting mentorship with the kids, right? And so we ask here's the questions we ask you know the students and the parents which is to kids you know you know kindergarten we're like do you love your guide right and but you know as you get older it's every adult had one or two teachers who transform their life right back to that is your guide that for you right and that is what our guides right that is the expectation that they are the ones that the students are like you are helping me achieve things that I didn't think is possible miss faith you told me, taught me how to do the impossible, right? And so that right that level and actually then you know at the parent side this gets into you know Dr. Joerger um you know has a book 10 to 25 right child psychologist development expert and it's you know from kids how to uh what matters for kids right from 10 to from 10 years old to 25 right and uh his whole theory mentor mindset you know high standards high support the the heart most parents are not high standards and high support which is what really matters to developed kids They're either low standards, high support. That's what happened to all our expectations. Or they're the inverse, high standards, no support. You know, this would be your classic, you know, tiger mom would be, you know, good luck. Figure it out, right? And the real answer for child development, you need both. High standards, high support. And so that's our guides. But the question we ask parents in middle and high school, right? Back to having what's a school reinvisioning it. It's like, do you trust your alpha guide to hold high standards for your kid so you as the parent can provide the unconditional love and support, right? Which transforms for those who've had adolescence, it transforms your relationship where you don't have to be the naggy parent for the high the high standards. You know, my daughter, my oldest daughter, you know, she's writing her college essay and I'm like, "You want to let me read it?" And she's like, "No." Right. No interest in that.

[01:42:09] Yeah. She's got she's got it taken care of. She's got someone else. And for me, I was super relaxed because I was like, I know Chloe, right? Back to our guide, right? She's a Harvard grad. I know she was to totally high standards for for my daughter and I know it's going to be fine and I don't have to get in a fight about it or whatever. I'm just like, okay. Yeah, I can give my daughter a hug and be like, "Good luck, right?" And so that transforms what teachers can be, right? versus I'm delivering those seventh grade lessons.

[01:42:37] And so, you know, and then the fifth dimension that we talk about is the C's, character, community, classmates, and culture. And these are also the hardest parts to measure, but at the end, they're what parents care about the most, right? Which is at the end of the day, all those other you don't character, right? Is do I have a good kid? Did I raise a good kid? Right? And is the school helping me make right raise a good kid? And so those elements are what we looked at and said now that you want to reinvision school right from the ground up. Here's the dimensions.

[01:43:11] And so Alpha is trying to be the exemplar you know for for all of it. And then the question is okay how do we get the price point down right? So we have opened a whole set of different schools right at half the price of Alpha right so Alpha depending on its location is between4 and $75,000 right? Um but we've opened although there's scholarship programs ton Oh so tons so we have a huge scholarship so you know we have a school down in Brownsville right where it's a second poorest school district um we have in Texas

[01:43:43] Brownsville is the second poorest school district in the country you know and at that school it's you know SpaceX uh is there so Starbase so you have a bunch of SpaceX kids and then we scholarship all the locals to come in and it's we're 6040 50/50 between that makeup and to be here. They all learn 2x in two hours, right? There's not a right back to where we we tested it out. It works with all kids.

[01:44:08] So, so I want to read you something that is fits right into this. So, this is um I think I read this in the New York Times. Before kindergarten, the children of the affluent are much more likely to be in preschool. By sixth grade, students in the richest school districts are four grade levels above children in the poorest school districts. That's just by sixth grade. By high school, richer kids average reading skills are five years ahead of poorer kids. By college, according to a 2017 study by

[01:44:40] Raj Chetty, children from the richest 1% of earners are 77 times more likely to go to Ivy League schools than children from families making $30,000 a year or less. Um, the academic gap between the affluent and less affluent is greater today than the achievement gap between white American and black American kids in the final days of Jim Crow. In other words, my read of this is that there is no greater predictor of academic success and failure than the wealth of your parents.

[01:45:20] So are you really suggesting that that could be wiped out? Wiped out. I there's always relative versus absolute and I believe we can raise the absolute standard right and maybe it's always an arms race and you know that and so but if you said today can we take where people are years behind instead of the gap being 77x could that gap be 1.2x whatever 100%.

[01:45:52] And the back to that issue cuz here's what what happens, right? You're in a rich school district, right? And I was up in New York and you know these are $75,000 private schools a teacher in front of a classroom. But every one of those parents also was spending $750 an hour on a tutor after school cuz the school wasn't teaching them back to that problem. But an extra 75 grand tutoring them 150 grand a year, right? And you right. Yeah, you need the tutor who's going to go back and fill the holes and stuff. And no, if I am in a school district, right, and I'm a poor school district, I I'm not I'm not I don't have the tutor. I don't have the access to that, right? You know, if you look in after COVID, right, the number one intervention and you know, a lot of government funding was spent to this was high dosage tutoring. Everybody knows this, right? It's not a secret. It's just it's expensive to give, you know, individualized tutoring. And there was a study that came out a few weeks ago or a month ago that was like it was really working and then sometimes it it they did some, you know, as it expanded out, it did less well. And the difference was when it was really working, it was one-on-one and then they started to say to save money, they had six one. And tutoring six to one is not right. It's not individualized. becomes a class driven, right? It's just that's the issue with, you know, if you have 30 kids, you can't generate an unending stream of content at 80 to 85% accuracy based on what the kid learns.

[01:47:24] It has to be one-on-one. It's just and it just that is the delta is for each kid. It's personalized learning. A personalized lesson plan is what every kid needs. And so and and I believe that if you get all the learning scientists together and say yes AI is the light microscope, don't you agree? And can we create a program, right, that's available to everybody, right?

[01:47:49] Then and I think they'd all say yes. Yes, we can. And that the the the the software is not insurmountable. Right? I believe we could do a you know I was actually talking to Stanford has their Stanford Accelerator for Learning which is you know how and Dean Schwarz runs it and I was like you know we could probably create an X-P prize right for an open-source available to everybody right you need you also need better credible people than me you you don't need me saying this you need Dean

[01:48:22] Schwarz and Stanford and the Ivy League right the people that everybody looks up to in education in America and saying we know this, we know this learning science, we can run, right? We can take Stanford CS and AI department with the learning science, right? And put that together and create this project, right, for not that much money that we can then get to every kid, right, and get it into every public school, right? They have the relationships with all the teachers where, you know, they don't need the randomized control trial or the skepticism you'd obviously get from talking to me. So, I this is all very doable. You know that's that is this mission we have.

[01:48:58] What is the biggest risk right now? Is it the equivalent of what we call market risk where it's just adoption? It's just it's the leap of faith that we can somehow abandon the only model any of us know or is there still technology risk embedded within the AI that says yeah I mean there is still some technology risk but that's literally like you can ratchet down and you don't have to be 10 times learner but could we get them three times five times today with more static versus some of the cool dynamic stuff that yes you could right but it's are you willing to change the motivational model for the kids? Are you willing to tell the kid use this app and I'll give you your time back? Are you willing to say you don't have to sit in class for six hours a day? Right? It's it's the rebuild that's the problem. Right? When we if you take our software, our magic

[01:49:50] AI tutor, right? Whatever it is, and you put it in a standard classroom and the kid has to sit there for six hours a day, I can promise you it won't work. It will not work. And so that's the issue is are you really willing back to what Brian told me a decade ago. Are you really willing to say kids must love school?

[01:50:09] Are you really willing and then go rebuild your school system around that? Because if they do, they're going to engage in the app, right? They're going to you're going to give them their time back to do stuff they love. Is that all are you going to make those changes? Because it isn't an edte solution. It's not go build this edte, drop it, and it's going to work. That's just we have that. Those apps do generally work, right? And to get the real revolution, you need to say, are we going to rebuild what we think K through 12, the first 12 years of kids' lives are? And if that's true, then the sky is the limit. And what we're obviously doing is trying to say, look at this. Look at these examples. Right? Because parents parents need I've learned as a principal, they need two things to want to change the school. Remember, I was skeptical for two years, right? I'm I'm I'm the average parent, you know, was they need a reference from an adult they trust.

[01:51:04] How's it working for your kid? Did it work for your kid? And second, they need to see the kid do something at the school that their kid can't do, right? And if you have that, that's actually the magic that unlocks, you know, a parent saying, "Okay, I'm going to go I'm going to move to this new model."

[01:51:20] And you know what? What it is that the kid can't Oh, he loves school. Oh my god. He wakes up in the morning. you know, he's waking me up so he's not late and he used to cry on the way to school or oh wow some parents are like I love the academic performance right or those life skills I really care about or he connects with his teacher so much more as guide you know cuz it is different and back to the choices like why we're opening all these different schools we have a gifted talented school right we have a sports academy school we have a wilderness school right where you're fishing and archery and you know farming uh you know we're going to be opening arts theater

[01:51:54] Parents want different things and kids want different things. And so it's showing these things that is going to be the connection that causes parents to say I, you know, I want this. And if you do, and you know, if a good example about motivation, you know, if you put the GT moms, you know, McKenzie has, you know, her roundts, the GT moms with the sports academy moms, gifted and talented.

[01:52:17] Gifted. Sorry, that's GT. Gifted and talented. And then the the the sports academy moms, you know, and they just look at each other like the other parent is, you know, off the rocker where, you know, the the sports academy mom's like, you know, my kid was just, you know, comes home just sweating from just running around all day and I literally throw them in the shower with their clothes on, you know, and the GT mom's like, okay, they were having a chess tournament in the afternoon and then we came home and continued it, right? And it's and and it depends on the motivation. Each kid's different, right?

[01:52:46] And all your kids are different and you everybody knows that. And you know, like when we ask like I sat down with at the guides, we're like, "Okay, how do we make these all better?" So on, you know, staff days, you know, cuz we have all the guides from all the different schools. And I'm like, "Okay, what's going to make kids really love school?

[01:53:02] How do we get it from 50 to 60 to 70 on Love School, the G GT guides are like more, they want a third power hour of academics, and they want Math Olympi, and all the other guides are groaning because they're like, "No, our students do not want more academics. they want sports or let's do a better workshop or you know what what it's going to be. And so the key on all of this is saying how do we you know focus school on making it awesome for kids right making it great.

[01:53:29] Have a culture where it is high standards high support where you have this magic unlock of they can learn 10 times faster which then enables you to give them the time back to do all these other things. Um but that's a big lift right that's why it's it's gonna take 20 years right. Um but I do believe that you know everybody every parent right the most important thing is raising your kids it's the same at a societal level right the most important thing a society does is raise its next generation and everybody cares about it and one thing I we spend enough money in this country or globally right that there's enough money to actually rearrange this and build an education system that's great for for the kids um you know 5% of GMPP right I mean at $7 trillion right that there is recognition at both the societal or parent level right that this is where we should spend money and we do

[01:54:30] Joe it's kind of amazing to think back you in the spring of 1989 you drop out of college to go start a software company obviously there's no way you could have imagined uh both the success you would have in that company, you know, creating a multi-billion dollar company and and along with it a fortune for yourself, but then somehow deciding right at your peak that you were going to completely walk away from that take that fortune and pour it into another endeavor that seems as far from anything as possible relative to what you what you what you what you started with. Um, look, I feel really fortunate to to that that you're starting this that you started this in Austin. Uh for the listener, I think I probably should have said this at the outset. You know, my daughter spent two years at Alpha. It was an absolutely exceptional experience for her. Really kind of experienced all the things you talk about, right? So showed up in what did she show up? She showed up in seventh grade. Shows up in seventh grade with the absolute negative story of, you know, I love reading. I love arts. I love these things. I'm a musician. I'm not I just don't do math and science. Like that's I know you did,

[01:55:40] Dad. That's not me. I can't do math. I never want to do math. Um I made the awful mistake of spending the past year trying to help her do math. That was a disaster. That only resulted in tears. Um, but it really I think what what appealed to me when we made that switch was it just seemed so entirely logical that the reason she was struggling was because there were things in third and fourth grade she never mastered. And I I really appreciated the compounding nature of that gap. And and it it just made sense.

[01:56:18] It really clicked. And so it wasn't a big leap of faith to say, "Oh, okay." Yeah. And I feel very fortunate that as just as you predicted, um, by the end of 8th grade, I mean, she was acing math and that has continued all through high school. She did go back to public high school. I think, you know, that's probably something you you do encounter is that there are kids that ultimately just want to be back in the big public high school. They want to play sports on the public, you know, in the public high school. they want to be, you know, and of course she's at a high school with a billion kids. Um, and she's very happy there, but I I don't think there's a chance I don't think there's a snowballs chance in hell she would be doing as well as she is if not for the fact that she had that 2-year sbatical to Alpha where she um really got to academically create a solid foundation. And I I will share one last anecdote here, which is um at her eighth grade graduation, she was in tears saying goodbye to her guides. To your point, it's think of what the impact of those guides were on her life. She loved those people. And you know, it's not that she doesn't like her teachers in high school, but she doesn't have that kind of relationship with them.

[01:57:34] Right. And uh back to you know you guys were I came in actually you know right then and uh Andy M who runs our academics you know uh since you since you brought her up wants to give her a call out because she spent hours with him going through lessons helping figure out why is this not working or what is it? And you know, one of the things when you're you're starting these new schools, you need the this concept of a founding family, right? And you know, your family was one of the most important and your support where you you got it. But your daughter, you know,

[01:58:11] Andy wanted to say, you know, thank you to her because she did go above and beyond where our lessons and all this learning science and this closed loop, you know, he's like, I'm way better because of the feedback and the time she spent with us. And so, um, you know, it is it is transformative to kids and to your point of high school, you're not if you want to be the quarterback on the

[01:58:34] Westlake team and run track, we don't have those in our high school. And so, we can get you prepared. You know, we say our middle school prepares kids for any high school, right? And so all our kids in middle school can get get their pick of high school that they want to go. And some want alpha, you know, alpha high, which is that, but some want, you know, the traditional play, but we hopefully have equipped them where they know they're a self-driven learner and can do it on their own.

[01:58:58] Yeah. I'll tell you that maybe the last story I I'll I'll I'll share Joe which is no surprise to you is it really doesn't matter what corner and I mean this literally what corner of this planet I am standing on when education comes up your name always comes up and this is these are people who don't know that I know you right they don't know that we are friends and I'll be I will be literally on the opposite side of this planet and if if I'm talking with anybody about education it's like what do you know about AI and education have you heard of this guy Joe Lemon at Alpha and it it's it comes up so often which tells me that it is getting out there.

[01:59:35] It is this is no longer just that little niche school downtown Austin. I mean it's hard to believe what has happened in 5 years. It went from one building, one place to how many now? Right. So we have we're now uh we opened 12 campuses this we'll be at 25 alpha campuses. We also have 25 non-alpha campuses where back to lower price points. You know, we have we have campuses open where, you know, it's charter, so it's free for kids. We have ones where it's $5,000 pay for the parents, $500 a month, you know, some at 20,000. So, we're trying to figure out back to innovating. We're like, what are the right price points and everything, but yes, you know, we expect 12 months from now there to be hundreds and hundreds of schools that use this model. Um, you know, uh, you know, the the demand for the sports academy is through the roof. Um, uh, and we think that's going to explode for sure.

[02:00:31] Well, Joe, I appreciate you taking your time to come out today, but of course, more than anything, I just appreciate what you're doing. And, and again, I know this is, you know, not something that necessarily fits into what we talk about on this podcast, but again, I don't think you can care about medicine, science, health, and not care about the foundation upon which it's built. And it all starts with education.

[02:00:50] So, um, you're you're working on such an important problem. And if there's one last thing I can do since I've obviously had a great career obviously before this and three years ago moved to education. If there's other people out there and one of the things if you're listening to this and you're excited, part of my job is let's go get more talent into education and I can tell you the last three years have been awesome and my next 20 years is going to be better than my last 20 years. And so, you know, if I can if I can convince you to come on in the water, what's the best way for because I guarantee you there's a million people listening to us. There's going to be a nonzero number of them are going to want to reach out to you. What's the best way to get a hold of you?

[02:01:28] Great. Literally, my email, which is Joe.lemont.school and send it to me and you know, I am overloaded right now. To your point, the hype has gotten very high about Alpha. Um, what should they what could someone who wants to get your attention put in the subject line? Heard you on the heard you on the drive podcast or something.

[02:01:50] I heard you on the drive podcast, right? And, you know, we're looking for, you know, all sorts of people. One, you want product people, you want engineers, you want everybody wants to come in. We have to go build, you know, we're building AIs, right? There's back to expansion. We need entrepreneurs where, you know, GT school needs 500 schools. We need entrepreneurs who are going to go expand it like it's, you know, a Chipotle chain, right? We need AI guys, right?

[02:02:14] I'm going out Silicon Valley where we we have to, you know, current chat bots aren't good. We have to make the LLMs better. Um, we need people we need educators, right? People who are like, okay, I want to do this new thing. Um, if you're one of the learning scientists that we don't have on our team, right, come do it. Right? that is we're if you're back to capital we're going to need a lot of capital as well to expand this if back to philanthropy right it's we need to be giving scholarships we're funding a lot of it but we need to make this available to everybody right we have to your problem it can't just be for the elite it's got to be for a billion kids so education touches everything and if you're just in where you're like that description where of what they're building I'm in then come aboard because it's awesome

[02:03:02] Joe. Alpha.com. We'll link alpha.school. Alpha.school. Okay. We'll put that in the show notes just so that people can click directly on it. Um Joe, thanks again. Wonderful as always. This is great. [Music]
