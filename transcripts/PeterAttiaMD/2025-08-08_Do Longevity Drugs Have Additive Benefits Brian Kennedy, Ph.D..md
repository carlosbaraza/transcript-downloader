This clip is from episode  #357 ‒ A new era of longevity science: models of aging, human trials of rapamycin, biological clocks, promising compounds, and lifestyle interventions | Brian Kennedy, Ph.D.

In this clip, they discuss:

- Designing a Longevity Drug Study – Hypothetical six-arm trial testing metformin, rapamycin, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 agonists in metabolically healthy middle-aged people
- Mechanisms of Action Questioned – The conversation explores whether these drugs benefit healthy individuals or only those with metabolic irregularities
- Lean Muscle Mass Concerns – Concerns about potential loss of lean muscle mass with some longevity drugs
- What Makes a Drug Truly Anti-Aging? – Whether correcting metabolic issues equates to slowing aging, or merely normalizing lifespan
- Additive vs. Confounding Effects – Combining drugs is likened to mixing 20 paint colors—more likely to create unpredictable outcomes than additive ones

## AI Summary

Here's my analysis of this clip from The Drive podcast with Brian Kennedy:

**1. Executive Summary**:
This discussion focuses on the comparative effectiveness of various longevity drugs and their potential additive benefits. Dr. Kennedy and Dr. Attia explore the efficacy of medications like metformin, rapamycin, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 agonists in healthy individuals. They particularly examine whether these interventions truly slow aging or merely normalize longevity in less healthy populations.

**2. Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Discussion of comparative effectiveness between metformin, rapamycin, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 agonists [00:00:00]
- Analysis of hemoglobin A1C levels and their correlation with mortality (5.0 vs 5.4) [00:04:23]
- Observation that combining multiple interventions often leads to cancellation rather than additive effects [00:06:24]

**3. Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Focus on optimizing glucose homeostasis through diet, sleep, and exercise [00:01:52]
- Try one or two interventions at a time rather than multiple simultaneous changes [00:06:24]

Risk/Benefit Considerations:
- GLP-1 agonists may cause concerning muscle mass loss [00:05:17]
- Higher lean muscle mass with slightly more fat may be preferable to low muscle mass [00:05:35]

**4. Supplements & Medications**:
Medications discussed:
- Metformin (skepticism about effectiveness) [00:00:25]
- Rapamycin [00:00:25]
- SGLT2 inhibitors [00:00:25]
- GLP-1 agonists [00:00:25]

**9. Notable Quotes**:
"If you're doing 10 things, you don't have any idea what's working and what's not working and whether things might be impairing each other." [00:06:47]

**10. Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are the specific mechanisms by which these drugs might work in metabolically healthy individuals?
2. How can we better measure the impact of combined interventions?
3. What is the optimal protocol for testing individual interventions while controlling for other variables?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] If we just took a population of middle-aged healthy individuals Yeah. and we we could design an experiment where you had the placebo arm, the metformin arm, the rapamy arm, the SGLT2 inhibitor arm, and the GLP-1 agonist arm. What is your prediction in length of life or additional years of life given in that six arm study or whatever it is?

[00:00:25] I I think the the the last three would be comparable. metformin I'm skeptical of. So, RAPA, SGLT2, GLP1. Yeah. I I just I we don't have data in healthy people that much with SGLT2 and and GLP1. I mean, so mechanism of action is what if these if the if the GLP1 group and the SGLT2 group are metabolically healthy, they don't have glucose excursions that are high. They're, you know, they're completely insulin. What is what do you believe is the mechanism of action? I guess you know if it I think I I guess

[00:00:56] I'm going by a different statement which is most people we're calling healthy are not totally metabolically healthy. Sure. Uh and so in those cases I think there would be a benefit but then I guess I don't know in the perfectly optimized person whether there'd be a benefit. And I I every time I talk to a doctor I ask them are you losing more lean muscle mass with these drugs than you are just by fasting or or or lifestyle? And I get if I ask 10 doctors I get 10 answers. So I don't know what the I don't know what the answer to that question is.

[00:01:24] But I think the reason that at least as a thought experiment it's an interesting question is because if the GLP1 agonist and SGLT2 inhibitors only work if you have some degree of um glucose irregularity. Yeah. Then it begs the question, well, it says, look, glucose homeostasis is one of the most important features of living, great. Yeah.

[00:01:52] Um, but if you could correct that with diet, sleep, and exercise, which you can. Yeah, I agree. You can. Um, it's hard, but it could be done. Uh, then those things aren't going after fundamental pillars of aging because people who eat well, who exercise well, and sleep well still age. Yeah. It's it's going it's answering you know Matt and I debate this all the time about you know and we did a we published a study in mice recently where we analyzed all the data that's out there in mice and um and we tried to determine you know how where's reality on interventions that extend lifespan in mice because if the shortlived if the control mice are really short-lived which happens a lot a lot why is that it's just really hard to control I mean if you look at the ITP P data the control mice are all over the board and they're very well controlled the best scientists doing the experiment we see a lot of variation too I I just think it's there are some cases they're bad vivariums and that may causes a problem but even in good vivariums

[00:02:58] I don't know it's true in every organism in yeast and worms one cohort of worms will all live a little bit shorter one cohort of worms will live a little bit longer it's cohort dependent but I don't know why uh but anyway the if the mice are short-lived, if your extension is there, all you can say is it's longevity normalizing.

[00:03:21] You don't know that it's slowing aging. It's only when the controls are really longived and you're getting extension that you can really make the argument it's longevity extending. And so that gets to your question. The real answer though is dependent on how many people you believe that are optimized right now because it's impossible to do the study.

[00:03:39] Yeah. No, no, of course it it it longevity normalizing works in this population, trust me. At least for health for for for keeping people healthy, but whether it's really slowing aging is a is a open question. I think I think the best case would be rapamy in there. Yeah. And and then of course it begs the question which is could these effects be additive?

[00:03:59] Right. So, so would there be a benefit to a person who is on balance quite healthy? But let's say their average gl let's say their hemoglobin A1C if it is indeed an accurate representation of their average glucose is 5.4%. So I don't know exactly what that translates to. It probably translates to an average blood glucose of 110 or so milligrams per deciliter.

[00:04:23] But the data there there are data that show based on hemoglobin A1C that lower is always better. So 5.0 is better than 5.4 even though 5.4 is deemed completely healthy. And that's AC that's all cause mortality data. So um we're saying we take a person who's at 5.4. They're not even pre-diabetic. They can't even they can barely see where pre-diabetic starts.

[00:04:45] Um let alone diabetic. But we give them an SGLT2 inhibitor. They come I'm at 5.4. Can I I can volunteer for this. There you go. So you go from 5.4 four down to 5.1 just on the basis of that drug. We throw a GLP-1 agonist on top of that. Now you're at 4.9. Um then we give you rapamy which really doesn't impact your glucose but we think it's going to do something a little bit different. Um you would say in that situation you might believe that there's some actual protection but not adding metformin.

[00:05:17] I don't want to lose muscle mass though. And which of those drugs would you be most afraid of? The GLP1 agonist or wrap-up? GLP1 agonist. Okay. I I think lean muscle mass is like super important. Yeah, it's probably better to have high lean muscle mass and be a little bit more fat than it is to be low on both is my best guess.

[00:05:35] Combining interventions, you know, first of all, I will say two things before I say what I'm going to say. One is that I believe we need to empower people to make decisions on their own health. And so I support hackers if they want to, you know, educate themselves and try different things and they know what the benefits and risks might be and what we know and we don't know. More power to them. I feel like part of the reasons we get such low compliance in medications is that we don't empower people. We don't give them choices. They don't know why they're doing things. We just tell them what to do and people don't respond well to that. So having said that, I can't pick three interventions that work well together. in in a mouse, you know, and we do these studies all the time. The thing they're more likely to cancel each other out than to have additive effects.

[00:06:24] And so if you're mixing 20 colors of or taking 20 pills, it's like mixing 20 colors of paint together. You're going to get some ugly gray outcome or at best you're going to get an unknown outcome that we can't predict. So I'm I'm really cautious and want to tell people that, you know, there are a lot of people out there promoting doing a million different things at the same time. I try one or two things at the same time and I

[00:06:47] I try to see how my body responds. I measure things, measure even simple measures are useful. Uh and I think that um if you're doing 10 things, you don't have any idea what's working and what's not working and whether things might be impairing each other. And I really think that's a scary path to go down. Now, what do you make of the data that I talk about all the time, which look at the hazard ratios for mortality based on high V2 max and high muscle mass and high strength and how those three things stand out so far above anything else. Um meaning like when you look at hazard ratios associated with smoking, type 2 diabetes, even cancer um they are not as lethal as being incredibly weak, incredibly low in muscle mass and incredibly low in fitness.

[00:07:44] And do you how much causality do you think is there versus how much of that is just those are just such good markers of health? I'm Peter.
