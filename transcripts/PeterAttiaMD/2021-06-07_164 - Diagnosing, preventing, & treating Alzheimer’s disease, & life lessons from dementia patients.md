## Description

Amanda Grant Smith is a geriatric psychiatrist with decades of experience treating patients with dementia and Alzheimer's disease. In this episode, Amanda shares how she developed a passion for geriatric psychiatry as a means to support dementia patients. She explains how to recognize, define, and diagnose dementia—a process that still remains somewhat elusive. They also talk about the significance of ApoE genotype and compare the various forms of dementia including differentiating between Alzheimer’s disease and Lewy body dementia. They discuss the current landscape of clinical trials, the drug pipeline, and talk about a very promising monoclonal antibody directed at amyloid beta that has the potential to be a disease-modifying drug. They conclude with a discussion about how to define “healthy aging” and reflect on how understanding dementia can shape one’s life philosophy.

## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia

[00:00:10] hey amanda thank you so much for making time to chat with me today from the first time um i heard you speak i knew i wanted to have you on the podcast you probably don't even remember when that was do you well i think it was that zoom thing for hfc right that's right that's right it was it was hilarity for charity and uh somehow uh i was considered an expert you clearly are an expert and then you and me and richard isaacson were a part of a discussion in uh in the days when we no longer do physical panel discussions and um i just thought wow really i i was really kind of blown away by a lot of your insights because they went beyond just the uh obvious topics we discussed which are you know the the research around what's the cause of alzheimer's disease how do you prevent it what are the treatment all those things are relevant and all those things are things that you speak to but i um i think what impressed me was the attention you brought to the impact that alzheimer's disease has on the family just as much as it does the patient and certainly that's something i want to talk about today but before we get to that um tell us a little bit about your background you you specialize in geriatric psychiatry which are not often things you think about right people think about psychiatry they think about forensic psychiatry they think about more of the dsm-5 type of psychiatry how did you get interested in that so i grew up in philadelphia and i had very active grandparents they owned a nursing home you know a lot of people think grandparents in a nursing home you know my own and operated a nursing home and you know just from a young age being around them and their friends and um you know seeing the vibrant lives they led even into their 70s and 80s you know that to me was normal aging um i never thought of anything different until i was in medical school and i really saw you know the pathologic side of aging and the things that can go wrong as we get older as well as i want to see an attitude of ageism among a lot of the attending physicians that we trained under and there was this sort of epiphany i had one day i remember i was in bryn mawr hospital in the emergency room and the attending sent me in to talk to a woman who would come in from a nursing home with chest pain that was all i knew so i went in and i talked to her and i got the history and i went and i you know presented the case to the attending in in rounds and he just laughed at me and he's like you went in the wrong room you know he's like the lady i'm talking about doesn't make any sense and i was like actually she does she just doesn't have her dentures in because the emts forgot to bring them you know but if you actually sat there and took the time to listen to her she told a very you know normal coherent story about how she was eating lunch and she felt pain and went to her shoulder so she called the nurse and so you know that for me was so enlightening because i realized how quick people are to brush off the elderly and it kind of lit a fire in me so to speak so that you know that became my passion so for the rest of medical school i made sure that you know my elective rotations were geriatrics and working with older people in different aspects of it and one of my favorite experiences was on the geriatric psychiatry unit where i got to work with you know dementia patients and psychotic patients and i just found that personally i had more patience for them because of their life stories and the things that they've been through and you know it just sort of led me down this path to where i am now and there are lots of ways as you experienced i suppose to [Music] interact with patients in a geriatric setting obviously internal medicine you could go down that path through cardiology you could certainly go down that path through other subspecialties um when when you were doing the psychiatric work was it understood at the time that a part of dementia is behavioral changes and other things like that or how was i guess i'm struggling with my question because i know what it is and i can't make it come out how much was it understood that alzheimer's disease had a behavioral component that would be under the purview of psychiatric care i guess i think it was it was fairly well established um you know the part that was the bigger problem was that there wasn't much that we could do about the cognitive side of things and fortunately that's changed some in in the time that i've been doing this but um so i graduated from med school in 1997 which was actually the year that denepazil or aircept was first approved so kind of witnessed the evolution of alzheimer's treatments in that time but certainly from the behavioral standpoint the behavior problems that can occur in people with dementia have always been treatable um anxiety depression psychosis you know those have frequently been reasons for hospitalization and often were the reasons that we saw people on the geriatric psychiatry unit because they were imagining things that weren't there or you know acting out on um delusions that they had you know that people were spying on them and they were taking apart the you know ceiling tiles in their apartment to find these you know wires that weren't really there and all that kind of thing so so we've always been able to treat that and and fortunately there's also been you know improvement in some of the options there not ideally but you know to the point where we can control some of those behaviors so people can have a better quality of life and so that caregivers can have a little more peace of mind as well is it common that a patient is known to have dementia and we'll get to how that's diagnosed in in such in a moment but a patient is is known to have this diagnosis of dementia either alzheimer's dementia or some non-alzheimer's form and then they begin to exhibit some of the symptoms you've described so that when they're coming in for evaluation you're not going through a lengthy differential diagnosis to rule out schizophrenia or other forms of psychosis or is it sometimes the case that actually the presenting feature of the dementia can be some of these psychotic symptoms you describe where they feel hey someone's talking to me or something like that yeah in fact the answer is both you know sometimes people will have a course of dementia that after a few years they'll start to develop some of these behavioral symptoms some people never get them and some people do actually present with them often with the latter what will usually happen is they'll go be seen by a community psychiatrist or somebody else and get diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar illness or something that does not have an onset in the mid 70s and so usually they'll be misdiagnosed for a couple of years until it becomes really apparent that that's not the primary problem that there is an underlying neurodegenerative process i i can't sort of imagine um because i haven't been close enough to it what it's like for a patient in the early stages of dementia i've seen patients in the later stages where at least on the outside it seems that they're quite removed from what's happening and paradoxically they don't appear to be suffering very much um but is it safe to assume that it's quite unnerving in the early stages and that that might actually be what's driving some of this behavior it's is a legitimate and understandable fear of something is wrong but i don't understand what it is yeah i mean sometimes so some people are always blissfully unaware throughout the entire course of their illness you know i can't tell you how many times you know i see a patient and they sit down in my office and i'm like so what brings you in today and they're like my wife because there's nothing wrong with me i'm fine they have no idea why they're there even in the very mild stages whereas some people are so acutely aware that something's not right and sometimes they know for two or three years before we can even find any discernible changes on their testing you know they're like i know something's wrong with me and a lot of times they're right you know sometimes they're just anxious because a family member had it or they're worried but a lot of times you know they're very in tune to what's happening and i think you're right usually those are the people that suffer the most because they know what's happening to them and they don't like it and they know what they're facing you know some patients are extremely insightful and really um really are aware of what's happening aware that they're losing things that they used to be able to do or that things aren't coming as quickly even yesterday weirdly i had two patients with lewy body dementia which is a type of dementia that has um sort of parts of alzheimer's parts of parkinson's and and some very prominent visual hallucinations and whereas often times when people have hallucinations or false beliefs to them they're real and they're they don't know that they're not real both of these patients were like i see things that aren't there and it drives me crazy like they knew you know this one woman has people all over her living room and she can't find a piece of furniture to sit down on because these people are sitting there and she knows they're not real but yet she feels like she has to ask them to move in order to sit on her own furniture but she was insightful enough to be able to say i know they're not there and i know my family members don't see them so it's really variable let's talk a little bit about how one makes the clinical diagnosis first of dementia and then how one starts to separate out alzheimer's from lewy body from presumably an unspecified form of dementia so so starting with the former what what is the clinical definition in the diagnosis of dementia so dementia is an umbrella term that just sort of describes changes in memory and other areas of cognition and it represents a change from how you used to be so you weren't born with it and it interferes with your day-to-day function so there are many causes of dementia alzheimer's far and away the most common um so the although there have been advancements in many of our tests um and and more sophisticated imaging techniques and and blood biomarkers that are coming along the real crux of um diagnosis is a good clinical interview with the patient and with an observer so usually it's a spouse or an adult child or a loved one who has observed changes over time in interviewing them separately that's key separately because otherwise the most important information is left out you know because they don't want to hurt the loved ones feelings or whatever so um getting a good clinical interview from the patient informant doing some cognitive testing to look for patterns that support one diagnosis over another and then doing some brain imaging to look for certain things like strokes or shrinking in certain parts of the brain as well as some lab tests to rule out reversible causes of memory loss thyroid disturbance vitamin deficiencies things like that syphilis although frankly i've stopped really testing for that because it's just tertiary syphilis is so uncommon these days and once we do all that generally speaking you know we have a pretty accurate diagnostic you know chance of getting the right you know label for them um sometimes we need formal neuropsych testing with a neuropsychologist sometimes we do need pet scanning to look at certain patterns for example frontotemporal dementia is one where people often present with relatively preserved memory but significant changes in language or behavior and usually you know within a minute i can diagnose them because the loved one will say well his memory is not so bad but and it's either you know he can't really talk anymore which can also happen in alzheimer's fairly early in some people um or you know i'm embarrassed to take him to church because he he'll get up and take the microphone from the pastor and you know you almost know okay this is ftd those are often the people that erroneously get diagnosed with bipolar illness because of these sudden and really profound behavior changes problems with judgment where they get labeled as being manic because they're spending lots of money or they're you know responding to every publisher's clearinghouse thing that comes in the mail um you know so there's these typical sort of stories and and behaviors that we see that kind of support one diagnosis over another so amanda there's a lot in there and i kind of want to go over that in a bit more detail so to make sure i'm understanding this and obviously the listener as well um the first thing i heard you really say there was the absolute importance of the clinical story so unlike cancer where the diagnosis is made typically off imaging and then ultimately through a tissue sample right the gold standard is a histological diagnosis that's not the case in alzheimer's disease we don't do biopsies of the brain i also didn't hear you talk about csf sampling sampling the cerebrospinal fluid to look for amyloid beta or tau anything you want to say about that before we continue down this rabbit hole well yeah i mean there are a few things i can say about that first of all you know certainly it is extremely helpful in the diagnostic process to have you know formal tests like csf or amyloid pet in terms of confirming a diagnosis you know although we certainly don't do brain biopsies unlike when i graduated when you literally could only see amyloid at autopsy under a microscope we now do have the ability to image amyloid in living patients which has you know and i know we're going to talk about research later allowed us to really go much earlier in the process and and design some prevention trials based on targeting people who have brain amyloid but don't yet have memory symptoms so it's been a really amazing revolution as far as that goes however from a cost standpoint although it's a test i can order it's not covered by any insurance and would cost a patient about four thousand dollars out of pocket so other than doing it you know in the context of a clinical trial it's really not realistic for many of the patients as far as csf goes you know there is a good correlation between the pet and csf findings because i am a geriatric psychiatrist and not a neurologist i'm not typically doing lumbar punctures as part of my practice generally speaking between the other markers such as you know mri imaging and pet fdg pet which measures how well the brain is using glucose as its fuel and has different patterns supporting one diagnosis over another and that is usually covered by some insurance we're able to make a diagnosis without the additional markers such as csf but there are times when it is helpful and when we do refer people um to neurology specifically for that so this clinical diagnosis is so important in a way that it's not really as important in the other major chronic diseases right when a patient comes in and they're being diagnosed with diabetes or nafld nobody's really taking a great clinical history you're sort of assuming you know how they got there but here you're having that discussion as you described both with the patient and with someone who can give some of these details you're looking for so i kind of want to identify some of these patterns now i guess the textbook cases are first first thing is a loss of short-term memory i'm assuming is that the the textbook version of alzheimer's dementia yes i mean in alzheimer's disease usually people start to complain of forgetfulness um repeating so a loved one might say well he you know he asked me what time this appointment was four times since yesterday kind of thing um but he can remember you know all the names of his high school football teammates that's very classic so the the preservation of long-term memory with difficulty with short-term memory now amanda how do you differentiate distraction from the path to dementia because if there's one thing i've heard so often from patients it's i you know i just got introduced to this person and i can't remember their name and it used to be so easy for me to remember names or you know my wife told me to do this thing and i just completely spaced on it and you know my in my practice most of those patients when they're saying that tend to be distracted there tends to be something else going on it's really not the uh pro drum to sort of dementia but obviously in your practice specifically that's one can't assume that do you have a way that you try to differentiate that well i think it has to be taken in context with all of the other information i mean quite frankly it happens to me too um you know literally yesterday i thought it was friday because i knew i was normally on friday i wear sweatpants and a usf thing and i knew i wanted to not wear that for this podcast today and so i was in my friday outfit yesterday and so at one point i literally was like oh it's friday and then i was like oh no it's not friday but i'm not worried that i have dementia i was distracted i'm busy i have a lot of things going on and so you know all those kinds of things happen to all of us so it has to be looked at in the context of you know a the fact that some of this does happen with normal aging the fact that you know stress a bad night's sleep all that kind of stuff can affect it and and the other part of it is the frequency and intensity of it you know if it's the exception rather than the rule it's probably not dementia but when that becomes sort of how you are and and what happens every day then it's more concerning you alluded to um i think you alluded to mri and although you didn't state it explicitly were you talking about hippocampal volume or other uh brain matter loss was that kind of what you were getting at yeah the typical things that we look for in an mri when evaluating for dementia a is ruling out vascular disease or quantifying the amount of it so we all get with aging some amount of tiny little strokes and i know that sounds scary but as we get older you know for various reasons high blood pressure high cholesterol smoking diabetes and even just normal aging there can be blocking of blood vessels changes in circulation that cause us to have these tiny little infarcts these are not anything you would notice you would never have symptoms you wouldn't go to the hospital but there can be an accumulation of them and there's a certain amount that's sort of normal when it's extremely mild or scattered but then when they start to you know coalesce or they start to extend into cortical areas parts of the brain that sort of matter more in terms of critical thinking then they can be symptomatic so that's one of the things that we look at is how much vascular disease another thing that we look at is how much shrinking there is both globally and then as you mentioned in the hippocampus which is where short-term memories are kind of formed and before they go off elsewhere and so there is you know it is known that that shrinking in the hippocampus particularly disproportionately to shrinking elsewhere can be a biomarker of alzheimer's disease now there are sometimes people who have hippocampal atrophy and turn out to be amyloid negative so there are these other pathologies that could be considered they call it hippocampal sclerosis some people have that from a stroke some people have it potentially from chronic traumatic encephalopathy and other other buildup of other abnormal proteins beside amyloid in the brain that kind of fact memory as well i want to come back to the amyloid negative case in a second um is hippocampal volume a reliable marker to check progress so for example if you had a patient that was high risk theoretically so i don't know if you're seeing people who are high risk but don't have symptoms yet but if you had a patient who was high risk you did an mri you got a baseline so to speak you had their hippocampal volume would tracking that over time for changes reductions presumably would that provide any meaningful insight sometimes but not always so other things can affect hippocampal volume for example people who are chronically exposed to elevated levels of cortisol or stress hormone you know who people have post traumatic stress disorder we know they have smaller hippocampi than people who don't have that and so it there are times when we can track hippocampal volume over the course of progression of alzheimer's and the shrinking sort of correlates with the amount of cognitive impairment but sometimes not you know sometimes we have people who are very impaired and their brain doesn't really look that bad and sometimes we have people who look like they shouldn't be able to you know put on their own pants based on what the brain looks like but they seem fine so it's again one of those things that really has to be taken in context with all of the other information and part of the reason why the the clinical evaluation and interview and the intangible stuff is so important and just to be clear the diagnosis is it requires the clinical story with or without amyloid and so when you look at the venn diagram of people with amyloid and people with clinical symptoms suggestive of dementia and you line them up there's an overlap but it's not a perfect union and what that tells us is that amyloid is neither necessary nor sufficient for alzheimer's disease correct well amyloid is necessary for alzheimer's disease it's not necessary for dementia but you know if you look at the definition pathologically of what alzheimer's is it is the plaques the out the amyloid plaques and the tau tangles in the brain so you know that was what's required pathologically to make a diagnosis of alzheimer's disease but that diagnosis will only be made post-mortem technically technically yeah um but that's why the advent of amyloid imaging has been so helpful in terms of um making that formal diagnosis in living people which is obviously more helpful for them you know the correlation i believe in one of the studies with amivid floor beta pier which was one of the first amyloid imaging ligands that came out the correlation between the pet and their these were people who were kind enough to donate their brains after they passed to compare to what their pet scan looked like and it was a correlation was about 97 so meaning when they were alive they had an amyloid pet scan yes and an amyloid pet scan unlike fdg pet where you're putting radio labeled glucose here you're putting an antibody to amyloid as their tracer correct yes and so they had this scan while they were alive and you then had a distribution of people that had you know this much amyloid that much amyloid etc but all of them to be clear had a definite had a diagnosis of alzheimer's disease based clinically correct right they had a suspected diagnosis of alzheimer's and then they underwent the pet and then then they donated their brains and then on exactly so what we're missing there of course is the control of people who had amyloid in their brains that would go on to have amyloid on autopsy but didn't have alzheimer's disease do we have a rough sense of how big a population that is i've had a hard time finding this by the way um what percentage of people on autopsy have amyloid in their brain but did not have dementia during their life um i don't know honestly um but i think more than you would expect because so what we know about amyloid and one of the reasons that amyloid imaging has been so helpful is because it's helped us understand that amyloid starts to build up 10 15 20 years before you start to have symptoms of forgetfulness and other cognitive symptoms and so um you know it's this process where you know it's occurring and then it reaches a critical mass and there's a lot of debate scientifically about what that critical mass is or what the downstream effects of amyloid buildup there's some people who think that you can have as much amyloid as you want and it's not until you start to have tau we're understanding more that tau whereas amyloid is sort of widespread kind of from the beginning and builds up all these years beforehand and so the the tracking amyloid doesn't correlate to symptoms tau on the other hand is very different and has a very specific um pattern in which it spreads that does indeed correlate with symptoms so some people feel like it's really the tau that kind of stages where things are and whether you're going to be symptomatic or not so to answer your question you know i think there are a lot of people you know who start to build up amyloid maybe in their 70s or whatever and then you know die of something else so a way to think about it is it's sort of like saying and this is a bad example but i think it's the best one i can think of on the spot it's like coronary calcification where if somebody dies of cancer and you see calcification in their coronary arteries you knew they have atherosclerosis but it never it may have never clinically manifested itself and they if they had not died of cancer they may have died of an mi ten years later that's exactly right and that's frankly the um analogy we most often like to use you know when so before 2011 um the fda you know the definition of alzheimer's was dementia so there was no place in research for these prodromal patients or you know testing these interventions in people before they had full-blown dementia and that was very much like waiting until someone had a heart attack to say that they had coronary artery disease well it's like no you knew that because they have high cholesterol they were building up and you could see on an angioplasty or whatever you know that this was happening and so in 2011 with the advent of amyloid imaging you know pittsburgh compound was the first thing that came out that allowed us to see that although its half-life is so terribly short that it really is not clinically um useful because it has to be made and used within minutes um but you know that really allowed us to redefine what alzheimer's is so that we could see this amyloid building up in patients before they started to have symptoms and then it allowed you know some redefinition and there were white papers that came out kind of dividing and i know on a previous podcast richard isaacson did go into this in some detail but you know the pre-clinical phase of alzheimer's then mild cognitive impairment and then dementia so it really has allowed us to then kind of take a step back and see if we can intervene before people have these symptoms that we may not be able to reverse yeah to me amanda that is probably the most exciting part of this field which is [Music] effectively taking from the playbook of the chronic disease we understand most you know i talk about this with patients which is like there's basically these three main chronic diseases which is alzheimer's disease cancer even though of course that's not one disease and the atherosclerotic disease is both cerebrovascular and cardiovascular and those three legs stand on a platform which is metabolic disease which is then the uh the basically the distribution from hyperinsulinemia to insulin resistance nafld and type 2 diabetes so that becomes the table and you have these legs that stand on it of these i think we have the best understanding of atherosclerosis where lesion by lesion we can stage them you know we understand what a fatty streak is we understand what a foam cell is we understand what leads to calcification you know how we go from soft plaque to vulnerable plaque to a ruptured plaque to an mi and we clearly understand as your point is made [Music] to sit there and wait until someone has a major adverse cardiac event to say oh this this guy's got heart disease is nonsensical i would go one step further and say and you know waiting until a person's 10-year risk exceeds 5 percent to intervene is equally nonsensical yet that is still largely the standard um because we know from autopsy studies of teenagers the process begins then i mean it probably begins even younger but we don't have too many autopsies of people below the teen years but certainly autopsies of people in their late teens and early 20s who have died for other reasons already show foam cells fatty streaks in some cases so if i'm understanding you correctly by definition now based on everything we understand anyone who clinically classifies as having dementia with amyloid has alzheimer's disease is tau necessarily preceded by amyloid or are there scenarios in which tau arrives with minimal to no amyloid beta so the answer to that question is yes but i want to kind of go back for a second so anyone that has dementia and has amyloid does have alzheimer's but they may also have other pathology too right so you could have a mixed dementia where you have alzheimer's and um vascular disease or you could have a mixed lewy body and alzheimer's and and we know from the autopsy studies certainly that are done by dennis dixon up in mayo and jacksonville you know most pathology is actually mixed i don't have the numbers and i don't remember them quite frankly offhand but i know that the number of pure alzheimer's is actually lower than the number of mixed cases so most people have something else too and is vascular the most common um additional diagnosis yes and so what does that mean let's let's think about that for a second you may recall i i interviewed francesco gonzalez lima probably two or three years ago um he's here actually in ut austin works with jack delatorre and they you know really have a strong point of view that says look it's this microvascular disease that is really a big driver here and there's a very compelling rationale for that you mentioned it earlier it's very hard to make it into your seventh eighth ninth decade without unbelievable amounts of microvascular damage and to your point if a critical mass of that is reached it's quite likely that that's going to result in the cognitive impairment and ultimately even higher levels of impairment beyond memory such as executive function um and if as you said amyloid is sort of accumulating along the way it makes sense that you could have this mixed picture where you have the the clinical side so you know you meet the criteria for dementia you have amyloid beta and you have a heavy enough burden of vascular disease i guess it begs the question if you had a time machine and you could go back in time for that particular patient and you correct the vascular insult so let's just say in one patient they were you know aggressively you know you aggressively manage their hypertension in another patient you you know kick the smoking cessation in 20 years sooner in another patient you manage the dyslipidemia you're going to impact the vascular stuff do you think that has an impact on the amyloid side of the equation and more importantly does it impact clinically their development of dementia i think definitely yes i mean i know you know again when you had your conversation with richard isaacson you know he stressed the importance of those cardiovascular risk factors and the development of alzheimer's the other thing that we know is and again it's not exactly the same protein but it's so closely related you know amyloid is a component of blood vessel walls right so you know to what extent you know i think there's there's still room for more understanding in that and what the exact relationship is between normal amyloid and pathologic amyloid so and it's important to say in alzheimer's the buildup of amyloid is this abnormal length amyloid that's not the usual thing that we find in our bodies right so it's changed a little bit um but there is normally amyloid that's part of our being and so because it is part and parcel of blood vessel walls it's only natural to assume there must be this interplay between the vasculature and the alzheimer's side of things um i would be lying if i said i knew what that was you know i think that still needs to be elucidated um you know that's why we have floors of people smarter than me upstairs doing experiments does amyloid beta exist outside of the blood-brain barrier does it does it exist on the other side of the blood-brain barrier honestly i don't know that's interesting i never actually thought of what you know until you said what you said about the relationship to the endothelium i never thought about that i i'm guessing somebody has looked into that and the answer is probably not enough to matter or else we would simply be doing a blood test to look for enough amyloid right right well that's coming though yeah so you know there are some really exciting i don't want to forget about your tau questions you know there are some really exciting developments in terms of looking at blood biomarkers including plasma amyloid in terms of potentially having a blood-based test for alzheimer's so there has been progress there and i think that you know as time goes on we're going to be able to do these less invasive tests and really have a better sense of both risk for people who aren't maybe symptomatic yet as well as diagnosis one blood basis oh okay yeah let's go back to tao and then i want to ask another blood-based question okay so you had asked about whether you could have other things like tau without amyloid the answer is definitely yes you know so frontotemporal dementias some of them are characterized by abnormal tau buildup in the absence of amyloid there are some familial genetic phonotemporal brain diseases that are characterized by towel burden chronic traumatic encephalopathy that we see in football and other boxing and things also have abnormal tau often in the absence of amyloid so yes that definitely has a role in the development of dementia in in other types of dementia too we sort of glossed over it but maybe it is worth explaining what it is that amyloid beta is doing to neurons and what it is that tau is doing to neurons to actually injure them do you want to spend just a second kind of outlining those things um to the extent that my blonde self can i will to a first order approximation no but i mean i i focus on the patient part of things i let the scientists do their you know the neuroscientists do their part um but you know it is this sort of cascade of damage there is activation of glial cells which sort of help protect our brain against you know intruders and they can release toxins they can sort of eat you know it's called autophagy you know eating up our own tissue and so there's damage both inside the neurons and then outside you know plaques and tangles and it creates a cascade that eventually leads to cell death and so is it more the death of the neuron itself or would the would the injury to the glial cells alone be sufficient to uh lead to these symptoms because the glial cells of course you know when i was in medical school which was not that long after you i don't i don't remember that we talked that much about glial cells in in our neuroscience classes i feel like we talked more about the neurons but i know that in more recent discussions i've had with neuroscientists they really place almost an equal emphasis on the glial cells so i'm curious as to whether or not injuring the glial cells in in this particular pathology is equally responsible or at least to a first order approximation equally responsible for the damage i think they're more responsible for the damage you know i think that they're part of the cascade that leads to the death of the neurons because they're trying to protect you know the neurons and in doing so injure them i want to go back to a biomarker question we're going to talk about the apoe genotype at some point but of course one can actually measure apoe in the plasma you can actually just like you can measure apo lipoprotein b you which we use obviously extensively in cardiovascular risk stratification um to my knowledge there's not a commercial uh assay for measuring apoe though it can be done do you are you aware of any utility to that would that would looking at apoe levels i read a paper seven or eight years ago i think suggesting that the lower the level of apoe the higher the risk but i i could have i could entirely have that backwards and i could entirely be wrong but is that something you've you're aware of at all not really i mean it's really more about the genotyping than the quantification of it you know obviously and again you've talked about it on prior podcasts the um the risk that e4 genotype carries compared to the others and the fact that e4 homozygotes have higher risk and also different responses to cardiovascular meds different different risks for other diseases besides dementia it is typically not something that we check for in a routine day-to-day clinical care for a couple of reasons one is it's not diagnostic right so you can have e4 e4 and not have alzheimer's or you can have e2 e3 which might be protective and still have alzheimer's so it really just makes people worry it does have a lot more utility in the research setting in terms of looking at how carriers versus non-carriers respond to certain treatments and helping us understand that carriers you know may respond differently to different lifestyle interventions may have an earlier onset compared to people who don't have it but ultimately end up with the same disease yeah so when people come to see you in clinic there's not a lot of utility added by looking at it i mean my view is apoe4 is great to help people identify risk early on but at the same time nobody gets off the hook and you used a great example the 2 3 shows up a lot and i tell my patients with the 2 3 you're not off the hook right you've got about a 10 risk reduction relative to the 3-3 but the 3-3 is clearly not at risk and on the flip side the 3-4 patients or even the 4-4 patients i say look it's certainly not a fade-a-complete but i would take this a lot more seriously than maybe you otherwise would right in terms of preventative measures so let's go back to the patient that shows up in clinic oh actually there's one other thing i want to clarify i'm sorry let's go back to lewy body dementia most people have heard of this there have been some notable examples in the public sphere about you know folks that have uh died from this is it still the case that that's a diagnosis that can be made only post-mortem um i mean again yes but it is you know there's this sort of classic clinical picture that is so compelling that you know it it can be made fairly accurately in the clinic without diagnostic testing and so the clinical distinction between i hate to use this term the clinical distinction between classic alzheimer's dementia and classic lewy body so let's exclude the mixed variants of that how would you differentiate those patients so classic alzheimer's you know would begin with short-term memory loss and slowly but surely over time progress to having difficulty you know paying bills and then eventually um needing supervision needing assistance with activities of daily living cooking bathing you know the classic sort of decline may or may not have behavior issues may or may not have some changes in walking lewy body disease on the other hand presents with a fairly classic triad of symptoms that occur within two years of one another one is an alzheimer's like cognitive impairment that can notably fluctuate so that some days people seem really good and some days they seem really really bad there is a parkinsonism component where they will often be stiff have trouble rising from a chair shuffle they may decrease arm swing when they walk so that they walk and you know normally when we walk our arms move but their arms don't move they may have more um less or i should say less expression on their face they don't necessarily have a tremor so true parkinson's disease proper often begins with a tremor a slow writhing kind of tremor at rest on one side and often we don't see that in lewy body disease but these they have these other elements of parkinsonism and so we've got the the cognitive impairment the parkinsonism and very often prominent visual hallucinations seeing things that aren't there fairly elaborate often delusions that go along with it you know there's this family living in my house there's people and bears living in the trees you know people will close their blinds because they don't want these people seeing them and all that kind of stuff um so that classic triad of symptoms with some additional supportive features including restless leg syndrome even many years leading up to it as well as rem sleep behavior disturbances so people who often act out in their dreams or a spouse who says i have to sleep in the other room because he punches me you know that's sort of a classic louis body picture and and furthermore they fluctuate both the motor and the cognitive symptoms fluctuate so today we might be able to go to the mall and walk all around and tomorrow they might have trouble walking across the room and from the time of diagnosis amanda until those patients are either in hospice or incapacitated or dead is typically how long is that a quicker disease sometimes i mean it's usually about eight years um but for some it you know my experience i've had a lot of lewy body patients who have sort of this precipitous decline and then kind of hit a plateau for a while and then really drop off you know this is not this is anecdotal this is not based on any data but it's just my experience with them and having seen enough of them to see that that's frequently kind of how it goes but it's usually about an eight to ten year process and they're it's less often as protracted as alzheimer's can be even though the average for alzheimer's is still also 8 to 10 years it can be significantly longer how hereditary is louis body dementia either with respect to lewy body itself or being predictive of the next generation's risk for alzheimer's disease or parkinson's for that matter um i honestly don't know i don't think it's terribly genetic you know we don't have well-established you know as with early onset alzheimer's which does have some specific mutations that cause it i don't know that we know of specific mutations for lewy body disease but i may be just not informed i mean that makes in some ways lewy body a bit more of a mystery because as you said for alzheimer's disease on the very early onset side we have the psen1 to app mutations which are about as close to deterministic as you get and then you have the apo e4 gene which is not deterministic but is highly suggestive for the more typical variant and we also have known risk factors diabetes you know microvascular disease dyslipidemia i mean these things are absolutely known risk factors we seem to have none of that on the side of lewy body correct as far as i know yeah what's the relative incidence of alzheimer's versus lewy body dementia is it like eight ten to one or how how much more prominent is alzheimer's um well it depends i guess if you're looking at uh you know the autopsy confirmed versus sort of what we see in the clinic um you know i think that i honestly don't have the numbers specifically for you but i i do know that you know it's diagnosed less but found more on autopsy that people do have lewy bodies that we may not have expected i got it and and just in your experience in your clinic what's the approximate uh distribution of those the the it's about i would say um you know 50 to 60 plus percent alzheimer's about 20 true vascular about 20 lewy body and then the rest is ftd and some of these parkinson's plus syndromes um progressive supernuclear palsy and some of these other less common things that we only see once in a while so back to kind of the way your practice works presumably people are coming to you at the referral of a neurologist correct not necessarily no um we get people referred from their primary doctors we get people that are self-referred um we get people that are referred by neurology it varies widely that in itself is actually quite interesting right if you think about the different paths that a person gets to you they can say hey there's something wrong with me oh dr smith that's a so so-and-so you know psychiatrists specializing in geriatrics i'm going to go see her and then the the primary care doctor can say look i'm i have a high enough degree of suspicion that my patient has alzheimer's they're going to come to you presumably when the neurologist is sending to you it's not to make the diagnosis they've made it i assume it's then to treat some of the behavioral components um sometimes yes i mean well first let me say that i would say fully half of my patients think i'm a neurologist like they don't even sort of differentiate or you know they'll refer to me as their neurologist and it just is what it is you know they assume and it's fine or maybe they don't want to say they're going to a psychiatrist i don't know sometimes you know i think it varies from place to place there are a few neurologists here in town that do specialize in alzheimer's and treating dementias and focus on that but a lot of them don't um a lot of them prefer specializing in stroke or headache or you know ms or seizures and so when it turns out to be dementia they're just oh we'll go to the alzheimer's center so i don't think it's a question of necessarily psychiatry versus neurology it's just go to the go to the memory place yeah um but yes there are definitely a subset of referring providers who do so specifically so that we can manage the behavioral aspect of things how long have you um been in your current practice in tampa since 2002 in this building since 2008 but so what happened is i i came down to usf in 1997 as an intern to do my residency here so i did my residency in psychiatry and then a fellowship in geriatric psychiatry and part of my fellowship time was spent with the suncoast gerontology center working under eric pfeiffer who had founded that here in 1980 and really was a leader in the field of geriatric psychiatry and alzheimer's disease he was the first president i think of the american association for geriatric psychiatry and it was actually one of the reasons i chose usf because i knew suncoast was here and i was interested in geriatrics and alzheimer's about that point so when i finished my fellowship on a friday i started working for him on the following monday um and and that was in 2002 and then in 2008 he retired and i kind of stepped in and took on his role as principal investigator for a lot of the clinical trials he had been doing and kind of directing the center so i'm curious as to how your practice has evolved in nearly 20 years what what is different and what is the same about people showing up with dementia today are they older are they younger are they more metabolically ill are they on a are they on a faster track are they progressing quicker i mean what what are all the differences that you see so that's a really great question and um you know the the thing that's the same i would say is the fear you know people are terrified of losing their minds and losing their memories and so that continues to be sort of the biggest motivator in terms of people seeking help um i will say that we are seeing people that are both older and younger you know i think that there's more of an awareness of alzheimer's as a disease as well as an awareness of the fact that there are things that we can do about it because when i first started there wasn't a whole lot that we could do and furthermore there was sort of this assumption that it was a normal consequence of aging you know there there has been a lot of um effort put into really educating the public that this is a disease and that this is not something that you have to live with and this is not a normal consequence of getting older and because of that i think there's been success in kind of getting that message across and getting people into the clinic i think that you know there's definitely more of a shift towards people seeking baseline people looking at prevention people wanting you know an evaluation and tips on brain health and i know you know again you spoke with richard isaacson because he runs a prevention clinic at cornell um in terms of the lifestyle modifications and things that people can do earlier you know we we often see people who have a parent who have alzheimer's and want to come in and have an evaluation for themselves or get involved in prevention research so that they don't go down the same path so that i think that's the biggest area where things have shifted i think there's also a better understanding that people realize that there's more that we can do and that early intervention is key you know people often used to be embarrassed by this problem or isolated by it or not want to tell family members or neighbors and now they understand that if they come and they seek help and we start them on medication even though they're you know our medications are not miracle drugs by any stretch the ones that are fda approved um but they can slow down decline and that in some people they can can even subjectively and objectively help for a period of time and so knowing that you can preserve your function and stay better longer or stay at home longer um you know there was one old study way back with dinepizzle showing that it delayed nursing home placement by an average of 24 months you know that's huge if you're someone that wants to be at home versus being a skilled nursing facility or if you're you're a spouse who wants to keep your loved one home you know that makes a difference even though the drugs not you know the people are still going to get worse on the medication um so anyway you know that was a lot a big mouthful just to say that you know i think there is this better um awareness of the things that we are able to do and the help that we're able to provide so that people seek help sooner um we talked about it at the very outset that so many of the things that the patients are experiencing when they show up are you know quote unquote the garden variety things that a psychiatrist would see anxiety and depression for example what percentage of the patients that you're taking care of are you prescribing antidepressants and anxiolytics and um is that standard of care is that something that you have the ability to be more bespoke in because you have a greater understanding of how those drugs work and how effective are they so the answer is you know quite a few i would say the majority of our patients do have some mood or behavioral issue that does require treatment um 90 of people will have some behavioral issue at some point in their illness it may not be a you know terribly problematic psychotic type behavior issue it may be you know something simple but nevertheless they're very common in all types of dementia the key is understanding that they are equally treatable you know depression in a dependent person is just as treatable as depression in a healthy 25 year old so there are obviously some um adjustments that have to be made for age and and renal function and other medications and drug interactions but um we very frequently prescribe the ssris um the type of antidepressants because they treat anxiety very well in this population they're pretty well tolerated they generally don't make people fall which is a big issue in this group as well you know we try to stay away from the benzodiazepine type drugs you know alprazolam and lorazepam and all the pams particularly diazepam and the longer acting ones but [Music] you know because they can really increase confusion and have a dramatically high incidence of hip fracture with those drugs and used chronically so a lot of it is you know identifying the specific problem treating with the least sort of offensive drug that's going to cause the least amount of collateral damage um and you know stopping them at times when they may no longer be necessary you know old people sort of they collect meds like they collect other things and you know sometimes you'll see someone who's on 15 17 18 meds you're like why are you even on this people who had hypertension when they were 50 and needed three meds to manage it but now we're 90 and they're falling all the time because their blood pressure is so low but nobody bothered to say hey you don't need three meds for your blood pressure anymore um so you know we do have to be vigilant and and really target symptoms with the safest lowest dose and the shortest treatment period that we can but in doing so can be very effective in treating these symptoms you might not know the answer to this but do you have a sense of how many patients in the united states or what fraction of patients in the u.s with alzheimer's disease are getting that type of complementary care for the psychiatric component specifically the depression and the anxiety do you think it's the majority or the minority i would probably say it's the majority i mean a lot of them do get um treated by their primary doctors for depression i see a lot of people who come to me already on medication for that um you know i think doctors are prescribing and people are sharing those and and certainly from the standpoint of um some of the more problematic behaviors you know people don't want to live with them they're difficult they're difficult for the patient and they can also be problematic and troublesome for the caregivers so they often will seek help for that you know more acutely than they will for the underlying condition how much are you providing i mean you're not necessarily treating the family members medically but after all you are a psychiatrist which means you have more tools in your tool kit than simply your prescription pad um how much are you treating the the spouse for example as you are the patient the spouse without dementia well in a way i think we all sort of give you know free therapy if you want to call it that you know we i i do occasionally medicate caregivers if they register as a patient you know i'll say hey you know you really have the severe depression we need to treat this um but i won't do it out you know i won't do it under the patients you know once we're dealing with meds it's a whole other story but um obviously there's a lot of support and education sometimes i mean especially with the pandemic um you know sometimes i'm the only other person that they will see or talk to even if it's on telehealth like this you know oftentimes it's just that opportunity to vent to talk to somebody who can understand what they're going through you know although i have had some experience with family members having dementia late in life you know i was not a primary caregiver um i most of what i know comes from you know the village of patients and caregivers that have shared very personal things with me so i have the opportunity to share their insights with others but i would say quite a lot of you know if you want to call it free therapy or whatever you know just that opportunity to you know listen to make them understand that you know what they're going through is valid and real give them pointers and tools and and things that they may not have thought of in terms of handling a certain behavior just that one little pearl that might make their day easier you know the other day i was talking to someone who just simply cannot get their loved one to take a shower i'm like what's their favorite snack and they kind of looked at me funny and i said you know they're like cheetos so i'm like okay tell them after they get out of the shower you'll give them some cheetos you know you'll go to the store you'll get some cheetos and they're like you know they they don't think of it that way because they're just you know sort of trying and fighting like you need to take a bath you need to take back get in the shower and i want to take a shower and there's not that sort of stepping back and like okay how can i do this differently so sometimes just you know kind of giving them a little reality check and a break from the constant stress cycle that they're in to kind of look look at things through different eyes um really can can make a big difference i think in their the way that they approach things you know the other the other thing that's sometimes really difficult for caregivers is you know a lot of times they'll think that some of these behaviors that their loved ones are showing are intentional you know or he's just doing it to annoy me it's like well no he's not like if he's really not if he knew the answer he wouldn't ask you again so instead of saying don't you remember just say answer the question like it's the first time you know and and take out that sort of personal attack side of it you know and and not look at it as they're intentionally trying to irritate you but you know they have a disease that's making them do this and often you know that is something that people really need to hear and it really makes their days better i mean it's it's easy for me to sit here at my desk and tell them it's a lot harder to do but at least kind of having that reality check can can change the way that they approach caregiving i'm sure people listening are familiar with elizabeth kubler-ross and how she goes through these sort of five stages of of grief and how people go through you know denial and anger etc on their way to acceptance and that model um has always sort of been helpful when thinking about something like cancer and i got to see that a lot firsthand is it similar here with alzheimer's disease both for the patient and the caregiver that they that there's this you know in some combination or in some order they go through those oh absolutely i mean you know other you know i can't take credit for the phrase but it's you know it's like grieving for someone while they're still alive you know it's the um you know this can't really be happening and then being angry then it's happening and you know sort of well maybe if we do this and maybe do that in fact i i re-listened to your podcast with lauren miller rogan and richard isaacson last evening just kind of in preparation for today and just to make sure we didn't sort of duplicate everything that we talked about um but you know lauren in that podcast really gives a very compelling journey right through those stages you know in terms of dealing with her mother who was my patient which is how i got to know them in the first place um but you know it's really a very distinct journey while her mother was was still very alive and you know going through those stages of grief in losing her hopes for what her relationship with her mother would be like as she got older um you know it's really terribly sad and it's also something that naturally happens as we grieve you know i think those stages of grief apply to almost everything you know they're sort of part and parcel of our our you know existence as human beings is that's kind of going to happen we don't always go through all of them or we don't always resolve all of them or make it through all of them but it's a very very real and major part of of dealing with this diagnosis in my experience with oncology patients once they've progressed through denial and anger and bargaining etc and they sort of get to acceptance the usually the biggest concern the residual concern is the amount of suffering at the end uh so it actually becomes um at least one of the concerns becomes around the mechanism of death and that's not something a lot of people think about most people walking around if they're level-headed know that they're going to die at some point there aren't too many people walking around believing that they're immortal so most people understand in an abstract way i'm not going to be alive at a point in time um but it's still it's kind of a vague fuzzy foggy thing which is i'll have a heart attack at some point then i won't be alive but but to the patient with metastatic cancer who's again accepted that and understands that they've progressed through all standard treatments so even now we can even take a subset of patients with stage four cancer who are in hospice care all of a sudden a big priority is the actual mechanism of death um and and and certainly for the palliative care physician and and and and in my opinion also for the good oncologist the one who doesn't just sort of abandon the patient when there's no more oncologic care i think a big part of that is explaining no actually we might not be able to save your life but we can absolutely prevent discomfort what is that discussion like for you once the patient and their family have progressed through all the stages and really understand that this is an irreversible disease and it will result in the end of their life how do you address the specific fears that remain um that's a great question and i do get asked about it fairly frequently but yet at the same time we often don't get into it too much because you know what i try to do is really help people focus on the now um that being said you know what i share with them is that a lot of times you know people's as they progress they're going to have more difficulty doing more simple things and more basic things they will have trouble swallowing they will need assistance they will perhaps aspirate on food and get pneumonia they may lose mobility and be bedridden you know and and we go through that conversation when they ask you know well how do you die of alzheimer's but the truth is a lot of people don't ever get to that stage you know many people die of something else they die of old age they die of their heart disease they die because they fell in a parking lot um you know before they ever reach such a terminal stage of dementia and so you know we have the conversation but we also try not to focus on the end game because that's just miserable you know and then um i know a little bit later you know we we're going to be talking about sort of healthy aging and stuff like that and and you know that's one of the biggest things that i see is is not focusing on the end but focusing on the now because the truth is with alzheimer's that's all people have you know they have today they have you know because they may not remember tomorrow what happened today so um they're really living in the moment so you know we try not to spend too much time dwelling on you know i i'm obviously extremely honest in terms of what can and will happen if they inquire and also in terms of letting them know that support is there through hospice and other things when the time comes you know that they don't have to go through that alone but you know we try to reroute that thought process into focusing on making each day better so let's shift gears a little bit and talk about the clinical trial landscape because that's a very big part of what you do right you're a clinical psychiatrist who deals with patients on an individual basis as we've discussed but you also are heavily involved in another part of this which is how to do clinical trials and this is obviously a very important part of this work now alzheimer's disease and drugs don't have a great marriage they don't have a great track record the way cardiovascular disease does and even though oncology is not you know great far from perfect uh oncology even has a better track record than alzheimer's disease and i think you could make the case without being hyperbolic that there is no disease that has a worse track record relative to the inputs uh on the output side in other words there were you know there are orphan diseases for which we have no drugs right but there have been few shots on goal so the ratio of shots on goals shots on goal to goals is lower in alzheimer's disease than probably not probably unquestionably any other disease okay on the one level that undoubtedly speaks to the complexity of the disease some might argue that on another level that speaks to the wrong goal or shooting too late in the game you know shooting from too bad an angle at the wrong goal like you could take this metaphor 10 different ways um as it stands today there are about 120 drugs in the pipeline um if my number crunching has it right about 27 of them if we extracted this correctly off clinicaltrials.gov are in phase one so for the listener meaning these are drugs that are really just being evaluated for safety at this point so we have some animal data that suggests this is a good idea we have no idea if it works in humans but in in a very small way with dose escalation we want to make sure it's safe about 65 are in phase two so that means they've passed that bar of being safe or at least safe enough to proceed to phase two where now we're looking for some efficacy and we'll of course continue to monitor safety and then 29 are in phase 3 which means at a small scale they've shown efficacy typically against a placebo now we want to see if there's efficacy again either versus a placebo or ideally against a current standard in a larger trial where again we're always going to continue to monitor safety but it's really this third stage that is required for fda approval another way to slice the data is to look at it by category of drug and i found this to be the most interesting 12 of these are in the space of cognitive enhancement 12 are in the space of neuropsychiatric and behavioral improvement and 97 are in the space of disease modification can you explain a little bit what the differences of those three categories mean and uh knowing that the next question i'm going to ask you is that how has that evolved over the last 20 years because that to me has been the biggest that was the thing i was most surprised by yeah so the um the symptomatic treatments are ones that you know can help slow cognitive decline or help improve memory and thinking but are not targeting the underlying disease process so all the drugs that we currently have on the market are ones that are symptomatic treatments because they're just helping those neurons communicate in the case of xenepazil and glantamine and ribostigmine they're you know cholinesterase inhibitors and then there's mementine which is an nmda receptor antagonist that normalizes levels of glutamate but they're just they're helping with neurotransmitters and they're not targeting the underlying pathology of amyloid and tau then obviously the behavioral drugs are ones that are being targeted for specific behavior problems in alzheimer's and other dementia patients things like apathy agitation psychosis sometimes sleep issues sometimes even appetite and eating problems so those all kind of fall under the behavioral umbrella and then these disease modifying treatments are ones that actually target the underlying pathology in the case of sort of the biggest group of those that are in trials right now are really monoclonal antibodies against primarily amyloid but also if you look you know targeting tau and removing them from the brain in the hopes that then there will be cognitive improvement or at least halting cognitive decline um can i interject for a second mechanistically is it known exactly where amyloid beta is made is it is it understood how you know from where the where the transcription takes place or is this all post-translational modification well so there there's a whole science dedicated to that you know and there it actually is is different points along the cascade you know so there's the amyloid precursor protein which is on chromosome 21 which is why people with down syndrome who have three copies of chromosome 21 almost inevitably will get alzheimer's if they live long enough because they're making a third more amyloid than the rest of us [Music] so anywhere from the very beginning of our dna all the way through some of the enzymes that cleave amyloid so part of the problem is that the amyloid gets cleaved at a length of 40 or 42 amino acids rather than whatever it's supposed to be which i don't remember and then the abnormal amyloid kind of folds and you know there's fibrils and there's pla you know the plaque itself is a conglomeration of a series of folds in the protein and so there are even differences among the antibodies as to what part of that cascade they target and amyloid is not necessary in other words if you could wave a magic wand and pull amyloid out of a person is there any ill consequence well like i said it is part of blood vessel walls normally so it is this pathologic amyloid you know these abnormal lengths of a beta 40 and 42 um yeah i mean those could be pulled out without consequence because they shouldn't be there in the first place so if you wanted to target the system you would not target you would not target the creation of amyloid you would probably target the enzymes that abnormally cleave well that that is one area that has been studied um the gamma secretase inhibitors for example are ones that have been studied um [Music] there's there's then the base inhibitors these are things that are being looked at because these are responsible for cleaving but a lot of times those have had side effects that we didn't really want yeah i wonder if has anybody looked at something like an antisense oligonucleotide that goes straight after the enzyme in a laser precision basically says you can't make this enzyme and you don't have to carpet bomb the enzyme and everything around it you're literally going after the transcription of the enzyme yeah i honestly don't know you know that's that's for the scientists i mean i'm sure somebody has thought of it and declined there's i'm sure there's a reason that hasn't been yeah i mean the thing is you know sometimes they have thought of it or they've tried it but then they don't realize what the downstream effects of doing so may be yeah um and that's been a problem with several of these medications you know whether it's a great idea you know they've identified a target they've identified compounds that seek out that target but they cause liver toxicity or they cause you know some other significant medical issue or they cause cardiac arrhythmias or things that medically are not safe to continue so the thing that surprised me amanda when i looked at the distribution of drugs just again this is available on clinicaltrials.gov is that 80 of the drugs are disease-modifying drugs which is a good sign of course because the other 20 as you said are symptomatic now that's not the way the drugs are currently represented there are are there how many drugs six approved drugs for alzheimer's disease right now well there's technically five well yes there's six but one of them is a combination of two existing correct right okay all of these are symptomatic drugs right we don't have a disease modifying agent out there we're going to obviously talk about biogen in a moment which is an important almost watershed moment in the field so i i assume that it's from your standpoint a great sign that 80 percent of the pipeline is actually focusing on the underlying cause as opposed to just the symptoms right and a lot of that has to do with what i mentioned earlier with regard to that 2011 sort of major moment where we were allowed to redefine what alzheimer's is and our understanding that the the amyloid pathology building up for many years is was a key factor you know i'm not saying it's a d factor but it's a key factor in the development of alzheimer's disease symptoms now some of the disease modifying drugs that were initially tested were tested in people with mild to moderate alzheimer's disease and were negative you know they did not seem to work or help and it may have been because targeting amyloid at that stage of the disease may be too late to help people who already are significantly impaired but that 2011 shift into understanding that there's mci and that even before that preclinical alzheimer's allowed us to then design trials that are currently ongoing looking at both prevention by amyloid removal before cognitive symptoms start and then also treating people with mild cognitive impairment who do have some symptoms of memory loss but are not yet demented because they're so functional in their day-to-day what was the typical duration of those failed studies so if you look at the earlier studies that were trying to remove amyloid late in the game that that failed do you recall on average with the duration are these like four-year studies three-year five-year studies no they were usually about 18 months wow so really short so yeah you could definitely make the case that that's again just going back to the disease i understand best that's like saying we're going to take patients who you know have the most aggressive form of cardiovascular disease they've got multi-vessel disease huge stenosis you know vulnerable plaque everywhere and for 18 months let's see what happens if we employ lipid lowering therapy and we see that it has kind of a minor impact and you can make the case well you probably should have done it earlier and for longer right and well i mean the the earlier is definitely key i mean i don't know if that so well yes for longer but not in that particular group you know there would not have been any um benefit i don't think to doing a three or four year study of that moderate you know moderately demented group with these therapies because they were just gonna get keep getting worse you know that's the thing they kept getting they were their disease had was progressing the train had left the station and it was going to do what it was going to do so you know traditionally 18 months has been a standard length for alzheimer's trials because it's the amount of time you know you have to remember these trials cost lots of money you know people often complain and rightfully so that certain drugs are extremely expensive and then you know obviously you coming from canada have a whole different perspective on um that than you know the american side of it you know where it's just all about money all the time that being said you know there is some validity to the price of some of these drugs because of the vast amount of resources that have been spent you know it takes on average i read a statistic that you know 10 to 15 years and a billion dollars for any one drug to get from development and discovery to fda approval that's right it's probably it's probably higher today actually it's probably closer to about 1.3 1.4 billion and you're absolutely correct uh so if you look at that pipeline of 120 odd drugs um again it's not going to be 120 billion because some of them will get you know weeded out in phase one but there's no question that the united states um subsidizes the rest of the world in drug pricing so what there's basically an understanding quid pro quo in my mind that says look in exchange for having the best drugs available first you will pay a premium for the development of the drug that's effectively what's happening in the u.s yeah and then it's also important to point out though that for every one drug that makes it all the way through there's literally four or five thousand that don't you know some get squashed in the very beginning and some make it to animal models you know but you know so so it's a very very very expensive um process for the drug companies and so my going back to my point you know they have to find that sweet spot in terms of length of a trial that will sort of be worth their investment but at the same time not spend extra resources but also give the information that they need and so knowing how alzheimer's progresses particularly in that group you know 18 months is a spot where you're going to see okay so in 18 months if they're better well that's crazy because that doesn't happen um if they're stable well that's good because it's usually there's some drop off in that period of time and if they're worse then clearly it's not working yeah and if you if you look at the oncology playbook here um you understand the challenge of this space which is you have the same economics right which is a billion to a billion and a half to get a drug from inception into a clinic and truthfully you have kind of a a gray area of utility right there are drugs that are getting approved that make very little sense so they extend median survival by two months without extending overall survival and they're going to cost a hundred thousand dollars and we can debate the merits of that and that's where you'll see differences between the u.s the uk canada etc but you see one of the issues here that i find most interesting and i'm not familiar i'm not as familiar with it in alzheimer's disease but i'm intimately familiar with it in cardiovascular disease and in oncology is the importance of patient selection and study design it's everything right so to me let's use cardiovascular disease in an example i always found the fourier trial and the odyssey trial which were the two major trials used to test the pcsk9 inhibitors i found them to be very elegant and very complementary so the fourier trial took patients who were maximally statinized these are patients that had an ldl cholesterol that was typically south of 70 milligrams per deciliter or in about that neighborhood so these are people at the fifth percentile of ldl cholesterol and then added a pcsk9 inhibitor to them um the study was stopped after two to three years i believe it was intended for four or five and it demonstrated an improvement and again in cardiovascular disease what are your outcomes it's usually mace a major adverse cardiac event so heart attack stroke revascularization death so you have heart outcomes that's an important thing right they're not tracking nobody cares how much it lowers your cholesterol the biomarker means nothing anymore it's only does it prevent an outcome you had a complementary study in odyssey which did not take heavily statinized patients but patients who were if i recall equally at risk and again it was major adverse cardiac event and there's all they usually include all-cause mortality this is a challenge that i see in alzheimer's disease is and i'm i'm saying this not as an absolute challenge just as a challenge to me as an outsider i struggle to understand these endpoints sometimes and i just don't understand how valid they are not because i think that the people measuring them are nefarious but because they just seem very soft and squishy at times like well did the person cognitively get better maybe yes no i'm not sure and yeah we use this test and it has a five point scoring system and we square the boxes and such and such but um in the end it's a harder disease to measure definitive outcomes in the to your point at the duration of time we want to study them so um that's a lot to unpack and and i guess where i'm going with that is how do you think about let's start with one element how do you think about patient selection who is the right patient to be studying where on that progress from pre-clinical to mci to disease i think we've ruled out bucket three right i think we're if i've heard you earlier it's we we don't want to be studying patients for disease modification that already have significant dementia so are you would you say the same is true of mci and we should be looking at the pre-clinical or what which means we by definition are making an imaging diagnosis um or is it early mci so i think you know the jury's still out with regard to mci there still are a lot of trials and i think there may be opportunity for mild cognitive impairment as well as mild dementia to benefit from these disease modifying therapies you know if we're looking at a cure because that's what everybody wants right a cure i think the prevention trials are really going to be the way to go because then you're stopping it before it starts you know we know that these anti-amyloid drugs remove amyloid we know this they successfully reduce amyloid to a point where people go from having positive amyloid pet to negative amyloid pet in fact we had an occasion once where we had a patient who was in a trial an anti-amyloid trial for some time and then that study stopped and then she wanted to enroll in another study and it was actually an anti-tau antibody and they did allow people with previous exposure to anti-amyloid drugs after a certain window of time sometimes they don't so when she had her new amyloid pet for that study she screen failed because she was amyloid negative and so um you know that's been shown in numerous trials with more than one compound that that it definitely removes amylase so if you look at the pet outcomes for these drugs they're great um what are the clinical outcomes you know yeah just like like you said nobody cares about a marker or cholesterol you care about the clinical outcomes and symptoms and so none of that matters if if you're removing amyloid if the people aren't any better or if they're continuing to get worse you know that's what was happening with the mild to moderate group um you know the original solinazimab trials um you know people just kept getting worse because they're they already had enough neurodegeneration and other pathology now going on in the brain that the whether the amyloid was there anymore didn't matter i do think in mci that there's opportunity for these drugs to work and and you know the fda is considering the agicanamab data right now um the there was just um last or actually at the beginning of this week data for don and mab which is a lilly study that came out at the adpd meeting showing that it met end points on almost all of the mark you know the the primary and secondary outcome measures that they had set forth so um yeah i wouldn't rule out the mci group at this point but in terms of sort of the ideal i think prevention ultimately is going to be the way to go as far as disease modification and you know just like you'll go to the doctor and see you have high cholesterol and intervene then before you get to these you know bad cardiac or stroke outcomes you know you'll go to the doctor and perhaps have a test that shows you have amyloid and then intervene then so that you don't then develop cognitive impairment that's our hope and our goal yeah that make that makes hands down the most sense and again i i'm obviously stating the obvious but the more we can model this after a disease where we've had unbelievable success like cardiovascular disease rather than a disease where we've had very little success which is cancer because we have to wait until you have cancer now of course i think liquid biopsies are going to change that and we are really on the cusp of that in fact that's going to be a super exciting discussion we're gonna have on the podcast in the next you know couple of months um so the goal of course is to turn cancer into cardiovascular disease it's to turn uh alzheimer's disease into the same so one of the most promising versions of these monoclonal antibodies to amyloid is atacanamab which is a drug manufactured by a company called biogen and it's been in the news a lot lately um i think for several reasons one is it's a drug that made it to phase three and it was running two parallel studies uh emerge and what was the other one called engage yeah so and to my understanding very little difference between them obviously different sites and maybe a slight difference in some dosing but effectively the same trial which is not uncommon for how a drug like this would be tested in phase three because of the size that you need to have of the the number of participants you need where i think it got interesting was um how the results were interpreted for the two arms and then what a re-evaluation looked like so do you want to explain the story of i guess let's start with the beginning this was a well-done study in that it had you know pre-specified endpoints and that's very important for people when they're evaluating clinical trials you have to pre-specify your primary endpoint you got to call your shot before you you know go to bat um right what was the what was the end point in this study and how did they go about evaluating um honestly i don't remember what what the specific primary outcome measure was so it was it was cognitive but it wasn't like it wasn't an imaging study it was a cognitive study right i don't remember if it was the 8-s cog or not to be perfectly honest the story of the embark and engage studies is i'm sorry the emerge and engage we're doing embark now which is the follow-up for the people that had previously been and emerge and engaged so the the bottom line is that the study was going along and at some point they do what's called a futility analysis to see if it's worthwhile to continue spending their resources on the drug or to abandon it and when they did the futility analysis they were not meeting their primary endpoints but after further analysis and looking at sort of a cohort of people who had dose escalated kind of in the interim they realized that the people in the high dose group actually were meeting those endpoints and so they went back and looked at all the data and in a very unusual turn of events they were like actually we were wrong and this is helping and so they ended up going back and and putting people back in the study who had previously been on it um in this new embark study as well as submitting to the fda for approval and the the numbers aren't necessarily relevant but the highest dose if i recall was like 10 milligrams per kilogram and there was also a stratification for apoe and non-apoe which i didn't understand because they were giving a lower dose to the apo e4 carriers than a higher dose and are they currently just giving everybody the highest dose in the revisit trial um i don't know if i'm allowed to talk about the current protocol okay no that's okay it's confidential but but what's interesting is that there's something that's going to happen on june 7th what is that what are we waiting for on june 7th well i just want to go back and touch on a point that you mentioned you know one of the reasons that they give the apo e4 carriers a lower dose is because of the risk of arya or amyloid-related imaging abnormalities so we know that with these amyloid drugs that remove amyloid we often will see changes in mri either edema or swelling or microhemorrhages so arya e for edema aria h for hemorrhages often asymptomatic but certainly were very significant in some of the earlier iterations of anti-amyloid drugs and drug trials that were going on and there was a distinct difference between the risk of arya and e4 carriers versus not so that would have been the reason at the beginning that that they would have been on a lower dose i believe and i don't want to speak incorrectly but i do believe that subsequently they did find with this drug that that was not happening so they may have allowed the e4 carriers to go to the higher dose yeah there was a protocol amendment they did amend the protocol for e4 to go to 10 migs per gig um so so june 7. yeah what's what's going to have what are we waiting for on june 7th everybody's anticipating yeah so the fda is supposed to render a decision about whether they're going to approve this or not and what did the advisory board say earlier in the year there were two different things so there was one group that recommended you know approval and then there was another panel that was like yeah the date is not so compelling um and recommended not so we really do not know which way the fda is going to go there is a very large push on the part of families and patients who have gone without any new treatment for this disease for almost 20 years to say it's better than nothing please approve it i know you know from an advocacy standpoint there's a lot of that going on um you know then there's some you know very strict science people who are saying you know if the data doesn't support it don't do it so we really have no idea which way they're going to go um is let's assume the fda concludes that there's not there's insufficient data and they do not approve it does anything prevent biogen from aside from you know the destruction of shareholder value is anything preventing biogen from running another clinical trial at phase three to try to seek approval with a better a better protocol that might be able to yield a better outcome no there's nothing preventing that um you know obviously it's just a question of having the funds and inclination to do so you know but that's i think you touched on a little bit earlier part of the problem that we have is that you know the outcomes the primary outcome measures for these trials aren't that great um you know there's these are sort of long-standing well-established cognitive tests but how much they move in the right period of time may not be as good as we hope the ones that focus on the cdr the clinical dementia rating you know there is a subjective component to that because that's not just a test that is a an interview and a rating that a rater makes based on what both the patient says and what an informant says and the cdr is the primary endpoint for this drug okay so and that's the thing i mean the cdr has um i think it has six dimensions to it but it's subjective as you said it is subjective and and prone to um bias from let's say a depressed caregiver who sees everything worse than it is you know we there have been studies looking at that kind of thing and you know a lot of times a caregiver who is highly stressed and depressed will over report symptoms leading to higher scores you know in the sum of boxes so the cdr looks at memory it looks at judgment it looks at home and hobbies and you know some other things and you know a raider will interview the subject well they'll interview the informant and then they'll interview the subject and um you know they'll ask about recent events tell me something you did last week tell me something you did in the last month and then part of the rating you know is based on what the patient remembers compared to what the informant said um and and there is that sort of intangible part where you know if you're kind of on the fence you could go either way even though there are very well established scoring parameters and hours of training videos and things on how to do the cdr there still is that sort of it feels like a one or it feels like a point five you know that that plays into it that that's not you know just an objective measure like an ldl level you know um yeah i mean that's that to me is the biggest challenge here is cancer progresses quickly enough and at least currently we study it in a very clear sense i mean we can debate that there are actually some limitations in how we study cancer progression and that's been i think gamified a little too much cardiovascular disease we've already discussed it seems that the best hope for a disease in which subjective evaluation is so important is to have biomarkers that are so predictive of clinical outcome that you can rely on those right in combination potentially with a clinical evaluation yeah i don't think we're go you're not gonna you can't do a long enough study to get hard outcomes right um so i mean there's really two enormous challenges in drug development for alzheimer's disease there's the technical challenge of how do you develop a good enough drug and then there's the operational challenge of how do you actually study it right and you know so going back to your question you know biogen could very well go back and do another study and use a different primary outcome measure whether it's the eight ask cog or there was a cognitive composite score that was recently used by esai for a different trial you know they got a lot of flack for it um because people accuse them of kind of cherry-picking things that worked but at the same time as you also mentioned earlier these were things that were pre-defined you know it's not like they went and just chose the best things or the things that showed change they defined in the beginning that these are the um measures that we're going to look at and made this cognitive composite based on years and thousands of patients worth of data showing what specific cognitive tests may be better predictors or may change more during a certain period than those that won't so you know i personally didn't have a problem with that cognitive composite because i thought that it was a thoughtful way of kind of rethinking um and getting good data that might be useful you know the 8s cog is just so ingrained in this field and although it certainly has a lot of utility it also has limitations and so um finding some of these better objective primary outcome measures from a cognitive standpoint in addition to the biomarkers i think certainly will be useful for for drugs moving forward so i want to kind of close our discussion amanda with something you alluded to earlier which is what does it mean to to to undergo healthy aging um it's an it's inevitable we're all aging we're all going to die and unfortunately many of us are going to die um with some form of cognitive impairment even if it is not dementia yeah so in your 20 years of practice what what what wisdom have you gleaned and and what might someone who is you know seemingly far from that learn so you know it's interesting and i i knew we were going to talk about it so i've actually been you know more contemplative in the last few days kind of thinking about it um you know there are a lot of different frameworks for aging you know the stuff that we learned in psychology class and you know some of these classic structured approaches to aging both psychological and sociological but you know i'm never one to kind of fit into one neat category i like to kind of be eclectic and take a little bit of this and a little bit of that you know but at the end of the day you know it really has to do with you know how people see themselves how people interact with the world what kind of relationships they have how able they are to let go of things that they've lost and you know how able they are to focus on the positive i think that's where i see people struggle the most as a psychiatrist and people develop the most depression is when they spend so much time looking down the road at what's going to happen or what might happen that they can't enjoy now and you know it's very interesting i can have two patients you know maybe both of whom were marathon runners and now both have parkinson's disease and while they both have disability one of them sort of centers their whole identity around this new disability and focuses on the fact well i used to be able to do this i used to be able to do that now i can't do this i can't do that whereas the other one is like well okay so i can't run anymore or i might fall if i go to the beach but i can still enjoy the sunset in a special wheelchair or you know focusing on what i still can do and trying to make the most of each day and those are the people that i think age successfully even in the face of having illness you know we all will age we all have um changes in our physical strength and our you know mental alertness and you know acuity but it doesn't necessarily disable us and even if it does the key for me really is how how that shapes our attitude or how much we let it affect our attitude i want to run an idea by you and i'm curious as to your thoughts um i describe health span or quality of life as having broadly three dimensions a physical one a cognitive one and an emotional one and i think it's safe to say that as sure as god made little green apples the first two decline with age now if you're really lucky they don't decline too too much assuming you live a long life right so if you talk about someone who's going to live into their 90s there's a physical decline that is undeniable even if you are fortunate to be spared dementia there is a cognitive decline but not it doesn't have to be that sharp and for the lucky ones you do hear you know you got the charlie mongers of the world who are literally in their 90s and appear to be just as sharp as ever but the one that doesn't appear to have an age component to it is the emotional one and so the question i've been pondering is are the most miserable people going to be the people whose identity is wrapped up in the things that inevitably decline and therefore should we be putting more of our identity in the one thing that really has no tie to age which is basically our emotional health which i i believe is most a function of the quality of our relationship so a person who has wonderful quality relationships is generally an emotionally healthy person and that doesn't mean it's a person who doesn't get sad and a person who doesn't get angry and a person that doesn't struggle but you know they they have an emotional strength to them that i think comes from this tethering to other people so so does that framework make sense absolutely i think it's it's spot-on and and exactly true you know that is so important in terms of um you know well-being is is having people you know feeling loved feeling that there are people you can rely on feeling that there are people who can share experiences with you you know social isolation is a huge problem for some people and a definite determinant of quality of life versus not i definitely see that people that struggle the most are the ones that are constantly comparing themselves to their former selves you know um i used to be able to do this i used to be able to do that i used to you know if i did that i would just be you know hiding under my covers i mean i didn't used to need these but i do so it's like well i might as well buy cute ones because you gotta have them you know and so it's it's so hard though amanda like i i i you know i think about it like we're about the same age and it's true we've already experienced a decline but it's gonna get steeper right like it's when you look at what it means to be 90 for most people at least it's it's going to be a far greater loss over the previous two decades than maybe we've experienced in the previous two decades there's a real non-linearity to it but i guess it's as good a time as any to begin rehearsing that and and i and i've i've been very deliberate about this for the past two to three years in anticipation of hopefully a long life um which because you know look i think there was a day when all of my identity was wrapped up in the in these things that are inevitably going to decline and none of it was wrapped up in the other and and the i'm undergoing an asset reallocation uh which i guess the point is we should be doing this when we still have a chance to no you're absolutely right and and that that actually is a a great point not just doing the asset reallocation but just doing things when you still have a chance you know one of the things i you know i as we were talking earlier another big thing that i think contributes to quality of life and you sort of whether people age well or not is regret and how much regret they live with and so very often i see people who come in and you know have worked really hard throughout their lives and put off this and put off that and we're just about to retire and do y z and then now well now i have this devastating disease and so you know part of what i do is educating them well you can still do x y and z you just might have to do it a little bit differently um but it also i mean personally has affected me you know my happy place is the beach i love the beach i have dreamed my whole life of being able to see you know the horizon from my bed and so you know as soon as we were able to afford it we got you know a condo at the beach it was old built in 1972 and you know quite frankly hideous at the time when we got hit but it meant that i could wake up and see the gulf of mexico um and you know we especially through the pandemic we've gone there almost every weekend just because what else are you gonna do and you know but that's something i learned from my patients you know don't wait don't wait until i retire to get that beach condo because i might not be able to use it you know i'm living now so do it now and and that's you know a something i've learned and b something i really try to impart to these people that are coming in that sort of feel like that's a hard stop like well i can't do this now because of this diagnosis and it's like well no you still can you just have to be a little more careful or you can still take that cruise but you just just wear you know i actually anytime i go to a meeting i haven't been to a meeting and you know a year and a half but you know i save all of my name tag you know lanyard things and i give them out to people i say here take this on your cruise and just put your room number or cabin number or whatever in it and your cell phone number so if you know your loved one wanders off on the ship at least they can call you or they can find out what cabin you're in um and so it's it's making those adjustments but still you know doing the things that you enjoy with the people you enjoy doing it with uh i think i think that's incredibly well said amanda um you know i've really enjoyed our discussion today and i know that everyone listening to this has as well because um i just think people are becoming more and more aware of this condition um and as you said it's less taboo it's something that people are talking about and i i do believe that um people are cautiously optimistic that the next decade looks better than the last decade in terms of actual medical treatments we have i'm still firmly in the camp of richard which is not to say that you're not saying that but that says look prevention is the best medicine for chronic disease be it cardiovascular disease cancer or alzheimer's disease but inevitably a number of us are going to slip through the fingers and the grasp of prevention and are going to need treatments and i'm hopeful that these monoclonal antibodies that can target amyloid beta or tau can be a step in the right direction so thanks very much for all of your insights today oh my pleasure and of course exercise you don't need to tell this audience no i know that's what i'm saying you know it's even if you've passed the point of prevention you know and and i know you've gotten into this in other podcasts but you know the data the growing body of data shows that even in people who have cognitive impairment or have full-blown dementia aerobic activity can actually improve scores on cognitive testing you know some of the research that some of our colleagues do through all of these prevention trials and then through these intervention trials in mci and ad silver sneakers program at the ymca um laura baker uh at wake forest is doing a lot of great stuff with this and and showing that even if you have dementia your scores will go up if you do aerobic exercise so i'm glad you said that so it gets me going in the afternoon all right amanda well thanks so much and i hope you get to uh to
