## Description

Original release date: 10/17/18

In this five-part series, Thomas Dayspring, M.D., FACP, FNLA, a world-renowned expert in lipidology, and one of Peter’s most important clinical mentors, shares his wealth of knowledge on the subject of lipids. In Part III, Peter and Tom dig into why “reverse cholesterol transport” is a lot more nuanced than what most of us are taught, lipid transport, apolipoproteins, and more. In addition, this episode highlights the complexity of HDL and a discussion about the CETP inhibitor trials.

We discuss:
-Reverse cholesterol transport [1:40];
-Lipid transportation, apolipoproteins, VLDL, IDL, and LDL particles [11:00];
-Remnant lipoproteins and apoC-III [16:45];
-Particles having sex: lipid exchange [28:00];
-Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein (CETP) and CETP inhibitors [40:45];
-2006 CETP inhibitor trial: torcetrapib (Pfizer) [54:45];
-2012 CETP inhibitor trial: dalcetrapib (Hoffmann–La Roche) [56:15];
-2017 CETP inhibitor trials: evacetrapib (Eli Lilly) and anacetrapib (Merck) [58:00]; and
-More.

About:
The Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking…and a few other things. With over 10 million episodes downloaded, it features topics including fasting, ketosis, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, mental health, and much more. 

Peter is the founder of Attia Medical, PC, a medical practice with offices in San Diego and New York City, focusing on the applied science of longevity. The practice applies nutritional biochemistry, exercise physiology, sleep physiology, techniques to increase distress tolerance, lipidology, pharmacology, and four-system endocrinology to increase lifespan (delaying the onset of chronic disease), while simultaneously improving healthspan (quality of life).

## AI Summary

Here's my analysis of this episode of The Drive with Tom Dayspring:

**1. Executive Summary**:
This episode focuses on reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), lipid transportation, and HDL function. The discussion delves deep into how the traditional understanding of "good" vs "bad" cholesterol is overly simplistic. Tom Dayspring explains how HDL's role in cholesterol transport is far more complex than previously thought, and discusses the failure of CETP inhibitors as therapeutic agents.

**2. Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Liver makes only 20% of body cholesterol; peripheral cells make the rest [01:00]
- HDL particles can transfer cholesterol to LDL particles through CETP [29:00]
- 30-60% of cholesterol in LDL particles arrives via HDL particles [41:52]
- VLDL and chylomicrons primarily transport triglycerides and phospholipids, not cholesterol [33:24]

**3. Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Focus on ApoB/LDL particle number rather than just HDL levels [54:04]

**7. Biomarkers & Testing**:
Key biomarkers discussed:
- ApoB levels [24:00]
- HDL cholesterol [46:00]
- VLDL cholesterol [23:22]
- ApoC3 [16:48]

**9. Notable Quotes**:
"Stop using the term reverse cholesterol transport - it's idiotic, it's so immensely complex" [46:03]

"What if you want to use those darn adjectives with a patient? What's going to determine what's good or bad cholesterol is what that lipoprotein gonna do with its cholesterol molecule" [31:02]

**10. Follow-up Questions**:
1. What is the relationship between red blood cell cholesterol content and FH?
2. How do different dietary interventions affect CETP activity?
3. What are the latest developments in HDL functionality testing?
