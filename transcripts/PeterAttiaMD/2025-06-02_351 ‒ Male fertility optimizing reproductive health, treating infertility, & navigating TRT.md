## Transcript

[00:00:00] If you asked me what's the theme for today, I'd say sperm matter a lot. All right, so now let's talk about the guy who comes to see you. He's been on exogenous testosterone for 3 years. Presumably there are no sperm. I would bet 95% confidence that he would have no sperm in his So what are you telling him now? How are you going to solve this problem? Oh, this is a very important point. So 80% of conceptions naturally or at home occur when sex is front-loaded as opposed to reacting to ovulation. Tell me about the impact of cold plunging and sauna and hot tubbing on fertility for men. 20 minutes 104 degrees uh three times a week would probably make you zero. What paternal age do you worry about? National guidelines for sperm donation 40 is considered older paternal age. 50 for sure, right? Mhm. If you look at risks to offspring, tell me what your impression is of the effect of any or all of the above on fertility. You double the stress on a man and testosterone level will fall and then sperm production falls for a whole different reason.

[00:01:06] Hey everyone, welcome to the drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Aia.

[00:01:15] Hey Paul, thank you so much for coming out to Austin. Peter, the man, the myth, the legend. I am so excited to be here. So, um, this is in many ways, I guess, what's going to be part one of a two-part series I hope to do on fertility. And given the complexity of it, I think the most logical way to do it would be to break it down into male fertility, female fertility. And there's obviously going to be things we talk about that'll overlap. But, um, I was trying to think about the best way to start this. And I the first thing that came to my mind was can we just explain what's involved in conception and and maybe do it through the lens of the sperm but but like how much of a how much of a challenge is this? I mean obviously there's an enormous evolutionary pressure for this to go as easily as possible but what is actually involved? So um what what what happens for a sperm to fuse with an egg? What are all the things that are standing in its way so to speak? I mean there are a lot of so reproduction is uh an incredibly highly evolved million-year process and remarkably conserved among mamalian species even among land species and water species of animals vaginas cervixes uteruses and the question is why why is it so much work for a sperm to get into the vagina especially in say water and then have to go through a cervix and then the immune system in the uterus is very active because there's a hole in the woman to the parneium to the abdomen. So, it has to be highly protected and then you have to go through the uterus. So, there's an a 10- in 12 in swim, which is equivalent to about a 20 mile swim for a human based on the size after ejaculation. Yeah. And how much distance they have to go and they do that in minutes, which is crazy.

[00:03:01] So, it's an interesting challenge that nature has kept in place for a million years. I really respect evolution and it is why we're here for you know eat, sleep, reproduce. So uh it's so basically uh with ejaculation the penis is shaped to fit into the cervix. So everyone wonders make is it getting to the right spot? It's also interesting that the semen is coagulated and then it liquefies and that's because there's a lot of species of lower filyla that they have to leave as soon as they have sex otherwise they'll get killed like praying mantises and black widow spiders. So you got to get out of there as a guy. So our ejaculates and humans are sticky. By the way, do do we is there an is there an evolutionary explanation for that phenomenon? No idea. I have no idea why you would do that. I don't know why one queen bee and you know the the the bees in the hive die after mating. I I have no idea why that's an advantage, but I guess uh you know females are prioritized in evolution and that makes sense. So there's a the anatomy is perfectly defined. So a lot of men think they're having trouble placement placing things, but that I usually don't worry about it because the cervix and the penis it expands. It forms a seal. Then there's a crypt. sperm have to go through a crypt uh a channel which is uh only a few sperm make it. So a 100 million sperm may start out maybe five million make it through the first barrier which is the cervical barrier. The vaginal fluid is acidic.

[00:04:31] How how acidic? Five pH of five and the semen is a pH of seven. It's all buffered. So as soon as that so that's as a hostile environment so it has to get out of there quickly. Soon as it liquefies there's sugars in there and then they go through the cervical path. So five million will make it. One out of 20 one out what? No. Yeah. One out of 20 makes it through the cervix. Then a hundred make it to the fallopian tube and then one will make it to the egg.

[00:04:56] Literally only a hundred. Right. And this set studies in the 50s where he had had women have sex before hyctomies and then he swabbed different parts of the reproductive tract. These are young women for different reasons, not infertility. and found these numbers and that's the basis for our move to technology from 5 million moving sperm is when we start doing inseminations versus sex etc. So those are based on the kind of numbers of sperm that reach the uterus and reach the the thing.

[00:05:28] What's really interesting is there's some fascinating research. Everyone thought the vanguard sperm wins, right? So it's the Phelps sperm that's going to make it, right? And there's a company in out of Boston called Eric's Biosciences and I'm consulting with them disclosure. U but they've discovered that sperm work in failances. So because the immune system is so vibrant in the uterus, the first round of sperm gets through the cervix and typically absorbs the immune systems and it secretes FCR receptor.

[00:05:58] And by the way, we we've referred to the immune system a couple of times now. What is it? Is it just a bunch of antibodies? Are they B cells? What what is the barrier? There's site there's T- cells, B cells, and antibodies. It's a full immune response. So it's a specific immune response. It's anything anything foreign. Wow. If you think about it like so and there's also a mucous plug that exists for 28 days a month to prevent anything from going through because it's a hole into the woman's body and parinitis is severe, right? So, uh this and the cervical mucus thins and that's to let sperm through for two days a month. It's incredibly detailed, perfectly orchestrated system. So, uh, it looks like the first round of sperm get through the cervix, get into the uterus, and they get demolished, like a failins, like a Roman failins, and maybe a second round goes through and they get demolished, and they're secretting the

[00:06:51] FCR receptor in the in the imunogabulin because that's what antibodies bind to. So the female antibodies bind to that and we don't know how many failances go through but then it's like a it's like a run up the middle and then eventually a third of sperm or fourth make it and and immune systems deactivated and they get there. It's wild. That's a whole new way and that can be measured now and there's actually going to be an assay available to look at whether you're doing this and it's they're calling it a sperm cycle almost like ovulation spermulation but it's an hour and a half cycle when the failins is working sperm are deactivating uh the immune system and then maybe they don't. So there are groups of sper there are ejaculates which is a group of sperm some of which do this well and some of which don't and that can be a whole reason for infertility. If you're not able to deactivate the system you're going to you're not going to be able to get through because the immune system is active. Let's go through those numbers one more time. About 100 million ejaculated at the cervix during 5 million get through to cervix into the uterus. Yep. 100 to 500 to 500 get to the fallopian tube and one gets to the egg. Wow. Um, the question is why why do you need so many sperm? The the classic answer I used to give is they don't like to ask for directions. Men don't like to ask for directions, but this is probably why. Let's also define what makes up the ejaculate because we've talked about the sperm. So, how are sperm made? Because an important consideration for a sperm is it can only have half the genetic information contained within all the other cells in the man's body. So, when does that take place? So, the testicle makes sperm. It takes about 60 to 70 days and it's a process called meiosis.

[00:08:35] So in a a car assembly line, you want everything to be the Model T assembly, you know, mass-produced. You want it all to be the same. In meiosis, which is unlike mitosis, you want things to be different and to be a little little easy peasy. So you get what's called re combination. And so that's the source of evolution. So the genes, the the chromosomes blend in a different way and separate a different way. And and through that process of a couple of those, you get half the number of chromosomes which is required to join the other half. But it's not always the same half. Correct. Yep. And it's loosey goosey. It's not the same as when it started. Yeah. A funny story which I think I've shared on the podcast before, but if if not, I'm sure someone will be amused by my stupidity. Um, I had to take the MCAT before doing any of the premed stuff because I had studied engineering and then decided I wanted to do medicine, but didn't want to spend two years preparing. One year taking the postback and then the MCAT and then doing it. So, I was like, I'm going to just wing it and take this MCAT having never taken a biology class since high school. Uh, and I didn't even I think I took one I took freshman biology, right?

[00:09:46] So, I am studying my heart out for this little MCAT test, and the physics and the chemistry are fine, but this biology thing is killing me. I bought this cheap study guide. I didn't have the money or I didn't want to splurge for the official study guide. Like, there's an official MCAT study guide, but the thing was like 60 bucks, but there were these knockoff books for 10 bucks. I was like, they're just as thick. So, I buy one of those and every time I encounter the word meiosis and mitosis, I assume it's a spelling mistake because I bought the knockoff book. So, I'm treating it as the same thing. Every time I see the word meiosis, I'm like, "These guys, you know, they just misspelled it, idiots.

[00:10:28] It's mitosis, mitosis, mitosis." Finally, on the night before the exam, which I still remember it was October uh, sorry, August 17th was the day I took the test, I realized they were two totally different things. There's big things. There's a big thing. Oh my god. That that that realization might have got me into med school because, you know, I think I barely I think I barely got a 10 on the biology section, which was, you know, was it's hard to get into a good med school if you get below that.

[00:10:57] Uh so anyway, I to this day I get such a chuckle out of the confusion of the nomenclature. Um, again just to explain for people, mitosis is what happens when cells are dividing in our body constantly where they're trying to create a perfect replica of the entire suite of DNA. So really, to my knowledge, the only time we're undergoing meiosis is in the creation of an egg or a sperm. That's right. Okay.

[00:11:19] Now, remind me, do do are women born with all of their eggs? I feel like that's something I vaguely remember. You're going to have you'll have a guest talk. Yes. 5 million eggs at birth. Okay. 1 million No, 5 million eggs at conception. 1 million eggs at birth. And you basically ovulate a thousand in your lifetime. Okay. So by the time you're 45, you're out of eggs. You actually ovulate. You ovulate one a month, but you actually produce 10 a month. Got it.

[00:11:44] So you lose 10 per for every one, right? So So there's a a lot of waste, but there's no they're stuck in a stage of perpetual space where they're just bing, you know, and they get older and they don't evolve really and then they mature when they're asked to at that time. But sperm are constantly renewed. So if you look at is that just a mass space problem because the testes are I mean if we if we did if we did the same thing women did would we just have to have an enormous set of testes? Is that the reason that we do that Peter? Why do you think out of the box like that? So no

[00:12:16] I'm not sure. I mean uh there's a whole issue of you know what's the source of human evolution? It's really sperm. Yeah. Because they're constantly dividing. They're constantly influenced by the environment and they're throwing off mutations and epigenetic changes. And what's most interesting for me for this talk is that whatever happens in sperm happens to offspring.

[00:12:38] That's an interesting point, right? So it's transgenerational. Yeah. So when does that mean that does that mean that the father is more likely to pass on environmental stressors than the mother? Probably. Yeah. And that's definitely been shown. H okay. So let's go back to it. So the sperm is the actual cell. Where does it get the little tail from? And what's the what is the other part of the cocktail that is? So one of the most magnificent transformations of a cell in the body is the making of a sperm. It starts with a spermatagonial stem cell which looks like other cells. That spermatogonial stem cell is actually the first and the bottom of a tube. It's there's 12 stages of spermatogenesis. That cell is remarkable. It's actually the human male embryionic stem cell. So I have a patent on that cell because if you take that cell and you put it in a niche environment like an embryionic stem cell it'll become embryionic almost like and it's it can become multi- potent. Yes multipotent we don't know about purotent but you can form tumors and you can form bone ex you know miso misoderm ectoerm and endoderm you can do all three layers of the body with that adult spermagolio stem cell. Is there any other cell in the body that is capable of that? No. I mean, there are stem cells in the bone marrow. There might be stem cells in fat, but none of this none of we we showed that the capability of the cell is magnificent. And so, I I think it's, you know, it's the source like women have eggs and embryionic stem cells.

[00:14:09] That's the male embriionic stem cell in my opinion. Uh it hasn't been taken advantage of yet with cellbased therapy, but it is really incredible what this cell can do. And a man potentially has access to this cell. all his entire life. Yep. As long as he's making sperm. So that starts out and it usually reproduces motically and then at puberty it'll go down the path of meiosis which is a is a couple steps more than is mitosis involved with meiosis. But it's the having and the mixing up of the chromosomes and the newness of the of the of the of the gen, you know, of the genome introduces mutations and stuff.

[00:14:45] And most mutations are bad and some are good. And we, you know, you don't really think about that, but we could have a long talk about genetics versus epigenetics. Actually, let's let's focus on that for a second. I hadn't considered that. So, when when the when the cell that is becoming a sperm underos meiosis and it divides, what's the fraction of times when this becomes an anuploidic sperm and and explain maybe to people what annuploy is and what's the process by which that thing gets discarded.

[00:15:14] So, if you look at uh healthy human sperm for chromosomeal content and what's correct and what's incorrect, probably 2% of them are off. They're still being made. They're just off because it doesn't really it doesn't really uh click the system to to negate it. We don't know at what level of chromosome abnormalities the system will say this is not badly defective. Yeah.

[00:15:39] Right. But I would say if you look at making of sperm, it's very logarithmic. Um, you're probably looking at one out of four that are being made, go through the epidmus, which is the next 10 days, which is a collecting duck after the testicle where it matures, gets epigenetically modified, and you'll see these these zones, different epidmosomes and things like that happening. And there's a lot of post production modification not of DNA essentially but I think there's a filter going on where a lot of the bad comes out because if you look at the chromosomeal abnormality rate in testicular sperm before it goes through the rest of the system and compared to ejaculate it's higher. It's two to three fold higher. So something is getting filter. Yeah. And just so folks know when we say annuployy we mean you don't have one copy of each chromosome. You either have none or you have two or any anything that's not one is bad. Right.

[00:16:31] Yeah. And um when annuploly occurs in um in the in the in the fusion of the sperm and the egg, is it do we know? I guess we can figure out pretty easily if it's maternal or paternal in origin. If you look at the embryo, it's it's kind of hard to tell. There are some markers of paternal and maternal origin.

[00:16:54] It depends on where you're going back in mitosis and meiosis. So they can sort of ascribe it in the embryo. in the sperm, you're really going to have to look at the sperm. And if you see a transllocation, some characteristic change in sperm and you see it in the embryo, then you know it's it's paternal. Yep. Okay. But not usually.

[00:17:11] And uh you know 98% of sperm are typically normal. In a guy with infertility, it might be 95%. Here's an example. If you have a patient with Kleinfelter syndrome, y a male with an extra X chromosome in every cell in their body or an a transgenic model with that that feature. Uh so this is a man who's XXY instead of XY. So 47 chromosomes, not 46. Yep. And phenotypically he kind of has a distinctive look, right? 10% of the time. Oh, really? 90% of the time a man with Klein filters, you'd never know.

[00:17:47] Yeah. Okay. So that's the board question. That's the board question, right? That's the Matic question. Yep. Yep. So the um All right. So in these men, if you look at their sperm annuploy, right? So every cell in their body and in the mice and the transgenic mice all have an extra X chromosome. Only about 10% will have it in a sperm.

[00:18:06] Meaning they will produce an X or a Y sperm just like everyone else. The only difference is they have a 2/3 chance of producing an X and a one-/3 chance of producing a Y, I'm assuming, instead of 50/50. Don't think we know that. That's math, Peter. That's math. Yeah. So, uh, biology is not math, remember. So, the, uh, and I had two clients patients yesterday that operated on, and they're not doing pre-implantation genetic diagnosis of the embryos that they're going to create from their sperm because the chance is not that high. So, it goes from in mice.1% chance in of normal men having xxy sperm or x anoid sperm, an abnormal sperm to 1% In humans, it goes from 1% or so to 10%. But 90% are still That's remarkable. That's amazing. It's remarkable how efficient this is. I interrupted you. You were in the process of explaining how we actually make the sperm, where the tail comes from, and the whole It's all done in the testicle.

[00:19:03] Yep. It's an amazing machine. Uh the weird question we should maybe get to is why is it out in the breeze like that? I assume it was temperature related, but why why why does it need to be a little cooler? Yeah. Yeah. Why? We've been asking ourselves in the field for years. I mean, I I I would guess because I like to make things up that it's so energetically demanding that it's giving off more heat in the process of creating something that is going to be so efficient to be able to swim 20 miles effectively. And that's very glycolytic, I'm assuming, right? Like the amount of ATP that must be generated, 75 mitochondria per sperm.

[00:19:39] That's like, you know, four. It's an electric motor on each wheel. Yeah. So, that would be my guess is you just It's an over it's an overheating problem if you tried to keep those guys inside. And I think overheating could be translated to oxidative stress which is a cause of a lot of infertility. Anyway, it's it's we don't know is the answer, right? And it is interesting that you know ovaries are inside. So men get in hot baths and they're cooked. Women can get in hot baths and they're okay. So it's funny. I had a buddy over who who shall remain nameless. And um he's he he does not have kids but he would like to have kids and we we saunaed the other day and um he went up to my freezer beforehand. I didn't really know what he was doing in I thought he was getting a drink or something and he came down with ice packs and there's two companies that do that. Yeah. He So he basically we were sitting in the sauna and he was in the sauna but he's got ice packs all over his groin and uh I immediately understood why he was doing that but yeah. Yeah. We'll come back to whether or not that's an important strategy for men in saunas who want to have kids. Um right. So so the complete sperm the first half is called spermioenesis. Spermatogenesis is the whole process. Spermioenesis is when you go from the round cell stage and and you get half the number of chromosomes and then you have to make a tail and then whole motor assembly and that is the most profound transformation of a cell in the body. It takes about 3 weeks to go from that stage and we're learning now it's a lot of it's vitamin A driven.

[00:21:02] Three weeks of the six or seven to make a sperm and then it goes then it's complete and non-modal and it's packaged. It has give us some size comparison before the tail is on. What is the size of that cell? Probably similar to a you know a lymphos half the size of a lymphosy. Okay. Or half the size of a red blood cell. Couple microns. And then the tail makes it 35 micron tail. Yeah. So really magnificent uh engineering feat. It's got microtubules in the middle and there's these sort of links to the tail. It's like a kite and the engine runs it and it tail wags and it's it's remarkable. 300 genes control movement of sperm alone. Um, you know, there's mitochondrial DNA in there, all that stuff. It's just wildly compact, 10 times more compact than any other cell in the body from a mitochondrial density standpoint. From any from a cytoplasmic standpoint and nuclear standpoint, it goes from uh histones to proteines. So there the DNA is condensed a lot more because it's got to go on the road, right? So it's got to be packaged really well to survive outside the body and be in good shape because it's you know it's the it's the transgenerational. So lot of energy in that. And then uh during the epidmus which is a collecting duct which most people don't know about. Oh sorry one other question. Where is the ATP or carbohydrate or whatever the glucose stored in the sperm? Stored probably in the cytoplasm and in the tail. Okay. And it's interesting. It's like a, you know, when you think about a rocket ship with its payload, it uses a solid fuel obviously as opposed to a liquid fuel.

[00:22:39] It's packaged for that one shot. I assume it's the same here. There's no transporters to bring glucose in or anything. It has its solid fuel, one shot. Go for broke. That's right. Yeah, it is a lot like a rocket, isn't it? It is a So that's going to bring the physics in future physics. So then there's two week period where it stays in the epidmus which is a a basically a 35 ft tubule with estrogen and and there's a lot of post post modification of the sperm. The epidmus is 35 ft if you stretched it out roughly. Yeah. And just for folks living 100 ft of tubials in the testice. The the epidmus is on the back of the testshaped organ in the back. Yeah. Yeah. Um and this we'll come to this I'm sure later. is prone to infection and that'll probably factor into maybe some of the issues that deal with fertility. Right. Yeah. Okay. So, epidemis has been relatively underststudied but it has actually become very important epidemosomes and there's a lot of modifications we don't really understand. I wrote the chapter for our textbook on reproductive physiology and um it really is a lot of work in the 50s and 60s but now we're beginning to understand like DNA fragmentation and the quality of sperm is is driven by the epidemus. a lot of the quality of sperm, not the shape and stuff like that. But two things meaning based on its residence time within the epidmus and what other environmental influences that occur there because the epidmus is not as walled off from the body as the testice is imunologically and otherwise.

[00:24:09] It's more susceptible to drugs, exposures, heat etc. Testus is very walled off. Very little happens in the testus because the cerillo cells that line the tubules have a blood brain barrier, blood testus barrier. Same as the brain. It's highly protective. It's as it's as protective. Yes. Harvey Kushing at Yale did that in the late 19th century. Took brain dead patients, injected them with dye, methylene blue,

[00:24:33] I think, and it the blood brain barrier came about when it nothing went into the brain. Yep. And nothing went into the testicle. Those are the two areas of the body that were completely immune from normal transport processes. Wow. Blood tester. So the two things that we know happen in the epidmus after production of sperm are motility improves.

[00:24:55] So so sperm begin to learn progressive motility. So they start moving forward as opposed to not moving or moving in circles which is important. And the most curious thing is they learn how to smell and meaning there's there's a there's basically a chemical signal that they need to be able to track to which I'm assuming is the egg. Mhm. So the follicular fluid. though they actually detect follicular fluid. So if you take testicular sperm and inseminate it into a uterus with insemination technology, it'll just be killed. If you take an epidmal sperm and you do that from the top of the epidmus, it'll maybe run in circles and it'll be killed by the immune system of the of the female. It has to go through that whole epidmal once it's at the end of the epidmus where it's stored. And that's how many weeks? Two 10 to 10 to 14 days. 600 million sperm live in a bucket, a a pot of soup called the Dakota epidmus.

[00:25:48] And you ejaculate from that pot, which tells you a lot about sperm quality because it can get old. But that sperm, if you put in it, will know exactly where to go and it'll move forward because it it's like a shark sensing blood in the water. One part per billion of follicular fluid can be sensed by a sperm.

[00:26:09] So that's incredible. So, it's an it is literally an olfactory sense. It's a smell sense that sperm have for follicular fluid. So, they know exactly where to go. Again, it's um it's you have to wonder how many years it took to perfect their system, right? You do have to wonder. Do we know what the chemo receptor is? This was it was published on Nature recently and stuff like that. So, it's really interesting. So it's an olfactory type receptor. Yeah. Do we have anything else that we can is there any smell, Peter?

[00:26:45] Yeah. Yeah. Is there anything like what is the what is the most noxious thing that we can smell with our nose and at what concentration can we detect it? I have no idea. Yeah. Cuz I wonder just for comparison. Give me a minute. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I've always thought about this. Um uh if I like to hunt and so anyone who's ever bow hunted especially knows that animals can smell at a level that we can't even fathom, right? Like they can smell us literally a mile away if the wind is just blowing blowing their direction. So it's it's always seemed to me like we have really really insufficient noses, right? We were given lots of superpowers in many ways, but smell wasn't really one of them. I think I I would agree with that.

[00:27:30] And it also say that if you if you block a sensory bank of the five others increase remarkably like braille I mean I'm a micros surgeon I this stuff matters a lot but I can't do braille or hearing I think you can crank it up if you lose a sense and you see that with people who are deaf I mean you know your ability to see and I don't think seeing better is really the issue but hearing and smell I think it it can crank up.

[00:27:55] So, one part per billion, this is kind of remarkable. Um, you so you mentioned that at the base of the epidmus is is basically the launchpad. How many are stored in in that? Half a billion. Half a billion. So, five ejaculations. Yep. Okay. That's a pot. And what's the time to rebuild that? You mean to fill the rate at which you fill? Oh, I don't know.

[00:28:24] Um, and the rate of the reason I'll ask is if a if a if we're going to come to this, I'm sure, but is there a frequency of ejaculation that is too much that if if a guy is say ejaculating every single day, is that insufficient to get a complete replenishment where if he's having infertility, you would say you got to move it to every other day or whatever the number is. So that's a a great extrapolation of the pot of the pot of soup idea. And so on that note, I would say typically we recommend every two days of two days of abstinence between sex every other day is to optimize, right? But not for the semen analysis. That's for conception. Okay?

[00:29:03] Because depends how old you are in your biology. But most men need a day or two to refill to to recharge completely a day or two. So that's that's why we do that. That's why we recommend that. That's sort of a generalization. And some men are fine every day. Okay. I had a guy uh once who had to bank sperm for hepatitis treatment and he was looked like Mickey Ror and he had a wooden leg and he's about 50. And I said, "You're going to need to abstain for a couple couple three days to do this seam analysis so we get a good sample. I want it to be, you know, optimized one." He looked at his partner and he goes and she looked at me. She goes, he grabs she grabs him and says, "He can't do that.

[00:29:45] He's every day. He can't do that. I don't know what he's going to do." He's like he was panicking that he had to hold off for day like I was like I said how often do you have sex? He said twice a day every day. I'm like okay. So that was uh that was great. Then I had one man wonderful orthopedic surgeon at

[00:30:00] Stanford and I asked him on my questionary say how often you have sex and he wrote 01356 which he divided once a year. Well, 0 weekly 015 like you know Avagadro's number, right? And I'm like which meant he was so frustrated that was a beautiful way to say that was the point. 01355. Yeah. So anyway the um Yes. So that's so there for a semen analysis for diagnostics for infertility when you when you abstain longer your sperm count will rise but your motility will fall because it's older. So there's a you know there's a minmax curve that you're optimizing for which you would say is 3 days would be about right when you're not going to gain that much you're not going to lose that much motility after that it starts going. So there's sort of biological variability which we try to minimize when we do the seam analysis. So 2 to four days of abstinence. That's a different period than what we're recommending for sex which is every other day. Mhm. And that's based on New

[00:31:09] England Journal paper where you looked at they looked at um I think 700 couples and they had them keep diaries. I think it was a Boston based paper. Keep diaries of how they uh had sex, when they ovulated and when they got pregnant. And then they said do what you normally do and then give us the diaries. And then they evaluated them and they found that having sex, say ovulation is day 15 of the cycle. Um when they started having sex on 9, 11, 13, there were significant pregnancy rates and every other day was the optimal interval. But even 5 days before and 3 days before there were substantial pregnancy rates before ovulation. But if you waited to ovulation and then had sex, that's about 20% of conception. So when you get the kit, don't react to it.

[00:31:55] Predict in front of it. So frontload the sex. Very important point. And why is that? Is that because there's a reservoir effect in this uterus? It's managed. Sperm survive for a day or two. So when men are under stress, if ovulation is day 15, how could a day 11 sperm survive 4 days? Does it's nurtured once it's past the vagina. But how many of them are surviving? Is it literally the lone wolf or is it the last hund?

[00:32:24] Maybe some of the sperm bind to the aviduct and wait where is remind me where the avduct is. So the uterus and there's the fallopian tubes fallopian tubes and that's the the avoduct is right below where they fallopian tube essentially. Yeah, they they bind to the endthelium and just park. If there's no egg, they'll just sit there and they'll So again, going back to our moon analogy, this is after you've done stage one, stage two, stage three, you're now out of gravity, right?

[00:32:51] Like it's actually not an energetics problem anymore. You're not death star problem, right? That's right. You've escaped the hostile environment in this case of gravity. So now it's a fun place. It's the right pH. It's warm. So So do we have a sense? This would be a very interesting experiment of um what is the longest duration that a sperm could survive for conception. In other words, you to do the experiment, let's just make it as a thought experiment. you had, you know, a large number of women that you knew were going to ovulate on day 15 and then you would have them, you know, have intercourse on day 7, 8, 9, 10, and you create a histo across those things and kind of ask like what's the bottom fifth percentile, which is the theoretical possibility. That's a good one. And then the same thing after, right? You want to develop the bell curve of the whole thing. Well, we know that once the egg is ovulated about 8 hours and then it's over. Oh, this is a very important point. It really needs to be front. If it's only 8 hours of survival, this is after ovulation about 8 hours it's dead.

[00:33:59] If it's not, this is a very very left tail curve. Correct. Ah, I did not know that. Okay. So, you want the sperm there ahead of time. So, 80% of conceptions naturally or at home occur when sex is frontloaded as opposed to reacting to ovulation. And most of the apps that are available nowadays will tell you that. Peter, you're drawing a graph. I am. I I I have to draw. And it looks like it's algebraic.

[00:34:26] This is incredible. Okay. Yeah. Just this is it's easier for me to think about these things graphically. Um and and to think that it basically shuts off at about 8 hours. So, I give some some more physiology. I um there was a study that showed how long it took to make a sperm. And it was published in science I think in the 60s. And they gave men uh treatiated water. They gave men Yeah.

[00:34:50] They gave men radioactive hydrogen. Treatiated water. Yeah. And then they biopsied their testicles, which could never be done nowadays. But I did a little different. And I gave duturated water with a with a a group at Berkeley and we gave healthy men uh durated water for a week and and then we checked the first sorry dumb question. Why didn't they just measure the ejaculate? Why did they have to biopsy this the test? Why did they just want to know about spermatogenesis? But we didn't want they actually wanted to torture the guys but and they weren't I don't know what that that's wild but that was the best data and we did duterrated water which is not radioactive and we could measure that.

[00:35:32] So we gave them a dose and then we watched their ejaculates weekly. Yep. And we looked for when duterated the hydrogen showed up in the in the in the DNA and it was an average of 74 days. So normally say three months to make a sperm. So some women were 42 days and that's making that's going through the epidmus and getting ejaculated. So that's a you know some so we talked about maybe two months in the testice and two weeks a week or two in the epidmus and then maybe a couple of weeks to ejaculate and this was all the average 74 days. So it actually changed the timeline enormously to a much faster one that uh so 74 days. So when you do anything to a man fertility wise, you you're not going to expect to see anything change for at least 2 and 1/2 months. And when you talk about full replacement of that semen, it's probably it's probably end up being 90 days when it's all replaced. The pot is replaced.

[00:36:27] Yep. So that's a limitation what we do cuz 42-y old women want now and we have 3 to 6 months. When I did a study on fixing varicus seals, which is an infertility problem in men, it's surgery. And I looked at the meanantime to conception. It was about 7 months after repair, which is two cycles of sperm production. So, let's now define infertility. Uh, again, we've been using this term quite a bit, but I I suspect it actually has a formal definition.

[00:36:56] It's one year of of inability to conceive after having after after sex, using sex. Okay. So, doesn't have to be timed intercourse. Just has to be whatever the couple does when they think they're trying to conceive. Okay. Um, when someone shows up in your office, is it usually after they've gone down the rabbit hole of troubleshooting the female partner or are people doing this in parallel? There's a large bias in Western worlds about how infertility is evaluated and it's a complex the reasons are complex. But I would say my practice is not typical. So most of my patients have been through a lot before they come to me. And typically, I think

[00:37:42] Keith Jaryy's data was good at about 23% of men get a formal evaluation for infertility before couples go through IVF in North America. And how does that differ from the rest of the world? Let's say for I don't think it's been studied in the rest of the world. But there are countries like Germany and Spain with, you know, with single insurers and government pays. And it it's also recommended by society guidelines like

[00:38:06] American Society of Reproductive Medicine, WH etc. that both partners get evaluated simultaneously. Uh but the bias is female gets very evaluated for lots of money and the men typically may get a SEMA analysis but may not. And there's it's very complex reasoning there. It's a different beast. You know, they're not part of the problem. They refuse to do it. There's a lot of denial. it does get at your masculinity a little bit to get checked out and and things. So, it does go deep for men, it can be a little bit of a a problem. Uh so, I would say that lately with large insurers coming in, Progyny, Maven, and things like that, you're seeing a lot more men up front, which is fabulous. And we can have long discussions about the biomarker concept, why that's good for the field and good for men's health and good for longevity. Okay. So, let's let's talk about um your your workup. What do you do when a guy comes in and um what are the things you want to know about him? So, getting a guy in is great. Uh usually they're dragged in by their partners. Uh usually the partners come along to make sure they show up. For me, it's one visit. So, we do one visit and I do everything else where they are where they are. I don't ask them to come in a million times anymore. So, it's a very different kind of practice, but I try to get everything done in one visit because when you get them there, it's rare to get them there. And the physical exam, so you do a history, a very thorough history, which is usually preceded by a questionnaire I give like 200 questions.

[00:39:40] And that has all the hot bath stuff and all the exposures they have. And they have to do that before they see me because that's a really important part of it. If you could pick one in a multiple choice question, what matters the most is probably the history. History of paternity matters. A history of exposures matters etc. Physical exam very important 1 to 5% of male infertility can be due to a med major medical issue testice cancer diabetes things like that. So physical exam varicus seals is very important you could be missing a vast difference uh one in 500 men have perfectly normal testicles but no they have a natural vasectomy it's congenital absence of the vast it's they're going to be sterile or infertile. Can you explain what that we haven't talked about how a vasctomy works and why a guy still ejaculates but is infertile. Explain what the vestfren how the whole thing works in the plumbing. Right. So we asked we didn't answer that question which was the what's the semen consist of. So it's about 10% vasal fluid with sperm. It's about 80% somcical fluid which is an accessory sex gland in the back of the prostate and about 10% prostate. So typically during ejaculation prostatic fluid which is clear and sticky will grease the barrel of the urethra sort of precom. Then during the ejaculation process the pellet of sperm gets pumped from the vast deference into a chamber called the ejactory duct and this happens quickly and then the seinal vesicle which is like a bladder contracts sends it into the prostatic urethra between the bladder and the the outdoor world. There's two valves. One is the bladder neck, it closes. And one is the urethral sphincter that we pee through and that opens and it gets forced out with muscular contractions.

[00:41:21] So that happens in seconds. Yeah. So therefore, if the vasins is clipped, you're getting essentially 90% of the volume. You're just missing the 10% of the volume that contains the payload. So in 3,000 men I've done vasectomies on in 30 years, two men have said, "My volume went down." And I said, "Really?" One of them banked sperm and he had a semen analysis before and after. and he did go down by 15%. And he noticed it and I said, "Good for you. What do you want to do now?"

[00:41:49] But so it can be noticeable, but not usually. And so the color is the same, the opacity is the same, the the whole process of uh liquefaction is the same, viscosity, etc. Got it. So physical exam. Um do you need an ultrasound? How are you able to detect if a person is congenally missing a vasence? This is pure physical exam. What? What? You feel it? Mhm. Interesting. So my fingers can feel 2 and a half mm and the vast difference is like piano wire. I mean it is different than anything else in the chord. So I did a study a third of my men with absent vast were were only found out having procedures until I saw them. I usually just do the exam. But it is an expertise thing. Yeah. Yeah. It's not like the PCP can figure this out.

[00:42:34] You have to be doing this all day every day. I'm Yeah. I think you need to be trained on that. But if you're well trained, it should be a purely a physical exam. How what percentage of men are congenitally missing their ve? One in 500. One in 500. Okay. The most common genetic disease in America is cystic fibrosis. So the big implication is these kids these men can't conceive naturally. They have a natural vasectomy. We use sperm retrieval techniques and IVF, but they have definitely have the chance of passing on cystic fibrosis to a child. Why? Why is that? Because the con very interesting biology but men with cystic fibrosis the most common genetic disease in America have no vast deference. Okay. So what's the ven diagram of cystic fibrosis and congenital lacking vast deference? The genes for that were discovered. It's a you know chromosome 7 there's 17800 mutations maybe 2,000. So the they cloned the genes and got the variance in the late 80s. And then they found that there's another group of men who are perfectly healthy, do not have cystic fibrosis, which is a major metabolic disease with a short life expectancy, better now. Those men had absent vast difference in the absence of disease. They took the gene sets and looked at them and they were the same, just not as many, right? So you have homozygous or hetererozygous.

[00:43:50] So you have a carrier for cystic fibrosis will have an absent, but a full-blown CF patient, cystic fibrosis patient will have no vast difference, too. So it's a form fruit of cystic fibrosis, but it doesn't have all the chemical and metabolic side effects. So in other words, when you identify a man who does not have CF with a congenally absent vas, there's a very good probability he's a carrier of CF. Yes.

[00:44:14] And you can usually define it which we can genetically test easily. Okay. Yeah. And then you have to worry if if there's a 4% chance in America anyway that a partner might carry it. There are two carriers. You have a one in4 chance of having a very affected child. So that's the big concern in my practice and I'm

[00:44:30] I'm proud to say in 30 years we have no CF children. Okay. You know it's all about good engineering and doing it right. So so that's the that's the vast difference part. What else on physical exam are you looking for? So cancers, infections, epidenommitis. Yeah, tell me about epidmmititis. Obviously anything that interferes with that section of the journey is going to be critical. And remind me, is it EBV that we typically or measles, mumps? What's the what's the infection? Mumps. Mumps. Okay. But that's typically Yeah. So among viruses in the world, there aren't many that get into the testicle like other things.

[00:45:06] Very little gets into the testicle. Similar to the brain, but the MS virus does it about a third of the time when you're a child with MS. You know, the parotted gland infection. It's a glandular disease. So, it really only matters when you're pubertal and you get MS and then it goes to lots of glands.

[00:45:27] Go to your pancreas and cause diabetes. It can go to the salivary glands. It can go to the testicles. It's a it's some kind of there's an open time open, you know. So, just one more reason why everyone should really get the MMR vaccine when they're a child is like we, you know, not notwithstanding the tragedy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. of of children dying from preventable diseases. But this is this is another non-lethal but significant complication of the Absolutely. And it will cause um viral necrosis and edema of the testice and the similar to a brain. It's in a calvarium, right? The brain is in a fixed space. So when it swells, you got to do something because it can it can die if it swells too much. Testicle is a fixed cavity with the tuna. And so if it swells too much it necrosis and then you get fibrosis and then you get sterility and it's you know I've got techniques where I can find sperm in lots of these men very little pockets but most of it you're ablating the testice it's going to scar and die from eskeemic necrosis.

[00:46:27] So Zika, Ebola, these are I mean the CDC called me when these were coming around. Zika, you know Zika has been transmitted through semen. It causes the anastphily issues with uh ch and when these when these pandemics recurring Ebola 2. Um I got a call that there was an Ebola patient who survived when the institute survived the hemorrhagic fever and then uh a year later transmitted Ebola to a partner who transmitted to six other men and it was another outbreak in South

[00:47:00] Africa. Meaning the patient that survived Ebola, the virus managed to survive in the testes somewhere. Okay. But was transmitted sexually a year later when he was well when he was asymptomatic. He had already developed immunity. Right. So there are we don't know about testus but we know that mumps will do that to the testus but there zika is also persistent in the semen.

[00:47:23] But in that case you have to think they would h wherever the virus hung out it had to be very very immune privileged. Yep. Huh. Or at low levels like low viral loads where there's no disease. I'm not sure. But these are concerning cases. But then it was transmitted at a low viral load, an even lower viral load, right?

[00:47:45] So it's tricky and there may be bulb u glands, maybe it's some vescal. It's hard to know, but yeah, it's it's getting away. So but most viruses don't go there. So the big one would be CO, right? What what did CO There was a big deal about the the um the AC receptor being in the lung and being in the testicle and maybe CO infection would make you sterile. There was one Zika paper in nature that looked at if you infect mice or was it rats with Zika the testicles shrivel up and they get infertile and that caused a huge scare in the field. But we really didn't see it. We maybe see it in we don't see it in fertility. And what is it about the

[00:48:24] Zika virus that does this? We're not sure why it did it in rats, but the it's a blood test this barrier thing. It's an amazing barrier and nothing really gets through including viruses, but MS does only at puberty and Zika does. We Zika does in animals, but we didn't see it in humans. But I thought you said that Zika was leading to anphille in cases. Yeah, but that could be seinal. That could be just in the semen itself, not in the sperm. Like Ebola is probably seinal, not testicular. It's not on sperm. It's around sperm or in the fluid.

[00:48:54] That's the conclusion so far. So COVID the big worry was when this Chinese paper came out like oh my god it's going to the lung binding to the AC receptor it's Testol has it too it's going to make men sterile forever and there were cases of infertility with bad infections and you know was that just the fever which typically does it even after a flu or was that COVID specific and we didn't know a couple of colleagues did some papers one which impressed me was at Cedars was a bunch of men maybe not reproductive of age died with fluoride COVID. So they got autopsies and they looked for virus in different locations in the body and I think out of 10 men or seven men one had it in the testicle. So these are the men with the worst infection ever, the highest viral load you can imagine and only one of them had it. So I I believe that there is a risk of it. But I'd say in the thousand men I've seen since co I think there were two cases that that I would say were unexplained where men were either fertile or had normal semen quality had a bad co infection maybe hospitalized and 3 months later sterile. So I think there's a low and tell me there what is the phenotype of their sterility aside from the presentation that says I can't get someone pregnant. really means no sperm in the semen and typically if you measured the signals to the test that's literally what it means I'm sorry okay so literally no sperm in semen they stopped produc okay understood y right so so it's a it's a primary problem so the third thing we do history physical semen analysis is a third fourth would be hormones and that's what we check in men too because production of sperm is driven by the brain so nothing happens to sperm being made without the brain telling it what to do similar with eggs and controlling it's a homeostatic mechanism with negative feedback.

[00:50:45] Classically, anabolic steroid users. Yeah. Which I want to talk about in detail. Um can we go back to semen analysis? Um you're looking for obviously the count and the motility. What else do you look for? So in the semen analysis, there's several features. I consider it sort of a poker hand. Uh there's a volume. How much of the semen volume? There's a count concentration of sperm. That's numbers per mill. And then there's motility, which is percent motion. you do a forward progression. So, how good is the quality of motion? And typically some measure of shape called morphology. There's three liquid issues, liquefaction, aglutination, uh, and viscosity. And then you look for other cells that aren't sperm. They're called round cells. And either they're going to be pus cells or immature germ cells that are early ejaculated early.

[00:51:33] And presumably you want to see fewer of those, right? There's a number like less than a million is normal. Okay. So if you ask me, how do I look at a seam analysis? That's a little different. I look at that as a poker hand with each card has a meaning, but they have a look. So if you said, what do you mean by that? So if the volume is low, it's one of five things. You're always going to find something. It's at the collection error. I call it first sample syndrome. Guy's not good at it, right? You know, it's like, okay, I got to put it in the cup and I got to stop doing what I'm doing and okay, you know, so so you do a second sample and then there's low testosterone can cause it.

[00:52:08] There's an absent vast difference which means you have an absent seminal vesicle, there's a jacktory duct structure. And by the way, do you ever have that on one side and not the other or is that always okay? Mhm. Yeah. Know it's very variable segmental. Yeah. And so there's five real issues. So when I see a low volume semen as a surgeon and as a do I mean I'm going to find something. So that's really good. Other than that the seal is a I I I think I've been published as saying it's a blunt instrument for fertility. Unless it's zero. You can't really say much about their fertility because people conceive at all levels and people are there scenario you know obviously you rattled off a whole bunch of parameters that you can access there but are there certain null states that don't exist where everything is amazing but this one thing is horrible like do you see scenarios where everything is remarkable perfect motility but bad morphology or perfect morphology isolated isolated you do see isolated things right so one of them is called I call it syndroic sperm shape problem so you can have perfectly normal semen analysis count, motility, volume, progression, and the sperm look terrible. And so there are rare conditions, one in 5,000, where you might have globospermia or two-tailed sperm or pin head sperm. So if you look at shape, 4% should look normal, which is terrible. We can have a whole discussion about why 4% of human sperm being normal is normal when 99% of animal species in the wild have normal looking sperm. But it's all a construct, right? It's all a construct of who someone decided what normal is. But in men who have large abnormal forms, like 4%'s normal, if they're 1% normal, and you look at the abnormalities, I'm sorry, I'm still confused on that point.

[00:53:47] Are you saying that in a you would consider it perfectly normal if only 4% of the sperm are morphologically perfect and 96% are not? And that means the 96% that are not could be pin head, could be double tail, amorphous or tapering. Going back to the original, that's that's a as a mathematician that's not a great number, is it? No. And if you look at marine species, 999 look perfect in the wild. Yeah. And presumably that's because their environment is so much more hostile. Like they're doing this all in the ocean. I don't know. But it's it's amazing that we're that good with the spermmit. But again, it's a construct. It's like putting stars ordering stars in the universe. Cassopia someone named Krueger said this is what a normal sperm looks like and but we know that two-tailed sperm have double I mean it might be the two tail might not be the worst thing in the world if it's just extra rocket boosters. But what about the pin head? What does the pin head imply? It means there's no nucleus.

[00:54:42] It's a tail. So that's a true problem. Yeah. It's like a little tiny head and moving along. So if you if you if you rule out if you if you give somebody credit for their two tails, what's what does your normal go up to from 4%. Oh, it depends, but maybe 20. Okay, so there's still 80% that most of them are going to be amorphous. Head's a little rounder, heads a little narrower. Those are called stress patterns. And things like hot bads and varicosils and smoking will do that, which isn't that bad. So in the case of 1% normal, you got to look at the 99%. Because that's not the story. The story is in the other half the other chunk, right? And if they're all looking the same, then it's syndroic and then you have a problem. I see. So the more homogeneous the failures are, the more likely that you have a clear ideology and that's hard to fix. I mean they'll fail with sex, they'll fail with insecinations, they'll fail with IVF.

[00:55:36] They'll fail with IVF. Yeah. They'll fail with IVF Nixie. And sometimes with globospermia where they're called lollipop sperm, they just have a big round head with no acrosome. There's all nucleus and there's some of the components. They'll just bounce off an egg. They'll never work, right? They'll never work naturally. And to get them to work with IVF, you have to single sperm inject them into the egg and then shock the egg with calcium do a calcium or polectrics to get it to to to actually fertilize because it also introduc the sperm is important with fertilization. Not only has to bind but it in the calcium channels are regulated by sperm and what shuts the doors to polypermy in an egg is calcium activation. This is the reason why even if you launch a hundred sperm at an egg, it's only one that can get in because the first guy that breaches sets off the calcium channel that shuts the I mean the Star Wars space analogies here are are just phenomenal, right? Million years. A million years no more breaches in the hole. So there so morphology can matter a lot but it's very rare. So, I'd say twice a year in my practice, I'll see this because everything's failing and everything looks normal and they ask me what's going on and I'll look at it really closely and say, "You have this issue and there's not much we can do to treat it." Now, we're going to try sperm sorting technologies which are out new on the market, micrfluidics and things like that. And I've been throwing that at them. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. And is that something that we know the genetic underpinning of?

[00:57:08] We're getting there. PLZA deficiency is one of them recently discovered that that runs the calcium channel which tends to be associated with a certain look like global spermia. So it's coming around. Think about that for a second from an evolutionary perspective. That that is the single least desirable genetic mutation you could acquire.

[00:57:30] Yeah. Unless you're not making sperm. Yeah. But but this is a dead end to the genome. Right. Right. So, does that mean it is only an an acquired mutation, never inherited? I mean, it can't be inherited presumably unless it's homozygous, but even still, that's one of the 50 we throw off in each generation. 50 mutations. God, that's just incredible. I think what I would like to emphasize in this podcast is how fluid evolution actually is. And it's sperm driven and it's transgenerational. So if you ask me what's the theme for today, I'd say sperm matter a lot. A lot a lot more than we've given them credit for. All right. So let's talk about so so basically just rounding out the seaman analysis physical analysis on the semen analysis.

[00:58:21] Um what if motility is the problem? So I look at in my poker analogy of the hand if everything looks good but the motility is low I think of short-term toxins. So um not severe um severity. So things like uh exposures, so medications, um I think about habits, pot smoking, hot baths. I think about behaviors, lifestyle, I think about so so I look for an exposure in that individual basically picked up on the history varicus seals and exposure. Um things like that. And if the count's down and the motility is down, it's I think of a more severe exposure. So it's, you know, it's there's a there's royal flushes and there's four of a kind, there's two of a kind. So I would think of more of So I my goal when I see that seam analysis and see that patient is to figure out if he's not normal, why? And by the way, do you get that analysis the day he's in the clinic with you or is that something you follow up on an appointment with?

[00:59:26] Pretty much have it in my hand when I see them. Either they give it to me or I get one. I want that there because that's when I look at them, I'd like to have that in front of me to say what kind of poker hand are you playing? And this is something that's standardized and automated through micro micrfluidics.

[00:59:41] How is the how is the assay actually done? So the guy ejaculates in a cup, takes it to a lab. Oh, I mean so it used to be done manually. Okay. And now it's done with hemocytometers and it's done with machines, computer assisted semen analysis does most of them in IVF groups. So it's it's really standardized. Oh yeah. I like the, you know, I like the bespoke suit. So, I like the handmade se. So, when I have mine repeated, I usually have someone do it by hand because there's observations

[01:00:09] I like, which is, hey, you know what? 1% morphology, but all the others look like this. Those comments are incredibly valuable that you don't really get from a computer assisted seam analysis. But it's faster and you don't have a lot of human effort involved with the computer. And are they using AI for this yet?

[01:00:26] Yeah, I mean some people are for sper sperm selection a little bit, but yeah, there's a lot of stuff to help out and that will be really helpful for morphology to standardize it because one man in Krueger in South Africa correlated bad sperm shape with IVF outcomes and did not find that they were good when the sperm looked bad. That's where the 4% came from. But it's really hard to do that every time and do it well because it's so hard to do. Well, hoping AI, machine learning can help standardize the look because sperm, you know, it's just it's hard. Yeah. Given how good AI is at image recognition, this should be this should be like this should be a one foot putt. Yeah. Um, okay. You mentioned hormones. You were obviously alluding to LH and FSH. Um, what else are you looking at?

[01:01:11] Testosterone. Normal amounts of sperm. Yep. You need proper amounts of testosterone and FSH. Think of it as flowering a plant. you need the water and you need the sunlight. So if testosterone and FSH are key to get normal amounts of tea, testosterone, you're going to need LH which drives it. Same in women, you know, they these these are all named in women and females. So um that signaling is really important. So there are cases of genetic infertility like Coleman syndrome where men aren't making any sperm, but they're just not sending the signals down and you can just give them the signals with injections. Sorry, these men are not making FSH and LH, so they have virtually no testosterone, right? Okay. Nor sperm, but you can give them signals. Yeah. So, hCG, FSH injections, and they will be fertile.

[01:01:57] Oh, so if you gave those guys So, is the problem in the pituitary, not the hypothalamus? No, it's uh it's the alactory node in the hypothalammus. So, they don't smell either. So, could you give them Clomid and would they make No. No. Puitary is not not working. Yeah, it's the G&RH is the G&RH is not. Okay, got it. Um, what about estradile? Does it play a role? Yeah, so estradile is often estradile is sort of a mild poison for male infertility. So, everyone needs estradile level, female hormone levels.

[01:02:29] Uh, testosterone gets converted to estradile. So, that's a byproduct of it along with DHT. And then estradile goes back to the brain and is a feedback. So, if it's there, the brain knows how much testosterone it's making. So if there's too much estradile, the brain senses it's a negative feedback senses, hey uh there's too much of this, so let's make less testosterone. So it will lower your testosterone to have high estradile.

[01:02:52] When estradile is made, it gets metabolized differently than testosterone. It goes to the liver or to fat and aromatases convert it to something else or testosterone gets converted to female hormone aromatasis. So you can get high levels be being obese or having liver dysfunction. So alcohol, you know, alcoholic cerosis, hepatitis, it'll rev it up and it'll make a lot more estradiol level. And there's some medications that do it, too. And that will act and lower your testosterone, which will lower sperm production because you're not watering the plant. If you correct for testosterone, so in other words, if a guy has normal FSH, LH, and testosterone, is there an estradiol level by itself that is problematic? Not usually. Okay. So, it's really only high estradile in the context of suppressed testosterone. So, that's when you would act on it. Yep. If you see that there's a low count and the testosterone is low and you could say you need to lose 100 pounds which is the the key secret for everything right which is but you can also give aromatase inhibitors like weightlifterss use to keep their levels down. Okay so those are four big pillars anything else besides the history the exam the analysis and the hormones and then so you usually do two seam analyses three weeks apart or more to get a sense of things because it varies quite a bit.

[01:04:04] So an a lot of a lot a very important point is that the seam analysis any feature of that seam analysis vary by 50 to 100%. So never make a decision on one seaman analysis. It's really hard. Yeah. Especially if it's the first one as you said for all the right potential. So I I can do a lot of consulting for the FDA and they do you know they do they do medications in reproductive age men and they're trying to show the seam analysis. They're going to the FDA and they're saying can you help us interpret this data for the FDA? said garbage in, garbage out. I mean, there's so much variability you really can't say anything. It's really hard to get. So, you have to do at least two samples and it still varies quite there's there's interobserver variability. Who does the seam analysis? There's biological variability on what your system's like.

[01:04:48] So, that's the big problem with studies is that what percentage of drugs that are going through an FDA approval process are having uh a semen analysis as part of the evaluation? I don't think many. So, why is that? uh because usually the indications aren't reproductive age reproductive age men or women for some of them. If they do they'll do animal models. They won't do human studies do animal models. They'll do beagles. So mice and beagles and if there's no fertility effects they don't really look at semen analyses in those.

[01:05:18] They'll look at fertility effects in animals. If there's nothing there then they'll probably not require human studies. If there's any suggestion of a problem in the animal models which is a million dollars of work. So if you ask me why I patented the surrounding stem cell, I want an in vitro test for human infertility that we could use instead of animal models. Save the animals, save a million dollars, do an invitro spermatogenesis model and see where the if there's an effect at all. It just seems to me that in this day and age with people reproducing at older and older ages, we we shouldn't just assume that because we've developed a drug for blood pressure or diabetes that it's not going to be used by people with fertility. I'll give you a silly example. Have GLP-1 agonists been tested for fertility?

[01:06:07] Okay. Well, because it's sort of an off label use of a diabetic medication, but it's no longer off label. It's an on label use today. But it looks like it might be even but even if it was on label. I mean I'm just using that as one example of a drug that was initially approved when we thought ah this is going to be for people who are not having kids. But the truth of it is you're going to have lots of people that are trying to reproduce on many of these drugs. Absolutely. And you know there are 80,000 chemicals out there that have are not been studied reproductively that are commonly and used in industry.

[01:06:36] European commissions are a little better off. They they've screened them and they've warned about them. But America Mm- Why is that? I don't know. It's attention to detail. It's one of those things that just doesn't I don't know. Is it under the purview of the FDA? Yeah. Or the EPA? Probably a combination. Or maybe everyone's thinking it's the other person's job. I'm not sure. But they're untested and they're out there. Well, why don't we just talk about some of those things then now? So, so this is

[01:07:05] I'm sure kind of a a contentious topic, but um as you know, um there, you know, lots of discussion around microplastics, right? So, um I don't know how far we want to go down that rabbit hole. I I recently did a podcast on this topic. I didn't really touch on fertility because I just didn't see any great evidence. I talked more about things where I thought there was a little bit more evidence.

[01:07:27] Obviously with the microplastic story there's there's quite a bit of smoke but there's no real fire. My conclusion from the analysis was there is enough smoke that take steps where they are reasonable and reduce your exposure to these things. So everything from microplastics to PAS chemicals to uh even phalates and um and even the PM2.5s like there's no reason to expose yourself unnecessarily to this if you can take relatively straightforward steps eliminate 60 to 80% of them in your life do it. Um tell me what your impression is of the effect of any or all of the above on fertility.

[01:08:05] So although sperm are made constantly and are susceptible to that, we know the testicles a pretty good place, excuse me, and insulated from from exposures, I am also I also think there's a lot of smoke there and there needs to be it needs to be sorted out. But especially with the 80 60 to 80,000 chemicals that are being used that aren't really tested at all. I I think the only way to know is to do do you know stem cell in vitro testing as much as you can before you put it on at the ID investigational drug stage not at the final stages for clinical trials but early on do it so you're screening them way in advance of getting it to clinical trials and where the money gets big but I think that men there are windows of susceptibility in men unlike maybe with women whose eggs are constantly exposed to toxins s men have windows and one of those windows is birth and early development the first 12 weeks of life. So there's a good early when when all organ systems are developing including testicles uh I mean

[01:09:11] Shauna Swan did this one with maternal beef consumption uh estrogenized beef consumption their sons had lower sperm counts when they were 20 years later or something. So so I think that's a window of susceptibility. I also think um you know puberty is a window of susceptibility when things turn on. So I think if exposures in those moments are probably going to matter the most to men. I don't know I don't know about other times. And what is your advice to a guy when you're giving him counsel on everything he can do? We're going to talk about everything, but on this particular domain, if he says, "Hey, should I stop drinking Starbucks coffees in those plastic cups with the plastic lids?" And do should I get a reverse osmosis filter in the house? Like, where are you telling him to draw that line?

[01:10:00] I'm not great at that because the stress level goes up so much, and I think the stress counterback balances any amount of microplastics you save. You double the stress in a man's testosterone level will fall and then sperm production falls for a whole different reason. So my my my tes my testosterone level when I uh left residency Oh, I bet. Um so how old was I? 33. Should have had a pretty good total T 220 nanogs per deciliter.

[01:10:30] Did you measure LH? Um was probably low. Yeah, I'm sure FSH and LH were totally low. I don't remember what they were free testosterone of like three to four. You're well the sleep deprivation. The stress the So what does stress do? Stress is the sympathetic nervous system. It's fight or flight. You're running from a woolly mammoth. It doesn't know what you're running from.

[01:10:50] It doesn't know whether it's sleep or travel or financial or emotional. It's just the body. We are cats and dogs. We have the same binary nervous system. Either you're on or you're off. And when you're on, do you want testosterone? No. You want cortisol. You're running for your life. And do you want fertility when you're running for your life in any species? No, you're trying to save your life. So cortisol goes on, testosterone is nowhere to be found. Fertility is nowhere. You turn off all that stuff.

[01:11:18] Then when you outrun the woolly mammoth and you're behind a rock and you grab the berries and you catch a nap, boom, testosterone shoots up because it's rest and restore and you have to rebuild for the next run. And how quickly do you think that occurs in humans? How quickly? Yeah. How quickly can that days easily? We can reverse. Chronic stress is is it. It's not We love acute stress.

[01:11:39] All species love acute stress, right? We love that starvation, intermittent fasting. It's really healthy, but not low-level chronic stress, not connected to your computer, not your emails, not the workday that never ends. Terrible for us. And the best manifestation is erections because erections will fall if you're under stress, too. Penis has a mind of its own. According to Da Vinci,

[01:12:01] I had a guy come in, you know, um, he came in, he was like 25 in San Francisco, a startup guy, and he comes in, he says, "I got to see you." I said, "Why?" He said, "I lost my erection yesterday." He's 25. He said, "First time?" He said, "Yes." I said, "All right, come on in." So, he comes in and he's got his act together. Looks good.

[01:12:23] And I said, "What happened?" He said, "You I just I just lost my erection. I It's never happened to me before. I think something's wrong. I said, "Okay, tell me about yourself." He's just getting his a- round of funding. He's traveling a half a million miles a year. He sleeps like three to four hours a night, if any, and he's constantly running. And I said, "Congratulations. Welcome to the human race." This amazing the first time. Yeah, I know. He's like, "What are you talking about? You're not impervious. Stress stress has its effects." So clearly the fertility women who are sort of marathon run oh the great study was a moderate exercise moderate exercise men uh I wrote a blog on this called can you be too fit to be fertile moderate exercise uh went to extreme exercise measured as 2 hours a day of vio2 80% maximum capacity so pretty heavy workouts for 12week periods so moderate to extreme and then back to moderate sperm counts fell by 40% % went like moderate to extreme and concent sperm testosterone fell by 50% and then went back up. So that's a kind of a and there's also military studies of men under acute stress during uh during you know hell weeks and and training where they were taking their testosterone and

[01:13:38] LHS and they were dropping by about 50%. With severe stress and that's okay for a day or two or a week but when you're doing it chronically we're not built for that Peter we're not built for chronic stress that's a longevity issue. Yeah. Um let's talk about the use of anabolic steroids. So um or let's let's talk about it more broadly with sort of the three most commonly used approaches to testosterone replacement. So the the way

[01:14:09] I see it is the three most common approaches are using either clomophen or clomophene using hCG or using exogenous testosterone in one of its derivatives. Would you agree that those are kind of the big three? Okay. Uh we'll just briefly highlight for everybody why each is a little bit different. Exogenous testosterone, you're just giving testosterone. The body senses it and immediately shuts down the hypothalamus. All natural production. Yep. So LH and FSH will go to zero. Testosterone will be as high as you want it to be. It's there's no limit to how high it goes. had a couple of people on this podcast who have blown my mind with how much testosterone they've talked about taking. Um, not clear how that's possible, but nevertheless, they're doing it. Okay. Uh, hCG is synthetic luteinizing hormone. So, you give a person hcg, they will make testosterone, so it's endogenously produced, but they're making so much of it that they'll also suppress LH and

[01:15:10] FSH. So LH and FSH will come down, testosterone will go up and then clomophene or inclapine block the signal of estrogen at the level of the hypothalamus. So the hypothalamus thinks, oh my gosh, we need more testosterone. It ramps up FSH and LH production, which has the same effect as making more testosterone, but you'll now see high normal FSH and LH. Yeah. And the two the two different classes are the LH and Clomid versus testosterone.

[01:15:41] Unlike testosterone shutting off the natural production, the LH the hcg and the clomophene and clomophene will stimulate natural production. So you keep your testicular size, you maintain your fertility, whereas the others you're going to shrivel up your testicles and not maintain your fertility. And you can't generate levels that you can with the exogenous testosterone with these. You'll never get to 3,000. You can't do that because it's it's tightly regulated. So, question one, if a guy is taking exogenous testosterone, and let's just say he's been on it now for a few months, is he able to create sperm?

[01:16:20] Not 95% chance he's not. Wow. While he's on it? Yep. Understood. But can he create it once he stops? And we'll and we'll definitely address that. But just to be clear, even a couple of months on exogenous testosterone in any form, injection, topical, oral, whatever, you basically have shut off the ability to make sperm because your testes themselves have shut down, right? No signals, right? No gas to the engine.

[01:16:49] Now, there's some it's nuanced, okay? So there's there are formulations that are topical that are less potent that way, less inhibitory than injectables. So there are variations in the spectrum of exogenous testosterone that will maintain some of your fertility. there are formulations at least the um I don't want to go so far as to call it the marketing material but for lack of a better term the marketing material is suggestive that the more frequently delivered varants so for example the intraasal variant which is delivered three times a day the oral variant delivered twice a day have less of a negative impact because they're producing far lower surges than if you did a weekly injection is that what you're referring to Yeah. So they do more physiologic they're in the normal range more. What gives you side effects from testosterone including sterility is too much. Yeah. So in your experience has that borne out? Yeah. So men you've seen men taking nodesto three times a day doing a nasal keeping their sperm count. Keeping their sperm counts. Okay.

[01:17:55] That's interesting to note. What about the oral testosterone the twice a day? Love it. So and dec testosterone nec and decano8 and it was not available in America for 50 years. It was available in Europe and a couple of researchers at UCLA a husband wife team beautiful um decided what happened was we were worried when we took oral testoster right to the millary system and go to the liver cause liver cancer so it was always verboten even though there was no evidence this was happening in Europe for 50 years.

[01:18:28] Yeah, they wasn't not much. It's FDA approved. The EA approved it. So the uh so this group came up with a way to get it metabolized through the lymphatics. So it can absorb through lymphatics and never hits the liver. And it's really good. I mean there is a non-response rate of around 10%. So 10% of men, some like gels too, 15% won't respond.

[01:18:51] There's groups that won't respond that well, but it is really good. And you get nice. Oh yeah. You know, I'd be interested to hear your experience with it. We have prescribed it now to maybe a half a dozen patients. Um, one of the silly challenges we have with it is we actually have no idea if they're therapeutic because trying to get their blood drawn to figure out when to draw their blood to actually see the level. For example, if a guy takes the drug at 8 o'clock in the morning and then at one o'clock in the afternoon, which is sort of what we're told is a great window to take it so that you get that mid dose mid dose, right? If he does his blood draw at 7:00 the next morning, he's been 18 hours off drug. He has unmeasurable testosterone. He's going to show up at 200. He's going to look like I did 50, 20 years ago. His

[01:19:40] LSH and FSH are still completely suppressed because that doesn't go away over 18 hours. Um, but you know, I don't know what to I don't know how to interpret like what is he walking around at during the day, which is what I care about. It's hard to know. I mean, um, usually you don't want to do it right away, too. So, you want to give them a couple weeks to to stabilize hemistatically, right? But usually you can get pretty good levels because the halflife isn't that short.

[01:20:05] They say it peaks in 5 hours. So, I don't know what the halfife is. The halfife would be probably like 12. More like 12. We wouldn't dose it at 100% decay, right? You have a dose it at 50%. Yep. So you So he's probably not responding. We can check it at different times, but it's probably not much of a response. And what are you dosing it at?

[01:20:26] It comes in 100 and 200. So it depends. I usually go to the mid dose 298 twice a day and then you can double it or go half whatever. I usually start out at not the lowest dose. Yep. Um and it depends what you're trying to solve too in the problem, right? If you want them, you're not going to get them to 800 or,000 very easily. You can get them, you know, four, five, 400 to 600, 600, 700 pretty pretty well, but no side effects. I haven't seen anything that maybe a couple dozen men really well tolerated. Interesting. So the So this is not something you used when you're trying to get a guy from 300 to a,000.

[01:21:03] You could, but not probably not the first choice. Yeah. And now you're taking 500 twice a day or something crazy like that. Yeah. Yeah. And twice a day is a big deal for men. It is. Yeah. And what about the testo? How are you are you using I've never No one tolerates that. Yeah. What What's the experience like? We've never used it.

[01:21:20] Well, have a flu and try to get your testosterone level up. You can't do it. You have to spray in your nostril each nostril three times a day and it's gooey and it's gel-like and I I just men within a week will call and say, "Can't do this." Yeah. We've had more luck getting women to use this. Maybe. Yeah.

[01:21:37] Yeah. Um, okay. So, let's go back to the big fertility between the two types of testosterone replacement or supplements. One is sort of we'll call it the natural ones versus the exogenous ones is the side effect profiles differ widely. It's very difficult to get polyythemic or thickening in your blood with the physiologic levels. It's just doesn't happen very often. I don't think I've seen it once or twice. But if you take testosterone exogenously, you're at risk for polyythemia or blood thickening. So testosterone stimulates epipotent in the kidney, you make more blood. Athletes love it. But if you go on a long flight and you're dehydrated, you're going to throw a clot. And people look at it for longevity and it's like be careful.

[01:22:24] Yeah. Because I've seen 70-year-old men want longevity in taking this stuff and then they have a clot and they have a stroke and now they're 71 and they're not that the whole And do you find that that that that the clot risk is proportional to hemoglobin hematic risk simply and what at what level are you saying it's time to train it's time so I mean the studies aren't broad but

[01:22:42] Ramasami just did another paper on it and that the most significant event occurring with testosterone replacement or or supplementation is polyythemia and events And so I you know the high level for hemoglobin is 17 matric 50 uh you start seeing events happen about 18 and definitely at 19. Yep. And um are you one of the things we do with patients who are injecting testosterone cipionate is and we have some patients who love doing this. I think it would drive me nuts if I were trying to do this. They inject it every day. So they'll do 10 to 15 milligrams every single day and it actually produces the same effect which is they don't have the polyythemia because they don't they never hit these crazy peaks. You know 10 years ago everyone I saw that was prescribing this was prescribing the standard was 200 milligrams every two weeks which was crazy highest risk.

[01:23:38] Yeah. Um so what is your typical injection schedule once a week or two twice a week? And I think twice a week will you you can have the dose right if you do it. So that is a little safer but then it becomes the intensity and so just I can't do it like that or whatever. I want a pellet instead. So do you put pellets in? Oh yeah. Yeah. I do them all. Yep. And what's your do you find that the pellet also I don't know the kinetics of it but I would imagine you're pretty super physiologic for a month or so maybe. Yep. So pellets are like the um long-term contraceptives for women. Yep. you know, in the arm, they put it in subcutaneously. We put it in the butt and it's a couple minute procedure in the office and it gives you, you don't have to worry about anything. There's no compliance issues.

[01:24:21] We don't have a lot of side effects or consequences from it. It's done with a troll car and a thick needle and you get, you know, quick pretty quickly within a couple days, you'll get a level and and then it'll slowly decay pretty much half of it by 3 months or so and then the rest by four to six. Supposed to be a six-month physiologic level, but normally it's four. Yeah. four or five and um you know men feel great for a while and they can feel it because it's slow but it is even and you do have this risk of polyythemia and things like that but there's a three-month period of risk and then usually there there's when you're in the normal range it kind of goes away so I don't see a lot of consequences with that if it's 6 months

[01:25:00] I really don't so let's go back to the the clomid hCG route what is the um uh what is the extent to which fertility is preser preserved when a man is on one those agents. So, Clomid is we give it for fertility all the time. So, I'd say very good. Yep. It might even improve it. HCG depends on the dose. So, like you said, high doses suppresses. So, you to be normally fertile, you want LH and

[01:25:26] FSH going to the testicle. You want the water and the sunlight. You want the testosterone. If you've got the testosterone, but your FSH is, if you don't have any sunlight, you're not going to bloom. So, I usually add Clomid to HCG if the dose is above 1500 units three times a week because that's going to start suppressing the FSH and Clomid will keep it going and then your fertility is preserved. 1,500 three times a week of hCG is a whopping dose. You're saying beneath that you typically don't have issues with FSH and

[01:25:55] LH suppression, right? Well, LH you will because it's LH. Yeah. But not FSH. Not maybe a,000 to 1500 you start seeing it. Okay. Um, so that's why you protect the fertility. Yep. And you will just give And what dose of Clomid will you give on top of that regimen? Depends. I mean, usually half a pill a day. Pill half of 25, half of 50. 50 milligram pills. Yes.

[01:26:19] Usually half. You'd give 25 every day. These are staggering doses. I'm How How are these guys testosterone getting? That testosterone is driven mainly by the hCG. So I I shoot for the normal range of 500 to a thousand. I don't Yeah, that's I'm not an anabolic guy. I'll nail today. Yeah, I know. It's interesting. I mean, we don't you we don't like clomophene at all. Um just because

[01:26:47] Well, there a whole bunch of reasons, but they have to do with kind of lipid stuff. But even when we would use it, we would probably use 50 three times a week. So that's about the same, right? 25 a day. Um but for most guys, that would be sufficient alone even without hCG. But you're saying okay well it's the hCGs that's driving the tea. We're just trying to protect it. If you said what do you give on isolation as monotherapy? Yeah. What would you give for clomid 12 and a half to 25 typically depending on how sensitive? Do you prefer Clomid or and Clomophine? Do you

[01:27:18] So it's very interesting. Clomophene is really good. Um it's an interesting FDA story. So uh Clomid is not approved for men and Clomophane is neither. uh Clomid's approved for women and Clomophine is not approved for either. Uh can clomophene's compounded Clomid is available for 50 years. So a lot more data and once a cis cis isomer and was a trans isomer. So they're different and the estrogenic effects are slightly different. Um so I have enormous experience. I have 560 men on Clomid and

[01:27:48] I have um fewer on in Clomophane. But uh it was developed for older men to preserve preserve their testosterone levels as they age because the signaling tends to get weaker. The pituitary tends to get lazier and this is to keep your testosterone levels up more physiologically than taking testosterone. So it went through some very good randomized trials that were published. This was clomophene or clomophene and they were done by reputable people in the field and published and then it went to the FDA for approval for secondary hypogonatism sort of age related changes not not primary testicular failure in age related androgen deficiency of the aging male or atom right FDA sat on it for a couple years and said nope why good question so it's published they're good trials it's safe. It's as good as Clomid and um they didn't approve it. And I think it's hard to know, but I think the reason was that there's such an uproar about testosterone in America right now and the FDA doesn't like what's happening.

[01:28:55] What happened is you can you can you can advertise your drug to the consumer now, right? So you know all the the you know the um biological response modifiers for psoriasis you all all those drugs go on and they give you 5 seconds on the benefits and the lesions go away and then 25 seconds of side effects right so you can do that if you do that with testosterone what you hear is you falling asleep after dinner are you not as athletic as you used to be are your erections not as good as they used to be there's 10 questions in the animal questionnaire and everyone is going to be like yeah everyone who ages has those issues right so it's like nobrainer. If they go on TV, they're going to want this stuff. So, the cat's out of the bag and that's they're stuck. And so, now when any testosterone trial comes back, they're going to point out the FDA makes sure that we point out the dangers of testosterone replacement.

[01:29:47] Okay. So, this is part of that energy, which is um you know, we don't want another testo. I think there's another reason, Paul, and it's everything you just said, but hcg and testosterone are schedule 4. True. Which means you cannot prescribe them through like these testosterone clinics that don't even see patients and, you know, are literally just not not being doctors, right? They're just sort of giving it to anybody who shows up and pays. It's a coin operated testosterone dispensary. Um but Clomid and I assume by extension and Clomophene are not scheduled, right? Which means you can coin operate those. And my guess is that's probably why the FDA is saying what it's saying is we don't it's already bad enough that the Clomid cat is out of the bag. But given that we we don't want to put another one of these unscheduled drugs out there in the in the land of uh sort of shady medicine and it you know the indications are pretty clear and they're really safe.

[01:30:52] You know, I I they're really safe drugs and I I like the my my effect is someone comes in who's young who maybe wants kids, hasn't had them, and they have a low testosterone of 220. You measure their LH, which no one does. It's low secondary hypogonism. So, it's not a testicle failing, right? It's a signaling issue and that's probably stress. So, I said, "Get rid of your stress." And they say, "How do I do that?" It's like, "Okay, so exercise, acupuncture, massage, or yoga." I mean for men I say physical activity is the best thing for sex. So as an aside during co I had two groups of men. They said what do I do? My life's a mess. You know everyone's life's a mess. So half of them had drinks at 5:00 and started drinking a lot and the other half went out for runs or got a pelaton which most of the country did. That's a great story. And then about six months later these guys realized it's not working and they started shifting over to exercise.

[01:31:46] So I was very proud of them. these guys I was really happy with. Like nice because that's the best way to handle stress is when you have no control over things. Go for a run, go for a walk, get out there. It's so good for you. It's just de decompressing hold. Get your mind off something, anything, surfing, whatever. So, um, they don't do that.

[01:32:07] So, I said, "Well, let's do this. I think what's happening is this. I think it's your stress. Um, maybe try traveling less or whatever." And then I'll give them clomid. I'll say, "Let's try this for a couple for 3 to 6 months and let's see how you feel." Sometimes it's sexual health issues. Erections aren't typically that dependent on testosterone. Typically, it's other things. And so, if that's the issue, and

[01:32:30] I'll say, I I'll I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Maybe maybe you were higher before and we don't know that, but let's do something pretty safe and easy and I'll I'll I'll double your testosterone or triple it. Let's see how you do. And then I'll check in with them at 3 and 6 months. How you feeling? I feel great or hey it's not working. I feel the same. It's like well it's not testosterone related. Whatever the symptom is you're having you you wouldn't have it with a testo. We know levels of testosterone above which you should not have symptoms right. We know libido we know erections. We know fertility things like that. And what are the approximate levels for each of those? I don't know. Erections I would say the best studies about 290. Yeah. So most guys that are having difficulty with erections are above 290. there's some other issue usually, but you have to prove it to them. And I'm fine with that as long as it's safe, right? And that, you know, you're convincing them with them. Libido, I'd say 350 is sort of a range. It's pretty sensitive.

[01:33:24] And it's it's harder to call because libido is driven by so many different things. Fertility, I'd say 300 is a good one. You start seeing issues. With how much FSH and LH, I don't know. Okay. And then obviously the other thresholds would be anabolic capacity like muscle, you know, muscle mass and things of that nature and and mood tends to be a lot more variable in my mind. Absolutely. I I think there's myths around testosterone and those are some of them.

[01:33:49] Testosterone is an is sort of a Morgan Taylor an equilibrium story where if you're low you have symptoms and you're low those symptoms will get better when you go up but then there's a point where it flattens out and no there's no increase or improvement in symptoms are classically ascribed to that there are there also it's a linear relationship between testosterone that would be blood and muscle y so more is better for making blood doping and also blood doping and also for tes for muscle. Absolutely linear. Yeah. And what I Yeah. I'll tell you why I find that interesting, Paul. And I only learned that really in talking to bodybuilders who were taking 500 to 2500 milligrams of testosterone a week.

[01:34:33] Because my initial reaction to that was, you've already saturated the androgen receptor probably five logs. I mean, not five logs, but like at least one or two logs earlier. Why? How would you still get a And but they convinced me. No, no, no. There's a real difference between 500 and 1,000 and 2500 in terms of muscle mass. Um, which it sounds like you agree with and and I I don't understand the physiology of how that's possible. I don't I mean, how many androgen receptors would you need to you'd have to upregulate them when in fact you'd be downregulating them? So,

[01:35:04] I'm not sure, but it's not it. So, the effect is indirect. The effect of testosterone muscle mass is indirect. It's not that you're going to do it and create mass. You don't just create mass. What it allows you to do is recover from injury, right? So if you push the system and you need two days to recover, you can go to one day, you can push it again harder. So that's what testosterone does in in the in the primitive world, right?

[01:35:26] If you're a caveman, there's even studies that show, by the way, that high enough doses of testosterone will will increase muscle protein synthesis absent the stimulus, absent the lifting stimulus. So it it's the potential to recover that is improved. I'm not sure that's receptor-driven at all. like it might be several pathways going on that are logarithmically better, but it allows you to push the system and go back and then push it again and that's how you build muscle. All right, so now let's talk about the guy who comes to see you. He's been on exogenous testosterone for 3 years. So he was given poor advice three years ago. He went to some shady, you know, back alley website and they just, you know, he was 27 years old at the time. He just wanted to I mean this is tragically a very common story by the way, right? So this guy's been on 200 milligrams of testosterone a week for the past three years. He's now 30 years old. He's met the love of his life and lo and behold that he can't seem to get pregnant. So he's in your office. During the history, you find out pretty quickly. He's been on 200 milligrams of testosterone for 3 years. Tell me what his uh sperm analysis looks like. Do you see there are no presumably there are no sperm? I would bet 95% confidence that he would be have no sperm and a semen. Okay. 200 milligrams a week. So, what are you telling him now? How are you going to solve this problem? So, it's funny because a lot of guys come in and they're they look good and and I when I examine I'll say, "Are you taking anything? Are you taking because they never put it on their medications, right? You never write it out on the history. You always have to get it out of the if they look if they're super jacked but then they have shriveled testes." Yeah. And they're zero and they're wondering what you know, right? So, I will look them in the eye and say, "Are you taking testosterone?" And I'll look them in the eye until they answer. And if they look down and and they don't say anything, I know they're on it. If they look me in the eye and say no, then I know they're not. But they'll always look away cuz it's it's this verboten thing. So, this is the same, by the way, as I'm sure you experienced as a resident in the ER. The people that come in with foreign rectal bodies and abdominal pain, that's the one thing they emit from their history, right? It's like they tell you, you know, this is the last time I ate. This is this, this is this. But then you get the X-ray back and there's like a candlestick in their colon. And then you say, what about Hopkins? What about this? Yeah. Yeah. What about this candlestick? And they're like, oh, I totally forgot to mention that. Yes.

[01:37:51] Yes. That it was lit when I went in. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So um typically I'll say so my theories about this is if he's why is he taking it? So if he's taking it for anabolics and you know he probably has a pretty good idea and I I want to send you give you a little research we're doing on the lifespan of anabolic storage users. So remind me at the end of the story to give you a little brief about what I know about that. But um so I so when you take so how he takes it matters. So if he's been in constant use injectables, that's the most suppressive of fertility. And if you turn a gland like a testicle off long enough, it's off. So I gave a lecture to the anagramrin society on recovering men from hypoganism in young men. And I asked them a question at the end because

[01:38:42] I my whole procedure comes from steroid users. I I I take notes when the anabolic guys come see me cuz they're really smart and they know a lot about reactions, biology, not everything, but it's a science. Some of them are PhDs. I took notes for years and it came up my approach uh along with what I know, right? So, it's very much in concert with concert with them. So everything I say is sort of built on a large experience. Uh and it's called getting off the juice the blog and I have people read that blog, do it and say get about 80% of the way and then call me and say

[01:39:17] I need help here now. I'm here. Yeah, we'll we'll link to this in the show notes. It's pretty cool getting off the juice. And there's a PowerPoint in it. So the recovery is usually possible in young men, but it depends on how much they took, how long they took it, and how they took it. If they do it like a cycling effort, that's the best, right?

[01:39:37] So, if you cycle steroids, you recover the pituitary, you get back to normal, and then you hit it again, that's actually quite smart. Constant use is not constant use for longevity or whatever is not a good idea for fertility. So, that's going to be much more suppressive. Injections are worse than orals or any gels. Mhm.

[01:39:55] So, the next thing is how long? So, I asked the Endocrine Society since I answered all their questions. I said, I have a question for you. Can you turn a testicle off like in a thyroid or an adrenal gland? If you suppress it enough, can you turn it off for good? And they said, "Yeah, that's a board question of ours. We can do that." And I said, "Because we believe it's always reversible in the field of infertility in men." And they and so that got me a little worried. And so now I kind of worry about 5 to 10 years of use. After 5 or 10 years of use, you may not get it back. Either the ability to make sperm or the ability to make testosterone native. So we typically tell men in our practice um don't you know 2 years would be the absolute ceiling maybe are we too conservative maybe okay depends on dosing and everything right if they're doing 250 a week no I mean in our practice it would be 50 twice a week yeah I did a study published a study when I was a fellow in Houston um of a guy who took it for 25 years and we drove at him with gonadotropins as hCG and FSH and we didn't get anything. But he had testicular. No, we got a a low number of sperm back. And I just had a guy from Louisiana come in 25 years of chronic use. I did a mapping procedure to find sperm in his testicle and he's going to be having a kid. But he made a couple of sperm after and that was a record for me. But you pump him full of hcg and synthetic FSH and get nothing.

[01:41:16] And then you have to look in the testicle because the production can be low enough to be there but not coming out. But this is the rescue protocol. It's LHFSH. Basically, there's three ways to do it. One is never stop the testosterone suddenly. Interesting. Because men will hit the doldrums and go and they'll flop over like they have the flu. They'll feel like [ __ ] and they'll get right back on it. They'll feel terrible because they have nothing going on. If you take the testosterone away, their system's turned off. They're not making their own. It takes time to get the system to reactivate. So, that's the hardest. So,

[01:41:47] I always taper testosterone over over what period of time, six weeks typically. You have the dose for two, have the dose for two, and then off for two, and then you measure. And that's like getting out of the white water into the green the green wall a little bit. So that's a little smoother. So taper.

[01:42:01] And then I offer them two options. One option is taper alone. Taper with Clomidor and Clomophane, which is a little quicker getting the pituitary to turn back on. So that will that will soften the blow of the feeling of feeling completely fatigued or more aggressively hCG and and Clomid. Okay. Um, and I guess at about six weeks or and there's no So, it's it's interesting. If you give Clomid, the pituitary will make FSH and LH. Yeah. It doesn't shut off. It takes a while.

[01:42:36] Well, that's a way more cost effective approach than giving syn because synthetic FSH is pricey. Yes. Couple thousand a month. Yeah. In America. Yeah. So, is there any reason to do that over the Clomid approach or is it just that it's faster? I think you might gain a couple of weeks of time. Okay. So, for most people, that's not price worth with that taper over a month or two. I usually check their tea levels at around two weeks off of the last testosterone.

[01:43:00] And that's the lowest they'll be. And if they're in a good range there, that didn't you can use that as a predictor of their response. If they're good if they're in a normal range. Oh, really? Okay. So, you we we want within a couple months to see them back to 600. 300 would be okay. to make sperm. Okay. All right. But then to get them to where they want to be depends on their symptoms and what they're happy with.

[01:43:22] You know, I'm not sure. I'm not You won't know. So, you wait longer to see how how high you can get them. That's the lowest they'll be, but they'll be off of testosterone. And if they go along that taper and they're not tolerating, I try to tell them, don't go back. Just stay there cuz time will help you. Yeah. And you're not going to feel maybe that great. But try to do this because if you don't, if you go back, then we have to start over. But if you can just maintain it for a while, you'll feel better. And some of them dip a little bit, but remarkably most men do really well with that taper. Now, before

[01:43:54] I want to get onto some other topics here, but just to close the loop on this, do you ever advocate kind of crazy ideas for guys that are using testosterone to use lower doses and then combine it with hCG? Just as we were talking about the Clomid plus HCG approach. Okay. So not not an unreasonable approach to combine clomid with testosterone at low doses to preserve testicular function. I operated on a man to a testicular sperm retrieval on a man who was aospermic for genetic issues and he was on testosterone for 10 years and because he needed it. He was his testicles were failing and I said you're not going to make sperm on this.

[01:44:35] So, we put him on um HCG, which didn't do anything for him. Felt felt terrible. And did that for a year, and he said, "I can't do this anymore." I said, "Okay." Or maybe it was 6 months. And I said, "I need a little more time for you to be off testosterone, but since you've been on HCG for 6 months, I What do you have on?" Like 3,000 times a week. 3,000 three times a week. That's a whole vial a week. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

[01:45:03] Then I I said, "Okay, let's add in a lowd dose tea gel, testosterone gel to get your testosterone up, and we're going to lower the hCG to 500 three times a week, twice a week." And I did a sperm retrieval yesterday. Boom. Plenty of sperm. How old was he? 35. Interesting. So you can you can maintain whatever's going on in the testicle with hCG and take any testosterone you want.

[01:45:33] That was a that's an important lesson. Yeah, it was. Now here's the here's the catch though. The caveat is it was done in I think Finnish bodybuilders. They were doing a cycle of steroids huge amounts. They took lotto hCG 500 twice a week. And John Amry has worked out in Washington has worked out all the exact doses, but 250 to 500 twice a week is a good dose for that. It keeps your intesticular testosterone high, keeps your sperm production going. And they went on both concurrently for 12 weeks, and their sperm counts were normal the whole time at any dose of tea. Now, what happened after that is people start saying you can preserve your fertility on testosterone replacement, which is possible. They missed they missed half the story, but it was only 12 weeks. And if you're doing it for 3 years and you miss your dose of hCG, boom, you're done. You're cooked. You're going to go to zero. So unopposed testosterone without it. So you have to be 95% compliant. And do you think that there's a difference between hCG and Clomid in that effect as the adjunct? The Clomid doesn't work even near HCG is the one.

[01:46:36] Yeah. Okay. Clomid doesn't improve intericular testosterone levels like HCD does. It's ineffective. Got it. It will potentially make you more recoverable. If you do it 80%, you'll be zero. Even though you're you thought you might have a sperm count, but your recovery will be faster because it's done something. But the only way to maintain your current fertility is you have to be 100% compliant with dual therapy. You can't go on monotherapy with testosterone.

[01:47:04] Outside of fertility, given the popularity of testosterone replacement therapy today, is there another advantage to just doing dual therapy? Obviously, for fertility, we wouldn't be talking about it. But can you think of any other reason why it might be advantageous if a guy can deal with the hassle and the cost? Yes, depends on the indication though. I mean, if everything but fertility, like any other health benefit, I think muscle mass. So, with aging, it's a great one.

[01:47:32] I mean, you know, it used to be like growth hormone with uh age wasting syndrome, things like that. I mean, muscle mass is a key for men, right, as they age. But I'm saying as opposed to just being on testosterone injectable to to to do the dual therapy versus just monotherapy. No, you mean and if you're going to do some kind of therapy, if you've committed to doing therapy, no, I

[01:47:50] I think I think the only reason would be if you want testicles to be big, I just volume. I just created a new procedure to make testicles larger naturally by putting a fat injection in the hydroal space in men on testosterone because they don't like their small testicles. So it's the equivalent of the Brazilian butt procedure for the testes. Yeah. So it's all natural and there's no prosthetics and and that you can't tell and it looks it makes them nice and big and it's all test is fat grafting and it's fabulous. But that's Medicare. No.

[01:48:20] Yeah. Um creatively approved. All right. So let's shift gears and talk about other modifiable factors. Um let's talk about heat. We've talked about it a little bit. So for fertility. Yes, for fertility. So tell me about the impact of cold plunging and sauna and hot tubbing um on uh on on fertility for men. Okay. So the test says outside the body. Yep. It's 3° cooler than the rest of the body. So 95 versus 98 degrees

[01:48:49] Fahrenheit. And then there's a reason for that. Unknown. We had that conversation. don't really know why, but uh it may be that it's an imunologic sanctuary and that's the only way to do it and that God or Dorman could figure out. But um if you heat up the testicle, it's also close to the skin. So it's a radiator. So when the heat comes down the arterial blood, it has to cool. So it raises and lowers. And there was a journal in the there was an article in the journal of irreproducible results about 20 years ago. A man went to Big Su and wore nothing and he measured ambient temperature and he marked on his leg with a marker where his scrotum hung, how low it hung and he could tell the ambient temperature by how high or low his scrotum hung. He became a thermometer. So, so it does go up and down. Is that Peter Tia laughing?

[01:49:39] Journ of irreproducible results. Oh god. Really cool. But it showed that it's very temperature sensitive, right? And it goes up and down to regulate it closer to the body when you want it warmer, etc. You go into a cold shower or a plunge where your testicles, they're way up there in my abdomen. Yeah. And that's all the cremic muscle and it's all temperature driven. So it spends all of its time regulating its temperature to stay at 95. Now saunas, baths, hot tubs, jacuzzi, steam rooms change that, right?

[01:50:07] The worst one of those is anything underwater, submerging underwater because you're one centimeter away. You're a liquid. It's a liquid. You're going to turn that temperature. Maybe not the in part inner part of your body, but little kids going into hot tubs, right? They overheat. So testicles will certainly overheat. So you get into a 105° hot tub, which is a very typical temperature for a hot tub is 105 to 110.

[01:50:32] You're saying within a relatively short period of time, your testes will assume that temperature? Absolutely. Yeah, you're 70% liquid and this is right at the surface. So I did a study, published it in the Brazilian Journal of Urology, very I published 200 studies. This was the hardest one to get in. Everyone said we know that it affects it affects fertility. So I don't we're not going to publish it. So American I went to

[01:50:54] Brazilian Journal of Urology. It then went to the New York Times as a press release. That's how popular it was. It's probably my most cited paper ever and it's certainly not my best. It's very interesting. I took infertile men with low sperm counts and stopped the tubs. They were in hot baths because I used the word jacuzzi. Jacuzzi called me up and said stop. Don't use that word. So I don't use that word. So hot baths or tubs. And I told them out and they went up 300%. Their semen announce semen quality went up 300% total motor count in 3 months or four months and 600% at 6 months. So you know you have to give us some time and that's that curve right the recovery curve. And we didn't look at fertility. We just look at that recovery and some men were zero and went up to close age range of these men 35.

[01:51:41] So fertile men. Yep. Trying to conceive. Yeah. These are men who are not able to conceive. You're making the diagnosis. I think it's your hot tub. Let's get you out of there. And they have a six-fold increase in sperm count. Total motoral sperm count meaning count motility mainly driven by motility. Interesting.

[01:51:58] So it's motility that the price the biggest one but also count might have doubled may have gone up threefold kind of thing. So sixfold increase overall. Then I calculated after that I calculated a lethal dose of tubbing. So what's the lethal dose 50? Yeah. So lethal dose to me means you're zero. Yep. You do it enough you have no sperm.

[01:52:19] And it came out to be 20 minutes of a hot bath or tub. 20 minutes 104 degrees uh three times a week would probably make you zero. Wow. There have to be a lot of guys out there who are spending at least 3 * 20 minute sessions in a hot tub that's at least 104 degrees. Yes. A week. And the highest group, the biggest interesting the largest group of people in tubs in

[01:52:46] Northern California we did the study were environmental lawyers. I don't know. It's like is your job that stressful? It's like yeah it is. I mean it probably is in California. All right. So then then I think there's been studies that was the I mean the only study ever done prior to that was a PhD thesis at Vasser College where someone had a guy dip their testicles into a a bucket for 20 minutes at really hot and looked at their sperm counts or their fertility and they went they went they was the only and I couldn't even find it wasn't published I had to go you had to figure out this thesis thing but that's how little was written about it and they gave me so much flack for publishing this it was really funny and The New

[01:53:25] York Times had an article said, you know, it drew it drew a condom and it drew birth control pills and it drew a guy in a tub. It's like pick your contraceptive. So, it's huge. And I asked it I'd say 10% of my population's in it. Then the next question is what about saunas? So, saunas is not underwater. It's not submersion, but sauners are you're in a you're in a hot room. You you you're going to it's going to affect it. And I would say the effect is one quarter to oneird as profound as a hot bath or submersion. So my friend was absolutely right to have those ice packs on his scrotum.

[01:54:00] He's think he's reading. Yeah. He's listen protocol. Yeah. And then I would say steam rooms, showers are probably fine. Yep. Because you you're in an ambient temperature is normal. And I think steam rooms are probably between saunas and you know, it depends how much time you spend, but it's probably not normal, but not a hot bath. Hot baths are terrible. Okay.

[01:54:21] Okay. And then what about the cold? I don't worry about cold. I remember Surfer magazine called me and said um you know I know the California surfer, right? LA surfer and they they said uh the editor of Surfer Magazine called me said are are surfers infertile. I said is that water bad for them because

[01:54:39] California water is 60°. And I said no I have never met an infertile surfer. So I don't think it's bad at all. All right. So the cold is okay. Especially plunge where you're talking seconds. Yeah. Yeah. you know, your testicles are going to go up and you're you're going to be able to maintain that heat. I think if you did it all the time, it would probably be bad. Yeah. Because enzymes work in the testicle at that one temperature. They work optimally.

[01:55:04] Okay. Let's talk about exercise. You mentioned one example of exercise that can be problematic which was I believe you said in a study where men were ramped up to 2 hours a day of exercise that was above 80% of V2 max which is pretty strenuous. Um that that was enough to put a dent in their fertility.

[01:55:25] Um tell me about riding a bicycle. I'm a biker. Uh, I have old vintage bikes that I used to race in Connecticut and I had them rehabbed and they're all Italian and they're all steel and they weigh a ton and the seats are from Brit Britain and they've got 10,000 miles on them and they weigh 4 lbs as much as just like a

[01:55:44] Brook saddle these leather saddles and you know all all worked out and it's like that saddle nowadays is about half the weight of a of a carbon bike, right? So, but I love it and I'm I was thinking of maybe going senior league and doing this gorgeous steel frames and and and trying to keep up with those guys because it's not about the bike really.

[01:56:03] It's like when you get golf clubs and I got $150 set of golf clubs. I'm going to be as bad a golfer with thousand clubs as so it's really about the biker. But there are some differences and you know in terms of the momentum and the wheel force and all that but I love my old steel bikes. So, um, and they see this and I hang it in my office when I come to work in the morning and I bike in San

[01:56:23] Francisco and then I have this seat and it's like you you that's a bad saddle. And so the issue really is that the the it got started that biking was bad for reproductive health with a Spanish competitive cycling study. So competitive Spanish cyclist to France caliber cyclists were look their sperm counts were examined. But what was the control group? Did they have a control group of runners? I don't remember. I don't think so. So in other words, it could have been the exercise that was the it could have been the intensity of their exercise. Not a good group to study. Yeah. Their their anabolic so their sperm counts were low, their morphologies were off and they're extreme athletes. So it's so we know that and we know maybe they were on drugs, maybe they you know it's a big industry. They're super fit certainly exercising two hours, right? And so they said, you know, look at these guys who are really healthy and look at their sperm counts. But this other data didn't come out. So I did a blog called cycling into childlessness and I looked at a a more comparable study which was British commuting cyclists. So everyday people bicycling to work in Britain on different saddles and you know and I looked at their fertility and their fertility was far better than the average Brit. So even if they were taking some hit off the bike it was probably more than compensated for by their healthy lifestyle which included probably riding the bike. But obviously there's a healthy user bias because anybody who's riding their bike to work is probably consuming less Guinness, fewer fish and chips, smoking less. In other words, riding a bike is a proxy for being healthy. But in spite of that, it didn't offset that health risk. At least unless we found people who were equally healthy who I don't remember what they controlled for, but I think they did a lot of the socioeconomics.

[01:58:07] Okay. And it was just it may just been activity, but the bicycle. So is this a myth? Yes. Now if you said am I worried about bicyclists? Yes. So I worry about sexual health. I worry about the podendal nerve and I worry about seat anatomy. So the best seat for a bicycle. So if you're biking a lot that's good.

[01:58:25] If you're biking and you're getting pelvic numbness y that's bad. So you so you need to get a better seat. The best seat was studied by the the NAC the NA uh I forgotten it was it was Dr. Schrader at the NIH. The best seat is uh you know the saddles that are shaped like this are bad for your sitbones because they come into the middle where the arteries and nerves are to the penis. So it's an erection issue. Those aren't good saddles. The saddles with the two little tongs that hold your iliac crest bones with no nose. Y perfect. Right. So it's pressure where the pressure is outside facing leaning in. So we gave those to police in

[01:59:04] Washington, the the bicycling police down in like National Cathedral area in the parks and they all gave the seats back a week later said you're not doing this. And he said, "What's going on?" He said, "We don't know where the seat is. We go sit down and it lands somewhere. You have to have the nose for bicyclists cuz they use it to guide where when they sit down, they use it to guide where they sit." So the best saddle is flat or gel in the back cut out in the middle and some kind of lean in like this. So cut out saddles and then you should get it you should get your bones fit. So you get a you can do this online. You can ask them to send you a pressure pad and you sit on it and then you send it back and they measure the distance and there's only a couple of different saddles maybe 12 widths that you could do and you get it done. Or like me you use a saddle used for 30 years and it's perfect but it weighs 4 lbs. But that's cuz it's a leather saddle and it fit too. Yeah. Yeah. No, they're iconic. Um, okay. Let's talk about alcohol specifically and uh and let's talk about any other uh recreational drugs. Yeah. So, fertility wise, I'd say, you know, the government wants men. I'm just talk about men to, you know, less than two glasses of alcohol a day is okay. They consider four binging.

[02:00:22] Now, alcohol is um a small molecule. Goes right into the brain, goes right into the testicle. It's definitely a poison, right? It it goes everywhere. It's the testicle doesn't limit it. So, I worry about it a lot. The effects I see are direct when it's abused. So, I would say I you see morphology, motility, and count issues. So, that's a direct effect as a direct toxin because it gets it's one of the few things that's into the testicle. Second would be a hormonal effect. So alcohol use uh tends to cause the liver to rev up.

[02:00:56] Tends to cause more estrogenization. So you tend to get low testosterone from that. So it's a hormonal effect and a direct effect. Any evidence that it's having an epigenetic effect? God, I probably No, I don't know about evidence, but I'm sure it does. Um let's talk about common recreational drugs. Let's start with marijuana. That's the worst player for me. Um so THC same thing count motility morphology so it and and it probably has an effect we know it has an effect on um fragmentation which is a quality measure of sperm not only the way it looks descriptively but quality and also probably an epigenetic effect. Some of the early studies on sperm epigenetics showed alterations with with nicotine and with pot. What I don't like about

[02:01:38] POT is um depending depending how you ingest it and however you ingest it, you get a peak, you feel it, it goes away, you feel it's out of your system like nicotine, but it's but it sits in fat for a month or 3 weeks and it it's a depot effect and it keeps coming back. So you get a lowle toxicity which I don't like at all. So I am not a fan of pot. The other thing that really concerns me about pot and reproductive age men is I wrote a couple blogs on this called the weed worries and it there's some compelling evidence from epidemiology in two studies 10 years apart validating each other that uh the chronic pot uses associated with testice cancer and we think that that's causal. I don't know. It just worries me. Weed worries me. interesting given that it otherwise seems, you know, kind of benign. I personally can't stand this stuff, but um you know, I know so many people that use it so frequently that seem to have relatively few interesting phenomenon.

[02:02:40] It's medical marijuana, right? So medical means safe. But I asked someone, you know, I have a lot of pot growers in the Emerald City up in Northern California and they have the artisal stuff that wins awards and stuff and it's like which is worse for driving, being stoned or being drunk? Undoubtedly being drunk. Yeah. So it looks like reflexes, but you know, like he said to me, well, we tend to stop at stop lights and wait for them to turn. Yeah, exactly.

[02:03:06] Yeah. I'm not saying I'm not saying that one is I'm not saying that they're both that that you know driving stoned is good, but but there are probably far fewer people that die at the hands of u of a stoned driver than a drunk driver probably. And I think the signs, you know, the the uh LA story signs in in

[02:03:22] LA, you know, like they like, you know, they have the lit up signs about open season traffic. Remember the movie LA story? The they do say now stoned, you know, drunk or stoned, watch out. Yeah. We're going to get you. What what do you think is the mechanism of action by which THC is having these negative fertility impacts? Not sure. Um I don't think it's the mechanism. I don't think it's the root. So I don't think it's toking or or you know or edibles, but it might just be the chronic exposure. And

[02:03:49] I don't see there's some evidence that THC acts like LH and binds to the receptor and neutralize and and and blocks it but blocks it from LH. So you can get low testosterones but it's not it's not been that profound. Mhm. Uh what about nicotine either synthetically or in the form of tobacco? Uh bad actor uh at high doses I think too. Um either one. Yep. Okay. It's nicotine is nicotine per se is the issue and it doesn't last as long as THC. Uh it does have you know count motility effects and fertility effects. We think probably both of these are anti are oxidants.

[02:04:26] It's the oxidants that do it. It's oxidizing things. You mentioned diabetes earlier as part of your history and physical. Um what is it about diabetes? Uh is it the high levels of glucose? Is it the microvascular damage? Is it the inflammation that typically travels in parallel with it? Why why is type two diabetes a risk factor for infertility?

[02:04:49] Probably all of them. I don't think we know exactly, but I'd say that um I diagnose diabetes a and a lot of infertile men I I make the diagnosis. What's the physical finding you're seeing in the testes that tells you like you know how an opthalmologist will often make the diagnosis because they're looking into the eye. So for me it's usually their weight and their count motility or low.

[02:05:13] So, I'm looking for a chronic exposure and then they have polyura or polyypipssia or something symptom like that where they're drinking a lot and they're peeing a lot because the sugar is dragging it out and you check their UA and it's full of sugar and you said you know and then some of them have an

[02:05:28] A1C that's a little pre-diabetic but I think a lot of it is neurogenic too um they can develop a ED they can develop a third of type two diabetics have low testosterone so that's a clue and that's secondary so you can clom it you can bet them right back. But that's that's probably the common one is the look, the sugars and then the low tea and the low sperm count to kind of a picture the syndrome. And then we've kind of talked about sleep and stress obviously metabolic health in general. What are what are some of the other modifiable things that you see that the most common is a varicile. Okay. Tell people what a varicoseil is. So you develop varicose veins in your leg which can be need treatment and this is the same thing in the scrotum but it's not related. And it happens in typically at puberty. You'll develop this. You won't know it sometimes unless it hurts. And it's a it's a it's a reflux of blood in the wrong direction. So the testicle drains to the kidney which is uphill and it wants to drain back down. The reason why it drains back down is because as a species we stood up a half a million years ago, maybe 3/4 of a million years ago. And when you're an animal, your your kidney and your testicle drains this way. There's no gravity. But when you stand up, you're now draining uphill. The system was never made for valves. And if you said to me, "What's the reason our sperm counts are falling?" I would say, "We stood up as a species." Probably not a good idea for male fertility because that bud that's supposed to be staying up there comes back down to the testicle pulls around it like a hot bath is warmer and and affect it. And usually the first sign is a testicle on that side, which is the left usually is smaller than the right.

[02:07:04] So the physical exam will be a testicular discrepancy in size. That's the first thing you see. And then you feel above it and you feel a bag of worms. But sorry, there are no valves in that vein. Correct. So what's the head it has to climb? That's got to be this 30 cm. So how is it doing that without a valve?

[02:07:22] I don't know. That's a big that's a pretty big distance to travel without it does it at night. I don't know. Yeah. Interesting. Okay. But there might be a few. But during puberty, but the growth spurt those blow and that the angle of the renal vein and and and is there's a right angle. The right side has a natural valve off the vennea. So it's kind of has to go around 270 degrees. So you don't reflux on the right leftsided lesion in most men. You can be perfectly fertile with it. If you look at statistically, you know, 85% of men conceive naturally with without varicose. 80% will conceive naturally about a year. So so the curves are very similar clinically maybe insignificant, but there's there's a difference and it's statistical. But if you multiply that by millions of people, it becomes important and you'll figure that out easily on a physical exam. The best way is easy phys. I don't order ultrasounds.

[02:08:09] If it's if I can palpate it, then it's clinical. And you will that's an office repair. It's an outpatient surgery. Takes an hour. We do micro. Okay. Yeah. So, it's more involved than a vasectomy. Yes, it is. And because if you you're doing it micro surgery at the level where you don't cut muscle, you want them to recover quicker. It It's pretty it's it's a it's an involved area with lots of veins, but he's not under general. I use I use twilight twilight sedation. Y. Yeah. Um, so that's the most common%.

[02:08:42] Wow. And most men are fertile, but they can be. So again, you look at the semen analysis as a poker hand and you see count and motility being down, nothing else going on, and you see a varicile and it's implicated. All right. Have we missed any other of the major? I'd say the major ones are varicosil and then I would look for hormonal issues. Yep. So varicosils may be 40, hormonal maybe 10 or 15. Genetics. Yep. So the non-modifiable now, right? Okay, so you talked about a few of those already.

[02:09:09] What are some other ones? And on the genetic side, the most common one is for zero sperm is client filter is X chromosome. The most common one for low sperm count is Y chromosome deletions. This is an interesting area. What what does that phenotype look like? No phenotype mean in general. Yeah. No phenotype. Normal looking. A Y chromosome deletion male. Yeah. Because it's only the long arm. Yeah. And it's only a couple of floors on the building.

[02:09:37] So there's regions that are missing. I see. Okay. So very interesting. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you meant a complete deletion of the Y chromosome. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Got it. So it's the long arm and deletions regions, not Yeah. Rhode deletion. Yeah, you're right. So um Randy Ray Opera found that in at

[02:09:55] MIT 20 30 years ago now that the Y chromosome is a is a hall of mirrors and in meiosis every chromosome has a partner except the Y and the X and a man. And so the X the Y plays with itself. It combines with itself. Instead of finding a partner it has to do the dance too. And so it changes a lot. So it's very adaptable. It actually comes from the X through the mill through through evolution. So there's a lot of X genes that are on the Y and the Y doesn't we thought it was sort of a wasteland maybe hairy ears and tooth decay and things like that but now it's probably more important. So there are regions on the long arm of the Y. The short of the Y is very important has a gene called SR which makes you male. The

[02:10:38] SR is the male sex determining gene. If you have that gene your phenotype will be male. If you don't have that gene you're probably going to be female there. It's complicated now but that's sort of what it is. But that the long arm has these genes that control fertility and some of them. So typically we ordered in men with a low sperm count of below 5 million. So that would be a pretty common cause of a sperm count low than 5 million. And I published a study that if you have a Y chromosome deletion and you have a varicile and they both cause low sperm counts and you fix the varicile you're not going to improve because because the the non it's non-modifiable in all ways, right? It's who you are. Yeah. So, so but if you didn't have the B chromosome deletion and you fix the veric soil, you'll you'll expect a good response. Twothirds will improve, one-third or more will conceive naturally. So, you could take guys with low sperm counts and you can fix them or not, but the drivers genetics, right? And the phenotype in offspring is simply inherited as a Y chromosome deletion. It'll either be I just had a couple from Texas actually um he had a Y chromosome deletion. He conceived with uh help of a technology with a low sperm count. Sons have it.

[02:11:49] They have no sperm. So you can inherit the deletion but it might might increase. So you're going to get what your dad had or it might be worse because mutations tend to get larger and large and until they try to conceive they would never know this, right? Everything else is normal, right? So then there's I would say there's environmental lifestyle things. So I think obesity is a big one. Yep. And do you think that that's mostly propagated through the endocrine system then? Yeah.

[02:12:16] Y and I think you know that's probably that's a big one oxidation. Yeah. Uh in terms of the percent of sperm with the lifestyle issues and then lousy diet is probably something that and so so obesity and diet lifestyle recreational drugs. What else do I review with them? Um toxic exposures at work. So any smelly solvents I don't I'm really worrisome. Uh airport fuels you know airline stuff. uh machine shop oils, anything anything benzene derivatives used to be pesticides and stuff like that, but they're pretty well controlled. So, environmental exposures are are, you know, kind of an unknown. I

[02:12:56] I think viruses have a role. Y uh I you saw you recently wrote about HPV and I've been thinking about that for years because there are men It used to be half the men who came in when I entered the field 30 years ago, we didn't know what was going on with them. But now it's probably like 10 or 20%. With lifestyle issues and stuff like that, you can pretty much sort it out.

[02:13:17] It's not that unknown, but there are men who are like, "What is going on here? He's a perfectly healthy guy." Practicing in California is incredible because everyone's so healthy, you have to look elsewhere. You have to ask other questions. And you know, when there's obesity, it's always the elephant in the room. But everyone is so healthy in eating. So I get to poke around places where no one else goes because I have to explain it and there's nowhere to go.

[02:13:42] But um I did a study uh so HPV is the most common. You you wrote about that is that what's the link? It's hard to know. There's herpes very common. the STDs that we know about like the like the 11 common beasts, you know, like, you know, chlamydian, gorrhea, and syphilis, those we know a little more about and they're pretty obvious, but some of these like tchamonus and stuff are pretty subtle.

[02:14:06] And I had uh I was really concerned about this cuz one guy 20 years ago was a professor at UCSF, he he sent me a picture of micro electron photograph of a sperm with a hexagonal herpes virus in it. And I don't even know if it was photoshopped, but like there's this virus and a sperm. like yeah it looks like there's virus in this that you think that's what's causing it I said I don't know I don't know but normally when you see infections as a cause viral or bacterial as a cause of semen analys you'll see pus cells so you'll see what's called pyospermia luccoyaspermia the round cells we talked about the semen analysis will show up in higher numbers they tend to be destructive and they tend to lower motility so you tend to see a certain look to the semen analysis volume normal count normal motility is really low a lot of the sperm are dead because they've been wiped out by these cytoines and all the white cells and then maybe you'll find the pathogen somewhere made but culturing myopplasma CMV all these viruses so so Joe Daresi really bright guy at UCSF won a MacArthur award he took my patient semen and he had a back when microwaves were popular in the 19 and 2000s and he had like 2,000 all mamalian viruses on his chip everything and we ran infertile guys and we ran infertile guys and and looked at semen, not sperm. And 99% of the infertiles were positive for something and 98% of the normals were positive for something.

[02:15:31] So ubiquitous was the word and so it left us high and dry because you can't really do much with that. So it's out there. But I do agree with your assessment that the the pathologic phenotypes, the worst ones are probably doing something. The question is how do we measure it? What do we look for? And with semen analysis, as I said early on, it's a blunt instrument. It doesn't really it varies a lot. It's tough to to do it, but I love whether we do genotyping on is it in sperm? Probably not. You know, I don't I don't know. And when you look at HPV, it's probably one of those things that might be in the ejaculate after ejaculation. Might be coming from another fluid source and not in the sperm itself. So, its effect would be post ejaculation, which could still have a fertility effect, but it won't be probably as deep, right? And what if for example a guy has prostatitis and the prostatic fluid has pus in it pus in it then that could sabotage the whole thing and right I mean the problem with the male system is it's all through the same tube right and so urine comes through that tube and semen comes through that tube so you have to look for infections in the urinary tract in anything like that when you're doing fertility because plus cells kill whatever they see. Yeah. So if your urine's infected you know so that's a big deal. Now, have you done work with um intr intraticular PRP and stem cells? Just stem cells but not PRP.

[02:16:52] Okay. Um not a big fan. Okay. As a trained stem cell biologist and someone trying to make sperm from skin uh and working with some of the best stem cells scientists in the world, I u I have a lot of respect for them, but it's not that simple. So, we've had, you know, people have injected bone marrow into there's there's 560 offshore offshore stem cell companies in the world that will take your money and do things like stick PRP in there. They'll stick uh bone marrow aspirates, fat in your testicle. And I'd say my experience has been um is not been favorable. I uh you know these some of the toughest cases in the world and they come to me after that and I do my techniques and I don't find anything and the the trials aren't really real. They're kind of here come here we're going to do this and then we're going to do a micro dissection on your testicle. U but they didn't have one beforehand. So the chance of it finding it even without that is X and they're finding X. So you know it's just not well done. And I I have my patients investigate all that and I say you do the work. You tell me who you found. let me call them. Yeah. So, I'll

[02:18:00] I'll let them be my the workers and then I'll call them and I'll say, "Hi, um I was just wondering about do you have any papers or what's the science behind it?" And they usually hang up or you know, it's really interesting. But so far, I'd say it's unfounded. Yeah, I've had a very similar experience with uh a few of my friends and patients who have wanted me to talk with some of their their stem cell docs. And uh you're pretty evidence-based, Peter. Well, yeah. And so I accept the fact that they're not going to have remarkable peer-reviewed data, but um it is amazing at how few individuals can provide even one cell layer of scientific reasoning. Um and it's a topic I'd like to explore more deeply on the podcast. It's um you know, my guess is there are some indications for where it makes sense. I agree with that. Um, but boy, I'd like to figure it out without people wasting so much money. There's a there there, but it's just not not that easy. Yeah.

[02:19:04] Um, so what is the let's just say for every hundred guys that walk in your office who are struggling with infertility, what percentage of them will be able to conceive, assuming they are able to fully comply with the prescriptions you you you provide, be it lifestyle or pharmaceutical, for example, hormone modulation, etc. without requiring um and let's exclude the 40% veraric seals because you're going to fix those guys and they're fine. So 100 people who don't have a varicile um who don't have a genetic condition.

[02:19:44] I'm going to really simplify this. Okay, so these are a hundred guys that presumably have showed up with some iatrogenic reason for infertility. Um how many of those guys are going to be able to conceive without resorting to IVF? I would say that's the goal of my practice and I would say the answer is most wow but the caveat is you got to tell me about the woman because yeah because I will defer any yeah so the point is I did I did a paper this is the only data I can give you and so I did a paper where I I saw men for their infertility evolution got it done and I

[02:20:23] I I thought they were fine they had varicosils and stuff but their seminal analysis is normal and my investigation of their risks lifestyle, everything was good. And I said, "You're fine. You're cleared. No one's ever said that before." And they went home and they said, "Tur couldn't figure out what's wrong with us." I said, "That's not what I said. I don't do women, you know. I I don't It's

[02:20:46] I in my expertise, I'm saying something positive here, right? No one's ever said most people would say, "I'm not sure why you're not conceiving." I said, "I'm pretty sure you're not the problem." Yep. Okay. Didn't get interpreted like that. That got me a little angry. So I did a study with USC and I took these men that I cleared and I called them up a year later and I said, "Did what happened last year after Turk cleared you? Had a resident do this?" And the answer was 65% had conceived naturally.

[02:21:13] Another 15 to 20% conceived with IUI or IVF. These women were 35 years old, year and a half infertility. They weren't going to wait around. Most conceptions occurred within 6 months. I didn't do anything for them. I didn't fix their varicosils. I didn't touch something even medication. I just said you're fine. So, I published it as a lifestyle study, not that I was right. And the idea was they probably made changes.

[02:21:36] They probably took a nutritional supplement. They probably timed their sex better. They probably got out of hot tubs and all that stuff. And they were taking pills. I have a list of what they did. I had a table in that paper that said that 65% natural pregnancy rate. that is higher than anything I can offer as a treatment that we have published on. Right? So if you fix their Verica seal or you rarely get a 65% natural conception rate so I had a table of all the published conception rates for the technologies that that work and I'm saying this is even better. So does that if that addresses your question that's the only data I have.

[02:22:14] What advice do you give a guy who comes in your practice? Maybe you don't see a lot of these guys, but let's let's say you get a guy um who comes in and says, "Hey, look, I I want to I want to bank my sperm. I want to freeze my sperm." Now, presumably you'll get a lot of that if a guy's undergoing therapy for cancer or something like that. Um is there anything a guy needs to know? And would you recommend a guy do that if he's 40, doesn't have a partner, but says, "Look, I want to have kids." And is isn't there something to the idea that my sperm are better today than they will be in a decade? It's a huge issue. paternal age. Yeah, paternal age and fertility. Paternal age. So, we can we can go there. But I don't place value judgments. I say good idea. Uh I am a disclosure. I'm on a you know a board of legacy. Uh I was I love their mission driven the way they're mission driven.

[02:23:04] And so I I like the fact of going for military and exposed patients and this and that and VA. So, but I'm I'm I'm for that. I think it's the lowest hanging fruit in the field. Especially obviously for chemo for cancer survivors and things. It's like I don't care what you think might happen with your cancer. I would still bank it. I started a nonprofit called banking on the future. 16 year olds to 21 year olds with cancer. We'll do it for you. We'll pay for it 5 years just to give us a sample because it's so much harder afterwards or not. Right. So, so you would advise any male that's that hasn't reproduced and who might want to who's undergoing any chemotherapy for any cancer just play it safe bank for cancer? Yes. Now, should anyone do it for any reason?

[02:23:50] Probably not. But again, I don't pass the judgment. If they're worried about something, then I'm worried than then they should. What paternal age do you worry about? So, good question. Uh and you look at like national guidelines for sperm donation, 40 is considered older paternal age, 50 for sure, right? Mhm.

[02:24:10] If you look at risks to offspring, miscarriages, stillborns, um autism, birth effects, things immediately related to conception, prematurity, those go up with paternal age. Then you look at birth effects when they're born. Those go up, you know, one to twofold. And then the worrisome ones are the single gene defects and the epigenetics like psychiatric morbidity.

[02:24:37] So the autism, schizophrenia, dyslexia, bipolar disorder, potentially Alzheimer's in offspring. Yep. And they're not detectable with young. So big issues. So I've written a lot about that, published on it. I was actually having my second child at 50 when I was writing this thing. Should I be doing this? You know, writing a paper on all these risks called repro and with Alan

[02:24:59] Denko from University of Pittsburgh. But I think it's a hockey stick curve for risk to offspring. And you think the the the inflection is 40 or 50? I think it's more like 60. Okay. I think there's a slow linear increase in risk to offspring from 25 to 50 or 60 and then there's an inflection and then there's a blade of the stick and I think that's logarithmic. It's the same curve as women. Yeah. But they're shifted 20 years earlier or something like that.

[02:25:29] Yeah. So it's a shorter curve but the same thing 40 38 to 40 is kind of a point where things really ramp up with chromosomes. The men's stuff is not chromosomeal. So if you take the curves together, they're different spans, same shape, but I think the female curve is on top of the male curve. This is not a the same relevant relative risk, right?

[02:25:49] So women, you know, you go from 25 to 40, your your chance of a a miscarriage. So it's chromosomal. It goes up quite significantly after that. Very significantly. And the and the consequence of women's issues with offspring related health is basically miscarriage. Yeah. And in many ways it's almost easier to detect, right? Because very so so it's it's it can be more dramatic, but it usually is and now prevented with with pre-impation genetic testing. Men are different. You can't detect these things. They're single gene mutations. This is the the machinery is constantly working. It's getting old. the quality control of the process goes down and little gene mutations get in there that are always being always being spun off in the heat of the engine and they're getting they're not getting vetted. So the machinery is not doing a good job. So they're getting through and they're not going to be they're not going to be lethal. They're going to be delletterious. So that's where you get things and autism is a classic one.

[02:26:52] Paternal age related um looks like that's the biggest risk factor for it and that worries me a lot. Right. So I think [Music] um it's interesting the facts are that human evolution is entirely driven by sperm. Yeah. Because eggs are just sitting there correcting the problem. It's entirely driven by sperm and half and so 50 mutations a year a generation usually gets spit out. It's in a nature paper. um probably between generations and there's always mutations occurring in 14-year-old fathers but it goes way up with 60-year-old fathers. So the rate of mutations goes way up with age but it averages 50 over your reproductive life.

[02:27:33] And most of them half of the mutations that we are throwing off as a species are not ears or hands or feet or height or things. It's all neurodedevelopmental. It's like half neurodedevelopmental. Yeah. So when you think about what we're seeing, you know, the Martians from the 50s and the movies with big heads, that's kind of where we're headed. It's autism, dyslexia, bipolar disorder, you know, these are neural developmental neurogenerative issues. And why is that? Well, that's what's going on. I mean, that's where we're being stimulated. That's where we're being asked to evolve. Look at the last 30 years, right? Funny. one of the biggest investors in uh Salesforce um said to me I was said to me I you know I realized I was dyslexic when I when my son was born and I said really he said yeah but you know what it helped me be the man I am to realize that Salesforce is going to fly gave him the first 500,000 gave him the first million they never took any more money and he said it let me focus I was so autism is one of those diseases where you put out you you ignore a lot of input and you find the the gift and it's amazing if you go down the rabbit hole of what they're good at. It's like their whole brain trust is there. So, is that a disease or is that where we're headed?

[02:28:50] I mean, I think it exists on a spectrum. I I think any anyone who's who's probably spent time with kids, you know, using ASD as a um as as an example, boy, you know, you know, mild versions of it the way it can be defined because it really has three categories now in the DSM5. Um I think the mildest version probably comes with more superpowers than limitations or maybe equal amount, but but clearly the more severe it gets, uh it's pretty debilitating. But but this this idea of paternal age, we're calling it disease, though. Yeah. But maybe it's not disease. Maybe it's where we're headed. Maybe it's the future. Maybe the nonsequittors that come out of those brains. I mean, look at who's changing the world right now.

[02:29:33] At least in Silicon Valley. Yeah. But but again, I would argue most of those people would be in category, you know, class one, not class three. Um what's the uh what's the thaw success rate? Right. So if a guy is 40, he's he goes ahead, he freezes and banks his sperm, assuming they were good to go in, right? Are they very high probability of thawing correctly? So when you freeze sperm, it's about a 200-y old process regularly used for about 75. I forgot who the Italian scientist was who froze sperm in snow and then thought it and it but it was alive a couple hundred years later after Leewenho came up with the microscope. They found it was moving and it was possible. So egg thawing is very new. Egg freezing and thawing is very new. This is very old. So everyone is thinking about sperm now because eggs are being frozen left and right. But this is much older technology and the cell is much hardier than an egg. So it does a lot better typically. When you freeze it, it's the freezing process that kills sperm before icicles on the inside. Yes. And then while it's frozen, there's usually no issue. And then it's and then there's another problem when you thought rapid temperature shift. So that's where the kill rate comes from. In a good sample, half of it should survive. Okay. And so in so how much sperm would you tell a guy to bank if he has to do it if it's the definitive samples for his life? So meaning he's 40 or he's about to undergo chemotherapy or some other exposure where he should just assume he will not have normal sperm again. What do you tell him? So I usually say depending on what technology you're going to use, but if your sperm count's normal, three three ejaculates is one kid's worth of sperm with insemination technology where you would thought and then and then turkey based it. So 10 ejaculates for three shots on goal for three kids potentially. Three kids with low technology. But 10 ejaculates will give you most of China with IVF. Got it. Oh, when you say low technology, you mean

[02:31:35] IUI or something like that. So there's three levels. sex, no tech, high-tech is IVF, and then the middle is IUI. Y, that's the stuff that's turkey basting. It's relatively straightforward, relatively cheap. I see. Three kids for that, but plenty of sperm for IVF. So, three ejaculates would be more than enough if they're normal for IVF. Yeah.

[02:31:52] So, the population you're talking about may be cancer survivors. Half of those will not be normal. They're really looking at IVF. Y, so they don't need that many. Yep. But I'd say three is a good number, but it's an insurance policy, right? Okay. Well, Paul, this is this has been a super interesting tour through the world of male fertility. Um, I can honestly say I knew very little about this coming in. Um, some of this stuff I understood pretty well, the hormone stuff, but boy, a lot of this stuff I had no idea. So, um, I will be studying my notes from this. Um, we're going to link to a lot of the stuff you've created. You've got a lot of great content out there, so we'll make sure people know where to find you. podcast too. Talk about that.

[02:32:36] Well, we started a podcast last year because the blog of 15 years and we're just doing Timely Topics and it's me and my associate Rob Clyde who's a director in Hollywood and we we take on Anthony Bourdain. We're going to be the Anthony Bourdain of Men's Health. We're going to just take on the topics testosterone, etc., penis myths, and just talk about stuff that everyone is asking questions about, but no one's talking about. And like you, datadriven answers. Okay.

[02:33:03] What's it called? Talk with Turk on all channels. Got it. Okay. We'll make sure folks know that. Um, you have a clinic that you run up and down the coast of California. So, obviously we'll we'll make sure folks know how to how to find you there. But presumably, I think we've given folks a road map for their local urologist as well. If they're getting the work up, basically it sounds like if you're being worked up for fertility with your urologist and they're not going through the steps that we've described, maybe you should find somebody else. Yes. I think it should be done. That's the first step. And there there, you know, there's a lot going on now that the biomarker concept I don't you know this relates a lot to your views on medicine 3.0.

[02:33:45] Um we now know I know the paper came out two days ago looking at longevity based on the SEMA analysis in Danish the rigorous hospitalatin in Copenhagen. uh they looked at 74,000 men over 50 years and found that those guys with say normal semen quality live 3 years longer all causes than men with low sperm counts in the when they were younger.

[02:34:08] This was a one you know a singlepayer system so they have all the data on it is very much a landmark study. So I'm if you ask me what excites me about the field, I would say as the author of the biomarker concept early in my career, I would say I'm really happy that we're scaring couples to realize that their fertility is a measure of their health. And now we have our foot in the door. If we can get a sperm count and get them in the office, we can actually tell them a little bit about their trajectory. And that's getting more and more every day.

[02:34:42] And we've never had a chance to do preventative medicine with young men. So, it's a men's health play in a big way because their partners are bringing them in, but who cares? They're in the office. What do you mean? Your father had prostate cancer when he was 50. Someone had colon cancer and a you know, so I have now an NP Molly Jessup who is medical and it's like, okay, you know what's going on? because there's metabolic stuff and you can pick up diabetes and we have an opportunity here we've never had ever is to get men at younger ages and I you know I was a professor at UCSF for 15 years endowed chair I left and I went to Yosan

[02:35:21] University traditional Chinese medicine I lecture there now we had a conference last week and I lectured and and I liked it because I thought western medicine maybe your view too is too reactive they're always trying to get men out of trouble or get patients out of trouble, but we're not thinking about getting them from unhealthy to healthy, which is the preventative aspect. We're just not very good at it. Your general surgery, every example you give is a guy, you know, dismantly bad, you get him back, whatever. But you got to think next step like kidney stones, great. Urologist, we treat them all day. It's fun. It's endoscopic. It's a lasers. It's shock waves. But what are we doing about that stone? I mean, how come how come we're not preventing these more? We're It's just not It's not on the radar. I go to Yosan University in traditional Chinese medicine fabulous place and it's all holistic. So I see patients who get referred by acupuncturists and they come in their diets under control their stress is under control. They're doing acupuncture they're sorted out and what do I find? Varicus seals because they don't find those. But the phenotype is totally different than the western referral. And I think that's I'm I've loved that because that's 3.0. That's medicine 3.0 which they're doing.

[02:36:30] They've been doing it for 4,000 years. And it's interesting how we don't give a lot of street cred to it, but in my view, a much of we don't understand about fertility, certainly men, possibly women, is epigenetic. And the drivers of epigenetics, which are marks on the DNA, not DNA mutations. 50 DNA mutations a generation, doesn't explain it. There's other stuff going on. Epigenetics is all lifestyle and diet driven. It's all lifestyle and diet driven. It's everything in your book.

[02:36:58] Well, Paul, very interesting stuff. Uh, thank you again for making the trip out here and uh, thanks for sharing your insights with us. Great. Yeah. All right. Thanks, Peter. [Music]
