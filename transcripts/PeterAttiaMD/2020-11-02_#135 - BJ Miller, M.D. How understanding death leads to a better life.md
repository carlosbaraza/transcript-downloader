## Description

BJ Miller is a hospice and palliative care specialist on a quest to reframe our relationship with death. In this episode, BJ begins with how his own brush with death radically shifted his perspective and ultimately forged his path towards palliative care and helping patients integrate and understand their life in a meaningful way. BJ recounts several moving stories from his patients, which reveal important lessons about overcoming the fear of death, letting go of regret, and what’s most important in life. He discusses the major design flaws of a “death phobic” healthcare system. Furthermore, he makes the case that seeing death as a part of life allows us to live well, as opposed to living to evade death itself. He concludes with a discussion around physician-assisted death as well as his hopes around the use of psychedelics to reduce suffering in end-of-life care.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of the podcast episode with BJ Miller:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. BJ Miller, a hospice and palliative care specialist, discussing death, dying, and how understanding mortality can lead to a better life. The conversation stems from Miller's personal experience losing both legs and one arm in a college accident [00:08:00], and later losing his sister to suicide [01:15:00]. The discussion explores the healthcare system's approach to death, the difference between palliative care and hospice, and how understanding death can enhance life appreciation.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Palliative care differs from hospice care - palliative care focuses on quality of life during serious illness, while hospice is specifically for end-of-life care [01:20:00]
- Less than 50% of hospice deaths are now cancer-related, with progressive neurological illnesses and organ failure increasing [01:35:00]
- Electrical burns cause damage from inside out, requiring fasciotomies to vent heat [00:12:00]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Consider mortality early in life to make better decisions [01:25:00]
- Focus on quality of life alongside longevity [01:30:00]

Context-specific recommendations:
- For terminal illness, consider palliative care early, not just at end of life [01:22:00]
- Balance pain management with consciousness in end-of-life care [01:40:00]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
No specific supplements were discussed.

Medications mentioned:
- Pain medications for end-of-life care [01:40:00]
- Psychedelics (psilocybin, MDMA) for end-of-life anxiety [01:45:00]

5. **Exercise & Movement**:
No specific exercise protocols were discussed.

6. **Nutrition & Diet**:
No specific dietary approaches were discussed.

7. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
No specific biomarkers were discussed.

8. **References & Resources**:
- Dream Foundation (organization helping fulfill end-of-life wishes) [01:38:00]
- Zen Hospice Project in San Francisco [01:42:00]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"Death is coming no matter what we do... if failure is guaranteed then I'm no longer limited by it" [01:33:00]

"The pressure's on for me to take my life seriously but the pressure is off for me to get everything just perfect" [01:33:30]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
- How can the healthcare system better integrate palliative care principles earlier in treatment?
- What role will psychedelics play in future end-of-life care?
- How can medical education better prepare doctors for dealing with death and dying?

The conversation provides valuable insights into death, dying, and how understanding mortality can lead to more meaningful living. Miller's personal experiences and professional expertise offer a unique perspective on these universal human experiences.

those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to peteratiamd.com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode [Music] my guest this week is dr b.j miller bj is a hospice and palliative care specialist we talk a lot about what that means but the reason i wanted to speak with bj is i've been really thinking a lot about better understanding what end of life means and how understanding the end of life could help us better understand frankly what we want out of life and by an amazing coincidence bj and i met very very briefly many years ago in medical school although i don't think he remembers it but when i saw him again giving a ted talk several years ago i immediately realized hey that's the guy i met at a party you know 20 some odd years ago and became really interested in his work and then reached back out to him and said hey would you be interested to sit down and talk about this and so in this discussion we talk a lot about his personal story because you can't really avoid it and frankly his personal story is a big part of why he ultimately chose the life path he did which is doing something that many of us including people who go into medicine would find just too difficult to do which is basically help patients die as a means to reach this combination of their life we get into all sorts of things the difference between death and dying the difference between palliative care and hospice the differences between loss and regret what the medical system that we're a part of is good at and what it's not so great at we talk about what really happens at the end of life how enlightened or transcendent is it and he tells a number of stories that are quite moving about patience and also from his own life and finally we conclude with a discussion on both the hastening of death and also what he's most optimistic about including the use of psychedelics this is another one of those episodes that i think people at the surface might think gosh i don't really have an interest in that i would encourage you to push through that i think it's natural to find this topic unpalatable and i think that's exactly why people need to listen to this so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with bj miller [Music] hey bj it's a real honor to be sitting down with you even though we're not in person together thank you peter i appreciate you having me but i'm looking forward to this now i don't know if you remember this in fact you can't have remembered this because i'm not memorable in the way that you are but we've met a few times at parties in medical school no you went to ucsf and i went to stanford and i don't know if we were the same class but we were pretty close what year did you matriculate at ucsf 97. yep so we were the same class and i don't recall you guys ever coming down to palo alto but we sure as hell went up to san francisco a lot for social reasons or for school no just for social reasons oh yeah yeah yeah we just had friends in common and stuff like that and so it's almost 25 years ago and i remember one of the things that stood out was you had a dog right yep what was your dog's name i don't remember his name was vermont like the state i got it yeah wow i'm so psyched you remember him peter he was a huge part of my life i can tell you that's beautiful so i will admit something bj which is that i never had the nerve to come up to you and say hey what happened because it wasn't subtle right yeah no it's pretty it's pretty bleedingly obvious yeah so as i would learn later your life changed shortly after thanksgiving in 1990 right that's right you got it bud yep and that change which i think on the surface would sound like a change for the worse maybe wasn't for the worse after all can you tell folks what happened that night yeah i mean it was a big moment in my life as you're pointing to peter yeah i mean and there's a lot to talk about so i'll try to just kind of parlay the basic facts and then we can talk about any of it so just back from thanksgiving holiday and i was very happy to see my friends we were all kind of that early college we were just basically in love we couldn't wait to see each other being away for thanksgiving break was a bummer really so anyway we come running back and we immediately decided to go a handful of us would go out and have a drink and just run around i was actually on my way to the computer lab to print a paper when it kind of got intercepted and off we ran to go have some fun nothing crazy it was we didn't go nuts though but we were heading to the huawei market which on the east coast it's sort of like a 7-eleven late open all-night place to get a sandwich kind of joint chips or whatever anyway so we're walking to the wawa market and this is at princeton university where there's a commuter train that runs right up along campus because princeton sort of a bedroom community for new york and philly and so this commuter train was it was called the dinky of all things it was just sitting there not operating hours so i was just sitting there and we stumbled across it and just decided to climb on top of it just relatively innocently for things we had done but felt much stupider but anyway we decided to jump on top of it climb it climb a ladder just stand up on it like you would a jungle gym or a tree or something and when i got up on top of the train i had a metal watch on and the electricity arc to the watch when i stood up because i got close enough to the line and that was that electricity entered the arm my left arm and then ground down and eventually there's a big explosion and whatever else and that was that i survived that but ended up losing both legs below the knee and that one arm below the elbow very touch and go in the burn unit in livingston new jersey saint barnabas hospital for i don't know maybe a month or so then i was in there another month in the burn unit and then eventually out of the air and into rehab and then a long process of re-entering the world but anyway that was my big the thing i call the cosmic spanking that big big moment that just came along and completely reoriented me changed things around do you remember the actual shock or is that sort of so traumatic a lot of times trauma patients for example when they're hit by cars or sustain a significant gunshot wound especially if it's followed by a prolonged period in the icu they suffer some antigrade amnesia so they forget things in front of them not so much behind them but a lot of times that includes the actual event so what is the last thing you remember do you remember actually climbing up on the train i don't no i remember the night is all very fuzzy i remember sort of snippets from the hours preceding but i don't have any recollection of approaching the train or getting on top of it this is just pieced together through stories from my friends who are with me but the first memory i have around the accident itself that night i can picture a lot of it again because my friends have told me but my own memory really began in the hospital that night i was taken to the local er where they just did basic things they were called fasciotomies which as you know with electrical burns you burn from the inside out so you've got all this heat running around in your system and it'll keep burning you so they've got to vent that heat basically the local er they cut these fasciotomies to vent me and then stuck me in a helicopter to go to the new jersey's one burn unit at saint barnabas i can remember being loaded into the helicopter vaguely i was very tall i was almost 6'5 and i just remember the pilots there's this awkwardly trying to get me into the cockpit because i was too long so all the amputations i had were surgical so at that night my legs were burned i still had them so then you get to a burn unit and you're with now a team of doctors and nurses who have seen the worst of things for what it's worth just as a bizarre coincidence in general surgery which is what i want to do after medical school you rotate through all the different disciplines of surgery it's quite random you'll spend a month on this a month on that a month on all of these different things and my very first month of internship was in the burn unit i had never done any of that during medical school so to show up on day one at sort of the premier burn unit of maryland which basically meant it was the referral center so if you got burned in pennsylvania you were still coming down to hopkins i mean it was another world you got it i mean it was very difficult to get used to doing dressing changes on patients and just seeing the amount of pain people were in when they suffered these burns and the other thing that was remarkable at least to me was how otherwise alive people could look when they came into a burn unit but yet how poor their prognosis could be based on the amount of surface area that was burned we basically had actuarial tables that would say well he has this much of third degree and this much of second degree and even though he's sitting here actually able to even communicate with us this person has a very high likelihood of not surviving this injury yep it's interesting that you say that because one of the early memories would piece together for me by a nurse with whom i became very close was when i landed in the bay at the burn unit this was not uncommon but apparently the techs and the team were sitting around basically taking wages on whether i was going to make it it's probably based on very much the same kind of what you were just describing that sounds kind of harsh but i'm sure it wasn't i think that was just as you know these things get de-personalized in that setting almost by necessity it's a brutal setting but anyway you can talk more about that but i'm in a way glad peter to know that you know what a bernie it is like it is an other world that i've always struggled to impart to people what it's actually like in there it is a wholly unnatural place i mean nature is completely kept at bay yes and there's a reason that it's very separate i mean in small hospitals they do what they can and i'm sure they don't have dedicated burn units but at tertiary care centers they have dedicated icus that are exclusively for burn patients that don't take other medical or surgical or neuro or pediatric cases and it's also a very special type of nurse that works there and a special type of doctor because everything from the frankly just at times the grotesque nature of the disfiguration of the skin these dressing changes that we talk about doing several times per day on a patient they require incredible sterility at the bedside frankly in the early days early days of the patient's admission even the smell of burn tissue is a very foreign odor to people so everything about it it places by the way everything i've said says nothing to what the patient and their family must be experiencing as they're coming to grips with this so when did your parents arrive i'm sure you don't remember it but based on the stories they came almost my poor parents man they got the classic in the middle of the night they were in chicago where i grew up at the time so they get a call from new jersey at 4am or something ridiculous and basically not a lot of information just everything was emergent and scary and basically your son's here with us he's very badly injured might not make it through the night get here as soon as possible basically one of those calls so my parents were there as quickly as it could be the next morning to your point about this place these so what they've learned burn treatment science is infection is very often the thing that kills people pence all the sterility so someone might look just fine but they're so exposed their body is so exposed that you're so susceptible so that means whoever's in your room or even spacesuits and whatever else and for a while i was not allowed many visitors there were friends who would come but they couldn't come in the burn unit eventually they allowed my parents at the bedside one at a time that was it but it was really powerful very potent visits i remember them very well as did my parents as you describe your experience as a student as a trainee it's not much different because it's such a foreign exotic environment that works against intuition a lot of ways the things that touch for example something you have to avoid at all costs smells everything is foreign there is just no place to sort of rest into a familiar you can imagine if there was that way for you as a student trainee it was certainly that way for myself and my parents but in a way too that foreignness and by virtue of me being so undeniably vulnerable i was not moving i was completely at their mercy in a way it allowed me to very quickly submit to the place and to the people working there because i clearly had nothing approaching an option very quickly i was aware of my vulnerability and and immediately trusted the people working on me in a way because i had to but also as a comment of how skillful they were at their work do you remember the actual discussion you had with the doctors about the need for amputation because obviously when the fasciotomies are performed initially it's with the hope of salvaging the limbs presumably at some point they came to the realization that trying to salvage the limbs was actually going to threaten your life due to infection they had to go i've been around those discussions do you remember that i do i do i do my first memory real vivid memory before besides that helicopter moment was the night before my initial amputations and the part i remember about it which was maybe five or six days in peter that's when i was hemodynamically stable enough and more to the point the demarcation of viable tissue versus unviable tissue was a little bit more obvious so surgeons had a fighting chance to remove the right amount so dr mansour was the main surgeon an amazing amazing person i remember he came in the night before and said something all i remember is an a conversation and then i remember falling asleep i fell asleep in my little room and somehow you know that feeling peter where you wake up from a dream and there's a moment of reorienting yourself and maybe it wasn't a very pleasant dream and you take a little second and you get your bearings and you go oh it's just a dream oh thank god you know classic thing is people show up like taking an exam naked or something so they're late for their wedding or some moment you wake up and oh thank god that was a dream i remember i woke up in the burning having that sensation strange i remember i looked around and i had this weird feeling like oh this whole amputation thing that i was just hearing about was a dream oh i'm fine gotta go to the bathroom so i in my haze it's managed to extubate myself so not an easy thing to do extubate myself pull my central lines out of my neck under strap my arm from the bed and all the while i can remember this so clearly i'm looking around my room with all these cues that obviously i'm not in my bedroom but for some reason i'm just thinking oh yeah this is my room i'm just gonna go to the bathroom now and i got up and out of bed eventually and started walking to the door with all these alarms going off in the middle of the night somehow i don't know where the nurses were but there was a gap there and i started walking to the door just to take a leak on my crispy little feet and the foley catheter line ran out as you know they're usually attached to the bed so when that line ran out it yanked on that foley and that's a pain that i won't soon forget and that catheter ball was not deflated we can explain this for your listeners but anyway i was just about to say we're gonna hit pause and explain everything you just said but let's start with the extubation so you have a tube that is in your airway and a machine that is breathing for you so the act of pulling that out means you now have to breathe on your own something you have not been doing for the previous week that alone could have killed you yeah right you then pulled out a bunch of central lines which if not compressed so central lines are very very long intravenous lines that go into the main veins inside your body veins that most people don't even realize they have called the vena cava subclavian vein etc to pull those out without the appropriate protocol of compression could also lead to internal hemorrhage and all sorts of crazy things you're dodging death you're three for three on this yeah yes in retrospect i smile almost with pride because it feels good it sounds so daring obviously time i had no freaking idea what i

[00:18:31] but then the thing that finally gets you is a catheter about the size of an hb pencil that is in your urethra up to your bladder which stays in place with a balloon that's dilated to the size of a very large gumball and said gumball prevents the catheter from ever coming out and before we take these catheters out of the urethra which is by itself unbearable i myself have had one we have to deflate the ball because trying to pull a gumball sized device out of the urethra would be tantamount to torture but of course you just went ahead and through the force of walking towards the door basically removed your own foley catheter minus the balloon removal or yeah yeah you're still alive but all of a sudden that dream not happy yeah it is amazing that you're right that you must have done this all very quickly to make it happen so now you're sort of having that moment of maybe that wasn't a dream i will never forget this it was a clarity that world all the haze cleared up instantly when i felt that fully dislodged from the bladder but incidentally it didn't come all the way out so it's somewhere halfway which is even worse yeah it was just terrifying so i immediately follow the floor and i'm screaming and now a nurse comes in i don't know what the delay was incidentally that poor nurse we never saw her again she was never assigned to my room again poor thing part of her explanation she was avoiding my room she admitted in some ways because she had a son my age it looked just like me and it was really hard for her anyway so eventually so i'm on the floor now screaming trying to break the catheter line which is impossible but it's the only way i thought i could break the tension but anyways they came in got me back in bed and all that stuff and the way it went but to your question peter it was instantaneous that i realized this wasn't a dream and all the relief that had just i had experienced moments ago in the other direction just immediately went away and i was very very clear on where i was and what was happening to me instantaneously it was a wild wild moment i won't soon forget so what kind of a mourning process did you go through postoperatively when you come out with both of your legs amputated and your left arm short answer is my morning process took me a while and my conscious morning process was delayed because i at that time embodied to sort of absorb the american notion that no what you do is you pick yourself up you get back on the horse immediately the less you acknowledge what's going on the better the tougher you are the faster you'll be functional again etc so early on i didn't do any morning not consciously i was kind of going the other direction joking around making light of it and both a moment of somewhat of denial and also probably something pretty poignant too i remember when i came out of that first surgery so i didn't know that there were people i knew my parents were there and oddly peter i don't know how this was possible but my parents moved into the hospital somehow they got a room in the hospital from chicago they lived there all the time i was there i don't know how the hell that never heard of that but they did maybe they had huge wings of saint barnabas that weren't being used i'm not sure but i knew my parents were there so i come out of the or come out and i'm heading they're wheeling me back the leg amputations were what they did first and i knew whatever the case is i had absorbed what dr mansour told me the night before eventually i woke up from that surgery with no surprises but i'm wheeling back to my room and there's a brief moment where you're going from the or suites back into the burn units and you go through this little hallway and i come out it was packed with people my friends and some friends have flown in from chicago i was so moved i had no idea that they were there and it was just a brief second there was no time to talk but there was just a lot of love i just remember their facial expressions i was very very moved and then i went back into the room and i remember my mom came in and we were sitting and she was crying and my mom had polio she'd been disabled my whole life most of her life and i just remember this is gonna sound i don't know it was part denial driving it but i just remember my thought when my mom came in was my response here was oh mom well now we have so much more in common now we're both disabled almost like a cheeriness i love my mom very much we're very close and i honestly felt like i was joining this ranks of folks that i always knew existed and felt very much a kinship with the disabled community by virtue of being close with my mother my first response was weird kind of immediate acceptance but i had to go back and it wasn't a thorough acceptance it was where i wanted to be but it wasn't really where i was but anyway that was my first statement it took really weeks it took actually my nurse kind of trying to work on their member time maybe a week or two later where one of the nurses with whom i was very very close joy varcardo pone and joy came in one day and she was just really moody with me she was just like throwing she was just strangely moody and i was just sort of joking around and anyway she's like throwing bed paints around and it's like joy what the heck what is what's wrong what are you okay and she's just basically lit and she's like i am just sick and tired of you not taking this seriously you're just joking around you haven't even cried this is a big big deal you're not being real and she just led into me she let into me until i finally cried it was the first time i'd cry those weeks in it was the most magical thing peter i will never forget that one either in part because it was like a damn it broke and so much came pouring out and it felt so good felt like such a relief i hadn't realized i hadn't consciously fought back tears or tried to be tough i just thought that's what i was supposed to be doing and i was on otherwise on autopilot too but what was also weird about those tears was for the moments the tears were falling i had really no physical pain i've never looked into this but i wonder what the connection is between the act of crying not just feeling sad but actually crying and anesthesia it was a fascinating moment but it really moved me and it began my relationship with began letting in that this was a bigger deal than i had managed to let it be i offer that to say the morning the grieving was very gradual took me a while to wake up to my own feelings about it all that took months and years really do you think that that was mostly a sadness and a loss that came through expectation of these are things i wanted to do that i will no longer do and i am sad as a result of that or do you think it was tears from a different sadness a sadness that's more born of anger like how could this have happened it's such a random event i've done far stupider things in my life like why was i wearing that watch you can sort of go through all those things like do you have a sense of where you were in terms of that damn the floodgates opening yeah yeah my sense is peter it's a sense driven by most of where how grief materialized for me over the months and years but my sense is for a number of reasons i did not have a lot of why me moments and there's a lot to say about that but to answer your question no i think it was more like first of all the physical pain i hadn't really let myself i've just been literally gritting my teeth and for as vulnerable as i felt as so exposed as i felt i was looking for anywhere where i could look or feel or act or present as strong and that's the only way i could think of i think was to kind of keep this stuff in and so i think part of it was a release around just a physical pain and i think the rest of it it didn't have a lot of clarity around the object of my sorrow but the sorrow i really think was had to do with embarrassment for doing this for ending up here putting my parents through so much pain i could see it in their faces slowly began to see what it did to friends too and others around me it's the feeling i think a lot of the pain a lot of the tears had to do with here i was taking so much from so many people i was embarrassed about that and ashamed about that i think that was a big part of it and i think there was also an image i had just kind of come into my body as a 19 year old and i think there was a sadness i didn't know if i would ever have sex again what women were going to think of me what my friends would think of me i'd been around disability my whole life and i've watched how cruel people could be and the projections they make and i think part of it was the more tears that i knew what i was going to be walking into with that i think yeah all of those things but low low low on the list peter were the why me questions i know a lot of that to the prep work that my mother my wife had said in it was always much more the question of why not me if anything i felt guilty for having to perfect a life before that separate from all of this bj there's another kind of really transformative event in your life that has to do with your sister when did that take place so that was 10 years later so that was so you're in medical school yeah exactly and i want to come back to how you got to medical school but can you tell me a little bit about your sister and the relationship you had with her in the 10 years that followed this and then ultimately her demise it's a good segue it's a lake of the way i grew up was i was no stranger to pain i was around it and there are all sorts of reasons to feel like that life was inherently hard and that was something about i felt almost a perversion that i could feel happy ever that felt that almost felt wrong i don't know how to explain it but part of my growing up was growing up with a sister i had one sibling lisa lisa was four years older than i am wild brilliant fascinating just intense person and our whole family life so much centered around her and her moods and her thoughts so i was enamored with lisa she was my older sister she seemed so smart to me she had emotions around things that i hadn't even thought of and she had these developed emotional responses i just felt like she must have insights in the world that i just couldn't see and she had such conviction and she was harsh harsh harsh that conviction older sister i'd wanted i aspired to her so i chased her moods around anything she told me i took at face value and she owned me in so many ways as her younger brother and she was very troubled and part of my adulthood was coming in to realize that lisa wasn't just full of conviction lisa was also full of some other things and so in my 20s here i am going to med school i'm finally learning to love to have some separation from chasing my sister's moods around and then in december december 1st of 2000 roughly almost exactly 10 years after my injuries lisa decided to kill herself lisa decided to leave the planet so yes that was another one of the major major life events for me and that was deep into medical school and one of the things that precipitated my deciding to leave medicine that i was going to get out of medicine at that point no i didn't know that actually yeah i want to come back to this can we talk for a moment though just to make the connection of how you ended up deciding to go into medicine because when you were in your freshman year at princeton i get the impression that medicine wasn't even on your radar correct that's right you got it yep no interest that didn't even cross my mind yeah so after returning to chicago going through a very lengthy process of rehabilitation you re-enrolled at princeton a full year later correct almost yeah the following fall so i went back in september of and you changed your major to art history is that also correct you got it yep why did you do that i had been there too for that's a word i had been studying chinese language and was heading for a major in east asian studies but when i was away when i was in that you know the burden of such it's like a torture chamber interspersed with like incredible boredom like you're just so you're so and this is so wild when i look back on these i'm sorry i'm just a quick digression so this was the first gulf war was happening it was so strange i was watching a war it was like a televised war such a wild thing bored stiff in horrible pain to and from that tank room for daily deep breathements so horrible pain interspersed with slight relief and boredom no touch with there's not even a window such a weird thing and i would toggle between on the television between watching the war in some cooking show it was just the strangest i don't know why i bring that up it was just how i spent my days but now i forgot your question brother what were you asking me about the decision to change to art history oh golly how did i get to that but anyway well i know because i'm sitting in this bed bored stiff and of course even with my little structures that were still in place that kept me from crying or acknowledging a lot of things of course it was no getting around some stuff and i was beginning to let into my consciousness and my daily thinking like you know sort of preparing imagining my life down the road when am i going back to school will anyone want to be friends with me but i'm basically bottom line is i'm sitting there very much pondering the value of my life what am i now am i less of a person do i have less to offer the world what will people see in me want to be i know so basically questions of meaning and questions of identity who am i what do i do with myself now what can i do i found myself in that mix just sitting there pondering questions like the meaning of life not in a recreational or intellectually kind of ivy league write a term paper way but in a way that was very obviously relevant and therapeutic and practical these existential issues became very practical and i and that's where they belong by the way i think so sitting there one of my friends and closest friend justin would come visit me at the bernie eventually and we find ourselves talking about art as this thing that humans do so i was looking for meaning making what humans how humans work with pain how do humans work with things they can't control and that led me to thinking about art why do human beings make art why do we take the material of our life and create with it and fashion something from it that wasn't there before but now exists thanks to us it's kind of a stunning impulse that human beings have whether you're making art that's going to hang in a museum or you're just fussing around your house we are a very creative species that was lighting up for me as a very important and telling and that maybe maybe the art world had something to teach me so when i went back to college that fall i rejoined my class i just had to finish the exam somewhere in the summer and i had a free semester i was supposed to be in china the second semester of sophomore year anyway i didn't have to do much to jump back in with my class and that was very important to me i wanted to be back with my buddies that was a real driver so anyway i head back to princeton joined my class and changed my major to art history to studying art and that was a really consequential decision one i'm actually very proud of i've talked about it before on this show i think it's even come up during a discussion where someone asked what's the best major that i would recommend for someone who wants to go into medicine and i i don't have great insight on this but the one thing i generally suggest is anything other than pre-med because i think whether you study art history or engineering or a foreign language and a foreign culture you're probably going to get something out of it that you would never get if you studied pre-med yet most of everything you study in pre-med you're going to pick up in medical school which is not to say that studying pre-med is not a good idea but that's my two cents is that the people who came in with totally different backgrounds often were people who didn't actually plan on going into medicine as the case in in yours the stories are usually pretty interesting so when in the journey of art history do you then realize you want to make what i think is even probably a greater stretch or leap which is to actually go to medicine yeah so let me first see your two cents and raise a mind unless we want medicine to simply be the stuff of technicians a technical pursuit which of course it is in many many ways i teach in med school i haven't as much lately but i've spent a lot of time teaching in schools of medicine and nursing and love it love it love it love it and if we view medicine as a technical pursuit simply then okay pre-med focus great but the trick is of course in medicine is our job is not just to it's one thing to know details about molecules how they work but it's a very different thing to know why it's amazing to have molecules in the first place and if you have not thought one way or another doesn't have to be art it doesn't even have to be through school per se but you better find a way to if you're going to go into the healing professions and clinical professions you better find a way to delve into why life is amazing and horrifying why is it so hard to let go of why it's so hard to love life when you know it's going away what is this all about in other words questions around meaning and identity one way or another weak physicians then you can see what happens in the healthcare system that is somehow has crowded those thoughts out as somehow being irrelevant you're left with a lot of zombies you're left with a lot of people with pulses but have no idea why it's amazing to have a pulse in the first place so anyway i can go on and on and on but boy i really really really love the notion of people who study humanities than going into the healing professions i think it's some people see that as like a left turn like oh but i couldn't make a bigger case for art history was some of the best preparation for medical school i could imagine i think you're bringing up really great points bj i think medicine needs all of the above you need people who have probably gone incredibly deep on a very narrow subset of science you need people who come in with engineering backgrounds you need people who come in with humanities backgrounds and i haven't to be honest with you paid much attention to how medical schools are doing these days in terms of recruiting talent what the war for talent looks like in medical school versus business school versus law school versus other graduate schools but i would hope that they've figured out what you're saying and they're making adjustments in that direction i think they are i know ucsf my alma mater has they've really invited folks like myself i didn't tell any of the pre-meds at princeton i did all the pre-med work after college and ucsf has purposefully attracted a lot of folks who are starting med school a little later in life have some other life experience etc something of a trend there i'm with you right it takes all of the above medicine is also a technical pursuit i guess even if someone wants to be a pre-med major take that more conventional route my advice to them was just make sure you actually love it just make sure you love the nuts and bolts you're not just doing chemistry just as a means to the end of medical school you find something to study that actually cultivates you loving something i think that's a major major distinction that could be engineering that could be art that could be chemistry yeah i've always felt that the history of science is also equally beautiful and so when you're studying physics and you're studying chemistry to be able to study it through the lens of how the people who discovered it went along their journey probably creates or at least fosters some of that intellectual curiosity and passion that i think can be found across multiple disciplines but still i want to get a better sense of what made you decide to take a very bold step which is i think to leave a comfort zone of you've now spent four years doing very well and you've got this degree in art history from one of the best schools in the country and you now decide to presumably go back and do a postback year to do a bunch of pre-med courses to go and do something that seems about as orthogonal from that as anything i'm sure it had a lot to do with your experience but can you speak specifically to what it was and how it for the lack of a better word marinated over the previous four or five years yeah no absolutely i can track this out so one of the things the injuries did for me cut to a spoiler one of the therapeutic endeavors here one of the ways to get through something is in some real ways to let yourself be changed by it i knew enough that thanks to my mother and the disability rights movement that the goal for me was to not get back to where i was before the injuries first of all practically speaking it wasn't possible i wasn't going to get my old body back also why cut myself off from all those lessons and all the experiences that happened during that period it's not something i could forget but nor is it something i would want to forget it's too dang rich so the idea was really always i knew versus the sort of normal language and thoughts around disability and it's like that it's something you would want to overcome put behind you and i think a lot of lay people or able-bodied people think the highest compliment they can offer a disabled person is oh i look at you and i don't see disability at all i know what they're trying to say and we can talk we can open that up too if you want to know down the road here but what we're trying to say but in a way it's not really a compliment i don't want people to ignore major parts of me just to look at me i'm not getting over these injuries every day i'm reminded this is not something of the past something i live every day so when i hear comments like that you just feel like you're just aware that you're not someone isn't really seeing all of you that's problematic in a number of ways so i knew i knew that i wanted to work with these experiences so that was a major major theme and medicine lit up as just theoretically as a way to put these experiences to use and the linkage between studying art and studying human endeavor in the study of medicine was not such a big leap the interest the through line the basil continuo for me was just being very interested in human beings human pursuits human endeavors and human creativity art was one application of those interests and medical science was another as i pondered what i wanted to do i thought well gosh medicine would be interesting if a doctor walked in to see me in the shoes that i'm wearing now that would affect me in a positive this was some way i was actively looking for an outlet where my injuries weren't something that someone would look past or forgive but were actually in some way something of an advantage and in this way for me in medicine i can tell you having this silhouette having this body has really been an advantage in a lot of ways if the goal is empathizing with your patients and their families if your goal is seeing yourself as a fellow human being next to them if you know or believe that's where healing happens then this kind of stuff is the best prop i've got going i really feel for my able-bodied clinicians who don't have some obvious source of pain and suffering that imparts to your onlookers departs to your patients that you've been through some stuff you've scraped the barrel so anyway i'm going on and on about that but so get back to your question that through line i knew i had a hunch that that would serve me in medicine just as it did in art and that i could apply these lessons into sort of a therapeutic application of studying perspective and meaning making so medicine lit up as a potential thing that i could do that would be fascinating i could make a living and i could exercise these lessons in a novel way so it makes unbelievable sense actually and i suspect it changed many things for you i mean look if you just described yourself as a six foot four handsome guy who goes to princeton you probably are a pretty ambitious guy you're gonna go off and study foreign relations and do all sorts of cool things and then everything kind of gets taken away in an instant how does that change your relationship with your own ambition or what it means to try and fail had you ever failed at anything by the way athletically and sort of academically even in the 90s i imagine getting into princeton was almost impossible yeah i exceeded in ways but also so true and i just had some green lights right in front of me i had this amazing education i had some basic abilities i could make a case for us that i had suffered and struggled in various ways up until that point and some things hadn't always gone right for me but there are such a such a different scale they're such a different scale but even as a kid so in some ways no i really hadn't experienced loss in some big way but what i had experienced was loss through people others that i cared about watching post polio syndrome take my mother's physical function down watching my sister's struggle so in some ways part of my charge as a young person was i hated that i didn't have more wrong with me i felt there was a mismatch i felt at odds with the world i felt this pain around me but i didn't really feel like i had my own access to it my problem was i didn't really have anything to complain about i knew that life was really really hard for many many people and internally my life was hard just imagining that and in some ways getting this new body and in some ways i have to say i've made it such i could have cultivated this idea but in a way i got the body that much more mirrored how i felt inside fragmented broken confused unintegrated different in some weird ways this body really the physiognomy of my body actually suited me in some real ways i chose that i ran with that it was true but it also was a way for me to get into this body eventually and quit wishing it were something else by building on what this body was showing me i knew the clever thing was i knew what i was doing was building a case that this was the right body that this was a good body this is the one for me and then you can imagine that really cuts down on the regret and the second guessing and if only i had four limbs then that's the kind of mindset i was heading for and trying to cultivate now here again brother what did you ask me that i went down on that change no actually i was talking about this idea of this could have actually liberated you a little bit yes yes and i think you've articulated that very neatly i want to come back to your sister we all do this when we get to medical school is we start to learn things that explain things we've seen in our past for example it's the first time you would have learned i suspect on some detail what the polio virus looks like and what a virus does how it is that your mom actually came to contract this virus and how a vaccine ultimately would go on to make sure people wouldn't get that virus and i would learn about the cardiovascular disease that ran so deeply in my family and really understand the pathology of this at some point did you start to suspect that your sister had whatever you want to call it formal mental illness or did you not think that that was the case at all or how did you think about your sister once you were in medical school and you began to learn about mental health in a somewhat formal way quick answer here is no i didn't the only time i actually let myself do that sort of the pathological overlay was after the fact after she had died leading up it's telling i mean leading up to that even through medical school studying manic depression something that she was posthumously diagnosed with oddly it never registered as me reading about someone like my sister somehow and i referenced this a little bit earlier was somehow the way she was or the our dynamic and it wasn't just me it was my parents too and her psychiatrist too she was a master manipulator she could have anyone thinking exactly what she wanted them to think and particularly me as her little doting brother who just looked up to her if i absorbed anything from lisa was that lisa was right lisa had it right including her angst and her pain that the world is a painful place and lisa was reflecting that anything i saw lisa was the standard she was right everyone else was wrong eventually kind of rolled with what she was selling i did roll with what she was selling and deeply to the point where any idea of pathologizing her just completely bounced off my head it didn't register as relevant to her she was the right one until she ended her life and then that prompted all sorts of revisiting that thinking also then eventually you know my parents what they did to try to make sense of all this they went through her diaries with a psychiatrist and it was in that act i didn't join them in that but i received the news and i believe it which is she was just textbook bipolar i mean just outrageously textbook and sometimes i'd get my quitting wanting to quit medicine did have some this was right after lisa died on the list of why i want to get out of medicine i was like jesus i can't i didn't even see right under my nose i'm trying to become like a healer person i can't even acknowledge that my sister's sick just was demoralizing on some level but but i also comforted myself she had a shrink for better than a dozen years who didn't notice this who didn't was who was somehow shocked that lisa killed herself weirdly i'd i remember on the one hand here i didn't see any of these signals coming and at the same time i remember where i was when i got the news of her death i was with my dad in a car and my buddy justin my mom called and my dad picked up in his kind of usual sing-songy way and there was a pause and then he immediately starts bawling i knew instantaneously that lisa was gone and when i heard it was suicide there was not a single cell of surprise in my body that's just an observation so i'm telling you two things on the one hand i didn't see it coming on the other hand i completely saw it coming i don't know how to reconcile those two but that's just the case so you're in your last year of medical school when this happens you've now alluded to this twice were you not planning to do a residency at this point or was this the event that sort of tipped you to not pursue your residency that following summer well all through med school i just assumed because i wasn't so enamored with medical science per se that was just a bag of tricks i was interested in gaining a career or work that allowed me to continue to thinking about these things and work with others and serve others around these ideas of identity of loss and trauma i just figured the best place for me to exercise that would be in the rehab setting so i was sort of beelining for physical medicine and rehabilitation so deep into medical school ucsf didn't have a program so i went and did an externship somewhere a rotation elsewhere out east and during that i'd already begun to apply for residencies in rehab medicine at that point and i so i then out here do a rotation having already committed to this field and i hated it the rotation was i just really did not enjoy it for all sorts of reasons one it was it was all mechanical this idea of like rehabilitation first of all the phrase is problematic rehab like the goal would be to get back to where you were before the injury which i've been saying i just don't believe it's true it's importantly untrue and this idea that it was so mechanical had nothing to do with the personal transformations that happened and that's where i realized i was so interested and that plus i realized as i was walking out of patients room i kept hearing nurses say look timmy you can be just like bj he's a doctor now i could hear myself being served up as a poster child and i didn't like the mechanics of the job i didn't want to be a poster child hypso facto i was like i gotta get out of this and one of my promises to myself going into medical school having learned what i learned was hey life's short life's important life's hard life's beautiful i'm not going to just get stuck somewhere and have a sacrificial life i know a lot of our colleagues in medicine who went into it because their parents were doctors and they hated it but what else am i going to do now i've gone this far or one way or another they just sign up willfully sign up for a life of misery i knew i wasn't going to do that so i promised myself and at this point another thing i learned from the injuries which was so critical was the ability to i was much less afraid now i was much less afraid of failure i was much less afraid of falling so you asked me earlier if i had anything really go wrong before in my life in some ways the answer is no i was a very frightful melancholy child sensitive which ended up manifesting as fearful at times now i was going the other direction man fear i had a totally different relationship with fear i saw falling as a skill so anyway the bottom line there was i was willing to try medicine and willing to dump it and in fact it felt empowering to do so it was a reminder that my life was bigger than just a job choice anyone's life is so there i am deep in med school already applying for residency screw this and so as i promised myself so i called dropped out of the match talked to my dean said hey i'm finished i'll graduate but you know i'm i'm gonna do other things she talked me into she said okay okay right i had begun to be disillusioned with medicine before my sister's death but that was sort of the straw that broke the camel's back as you've referenced i think we bring in idealism one way or another into the healing professions and then you have to go through this process of disillusionment where the practice of medicine isn't necessarily jiving with the ideals that you bring into it and that can be very stressful but i do think it's important for any trainee at one point or another to go through some disillusionment my response to that disillusionment was to get the hell out of it especially as i realized i didn't like rehab medicine and again lisa's death was just like proof that i'm just not i don't want to do this and i'm not cut out for it but then i got talked into doing my internship that first post-doc year and my family was in milwaukee at the time i had gone away i had left home when i was 15. and given lisa had just died given i didn't know what i was doing in some ways i said okay well moving with mom and dad we'll recongeal as a family spend that year together and i'll bang out my internship and just get that done and be done and move on but it was during that internship that i stumbled into palliative care and that's where everything changed again so bj what is it that you saw during your internship that both made you change your decision leaving medicine and also concentrated or focused you on an area of medicine called palliative care so a couple things happened one of the things i just sort of stumbled into this elective during my internship we have basically one month of an elective time if i remember correctly maybe more but i'd spend a little time with a hospice doc at one point actually my best friend's mother was involved with hospice and she turned me on to the idea but again i was so hell bent on rehab medicine figuring that was the place for me and wasn't sure that i had anything special to offer beyond that sort of rehab setting but i had absorbed that hospice was simply just where people go for the final days of life that was um i thought i understood what that meant but anyway stumbled into this palliative care elective at the medical college of wisconsin which just happens to have been one of the early adopters of palliative care david weissman an oncologist there had built one of the early great palliative care programs just happened to be there and on that first day we went and saw a patient i watched david talk to her about code status this was in the hospital he was a woman with heart disease advanced heart disease and david was trying to talk to her about her wishes what kind of care she wanted for and trying to impart how serious her heart condition had become tricky conversations very emotionally psychologically loaded content really tricky the zone that medicine traditionally does not handle very well and so i've seen all these counterpoints but right here i'm watching this guy sit with this woman sits on the edge of her bed with her just immediately this very different rapport he's talking to her like a human being not hovering over her like a superior someone who's there to fix her he was there as a fellow human being and it just showed it in his body language and his tone and his word choice it was beautiful and he said to her and i just watched how she responded to him and it was remarkable and he said something to her he tried to get to the code status question said something essentially like when you die do you want us to help that process along make sure you're comfortable through that process or do you want us to really fight that he wants to go to war with that notion and do our best to pull you back something along those lines but the magic moment was him looking in the eye and saying when you die of course as human beings that's a very reasonable thing to say because we all die it's not if it's women in the medical setting that is not the way these conversations generally work i was so moved by watching this and he dared to acknowledge this woman's death and what i saw on her face was not shock horror anger but relief that this man was talking to her plainly about her life and it was so gorgeous so poignant that moment really really stuck with me and as i got went home that night i remember thinking about it it's like well this is what i've been looking for this is in this world we take out of care world illness disability death are normal they're not anomalous this field treats these life events as normal life events which of course they are the starting point for palliative care is something's happening that you can't fix that you can't change and that was for me all along in rehab you could see would be similar like rehab the events already happened something's gone wrong now what you do i knew i was interested in the now what but here this field was digging into all the it's not just the angle of the joint it was concerned with but the angle of the thoughts and the way that we see ourselves in the words we choose to describe our place in the world and how we either suffer for those words or how we really can find ourselves through something more therapeutic and it was such a craft it was such a stuff of words instrument so anyway i really was really really moved but the first axis that opened up was i'm not here to fix people i'm here to be with people as they find their way as they deal with things that they can't control and that was a hope for me in so many ways how would you explain to someone the difference between palliative care and hospice which i think many people use interchangeably but i don't think they really are interchangeable are they they are not thank you thank you thank you a quick public service announcement because it's a really big problem for a number of reasons but palliative care is simply the interdisciplinary pursuit of the quality of life within the context of serious illness palliative care is that mode of care which helps you feel as well as possible emotionally physically spiritually you name it my job is to help you deal with the facts of your life and to feel as well as you can there is nothing in the definition account of care that makes it that you need to be dying anytime soon time is not mentioned there is death is included in this but it's not the focus it's simply the pursuit of quality of life and if you need to pose it like we do in medicine if you need to have uh objects of your efforts and enemy as it were the thing we're after the thing that we treat is suffering versus disease and there's a lot to that we can unpack that but so that's pound of care hospice is a subset of patent care which is that mode that type of care but reserved for the end of life the final months of life so hospice really is it's essentially end of life care is pound of care that's applied at the end of life but that's just hospice without a care there's no mention of time you just have to be struggling you should have to be interested in quality of life you not have to be dying anytime soon this is a huge huge distinction because of all of our deaf folk because they think out of care and end-of-life care or hospice are the same no one wants to talk about it no one wants to face that because of all the baggage around death so consequently people suffer for years where they could get a lot more support out of care but because of this misunderstanding they don't elect out of care because they think that's only relevant for them if they're dying and nothing could be farther from the truth so does that make sense it really does yes and i appreciate that distinction good what do you think it is about us as a species i can only speak to us because other species i don't think share our metacognition but why are we in such denial about death it's been said by so many people we are all terminally ill and yet most of us myself certainly included don't act that way at times we tend to fixate on things that absolutely don't matter for many people there's frank denial of this thing it's out there with some sort of abstract idea but it's certainly nothing that warrants any attention in terms of decisions one makes today that's really the first question i have and then i there's other things i want to explore here with you but what is your take on our just inability to look at death i think for starters i know in my field and elsewhere for folks who have kind of dared to turn their attention to mortality or have been forced to then you look back on the rest of the world and you see a world so invested in ignoring this part of life that it can feel a little perverse and i think a lot of us are quick to say the world or americans in particular are in denial and there's some truth to that for sure but i also think we should cut each other some slack just physiologically neurohormonally we are wired to run away from death any threat to our existence we have deep wiring that makes us fight that thing or flee it or go limp so we have that impulsiveness and then i think on top of that there's as old as human beings has been this acknowledged that we die that any adult in this world maybe not even just adults one way another human beings eventually come to the realization that death happens including their own death and i'm not sure that any other species has to live has to walk through life feeling that so it is quite a predicament we humans have it's elemental it is at the root of the judeo-christian tradition it's a root of many religious belief systems a lot of philosophy of thought it's at the root of song and artwork i mean this is a huge huge subject that humans really really struggle to wrap their heads around so i just want to give us plenty of breadth and i don't want us to be ashamed that we haven't figured out this death thing so on top of those old threads in modern times in the last 150 years medical science we're sort of a victim of our own success medical science has gotten much better it's easy to be seduced my life has been saved by medicine it's easy to believe that medicine can force stall death perhaps indefinitely so you throw all these things together in social cues around anti-aging this and that and you got to stay healthy and beautiful forever and put all that stuff together and we've conspired to set up a pretty tricky relationship to this piece of our nature no harm no foul but i think the reason to push back on this is a people die much more miserable than they need to because they haven't dared to look at this thing called death before it's too late and because also we have a health care system that it's not an intuitive thing to navigate anymore and thanks to our technology it's not impossible end up on a series of machines and that by some definition of life you have a pulse but that's not a life that a lot of us want to live is hooked up to machines so we have this weird technological moment that you can kind of live forever by some very reduced definition of life anyway there's a little bit of a rundown why it's so dang hard to turn our attention to this but when people do and i'll i'm coming to the climax here brother but one of the things you learn whether through religious and philosophical thinking or frankly in clinical thinking whether by choice or by force once you have to actually try to stare this thing called mortality this thing called death in the eye not only do you realize that hey maybe it's not so terrifying after all and that you can do it but it has a secondary effect of once you come to terms with your time is precious and that time is relatively short or at least not endless it has a secondary effect of helping you really really appreciate what you have the fact that it ends is what makes it precious so there are reasons why we don't look at death and there are some really good reasons to help each other find a way to do so i think that's just such an eloquent description of what i consider to be a huge dialectical challenge which is the problem that i focus on bj in medicine is how to live longer how to do so without requiring the heroics of medicine at end of life so just as you became disillusioned with medicine so too did i but it was for a slightly different reason which was boy we sure do put a staggering amount of resources and effort into things that with probably one-tenth of this effort could have been forced all or prevented altogether and i didn't think i could do anything about it so i left for a period of time before ultimately coming back to it but i think that what you said is i completely agree that we can do both right we can do everything in our power to maximize our lives here just as medicine allowed you to live that day there's a very good chance at a different hospital under different settings you would have died 30 years ago but you didn't now you're still going to die just as i am of course and everyone listening to this is going to die so we can do both we can figure out a way to live the best life possible the longest life possible should we choose that to be the case but none of that diminishes what you've said and i think that's the part that a lot of people don't appreciate is that it's one or the other and it can't be both amen you just hit on a real kind of a root cause one of the ways we struggle so much these days is from our structures our constructs our ways of thinking and as long as we think it's either life or death that either you love life and try everything you do to extend it or you love death and just completely accept that it's going to come today this false dichotomies are the problem and i'm so with you there's one reason i'm so excited to be invited on your podcast but is because our relationship with death is maybe a problem or just under realize but if there's a problem here it's the false dichotomy it's the either or thinking when the both and thinking is really where it's at so i love that you and others are trying to think through how to live longer and live better i love life my relationship to death even my acceptance of death is only to do with my love of life it would be a real shame of a shortcut that if in order to prepare yourself for the inevitability of death you somehow stopped loving life you somehow welcome depression so therefore you wouldn't love life so that much so therefore you're ready to die because life kind of sucks it could be so so much better than that and if we can find our way to include death into our view of reality like i don't love death i love reality and reality happens to include death therefore i'll deal with death i'm in no way concerted around it i'm in no way incentivized to make death happen again i appreciate you having this conversation with me i think there's a lot to be learned by pushing past the either or of this you've spent more time with people who are closer to death than almost anybody listening to this certainly you're in a profession that very few people go into as you've pointed out there are many reasons for that do you get the sense that when someone is at the end of their life they are more afraid of death in the sense of being gone or the act of dying and presumably what the actual mechanism of death and or suffering is yeah it's a really a great distinction very helpful one clinically presentation may be someone's freaked out about dying or some existential anxiety but of course as is the case with these things it pays to look a little bit more closely and see some things out here and one of the major things to tease out is are you afraid of the dying process like you're mentioning here like the suffering you imply that must happen during the dying process is that what you're picturing and therefore is that the source of your anxiety or is it are you really afraid to be dead whether your belief system suggests there's a judgment day and a reckoning perhaps a hell perhaps who knows what are you afraid of what may be coming next are you afraid to be gone are you afraid to miss out does it freak you out that the world will go on without you a major poll here or a major divide crossroads let's say is are you afraid of dying or are you afraid of being dead the former one of the reasons to tease us out is the former afraid of dying well we know a fair amount about that there's physiology to mark there are medications to help there are ways to help a body come down for a gentle landing as i say there's no need to be miserable and in pain at the end of life for the most part we can do a lot with medications we can do a lot to ease the suffering at the end of life in the dying process so the answer if that's your fear then the answer is reassurance if your concern is being dead well i don't have answers for you but i can as a fellow traveler i can accompany you there we can think about that together we can talk about it and then we can make a life that responds to that big question so if you're afraid of your belief system has you afraid of a judgment day well let that spur you to behave a little differently in the time you have left or let that help you wade into non-duality let that help you wade into the world beyond yourself that's my favorite response if anyone's interested in living forever my favorite means to living forever is to think about the world beyond yourself invest yourself in the world beyond yourself so when your self dies that thing you love keeps going anyway this is where it gets really really fascinating the relationship between self and other and what to do about that religious thinking spiritual pursuits this is what can open up when you admit that you're freaked out to be dead it's such an interesting way you explain the idea of again for me it's very clearly the latter not the former and i guess that's just because i have the luxury of medical training and i understand where and when one can draw the line for themselves with respect to what measures are taken how heroically they are and obviously the power of medicine to greatly reduce the suffering but it's this other piece of missing your family missing out on future generations leaving behind people you love to me those are the hardest things and of course your point is you can live through those things but you have to do something about it it doesn't happen automatically you have to make the investment and the irony is the time to do that is while we're alive amen just gave me chills you just completed the circle yep which almost suggests that palliative care needs to begin much earlier in life amen which is why it's such a shame that we forestall and keep it at bay when it's this thing that could help us so so much whether actually a pout of care referral or a pound of care mindset but one way or another finding our way into this subject while we've got plenty of road in front of us is absolutely the right best way you know it seems that there's a continuum where you have life you have acute illnesses more life acute illnesses chronic illnesses life and death the hospital and the entire medical system is really only geared to treat with the acute problems it has virtually no tool dealing with life or even chronic conditions and certainly not death i don't want to get into the why is that the case we can sit here and debate about incentives all day long i think it's straightforward i mean i think we understand that the incentives are such that reimbursement follows the treatment of acute conditions and to some extent chronic conditions i guess the more relevant question is what would have to change to realign the focus of resources to make it such that medicine could be more about helping people live and then helping them die when that time comes as a part and parcel of helping them live then relate those two things so i think a couple answers to your question i think one is in a big office somewhere at hhs when they're trying to redesign a health care system and even redraft a mission statement i would challenge hhs i mean to read the definition of palliative care and tell me why the definition of palliative care isn't the mission of all of health care so one answer your question is you can see that both the strengths of the health care system and the trouble that comes from it is a design flaw because you and i both know healthcare is littered with people who really really care and are trained at the hilt and yet the care we're able to meet out too often falls short i don't think the problem is the people i think the problem is there's a design flaw and for my money the design flaw has to do with the system is focused on disease not on the people dealing with disease and the second you make it about the person living with the disease not the disease itself well you've welcomed all sorts of things into the mix beyond just their physiology and anatomy you've welcomed their social emotional and spiritual lives into the mix you've also welcomed your humanness into the mix as being relevant you as a clinician being relevant beyond just your technical skills which will push back on burnout for one thing you've also made yourself in service of a human condition which means for us clinicians the expectation management we're not expected to work miracles we know that at some day everyone's going to die and that that's not a failure for us we didn't the person didn't succumb to the disease and we doctors didn't fail to make them live forever then once we align healthcare with the human condition and with serving human beings so much of the trouble will work itself out because we will be designed around the right thing so that's one answer to your question i think it's that simple and that hard on some level and then medical scores medical training would have to follow suit and revisit how we think about these things i mean for example think about your medical school training peter 100 of your patients die any rotation that you ever go through no condition befalls percent of your patients but a hundred percent of our patients suffer a hundred percent of our patients die and given that wouldn't you think that a responsible medical school curriculum that we would start and end day one and the last day would be around conversations like we're having now the palliative care would not need to be a specialty it would be baked into how all of medicine works so for my money that's a major thing that needs to happen policy will flow etc i also think to make that happen and to not wait for that happen that we human beings we people irrespective of our professions need to kind of come together as a society and to take these issues on especially right now when we're all so polarized and so divided and so aware about the things that we don't have in common with each other what a perfect time to revisit where we actually do have so much in common and where we do have so much in common revolves around everything we're talking about right now black white rich poor young old i don't care these issues affect all of us this is a genuine way for us to work on the points in common so we can make political comments about why now is right for that the health care system itself can't keep doing what it's doing and can't keep death the enemy because it's going to lose that war again and again and again and one way you can keep score on that is just cost yep cost alone is a metric by which we are losing health care is obviously one of two things that will either bankrupt the united states if they can't print their way out of it or create sort of seismic economic shifts and i do think that part of it is as you said we've taken the wrong strategy in a war that probably ought to be deemed more of a truce and put our resources in the wrong place can i ask you a question on that though yeah yeah why would you say that we are so focused on acute care and not on chronic care if most everybody is going to die of most of chronic conditions etc i should say i think we do focus a lot on chronic care i just don't think we're good at it so what i meant to say was i think where medicine is very good is on acute care and i think where medicine is really bad is on chronic care and i think those are the two things it works on it has nothing to do with sort of healthy life to prevent acute or chronic issues and it has nothing to do with death so that's sort of yeah just thanks for asking me to clarify that but yes i think we disproportionately focus on chronic despite our relative lack of success with it why do we keep doing that do you have a sense well i think in some cases we don't know what to do to prevent the condition so certain conditions never show up as acute cancer does not show up acutely i shouldn't say that it kind of does but it doesn't really fall under the rubric of acute care medicine the way appendicitis does but we don't really have a great sense of cancer you know we know smoking and obesity are the two greatest risk factors for it but there's many other risk factors including chance that we probably don't understand and even the ones that we do understand like obesity we don't really have the infrastructure to help with prevention so you talked about how in medical school we didn't have a single course on dying we also didn't have a single course on nutrition or exercise or stress management or the psychology of eating in our relationship to food and how you can help patients make better choices with nutrition and things like that so i don't buy the narrative that we have an obesity crisis just because sort of people are fat dumb and lazy i think we live in a toxic food environment and we don't have a health care system that's really geared to help people out of it because frankly physicians aren't compensated to do that you just don't have the billable structure in which you can do these things so instead i think we focus on where our tools are and our tools are drugs drugs become a good tool to use in a chronic condition setting right oh i think i'd add to that maybe encapsulate this list three ways one is the design flaw that we're death phobic and we see ourselves as victors when we cure something when we fix something so chronic illness by definition is something that we can't fix so i think it presents us with a sense of failure which i think is an emotional barrier to developing it further that's one big piece of the design flaw i think a second big piece of the design flaw is the way the busyness of medicine goes we are left to see medicine as a series of transactions which in acute care makes a lot more sense in chronic care it becomes part of the experience you're not kicking this thing out of the body you've got to learn to live with it so illness and health becomes protracted over time and therefore becomes an experience but we're wired for transactions we don't have the systems and structures in place to be cultivating experiences together with our patients that's the second thing and i think the third thing is this reimbursement and we are incentivized away from thinking about care over time so anyway i just want to complete that question for both of us i think that's why we're where we're at yeah i appreciate that structure that you've put to it i want to ask you about patients that you interact with during hospice so these are now going to be the patients who are probably in the final months of their life and that could be cancer is obviously a very common pathway that you'll interact with hospice patients is that the most common proximate cause of death for hospice patients in the united states cancer yes no it is no longer the majority until recently it's less than 50 percent now progressive neurological illnesses are on the rise cardiovascular organ failure but yeah fewer than 50 of deaths the hospice deaths are cancer at this point what do patients say most to you when i was in medical school i did a stint at the national cancer institute and then i went back there for my formal training fellowship and people that came to the nci to where i was and i suspect to elsewhere in the nci were generally patients who had progressed through all forms of treatment all standard treatments so they had metastatic disease that had failed to respond to any form of treatment so therefore they were at the nci for experimental treatment and at least for the type of cancer we worked on the survival was between 10 and 20 percent meaning 80 to 90 percent of the people we met were going to die very soon within six months typically i remember obviously feeling very attached to many of them and also spending time with them and asking them questions like what do they wish they could do how do they want to spend this time that they have left and sometimes they would share regrets and i always remember thinking i wish i could write a book about this just interviewing people like this but it felt it didn't feel right to me it was one of those things that just felt like it should be shared but i wouldn't know how to share it i suspect you've had more of those discussions than you can remember and i wonder what things you've learned from them these vicarious death bed moments i have a lot of them i think a lot of us in this field and maybe a medicine general like to say how privileged we are to be in this position how lucky we are to have our patients let us in to these very poignant moments it's so intimate so yeah there's a lot to be said for those moments including your wanting to protect those moments and not necessarily ram them into a book although there are sure as a way to do that skillfully the world could benefit from it but the regrets that pop in that i see at the end of life the conventional ones are sure you hear people say things like i wish i had spent more time with my family than at the office yeah things like that you know sure that comes up but in a way by time someone's actually in their death bed and again these days most of us dying from chronic illnesses that means we have some protracted period of time to think about our death specifically we will be introduced to the thing that will end our life months or years in advance and so by the time those folks get around to their end of their life they're beyond the sort of pat regrets they shouldn't work so much for example oftentimes if they're regretting anything they're hanging on to anything including regrets it's more likely i wish i had loved dared to love more i wish i hadn't been so afraid i wish i had just let myself be myself i wish i hadn't been so hard on myself or criticized myself those regrets they all have something to do in common and the commonality is it's sort of like oftentimes the common pathway is they wish they had let themselves come to terms with death earlier in their lives because it would have changed the decisions they made i think one of the things that people come to realize on their death bed and one of the things that i saw at getting close to my own was really grasping it in our guts that death is coming no matter what we do even in your work promoting a longer life as you said earlier doesn't mean that death isn't still coming it's coming later given that this is the freedom that comes from reckoning with death which is if okay you're telling me that no matter what i do if i'm a good person a bad person i eat my veggies i don't eat my veggies i smoke i don't smoke whatever it is either way if i'm going down eventually in other words if failures in this way quote unquote failure is guaranteed then in some ways the pressure's off like the pressure's on for me to take my life seriously but the pressure is off for me to get everything just perfect there's this biphasic effect that i see in myself and some of my patients which is they see the grip that fear has had on them distraction is done to them and they realize that no man the only thing i have to lose is wasting my time so i'm not going to waste my time i'm going to take this stuff seriously i'm going to say what i want to say to people i'm going to do what i want to do because if failure is guaranteed then i'm no longer doesn't make much sense to be afraid of failure anymore or not be limited by it because i'm going to fall either way so might as well try so i have the death gives me the reason to try and gives me the reason or the way of forgiving myself for quote unquote failing so it really in this way can be a real liberating force and i see people grok that and the regrets have something to do with not coming to that place sooner you presumably encounter patients who have the sort of proverbial dying wish never saw the grand canyon and i really want to go and see it never seen the mona lisa and i want to see it or i've never taken this vacation with my family how much of your work is trying to help patients navigate those wishes medically for example is someone strong enough to physically go to the grand canyon and can you put in a last-ditch heroic effect to get them there i mean how much of that do you do some i'm involved with an organization called the dream foundation out of santa barbara what they do for a living as an organization is help make those trips to the grand canyon or whatever those final wishes actually happen for adults in this country it's beautiful and i have been engaged in some of that with some patients whether you know a handful occasions where someone was here who may have lived here for a long time but grew up elsewhere and wanted to get home as it were back to the philippines or back to somewhere else and helping this sort of one last trip happen i've been involved with that a lot i've been involved with some bedside weddings in a hospital just before someone died i've been involved with some trips done to the grand canyon so some of that that is true like some of my job especially if i can be engaged with someone soon enough while there's still energy and time to work with then making those sort of last wishes happen is great it's fun it's great work it's powerful it's delightful and it's stunning but i will say and so i do some of that but for whatever reason i'm more engaged with people around letting go of that wish or that need to go see the grand canyon or whatever it may be of letting go of the things that they're not going to be able to do or at least grocking that fact so yes sometimes the response is to mobilize energy to do that thing i'd say more often and right alongside that wish is also helping them see the world and see themselves in the world in such a way that they can let go of those things that they never got to because they realize the things that they're not going to get to is a very long list and on a developmental level you've got to find a way to come to terms with all the things you're not going to get to do so that's where i spend a lot of my time movies lead us to believe that people become enlightened and hyper transcendent at the end of life but my experience with patients at the end of their lives is that oftentimes they're so heavily medicated that they're not really even able to communicate much with their loved ones and that's the price we'll pay to keep them comfortable especially patients with metastatic cancer the pain would be so debilitating it would be inhumane to let them suffer without those medications and frankly in the circumstances when we're lucky enough to do so we can get expressed direction from the patients before they get there that hey i don't want to suffer and i don't want a breathing tube put into my chest i don't want to be intubated and i don't want you to do chest compressions on me when my heart stops i just want enough medicine to be comfortable and so you don't have these sort of diving into a person's soul in the last day of their life kind of thing is that your experience also absolutely it is there are exceptions but not many the last day or two of life is not necessarily the greatest time to be digging into someone's soul and i will say you're right about medications is a big piece of this but i will also say just for your listeners a refinement here again pushing on the either or kind of thinking it's not either take meds and be comfortable or don't take meds and be lucid intractable pain is a great route to delirium and even if you're not delirious trying to have an exchange with someone when your body is in absolute agony is is a pretty quixotic experience i will say that another plug for pound of care is with very expert and judicial use of pain medications but we can often thread a needle and get someone comfortable enough but not so overly medicated that they can't interact we just want to name that refinement a little bit either way peter your point's still taken the very very final hours of life you're not generally reviewing much you're not having big philosophical conversations at that point in so many ways whether by medication or force of the disease it's too late which i think speaks to what you said earlier that there really is no time like the present to say what it is you want to say to people who matter it's not the movie where your final breath is asking for forgiveness or telling somebody you forgive them or that you love them that's very unlikely to happen that's very unlikely to happen as is anything sort of cleanly like closure i love pointing this out to folks one of the things in my world in empowered care world one of the things you would want to forestall with knowing so much pains coming is you want to forestall the avoidable regrets and avoidable pains but you're not necessarily going to get there in your final breath tell me the story about randy sloan how did you meet him randy was a beautiful young man so i met randy he worked at a motorcycle shop so when i first met rand one of my wishes for myself once i became an amputee was to get on it back on a motorcycle at some point i've always loved biking i'd always wanted to get on a motorcycle every once in a while swing through a motorcycle shop and see if there was any way to convert a bike and every time i walked in there i couldn't get anyone to take it on i think they all just freaked out like no way dude we're not putting you on a death machine never i didn't tried that hard but i never could get anyone really interested in one day i walked into a place called scuderia west here in san francisco and just met a wholly different energy and these guys were actually interested in trying to make it happen saw it as a creative exercise and that's exactly the spirit you need and randy was the mechanic who put his hand up is wanting to help make this happen so randy he was a bike mechanic and he took my bike and he managed to figure out a way for me to operate it with just one hand by a series of modifications and so he helped make this dream come true for me and it was beautiful for both of us he loved making it happen and i sure loved that he did then we had this gorgeous like teary moment when i picked up the bike and rode off in the sunset so it was just a beautiful but you know time-limited interaction with randy and then not that much longer i can't remember now months or maybe a year later and randy was in his mid-20s by the way randy ended up somehow his mother reached me and let me know that randy was in the hospital and something really big time was going wrong and randy and i had remembered each other because we were both moved by this story and his mom reached out and he knew i was a doctor so blah blah blah eventually i got to randy's bedside and randy had been walking up a hill in san francisco found himself a little out of breath went to urgent care they took an x-ray and he had turned out to have mesothelioma which is essentially unheard of in someone in their 20s i mean this is a cancer that is almost exclusively associated with long-term asbestos exposure in elderly folks and i don't know enough about motorcycles to know if there was asbestos in them but even if there was you'd think this is something that would still be 40 years later you're right so total freakish and even if you had had exposure it's rare to find exposed to asbestos these days much rarer but at that age you just don't have even time to develop the cancer it takes a while after exposure so just a real mystery how this young man came down with widely metastatic mesothelioma even at the time of diagnosis scans revealed it was in his brain stem he's one of these guys went from walking talking to that day was in the hospital on death's door and people scurrying around trying to make a plan what to do i met him i walked into that situation and by the time i even got to the hospital that he had had a dose of whole brain radiation because brain stem lesion was very precarious and they needed immediate care so he had already been radiated within hours and walked into a situation here's a young man trying to deal with this diagnosis come to terms with it and all that it meant and it meant that his life was measured in weeks at that point right from the time of diagnosis so i became his path of care doctor and we were together for the rest of the time and we got him into i saw him into at that point i was working at zen hospice project in san francisco he moved in there with us and he played his life out with us it was an amazing experience i think one of the most amazing things about it besides the medical like mesothelioma and this young man blah blah blah the really interesting stuff was how randy responded to this diagnosis and he and his mother and i were all it's just two didn't make sense it was too soon so we were all gearing up to think that somehow treatment was going to help him a sober conversation there was nothing that was going to help him at this point except for love that one dose of whole brain radiation really threw him for a loop i'm trying to talk to him about the fact trying to bridge him to the point to the realization that he has no good cancer fighting options and you're watching this guy's world shrink miserably by the second and to find a way out of this tailspin and to find a way forward we had our dutiful kind of pad of care conversation which and included a question in there eventually about like what was really important to him what about him that he want to protect as his body was falling apart what did he love most about himself somehow the question to randy became what are you most proud of in yourself as a young man in development it seemed like an important question and his answer was immediate his answer was i want everybody i ever come into contact know that i love them he answered the question immediately it was remarkable coming out of a 27 year old bike mechanic so there it was i said okay we need to keep you as comfortable and conscious as possible for what time you have and be in a position that your friends and people can visit you so that meant let's get you in the hospice house out of your teenie apartment walk up apartment where you have three roommates let's get you into this hospice house let's get you out of the charade of treatment let's treat your symptoms and open up your door and get as many people in here as you want and that's what we did he just had a steady stream of visitors he just basically became this radiant beam of love for what time he had and just made sure to love as many people as he humanly could and with that his mother and his stepfather came out and got married at the hospice house around the time he died he got in the the bay one more time for a swim he got to be with his dog and he let everyone know what randy meant was love and that became his legacy and he died smiling and quickly this all transpired over what felt like hours what role does euthanasia play i shame to admit i'm a little bit ignorant about the legality if it's state by state obviously i know that oregon is a state where it's legal how many states in the u.s have legalized euthanasia or some form of physician-assisted suicide i believe the number is now nine i have to double check that there's still it's unfurling as we speak there's efforts going on in every state house but i'm pretty sure the number is nine the first was oregon in 97 california in 2016 and others have followed suit montana oregon colorado california d.c others that i can't remember right now it's coming slowly but surely state by state has it demonstrably changed the practice of hospice or palliative care or is it almost moot because so much of threading that needle as you described it effectively it doesn't happen maybe in as dramatic a fashion but in the end of life care that you're discussing for example in in the case of someone like randy if randy had said let's say a few weeks sooner i want to go down the path of euthanasia what would have been different than what he ultimately ended up doing at zen hospice there was a moment there i could imagine he would have really elected it the world was falling apart too quickly it was too painful for a little while there for randy to see straight the process we can talk is a little bit of wonky there's a two week wait you need to have two physicians you need to write a letter they're fail-safes because what the state wants to avoid is it making it too easy for people to do something that they otherwise might regret because i think many of us have moments where we just as soon get off the planet especially when we're dealing with something like a terminal diagnosis it's a funny thing where life's ending soon some folks have this response okay i'm dying so there okay now that i realize i'm dying well now i can't die soon enough it's almost like once you pierce the veil of indefinite life which people really long for on some levels think they long for then all of a sudden they're terminal and then they can't die soon enough it's sort of a final act of control and a bit of an fu to death well you think you're inevitable i'll show you it's the quit before getting fired impulse in some ways there are other ways there are many things that drive the impulse but that's a sort of a side note but answer your question i mean if randy had enacted this procedure and ended his life hastened his death before nature otherwise would have had it well randy would have died sooner randy would have been able to schedule the moment of his death it would have been something and on some level that could have served him but the realization that randy had a mission to sort of prove love to show love to be love he had a reason to keep going there's a moment where if it had been too easy for him he probably would have elected to hasten his death but because he didn't and because he let it play out a little bit longer he got to a lot more people he had a lot more final moments with friends he got into the bay and he had the pride of playing his body all the way out he played every cell all the way out which for randy served him very very well and i think it makes the point one of the problems with the dying laws and let me just pause there too by the way peter the language of physician-assisted suicide has gone away in favor of aid and dying or assisted dying to get rid of the word suicide emotional baggage around that word and importantly these laws are for people who already have a terminal diagnosis and for whom death is coming soon so it's importantly different but if we had just exceeded his wishes and said oh sure you want to die randy sooner and later yeah we'll make that happen just in the name of helping him not suffer we've made that happen and it would have been a mistake in his case because as i think a lot of us know intuitively or explicitly a meaningful life a good life is not the absence of suffering suffering teaches us too much it's too important a vehicle for us actually a full life requires it and i don't mean to castigate anyone who does choose to hasten their death for some people it is exactly the right decision when it is seen as a meaningful response not a flight from suffering but a moving toward something meaningful and for some people a final act of will is very meaningful but for more people what ends up being more meaningful is them being more than their pain being more than their suffering and letting their body play themselves all the way out and dealing with and adapting every moment along the way trimming their sails along the way letting themselves be changed letting themselves grow right up into the moment of their death that's actually a more meaningful pursuit for the bulk of people it's really that pain matters more than being numb yeah yeah when it comes down to it when it comes down to it for most of us and this is a realization that came clear to me when i was in my hospital bed pain is very obnoxious and i don't like this stuff we can be more than our pain pain isn't ultimately avoidable in a full life like i said and it can teach us some things and really i'd much rather feel some exceptions and there's ways to paint this otherwise but in general i'd rather feel something even if it's pain than feel nothing anesthesia is a way a numbness is a way to die before we have to die that seems to be a bigger tragedy to me than is death in the first place have you had any experience with the use of psychedelics in end-of-life care are people doing any research on this obviously i'm aware of the research on psilocybin in patients with cancer i believe there was research done helping with end-of-life depression are you aware of any other agents that are used besides psilocybin for that research anything with mdma i'm not sure if which obviously i know mdma is being used to treat ptsd but what does the scope and breadth of that look like today substance is being researched along these and for end of life anxieties fears of death studying a patient population dealing with terminal illness or serious illness i can't quote to you all the latest details of studies there are studies ongoing for yes for psilocybin but also for mdma and then related similar but different is ketamine in the way ketamine is proving its way to therapeutic new therapeutic values so yes i'm most excited around the research around mdma and psilocybin and the research so far we've got a little ways to go but the data are pretty darn stunning the impact is huge and offers access the psilocybin stuff's the most remarkable i think one guided session where setting matters dose matters the integration process matters it's not just people going out in the woods and having fun but with this process there are really no adverse events to speak of people who are gripped by a fear of death gripped by a sense of meaninglessness and not belonging and not feeling connected come out of those one session losing their fear of death feeling part of something larger than themselves having a totally different relationship to fear this is one session the effect lasts for months it's not just a chemical effect per se we don't have anything remotely like this to offer in medicine the closest thing i have in my conventional work as a doctor someone comes to me with death anxiety two things i can do i can talk them out of it and try to with enough time we can find a new way of seeing themselves in the world a framework that allows them to feel like they belong in their own framework it takes time if we can get there at all and the other thing i can do is if you're really anxious well i can numb you out i can give you valium or whatever else i can put a wet blanket on your system that's the best we've had to date i don't have an intervention that helps me connect you to meaning connect you to the cosmos but these medications are offering exactly that and it is beautiful so we've got a little ways to go but i am thrilled for this potential are these tools the things you're probably most excited about in in your field in terms of being able to kind of revolutionize how you're able to help the patients who want or need that type of intervention or is there anything else that even rivals this yes there are two things so strictly speaking from like a medical medicationy medical physiology-ish kind of overlay the medical lens i would say the research going on around these substances psilocybin mdma ketamine etc are my favorite thing going maybe even bigger maybe the other thing that gets me more excited is the work going on on the periphery of healthcare and outside of healthcare that conversations like the one you and i are having peter and i thank you for it up and down one of the things we're doing is we're kicking the conversation beyond just medicine it's like we were saying earlier about the design flaw that medicine focuses on the disease not the person and one of the great things that happens when we focus on the person is that we in medicine become part of something larger than ourselves and we can partner with architects and artists and designers and other disciplines and death doulas and quasi-medical folks and alternative and integrative medicine folks all of a sudden we are part of a much larger family working on behalf of something much larger than even medicine and that's where i get really excited that people that society that culture is waking up to these issues death has become a medical issue it doesn't belong there suffering and death are way bigger than medicine medicine may have something to offer this getting back to your question the thing that i'm more excited than anything else is the rise of commerce multi-disciplinary work other institutions and vehicles tuning into this idea of life and death so that medicine doesn't have to carry all that weight water by itself that people are going to start taking care of people and not handing themselves over to doctors to do the trick pj i really want to thank you because your work and the work of people like you has actually had quite a profound impact on the way i think about life i'm in the process of sort of barely putting the finishing touches on a book about longevity and i've kind of come to the realization lately it's very difficult to do this without writing about death in some way but not as an enemy but more in a manner that is sort of symbiotic with life so maybe not quite a friend but certainly not a hostile combatant i just think the way that you've been able to speak about this so eloquently for many years now has been a great benefit to not just the people you've helped which is obvious i think those of us who are presumably a little bit further from needing that help peter i can't wait to read that book man and that is right on i think you will help so many people just this frame shift of finding a way to include death in your view of reality is one of the great services you can do the world man and i oh i can't
