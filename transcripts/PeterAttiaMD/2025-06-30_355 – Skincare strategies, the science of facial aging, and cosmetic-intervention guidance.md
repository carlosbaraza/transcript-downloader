## Transcript

[00:00:00] Why did I look better at 42 than 52? Start the discussion through the lens of preventive care. The absolute minimum thing I should use on my skin every day, it would be sunscreen. I tell my patients they have to use mineral sunscreens as opposed to chemical sunscreens. Cheapest trick in skincare. You can go to Walgreens and spend $6 on

[00:00:20] Aquafor and your skin will look better in 30 days, guaranteed. How much do you see trends that dramatically change what people are asking for? The images that are being posted are not real. I try to really educate my patients to stay away from things that are trending and really do things that make them look and feel better but natural for themselves. So, so what is it that you see tenuous that is most disconcerting? I think overfilling is a serious problem. Um whether it's the lips or the cheeks, the companies will tell you that filler only lasts one year in the face and you have to refill it. That's definitely not true. Really, I show up in your office.

[00:00:59] I can't tell you what's wrong, but I show you a picture of me 10 years ago and I say, "I want to look like that." Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Aia.

[00:01:17] Too Suzanne, great to have you here both. Um, you're obviously in Austin. You traveled from Pittsburgh, right? Yes. Awesome. Well, um, this is a topic we get asked a lot about and sometimes when we get asked about topics I already know quite a bit. Um, and this is absolutely an example of the opposite of that. This is a topic we get asked about a lot and I would argue that my knowledge is even below that of the general public. So I I can't think of a time when I've uh done a discussion on the podcast on something where I know less than than all things related to the health of of one's skin and appearance. Um and and so yeah, thank you very much for both being here and thank you for um helping me even think about how to structure a discussion on this topic. Um maybe before we jump into it, just give us each a little bit of your backgrounds.

[00:02:17] Uh I think it was um helpful to have not one but two experts here because you guys have sort of a different specialty. Obviously within medicine you have a different specialty. You overlap in things but but obviously do some things different. So, so Tanish, tell us a little bit about your training, your background, and what you focus on. So, yes, uh, thanks for having us, Peter.

[00:02:37] Uh, it's a pleasure to be here, um, to talk about something I'm quite passionate about, and I know it's very confusing for a lot of listeners to understand aesthetics and and we'd love to demystify it a little bit. Um, so my background, my core specialty is oculoacial plastic surgery. Um, I trained in eye surgery and in facial surgery mostly at UCLA. But do you train in plastic surgery first? My original background is opthalmology.

[00:03:04] Opthalmology. Okay. And then I did fellowships in athalmic plastic surgery and then another fellowship in facial cosmetic surgery in addition to that. Um my practice is limited to eye and face plastic surgery basically and um that ranges from reconstruction of children, cancer, reconstruction for elderly and all the cosmetic surgeries that we can perform on the face including nose, neck including nose and neck. Yes. and um I moved to 16 moved to Austin 16 years ago after training at UCLA and uh joined a large group here and we're also all in the faculty of the Dell Medical School.

[00:03:47] So we are actively involved with uh academics teaching residents. We have a fellowship program, two fellowship programs in our practice. Uh and um it's a real pleasure to be involved in academics because it's the cutting edge of science and you know we'd like to perform clinical research and um in the academic community which is how I know

[00:04:09] Susan. Um we there's a lot of collaboration among specialties and we have an opportunity to dialogue and and further this specialty that we care so much about. Awesome. Okay. And Susan, you are a dermatologist by training. Yes. And then I did a cosmetic surgery fellowship and I am in academic medicine as well. I'm at the University of

[00:04:29] Pittsburgh. I've been there about 24 years. So I got to see the evolution of this entire field starting with what we used to do at the time was uh surgeries and then maybe a few collagen injections and now we have the plethora of all these tools at our disposal. And I train residents, medical students, and I have visiting physicians from all over the world that come in. And I love the multipety collaboration that we have because we both belong to the American

[00:04:59] Academy of Cosmetic Surgery and we hear a different approach from different specialists maybe on the same procedures. In my practice, I focus on everything with regards to skin rejuvenation, peels, lasers. I also do a lot of fat grafting. We do body lipos suction, mini face lifts, eye lifts, but everything when it comes to the face is about really enhancing the appearance of the skin first because my feeling is that's the most important thing that everyone sees. So when a patient comes in like you who has not had anything done or doesn't know about the field, I actually like that because I can take that opportunity to really educate them and pick the right things for them. I appreciate you noticing I've had nothing done. Um, you know, we were talking before the podcast, but it's worth me stating this now again for everybody to hear. There is something about this field of of medicine that I have such a a block in my brain to understanding. And um, you know, uh, Tanuj and I have met before.

[00:06:05] Tenuous helped me with a scar. So Brett Cotless, a friend of mine who's actually been a former guest on the podcast, introduced us. Um I face planted one morning uh due to some hypotension and um sustained a pretty nice scar here that um I think for the most part is largely invisible today. Probably in part because my face is leather to begin with, but I think in part because um we did some 5FU microabbrasion. and we did a whole bunch of stuff and I was actually pretty diligent about staying out of the sun for the period of time after it etc. And um so uh I think we've also done a Botox treatment which you know I it's certainly reduced the wrinkles obviously it's long gone but

[00:06:49] I'd love to talk about that. Um, my wife and her friends are like, it's almost like they've done fellowships themselves, the way they talk about this stuff. And maybe that is just true of women in their 40s, but the way they go on about these techniques, it must sound like that when I talk about cars in front of them, like it's so foreign. So, as I was saying earlier, I have taken a strategy towards my appearance that is uh probably illogical, which is I'm just going to ignore it because I don't understand it and I'm going to focus on things I understand. I would I would view it as an enormous win of this podcast if in a few hours I decided to do something that was sustainable and, you know, going to going to help me look a little better at 62 than I should look. I'm 52 today. I looked at a picture of myself 10 years ago before this podcast.

[00:07:56] What a difference 10 years has made. I I look so much worse today than I did 10 years ago. And I I guess that's not uncommon, right? I would guess 42 to 52 is a big reduction in appearance. But it also made me realize, wow, the next 10 years that reduction will probably be greater if I don't do something proactive. Um, and to just f make one final point about my abject laziness on this topic. I can't even bring myself, this is going to sound so disgusting. I can't even bring myself to wash my face before bed, which my wife is like, "You are so disgusting. Just wash your face."

[00:08:32] But I'm like, "Eh, it's not like I'm that greasy. Who cares?" And she's like, she's always buying products for me. I just can't bring myself to do it. So, you guys have your work cut out for me because if I can be educated on this, I you can change the world. I was about to say that, Tin, we have our work cut out.

[00:08:50] Let's start a little bit with the biology of the aging face. And again, we're going to limit our discussion today to the neck up. Not that there isn't other things that that that are completely relevant around cosmetics, but um but that's just a big enough topic, right? Um I told you that when I looked at myself 10 years ago, I couldn't believe how much better I looked. But I'd have a hard time telling you why. Like I I can't put my finger on it, but I bet you can without me showing you those pictures. Why did I look better at 42 than 52? That's such a great question and that's exactly how my patients come in. A lot of times they'll come in and they'll say, "I feel like I look tired."

[00:09:32] Mhm. I don't know exactly what's going on, but I feel like I look tired. And I have these beautiful diagrams in my office and I show them the face of someone who's 20, the face of someone who's in their late 60s. And I walk them through the changes. And the first thing I do is we show them the diagram with the skin peeled off. And you see about 11 different fat compartments in the youthful face that on each side of the face that are plump, they're robust, they're giving volume and they're giving a padding between the skin and the muscle and the underlying bones. And then you look at someone who's in their late 60s and you peel the skin away and you see a dramatic atrophy in all those fat pads.

[00:10:17] A few might increase in size, but the vast majority undergo atrophy. And then in addition to that, I show them what the bones are doing at that age, too. So, we look at the vault, the bony vault of a 20-year-old and the opening around the eyes are nice and tight. The cheekbones are nice and wide. The jawline has a really good definition.

[00:10:38] And then you look at someone who's in their 60s and all of a sudden the opening around the eyes are wider. Really, the cheekbones are less wide, jawbone is less wide, less height. And so now you've got that scaffolding that's diminished and all the skin looks like it's just hanging and that's what's happening. But it starts early. So what

[00:10:57] I see on most of my patients when they come in and say I look tired and you said it, you look at your pictures 10 years ago and you look now and you don't know what's different. The first change is around the eyes. And I'm sure Ten can add to that. But basically what's happening is you're getting more bone loss around the eyes, more fat atrophy around the eyes. So you're starting to see the underlying anatomy which was padded before. So first of all, this is completely news to me. Is this loss of bone comparable to what we would see in the reduction of bone density in a person's hips as they age? So a lot of it is hormonal. A lot of it is hormonal. And you see it especially in women. if they start to see the aging changes, they they'll start to identify that in their early 40s. So, this in other words is probably another reason why women would benefit from hormone replacement therapy because maintaining estrogen levels would maintain bone health. Absolutely.

[00:11:54] And actually, that's something we need to stress more and more to them because it starts in their probably early 40s. Yep. And then it just accentuates over time. By the time they hit 50, all of a sudden, now if we're looking at them cross-sectionally, a group of 50 year olds compared to guys who are 50, the men are holding up pretty good. Their facial bone structure is good. Their fat volume's good. Their muscle thickness and skin thickness is good. But from 50 to 60 or 70, women will age about 20 years faster than men. In the lower face, especially, they will get so much atrophy in the mandible that they'll start to get that. That's why women start to say, "I hate my neck and I hate the loose skin in my neck." And if the because if the mandibles retracting, the neck becomes looser. Yes. Again, this is remarkable because if you bringing it back to the one thing I know about bone, it's when you look at men and women aging from a skeletal system. They're both going through a comparable decline starting in their 20s because we both peak both men and women peak in the early 20s. And um but at about 50, women fall off a cliff. Uh whereas men just continue a linear decline and and and so the gap really widens. Interesting to realize that the exact same thing is happening in the face. That's exactly it. And that's why women come in, the first things they say when they're 50 is

[00:13:16] I hate my neck. And I think we jump to try to surgically correct it or to augment it with fillers or neuromodulators to keep the muscle from pulling down. But I think we have to have a talk about hormone replacement. You have to catch those women before they're far along into menopause. Again, I'm blown away by that fact. If I could hop in for a second, I I mean, I love the direction of this conversation because um I don't know if people realize how much science there is about the aging process. Uh there were some seminal studies by Rooric and PESA in the '9s and 2000s that kind of delineated a lot of what Susan's talking about where they looked at uh CT scans of similar the same individual over time. I think some of those studies had a 15 to 20 year span and there was quantitative calculations of bone density and bone projection of the mandible, the maxilla, the frontal bone.

[00:14:12] Um, and these bone structures all recede with aging. Uh, and the bone is the foundation for the face. And so when we're talking about youthful fullness of a face, a lot of that is the bone structure. Uh, and then as Susan said, of course, the fat compartments are a critical component of our facial aesthetics. And as we lose all that volume, the reason why people start to look more skeletal as we age, one of the most common areas that I see in my practice is people talking about their underey bags and their, you know, the lines that are showing up in their eyelids and their cheek area. It's because we have ligaments that attach the skin down to the bone. It's called the osteocaneous ligamentous network of the face. And those ligaments are um the same for every single individual no matter what your ethnicity is. Of course, there's variations on theme, but the orbital retaining ligament, the malar ligament, the temporal ligament, the mandibular ligament, the mass ligament, these ligaments are always present. And then as we lose that facial volume from fat atrophy and the bones move backwards, these ligaments are tugging on the skin and these these deep lines start to show up. And that's that's really I would say one of the fundamental changes we see with aging of the face. What I guess I don't understand is the following. Again, I'm just going to use myself as the example because I think I'm probably reflective of many people. 10 years ago, I was less fat than I am today. Same body weight, by the way. I I almost to the pound, I'm the same as I was 10 years ago. Um, but

[00:15:48] I would bet my body fat was 2 or 3% lower. In other words, I have accumulated fat in my body. Why am I losing fat in my face? What is it about facial subcutaneous fat depot that atrophies when for virtually every person the opposite is happening when they age? They're actually adding atapost tissue subcutaneously and unfortunately often viscerally. So if I may answer that one, it's interesting because I talk a lot to my patients about that. Now the vast majority of my patients are female. So, they'll come in and they'll see me and I can look at their face. Let's say they're in their late 30s, early 40s, and I can guess how many kids they've had because what happens is you gain weight in pregnancy.

[00:16:37] It doesn't have to even be a lot, but then most people, if they're fit, they lose that post pregnancy weight. And I've had none, by the way, just in case you were wondering. That's good to know. Um, and then they lose that post pregnancy weight. And what happens is they go back to being the same weight that they were before they got pregnant, but their face is thinner. Second baby, more so by the third baby, it takes a significant toll on the face, that weight gain, weight loss. So you can tell looking at a female face almost how many times they've gone through that weight gain, weight loss. And so what happens, the facial fat pads are very unique metabolically. Like I mentioned, most of the time they're just atrophying as we age. Yeah, there are a couple compartments that might in time get thicker, such as the nasol labial fat compartment, which is why some people will have that deep fold. Yep. But for the most part, they atrophy. And so if you go through this yo-yo change with your weight and you're progressively getting thinner and then gaining some weight back, it doesn't go to the face.

[00:17:37] It goes to parts of the body we don't want. But the face continues to undergo that weight loss or the volume atrophy. But do we know biologically? because it's almost like a lipodistrophe where the fat cell becomes defective and can't reaccumulate uh uh triglyceride or whatever it is whatever form it's going to store it in.

[00:17:56] I I think this is a um the edge of our like so many things in medicine there are things that we know and a lot that we don't know. Yeah. So we know that it's happening. We don't actually know the biochemical mechanism necessarily. Um I think we're just starting to understand the individual um you know receptors and specific nature of different areas of fat. So for example even in the eyelid region when we're doing surgery on the face and we're we're doing surgery on the upper eyelid we will see that the fat pads have different colors. So the medial orbital fat pad is lighter substantially compared to the much yellowower and more orange lateral fat pad. And that color will be different than the buckle fat pad. And one of the differences, there's beta carotene differences in the fat pads. And that's probably just one of maybe a hundred that we'll eventually find out is is contributing to the differences in the fat population. So we know that facial fat is different from abdominal fat, which is different from lower extremity fat. Um, and we know this also practically speaking because when we're doing fat grafting procedures, the source of the fat can have a different long-term effect when it's injected into the face depending on what the source was. And so, um, so we know that fat is not the same throughout the body and it's not the same in the face. Um, there is a general, uh, consensus that betaarotene is an anti-inflammatory mediator. um and higher concentrations and lower concentrations of beta carotene can have some effect on the metabolic health and of of fat especially how it responds to stress.

[00:19:34] And so in the world of longevity there's a lot of discussions about you know man managing cortisol levels like sleep is helpful you know having lifestyles that reduce your overall stress level is good for your overall health in in numerous ways. That's also true for the fat and the skin of the face because uh again a lot of this is not fully explained but we're starting to get more and more details as basic science progresses in this area that these fat compartments and the skin which we can talk more about um is exquisitively sensitive to stress that the body is experiencing cumulatively over time. So you know a lot of times people feel like they're really aging in their 40s. You know, people have midlife crisis. They're their crises. they're probably experiencing the maximum stress in their life at that stage typically and I'm just generalizing here but you know people will have a busy career they've got kids they've got financial worries and so people are under a lot of stress in their 30s and 40s and that contributes to some of the more rapid facial volume loss changes some of the skin aging changes with elasticity collagen elastin changes that occur over time um and so that's where I I think that um you know this conversation really plugs in quite well into the line of um you know education that you're providing your followers in terms of longevity benefits because it overlaps here with cortisol stress and inflammation. And what's interesting is that chronic elevation of cortisol in the body is actually anabolic to fat. Right?

[00:21:17] You accumulate fat. It's catabolic to muscle. muscle decays, uh, fat accumulates. It sounds like you're saying, okay, that's that's true from the neck down, but above the neck, chronic elevation of cortisol might have the opposite effect. It might actually be catabolic to fat and therefore it accentuates the fat loss. Is that am I hearing you correctly in that? Yes, I believe that's correct. And and just yesterday in my clinic, I had a perfect example of this. I had patients backtoback. One was 68-year-old. She's a 68-y old woman who has lived a very comfortable life. She comes from affluence, hasn't really had to work too hard in her life and has maintained things. Of course, she's used skincare products and you know, she's had a little bit of fillers and Botox, but no surgery. And she looked 10 years younger than her stated age because of the kind of life she's been living. And then the next patient I saw was from rural Texas, has been in the sun, has never been taking care of her skin, you know, was working a kind of a bluecollar job, difficult life, couple marriages failed.

[00:22:23] She looked like she was 10 years older and and this is common. I'm sure you see this all the time as well, Susan. So, so lifestyle stress factors clearly have an effect. Um, and one of the reasons why, Peter, perhaps this is not an area that you've kind of delved into in your vast um, experience in medicine is because the quality of science and aesthetics has historically been pretty poor.

[00:22:46] You're you're giving me way too much credit. I wish I could say that was I have delved into plenty of things where the science is poor. There is some other mental block I have. It might be that I'm not smart enough to understand it all, but we'll continue. And I appreciate your and another reason uh why it becomes very murky to sort through the science and I'm sure this exists in other areas of medicine too but a lot of the individuals corporations you know factor forces that are delivering science to the masses and to physicians who are eating it up and and you know regurgitating it to their patients. U these sources are questionable. They're they're profiting.

[00:23:25] You know, as you I'm sure realize, the aesthetic industry is a very very lucrative industry worldwide, especially in the United States. And all the forces that are delivering the science, I'm sorry, not I shouldn't say all the forces, there's a lot of forces where uh those that are delivering the science have a vested interest in receiving monetary benefit from what they're pushing out. And that makes things murky. But I think going back to the fat compartments, think about it with our patients in general, you know, the the role of the fat compartments in the face are to allow muscle glide. So the muscles can move over each other when you smile, talk, eat, chew, all of that.

[00:24:08] And I don't understand why they should undergo such atrophy over time for such an important function. But then we look at the metabolic activity of the fat in other areas of the body and it's very different. So when we do fat grafting for example and we take fat from the abdomen which has the highest concentration of stem cells priiposytes there and put them in the face the fat starts to behave more like the fat from the abdomen when you put it in the face and if they gain weight so it retains its source. Yes. And then when they gain weight you have to tell your patients specifically don't try to gain more than a few pounds because it will hypertrophy like it would in the abdomen if they gained weight. Interesting. Um, is there an evolutionary explanation for any of this? I mean, I I don't know if aesthetics, if you think about this through an evolutionary lens, but I mean, historically, we didn't need to look good beyond our 20s if looking if the purpose of looking good was to attract a mate. So, again, none of us sitting around this table need to look good in Darwinian terms because we're not reproducing. Do you think that factors into any of these observations? 100%. Yes. And so I I think it's also good uh for the sake of um the overall podcast for us to talk about the evolutionary aspects of beauty for just a moment which could be a whole separate podcast. You could invite Nancy Etkov from Harvard to come talk to you about the psychology of beauty. She wrote the definitive book on it um and summarizes all of um evolutionary beauty science. I have all of my fellows read her book because I think it it's just a a beautiful compendium and um evolution the evolution of beauty is a fascinating topic because when you think back to the evolution of humans, you know, why do we even care about beauty? And so the interesting fact is that we're actually genetically hardwired to appreciate beauty. Um, and so there's this famous study from the University of Texas in the 1980s, Judith Langaw, um, is sort of a a well-known name in psychology. She did what's called a preferential looking study of infants. I don't know if you've heard of this study, but it's fascinating. She took newborn infants who were literally weeks old, barely able to see um you know six inches away from their face and she showed them pictures that are considered beautiful, faces that are beautiful and faces that are less beautiful. And these newborn infants who've not yet been influenced by society, preferentially we're looking at the beautiful faces. And so that that natural drive for us to appreciate beauty is present even at birth. Does that suggest that be that there is a definition of beauty that arcs time? Because I was actually going to ask a question which would be a great you know detour for us to take after this point about how much is the definition of beauty changing. In other words, if you took Matthew McConna and transported him back 10,000 years ago, would he still be a hunk? Is sort of where I was going. But continue with this point and let's come back to the evolution. That's a great um that's a great question and I would say that the answer is generally yes. There's two layers here. The first layer is the genetic biologic um drive that we have to appreciate beauty in men and women. Um and then of course there is a societal impact that conditions us to appreciate certain versions of that beauty. But the fundamentals are uh have been studied in the '9s. Um and the fundamentals are that all humans across ethnicities all over the world have been studied and they appreciate certain features of beauty. So there's symmetry of the face, um facial proportion, and then um they also appreciate uh sexual dimmorphisms.

[00:28:11] Those are kind of the three categories. And so, um, symmetry when when a face is symmetric, it sort of conotes if you're out there in the reproductive world looking at the pool of your options, symmetry means that this individual most likely has had good development and nourishment and is most likely going to have good genetics for me to potentially connect with and pass on genetics together with. Um, facial proportion is similar. Um, in fact, um, to to go a little deeper into that, um, averess is really what people are looking for. And that doesn't on the surface that doesn't sound so attractive to be average. But if you take a 100 faces of men, 100 faces of women, and average them all down to a single composite, you will um, average someone who has a little bit of a big nose or a small jaw or some aspect of their their forehead shape. And all that gets averaged down into a composite that is considered universally beautiful across cultures. And again that sort of unconsciously in the mating pool from an evolutionary standpoint is conoting healthy genetics. Um again to be able to pass on your your genetics with. And then the third area which is sexual dimmorphism. We're talking here about strong jaws in men, full lips or big eyes in women. These tend to conote either higher estrogen levels or higher testosterone levels depending on whether you're looking at women or men. And again, that's fertility. That's subconscious communication of fertility.

[00:29:45] So those are the genetic absolutes that exist in all of us on the planet. And then on top of that, as you're um kind of bringing up, you know, social media, you know, in this culture, this particular way of, you know, uh wearing your hair is considered beautiful. Those are conditioned upon us based on society. Um but it overlaps on top of that that underlying genetic basis. And how much can those things override?

[00:30:13] Again, I'll just use examples that we can all appreciate. Like, you know, my my I was talking with my daughter about Cindy Crawford. we were, you know, going and I was like, look, like look at a picture of Cindy today. Look at a picture of Cindy in the mid 1990s. I mean, there's simply no way to describe beauty in any other way. Like you you it doesn't matter what your type is, everybody would acknowledge Cindy is absurdly beautiful. And so you're saying she is hitting it out of the park on those three things independent of what the invogue look of the moment is, right? So if if if it becomes the case that blondes are really attractive, it doesn't matter. Like Cindy will override that. If it becomes the thing that women who weigh 30 pounds are attractive, it doesn't matter. Cindy will override that. Is that kind of what you're saying? I think if you look at even different races and look at a beautiful person in each of those, they actually all have similar measurements. So there are these masks that you can superimpose onto any image and really dissect down every single angle, whether it's the cheek angle, the jawline angle, the shape of the nose, the eyes, and all of you. If you look at that across different races, they all have that same kind of measurement that they hit.

[00:31:29] Talking about those same the symmetry, the upper third, the middle third, lower third, the face, the fifths going across the face, all of that. If you look at a beautiful person, no matter what race they are, they all kind of hit those measurements. Now, then there are nuances like you said, you change your hair, you change your makeup, you can transform yourself, but if you take someone without makeup and just look at them that way, they all kind of conform to those measurements.

[00:31:54] Doesn't this apply imply that over time beauty should be one of the most preserved concentrated traits of our evolution given the presumably the difficulty in acquiring a mate absent beauty? In other words, does it suggest that if you compared what we as a population look like today in 2025 to what we looked like 2,000 years ago, 10,000 years ago, a 100,000 years ago, are we monotonically getting more attractive as a species? Can I jump in on one thing on this? You would think so, right? Because we're selecting the selection should be ramping it up.

[00:32:34] Exactly. So we should be marrying someone that looks better or mating with someone that looks better and having our progyny look better. But what's different is our diet. So take go back a hundred years, 200 years, a thousand years. We had to chew a lot more to really digest our food. We were working our massitors. We were working our jawline. Our pallets were not as high. Our jawline was a lot wider. Our teeth were stronger.

[00:33:02] And then as we have changed our diet and everything is cooked and we don't have to make as much effort to chew it, you actually get more crowding in your of your teeth. Your jawline is a little bit less strong. Your pallet changes. More people become nose brea uh mouth breathers as opposed to nose breathers.

[00:33:20] That changes the shape of your face. And that has been measured anthropologically. And so it's interesting because there's a whole book on breath and they go through the anthropology of all of that and the changes in the skeletons that they've gone back and studied. And so that does fundamentally change. Now we have kids that have to have teeth extracted or we have to have pallet expanders now because we realize when we extracted teeth before we made the faces more narrow. And so now the thinking is let's preserve the teeth, expand the pallet when the child is 10, allow those teeth to come in so there's less grinding uh I'm sorry crowding and then that face will be better and uh stronger jawline. So it is something that we've changed. And then just to kind of head into the area of sociology for just a moment, uh 10,000 years ago, um if you were born in some place on Earth, Peter, your the pool, the genetic pool that you'd be interacting within was tiny.

[00:34:21] You know, there's some um fact that I'm probably going to misstate, but somewhere around 1900, most people on this planet had not moved within 10 miles of where they were born. And now it's totally different. And with social media and the way that we can connect with people around the world, not only because we can fly all around the world, but we're also seeing people on screens, the the the apparent genetic pool of faces that we're looking at has in has exponentially blown up into this very strange world that we're living in in 2025 compared to where our evolutionary biology has taken us.

[00:35:00] And I wonder also at what point in our development did other um I don't want to say higher order but other things became priorities in finding a mate. Like I think for most all of us I think when we were looking for our mate appearance was probably not the top of the list. It was one of the factors. You had to be attracted to the person. But I would guess for all of us it was will this person be a great spouse? Will this person be a great parent? does this person share my goals and values and blah blah blah blah blah. It's hard to imagine our ancestors were were had the luxury of maybe thinking about those things. So, so yeah, all of this is to say it's way more complex today. Um, but it is it is just as to hear you guys describe this, it's entirely fascinating to play the thought experiment of transport a hyperattractive person today back in time 10,000 years. And I would just be so curious as to how they would react to that individual. I think it's a fascinating thought experiment and I think that if they meet those criteria that we're we're defining, they would be considered a hunk or a beauty. Yeah. And then one last thing and then we can certainly move on to the next topic, but um in terms of timing, it is important for us to be evolutionarily attractive historically, not in the modern era until you're about 20 or 25. because we weren't supposed to live this long. One of the um issues that comes up with longevity and and trying to maximize our health span is that we were not really supposed to be living this long and healthy this long.

[00:36:38] And so evolutionarily, you know, mother nature is not helping us with our appearance. Our appearance was supposed to carry us through until about 20 or 25 at which point, you know, your kids are old. you know, most people were procreating at 14 and then at 25 their kids were at the point where they were getting ready to procreate and then, you know, you're led off to let le let le let le let le let le let le let le let le let le let le let led out to pasture at that point basically. So, so evolutionarily what we do every day um with our patients is we're really fighting biology. We're fighting genetics. We're fighting the unnatural existence that we have as a luxury of being born in this era.

[00:37:20] How much do you see even even just speak about it through the length of your actual careers? How much do you see trends that dramatically change what people are asking for? In other words, Susan, you 25 years ago, did men or women come into your practice significantly looking for something different in terms of an appearance and an outcome that they wanted you to shape? Yeah, I would say that's such a loaded question because 25 years ago, if we think back, there was no social media. Yep. Um, television was, you know, very basic. Um, they talked maybe there was some shows that had live people on there on different shows where they would talk about beauty or fashion, but you had to actually tune in and watch those shows to be able to see the trends. Magazines came out and that was the extent of it. Now you have social media and various channels on social media and then you have what we now know as influencers and they're changing what our patients are seeing and what's driving them. And the biggest one that I can talk about is basically that very well-known family in California that has monetized their appearance and set a lot of trends for better or for worse. It's great to see that they're making it okay to talk about enhancing your appearance or fixing something that bothers you.

[00:38:46] But where I draw the line is when they start putting out their transformations. And this trend now is something that everyone wants to emulate. And you're talking about young women changing physically changing their body drastically to conform to what you said is a trend which is exactly it. And trends as the word says are not permanent. So what happens when that trend ends? The celebrities have the money to go to the doctors and reverse all that. Now, it will take surgery and they will have scars to show for it or hide for from that. But the patients that follow them, these young women don't have all of that income to go back and then retransform their body and they don't know the implications of that. So,

[00:39:30] I think it's we have a duty as doctors definitely to try to educate our patients about not following trends so strongly and look beyond the monetary aspect of it. And so from that standpoint, I try to really educate my patients to stay away from things that are trending and really do things that make them look and feel better but natural for themselves because um I I don't know in your practice, but I know people want to come in for the enhanced buttocks, the

[00:39:58] Brazilian buttlfts and the small waists and you know that's something again that's being undone by that family now and you're going to see a whole trend that's coming out that doesn't look like that. So what are what are kind of the top above the neck trends? So so what what I see as I look around is I see lip size being something that's getting bigger, smaller, bigger, smaller. Where are we today by the way in lip size? So, just to um continue Susan's lines line of thought there, um we're in this again unusual era where the influencers that are affecting society are much more in our faces than they have been historically and they're affecting young people at a much younger age, which is why we just let my 16-year-old daughter have a social media account. Um, and that influence of these influencers is is quite powerful because what happens is on social media, which is the primary exposure that people are receiving these days about beauty, um the the the images that are being posted are not real.

[00:41:02] They're filtered. They're um unrealistic uh exaggerations of some of those three original factors that we're talking about, the symmetry, proportion. People will photograph themselves in such a way where they look they look more proportionate. They will uh you know they'll pull their jaw certain way to make their proportions look uh look better. Someone has to teach me how to do this because anytime I see a video of myself you know I'm like that is the worst looking thing I've ever seen. Like

[00:41:31] I need to learn these tricks. You need a 20-year-old. And a lot of this is subconscious posing. That's a term that I have, you know, have used for this concept where people are subconsciously posing like for example, if you like a lot of people when they walk past a shiny building will stop and look at themselves and kind of like adjust themselves a little bit. And by the way, is that new or is that something we would have all like in other words, did our ancestors walk by a stream where the water was still and look at themselves? Do we I mean not that we can know that but possibly I think so but I think the the it's becoming so much more exaggerated now um to the point where we can you know confidently state that social media influencers are selling exaggerated forms of beauty ideals like the sexual dimmorphism. So we talked earlier about like larger lips or bigger eyes. Um, one of the most popular procedures in uh,

[00:42:26] Northeast Asia is surgeries to make the eyes wider. You actually cut into the canthus and perform tossis surgery to make the eye look bigger. And then of course this trend to have bigger lips. Um, you know, fillers are being used left and right unfortunately to overdo lip volume and plump up lips. And because the social media influencers are are posting it, it's becoming more exaggerated because these exaggerated gender traits are becoming normalized.

[00:42:55] And so again, the family that Susan's mentioning in in California, they normalized over overdone lips to the point where people come in asking for it and we have to say, "No, I'm sorry. This is not a good direction for us to take you in." So, what where do you sorry to interrupt teners, but where do you put because clearly both of you seem to be more on the um well, let me take a step back. I was talking to somebody yesterday where I said one of the marks of a great surgeon is a person who is happy to say no. Is happy to say I'm not going to do this because I'm so good that I don't need your business. Like, I can be as selective as I want about what

[00:43:33] I do. Um that allows two things. that allows the right patient selection to get a good outcome. So the the discussion I had with a patient yesterday was about was about orthopedic surgery issue and you know the the the the doctor said yeah I think it's time to do the surgery and he was the patient was saying to me well he does sort of have a vested interest in doing the surgery after all he's a surgeon. I said yes but I can speak about this surgeon in particular. I've watched him say no to a hundred patients because patient selection is the most important thing for him to drive amazing outcomes. and he'll say no until it's time. In in in in the cosmetic world, you add another layer to that decision. And clearly, you guys are both on the spectrum of you both you're both, you know, you're both the top of your field, so you don't need an incremental patient. You're happy to say no. There's also, it sounds like an ethical reason for you to say no. My where I'm going with my rambling question is where do you think the field is on the whole? Are you guys the outliers or are you guys the majority? Is there is there a handful of bad actors out there that will take any money from any 17-year-old who's, you know, being duped into thinking this is the way they need to look? Um, I'm trying to get a sense of the scale of this problem. I would say the vast majority of physicians are ethical. Um, I do think there are some out there though where it is something that's monetized. So they will mask treat patients. You know their goal is to have surgery after surgery coming in and basically letting the patients make their own informed decision about it to an extent. But I always look at it akin to managing hypertension or diabetes. We never let the patients determine how much insulin to use or how much anti-hypertensive medication to take.

[00:45:25] And I don't think we should let the patients say that they want to transform themselves to some completely different person. I just ethically think that's wrong. I think that brings to mind a whole bunch of other psychological issues that might be playing there, including what we call social media dysmorphism where people h come in with pictures of themselves with a filter and say, "Can you make me look like this picture?"

[00:45:51] And so there's, by the way, is that a recognized diagnosis in the DSM5 now? Oh, in the DSM5, I don't know if it's made it that far, but it is something that is mentioned at different meetings now. So I don't know that it's made it into the DSM5. If not, it probably be on the six, right? Um, if I could chime in, I I think that, you know, Susan's obviously a very ethical, you know, outstanding surgeon and physician, but I I do have to say I'm an optimist. I have to say that I think the situation is worse than what you're saying. I think that there are unfortunately financial incentives for physicians, nurses, and the the broad spectrum of people that perform aesthetic treatments including, you know, Botox and filler injections. It's very poorly regulated. There are tons of people out there ranging from hairdressers all the way up to surgeons who will be happy to take your money and find a place to put the syringe of filler because they know it's going to be money revenue into into their practice. And so I I don't want to be overly negative, but I think this is sort of a cautionary warning to people who are listening to this podcast that when you're delving in the area of aesthetic enhancement, you have to understand that there's an overlay where the person that you're seeking out advice from has a substantial financial incentive to treat you. And it's I think it's a real issue. I do. Yeah. It's I'll

[00:47:21] I'll tell you one of the things I always caution patients towards in my world is you need to be really careful when you're seeing a quote unquote longevity doc who is selling tests and selling treatments for the results of that test. Right? When you go to see somebody and they're selling a biologic clock whose treatment is this supplement and they're monetizing those two things, I just don't see how you can trust that individual. I don't see how even a person with good intentions can't be can't get conflicted there. And I guess

[00:47:59] I never thought of it until you said that, but the entire aesthetic industry is effectively that because you're not just selling a procedure, you're often selling a treatment like a you're you're you're getting paid on both ends. Well, and what's happened is like Tenu was saying, the the providers have changed.

[00:48:18] So before it used to be only dermatologists that would do the injectables and then it became dermatologists and plastic surgeons and then it became the RNs and the physician assistants and those are still all medical providers including dentists who are very well trained can do that but then you get in certain states lack of regulation. So you're seeing unqualified people who are not medical providers doing injectables and laser treatments that they may not be trained for. And all of a sudden you start to open up a whole Pandora's box of complications there. And this is a shame because patients might not know enough to ask about qualifications. They might see that it's a nice storefront, the person's wearing a lab coat, they look professional. So from that standpoint, they might go in trusting that this person has their best interest. There might not be a physician overseeing everything. We feel very strongly in our practices that there is a physician overseeing every treatment. Whether we're doing it, our nurses, or our PAs are doing it, we're overseeing all of that to make sure that if there's a complication, that complication is ours.

[00:49:24] No matter what, we're going to take care of that patient. So it is a shame. And I do warn a lot of young residents coming into the field to enter the fields if they truly love the field and are passionate about dermatology, opthalmology, ocular plastics, all of that. Because if they're going into it thinking they're going to be the next glamorous doctor on social media, then they're not going to have a lot of treatments that they can offer because at that point all these other providers are doing those treatments. they're going to have to find a niche for them for themselves to make a name for themselves doing something differently.

[00:50:01] So, it it's really fascinating right now the times that we're living in. And do you see a change in residents today? So when I was in medical school, which is almost 30 years ago now, the people and maybe it's just it's such a small sample that it's an irrelevant statement, but but when I think back to everybody I knew that ultimately chose plastic surgery, they all had a very artistic bent to them, right? Like they I'm not going to say that they didn't pick it because it was also a lucrative field and things like that. Maybe if plastic surgeons made 50,000 a year, they wouldn't have done it. But I never got the sense that that was their primary motivation. When I think back to my friends in medical school that went into plastics, they were artists. They really took an interest in the art of this. Do you still see incoming residents largely of that philosophy where they're interested in the aesthetic component of it, the the underlying physiology of it?

[00:50:57] In other words, are they cut from the cloth you guys are cut from, or do you see a trend towards no, this is literally a cash machine? And um this you know it's one of again as as reimbursements are going lower and lower and lower across the entire field of medicine um it is clearly more attractive to be in specialties um where where reimbursements either remain very high and or there's a it's mostly cash.

[00:51:23] Well I'll take a more optimistic tone here. I think that um th those who are coming into residency and fellowships in the world of aesthetics I think really still have that same artistic mindset. People, you know, were painters or musicians. They have that artistic mind and it's something we actually look for in our fellowship when we're considering candidates because we know that they have that rightrain mentality of being able to handle medical problems. But the the the reality is that as you said, medical reimbursements are going down.

[00:51:57] The lucrative nature of aesthetics is high and getting higher as time goes by. And so someone can go through all the training and then when they see the dollars come in the door, they're just going to want more of that. And it can it can distort their ethics and they may not even realize they're doing it. I'm not saying that there are physicians out there who are knowingly duping patients into having treatments, but I think it just becomes this unconscious drive because of the finances. We were talking about that earlier and I do think it's a challenge because here we go again.

[00:52:27] Medicare just got cut again in terms of reimbursements. And that's sad because we're talking about in our university practices, there's a huge push for doctors to see more patients because reimbursement is dropping and so the only way that the medical centers can compensate is to increase the volume.

[00:52:46] There's only so many patients though in a day that we can see and offer really good care. So, Tanj and I have a very unique practice because most of our patients are self-pay. So, we have the luxury of time. We can talk to our patients, get to know them to the point that a lot of our patients come to us seeking medical advice and opinions on other advice that they've gotten from other physicians and we can help them decipher the facts. Whereas their other physicians may be fabulous, but they have to see 30, 40 people in a day. And that's a shame. That's do that's the detriment now that the physicians market is in because we're burning out a lot of really good physicians who want to give good care but find themselves having to see more and more patients so they can only spend 10 minutes a patient and that's really unfair and that's not why all of us go into medicine and for both of us we entered our fields before all of these devices and treatments existed.

[00:53:42] I think we did come into it with a passion for what we love, but we both have an artistic bend to ours to our personalities as well. So, we kind of gravitated towards this. I want to put a bow on the social media thing for a moment. Um, what is the most concerning trend or what is the most concerning request you are getting from people that you believe is sort of unique to to the social media phenomenon? What I'm seeing a lot more are teenagers now coming in asking for fillers and neurom modulators in their li in their forehead, fillers in their lips. And that's sad because but why would I mean would a neurom modulator do anything in when you're at that age anyway? No. But they're now being told that even 18, for example, it's okay to start preventative Botox.

[00:54:29] You don't need that until you're a lot further along in age. So that's just an abject lie that they're being told. Yes. And unfortunately, they're also being made to feel very poorly about their shape of their lips. They're being inundated with images. And like Tanish was saying, these are highly filtered images. We know a lot of people who will take in their waist, take in their thighs, all of that. Change the proportions and then post that image.

[00:54:54] And and what I try to tell patients is that what you see in terms of images that are on social media a are filtered, b are taken um with certain angles of the camera to enhance someone's appearance. And we will never, at least in my practice, take someone's photo that they took on their phone and then try to enhance them to look like their photo because what's happening is that you're going to make them look very different in life in real life. So how you photograph, you're only going to photograph beautifully if you're the most symmetric person. And that's why even the most beautiful model on in a photograph, if you look at them in person, they're very pretty, but you wouldn't think that they're super models sometimes, but when they photograph, they photograph beautifully because of their symmetry. But for us, with our forward- facing cameras um that we point at ourselves to take uh our selfies, they're going to distort our face. If you tilt one way, you elongate the face.

[00:55:51] So the different way you shorten the face and patients get hung up on that and that's really sad because in real life they look fabulous. Now is this a 955 female male problem that is is arising from social media or are there other are and is the ma I I I guess from the purpose of this discussion I would guess it's mostly female. My guess is the male issue is probably much more on anabolic steroid abuse and things that that young men are being influenced by.

[00:56:18] Is that safe to assume? So, so what is it that you see to news that is most disconcerting? Is there a particular product or particular procedure that is that is showing up that is would have been unheard of before social media? I would say two areas. One is because fillers are non-surgical, relatively accessible price points and um low risk and are ubiquitous. You can find a clinic within one mile if you live in a major city. I think overfilling is a serious problem. Um whether it's the lips or the cheeks over over volumization has become an epidemic and and it's it's a serious problem not only because it looks exaggerated and distorted and strange but even when as a facial surgeon I go in to perform surgeries I will find that filler has disrupted normal anatomy. And so decades later, the companies will tell you that filler only lasts one year in the face and you have to refill it. That's definitely not true really. We see I have patients coming in who don't mention that they've had fillers in the past, but then in surgery I will see filler in their cheek or in their face because they had it eight or 10 years ago and it's still there and it's stretching the ligaments. It's changing the structure of the tissues. It actually makes routine surgical procedures later more challenging. So that's one that's one area. And by the way, are there biologic features of the individual that would make that more or less true? Are there some people in whom fillers go away after a year or are you saying that for the most part they last long? That's also another whole complex topic is the metabolism of hyaluronic acid and some people are higher metabolizers, some are slower metabolizers and we actually don't have a good sense of that. We have some general concepts just based on experience but there's very little science on that. We can't really predict who. So, one doesn't know. One really doesn't know. Okay. And I'm sorry, you were going to get to a second point.

[00:58:14] Yeah. No. Uh, the second point is from a surgical standpoint. There is a trend right now where people are asking for this high arched brow effect where it's hyperexaggerated. The tail of the brow comes up very high. It's called a snatched look. About once every week or two, I've got someone who seriously wants to have their face distorted with a surgical procedure with me, and I have to say, "I'm sorry. We're not going to do that." Is it safe to say that anyone who walks into a physician's office to do this needs to be able to be over 18 to provide consent?

[00:58:49] But is it safe to say or is it is it is it the case that people younger than 18 can do this in less reputable uh places without parent consent? Do we know this? It should be 18. It's like any other medical procedure. You have to be 18 years of age to consent. There are rare instances where where I will treat someone who's 16 or 17. If the parent is there and if it's for something, for example, a patient has a hump on their nose that they don't like, but they're not ready to commit to a rhinoplasty.

[00:59:24] Yep. So, I can use fillers in a creative way to help reduce the appearance of that. But that's very The point is the parent is there. Yes. Absolutely. I did have a very interesting incidence where I had an 18-year-old though come in and she had just had a rhinoplasty and was coming to see me for fillers and for neurom modulators and I asked her I said you're 18 um is someone here with you from one of your parents and nobody was there with her and the interesting thing is though um she is 18 thinking that she's an adult but she's only a junior in high school so I was very conflicted. I I kept referring back to the something along the lines of you need to talk to your parents. You need to tell them what we discussed here. That really bothered me for a long time that here is this 18-year-old who's still in high school that wants to do things and I don't see a parent there with her. But I think I think it's not a huge problem probably across the board that people under 18 are getting treatments, but they're getting fed all of this societal pressure. Um, I like to use the term beauty pressure. They're getting all like like peer pressure. It's beauty pressure that's now more extreme because of social media. They're getting all this beauty pressure at a very young age, 12, 13 onwards. And so by the time they get into their 20s, they've been thinking about this for years and years and years and they're ready to dive into it. Now there's probably not a lot of people in my audience that are, you know, particularly young, but maybe we can start the discussion um through the lens of preventive care, right? So we can talk about preventive care and then move into sort of, you know, maybe where

[01:01:10] I am now where I missed the boat on pure prevention and I now need to start being active. So for the person who's listening to this who's um you know still in their prime uh from a from a from an aesthetic perspective so I guess they're in their 20s right we would say uh maybe even in their 30s depending on their genes um the only thing I know is wearing sunscreen is a net positive right so it clear I understand enough to say that UV damages skin um is it damaging elastin is it dam damaging collagen or is it purely just these sunspots that it creates? What is it that sun is doing that is damaging?

[01:01:50] Quite a bit. Okay. So, um I'm glad you mentioned sunscreen because if anyone's going to come in and say, "What's the absolute minimum thing I should use on my skin every day?" It would be sunscreen. And in fact, there was a 4-year study out of Australia that followed people for 4 years. And either they wore sunscreen or they didn't. And the ones that did aged better. Was it randomized? It was randomized. Okay, good. So it aged better. They age better. Fewer lines, fewer wrinkles. And that's in a country that has a lot of sun. So that shows you the power of using sunscreen. Now I'll take it a step further. I tell my patients they have to use mineral sunscreens as opposed to chemical sunscreens because I'm not convinced of the safety of aobenzone, oxyenzone as hormone disruptors.

[01:02:36] I do think there are some science scientific studies that suggest maybe they play a role in infertility. You can measure them in the bloodstream, especially if you're putting them over the entire body. The body, the skin is a great portal for chemicals to enter into the bloodstream if it's the right size chemical. So, there have been already studies done that show a huge spike in the amount of these in your bloodstream after application. After saying this for 15 years, I think the FDA just a couple weeks ago finally told the companies they must do animal safety studies. It's about time. It's very late. Yeah. So late in the game. It's very late because and also the I'm sorry to interrupt, but just I'm I'm so on board with you about the problems with chemical sunscreens because the other problem it creates is that patients think they're covered and then the chemicals that are actually protecting against the UV damage become inactivated over time and you don't know because you still have the film on you.

[01:03:32] You have the film on you and you don't know at what time of day you no longer have any solar protection. It's within an hour. It's within an hour. You put a sunscreen SPF 70 on, go outside and it's going to be if it's strong sun. Yeah. It's going to be deactivated within an hour. People will burn on SPF 70, SPF 100. There should be nothing above SPF 50 mineral because you can't get it into a formula. What is the use case for the chemical sunscreen? Are they less expensive? Like what are they water?

[01:04:01] Like what was the rationale for them? They blend in. They blend in very easily. So the people love it because there's no white film when they put it on. A mineral sunscreen takes a little bit more work to blend it in or it's going to cost more because you're going to have to get a micronized or micronized formula of zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. So my Elta MD 30 to 50

[01:04:23] I think I have one of each. I'm pretty sure that's a mineral sunscreen. It's you have to work to put it in, right? Is that that's Yes. And some of them um Ela makes some mineral and some uh chemical ones. So just double check. Got it. Okay. And they make it confusing on purpose by the way. So you have to go out of your way to actually find formulas that are primarily mineral because the companies want to sell you both products and they know that customer satisfaction is higher with chemical. Higher with chemical. And you know this doesn't have to anything to do this this conversation specifically but

[01:04:58] Susan has created skincare and so have I created skincare. So we've we've really dived into this world of skincare and the marketing of skincare um can really mislead consumers and uh companies that are creating skincare are motivated by sales. They want people to be happy with their SPF. when it's a chemical sunscreen, they're going to be happier with it because it doesn't have that white pasty effect, but it's just not as effective. Got it? And the other thing that happens, if you look at the amount of skin cancer in the US, it's increasing, including melanoma. So why do we have generations now of people from the late 90s on up who say they use sunscreen all the time, and our skin cancer rates are going up? I think it's twofold. I think it's because a like you said Touch, the sunscreens degrade very quickly when they put on a chemical sunscreen. And I'm going to take it one step further. When those chemical sunscreens absorb those harmful rays, whether it's UVB or UVA, the cells uh well, the chemicals absorb them and they neutralize those rays, but they cause reactive oxygen species. And those reactive oxygen species damage the DNA of the cells, which then accentuates the damage that you're getting from whatever other UVA gets through the sunscreen.

[01:06:17] So, you're really causing more damage and probably causing these cells to become more atyp atypical over time. By the way, you know that there's a there's a group of people who argue that, and I don't agree with this at all, that that argue that sun and UV rays have no causal role in melanoma. And the the argument they put forth is sunscreen use has been increasing and yet we see a significant increase in the incidence of melanoma. So they're pointing at the same observation. They're offering a different argument. I find your argument far more compelling. Yeah. I think everyone should be using a mineral sunscreen. So that's number one. I think that's Let's talk again just about the why. So what is it that ultraviolet energy is doing to my skin that is dilitterious? So I'm going to throw out more than ultraviolet. So, we know there's UVA. Yep. And UVA is the longer wavelength between the two ultraviolet rays that reach the Earth. That's A for aging. We have UVB and that's B for burns. That's the one that causes a lot of the redness and the sunburns and leaves behind a lot of the atypia in the cells. So, UVB probably causes more skin cancers than UVA, but they're both implicated. But add to it, we have high energy visible light, we have visible light, we have infrared light, all coming from the sun. So we have five different rays and they all play a role in how we age. So we worry about UVA,

[01:07:43] UVB with regards to skin cancer. But high energy visible light and visible light also play a role in terms of hyperpigmentation, infrared as well. And now there's some evidence maybe suggesting that because infrared light can reach deeper into the skin, it may have a role on fat atrophy and bone remodeling.

[01:08:06] Interesting. So, I'd like to see more studies along that. I don't know how you could possibly do that in an ethical way, but that's really going to be you could do it in animals. I mean, you could you could do animal studies, assuming you you you had a comparable model for um for for fat and bone. um because then that's the only way you'd have to use the isolated spectrum, right? You couldn't do it in sunlight because then you can't uh I assume you wouldn't be able to disentangle which uh energy wave was was causing the effect.

[01:08:35] Uh but that's an interesting thought. Um the yeah I think most of us think that I mean most of us I I've always thought well the sunspots are unattractive but uh you know my pigments dark enough that they don't really show up that much and um so okay so we know what sun is doing. I'm sorry to interrupt Peter, but one more addition to talk about with the UV damage because we could probably spend the whole podcast on UV injuries, but you know, in addition to everything that

[01:09:07] Susan said, a couple more things that I think are important to hear are for the listeners is that UV also not only do you know that it damages DNA and can lead to tumors, cancers, melanoma, u but it also um injures collagen particles, elastin particles, a lot of the ultra structure of not only the cell, the cells have intracellular infrastructure but also extracellular infrastructure. So the matrix of the subcutaneous tissues, the dermis is built by this beautiful scaffolding. If you look at an 18-year-old skin under the microscope, it's this thick, beautiful blanket layer of of of volume because you've got this collagen elastin structure that's holding this whole thing up and it's filled with water molecules that are have lots of space to move around in and signals going back and forth. So all of that collagen elastin framework also gets heavily injured by UV over time and it becomes cumulative and that leads to you know thinning of the skin loss of the subcutaneous fat layer loss of those in intracellular connections so that people start to get pitting and fine lines and wrinkles and so that's just from an aesthetic standpoint just another area just to know from from UV damage. So, so, so I'm sure you've heard this before, but so all of my black friends now are looking infinitely like on a relative basis, their aging is slowing down. And so they always say black don't crack. And so how much of the difference that we see in black skin versus white skin is due to less damage from UV versus other genetic differences that enhance what you're describing.

[01:10:50] It's almost completely what you're saying is the protection value of the increased melanin particles that uh people with darker skin have. There's a Fitzpatrick scale from 1 to six where we talk about the Fitzpatrick one is someone who's extremely fair, blonde, blue-eyed, burns all the time, never tans, and then it goes all the way to

[01:11:09] Fispatrick 6, which is dark, the darkest skin that you'll see, never tans, can't burn. And we're all somewhere in that spectrum. So I'm a three three plus probably. Yeah, maybe version. And so basically the is there basically a linear relationship between one and six in terms of how well you will age skin-wise? I think generally yeah that's about right. Um and and the melanin factor is huge. Um I mean just um you know just to counter that argument earlier about people who talk about trying to sunscreens um and and so the the melanin evolutionarily if you actually look at what's happening when melanin is inside the cell it's not just randomly dispersed. It's actually the melanin forms a parasol over the nucleus to protect the DNA to protect the DNA.

[01:11:59] So evolution has is showing us microscopically why it's so important to protect ourselves from the UV because we get this parasol of melanin that sits on top of the nucleus to protect it. And when we are exposed when we're Fitzpatrick 2 to six or 2 to 5 and you're exposed to sunlight we get immediate upregulation of melanin production by the tyrrosen kinus pathway and all of that melanin you know doubles and triples. So that's why we're tanning. That's why we're tanning. Tan is not an aesthetic. It happens to be aesthetic. But the reason we tan is to create more melanin to protect our DNA. Yes. And it's only aesthetic in this day and age because it used to be if you were tan, you worked in the fields. So it was not a sign of prosperity and affluence. So it is only aesthetic in our current day and age.

[01:12:51] But yes, melanin is our own antioxidant. It's a very good antioxidant and that's how it works. Mhm. Okay. To your point, we could spend the rest of the podcast on it. We won't. We've established the fact that step one, the no regret move, protect your skin in the sun. Um, what's the next level thing that one can do for prevention? So, we may be on the same line. We might be a little bit different. I would say step two would be a retinoid of some sort. And it could be in your I was worried you were going to say that. I know. Everyone says that's just one more thing I have to apply.

[01:13:27] Well, here's what I tell patients. Cuz you said you don't wash your face at night, right? I know. Don't. It's so gross. Do you brush your teeth at night? I do. I'm a religious flosser and teeth brusher. Right next to your toothbrush, put your little tube of retinoid. That's what I tell my patients. So, retino retinoids, we have different categories. There's retinol which is the weakest one and your body will go put it through two enzyatic changes to become retinoic acid which is what you get at the pharmacy and that's great if you're in your 20s late teens early 20s and you're just trying to be preventative with how your skin is aging and at the same time maybe addressing some acne.

[01:14:07] Okay, once you hit late 20s into your 30s and early 40s, you need maybe something a little stronger and that's where retinaldahhide is a little bit better and that's the next conversion. So retinol becomes retinaldahhide which then becomes retinoic acid. So retinaldahhide is that middle step and there's more actual enzyme in your body that can convert retinaldahhide to retinoic acid and that's less irritating for p people to use. So in your case, if you get irritated very easily and you're going to quit, it gives us an option to give patients something that's highly efficacious, that is going to irritate their skin less because it gets converted to the active form after it's been absorbed into the skin. And then the gold standard is retinoic acid and that has multiple different strains, but that's someone who's in their mid40s and up. They're going to need it continuously to keep boosting collagen because our peak collagen production, you want to venture a guess as to what age we peaked in our collagen production? Uh, I would say late teens, early 20s. Yeah, 18. Yeah, that was the when our fibroblasts were making the most of the matrix that to I guess that because that's when in in women bone density peaks in at about 18 for men it's about 20 21. Yes, exactly. So 18 we start to make less collagen, elastin and glycosaminoglycan. So if we can add a retinoid in there, we're telling the fibroblast to boost more of those production of those ingredients, those peptides and those collagen matrix. If we are looking at the melanocytes, those retinoids also normalize the function of melanocytes so that they're less aggregated, less overactive and they also help to normalize the turnover of the keratinocytes. So they're working out the major cellular structure of the skin at the level of the DNA. Now my recollection is there were two concentrations of this stuff that you could get. Does that ring a bell of the prescription? Yes. There's three 0025.05.1 and then there's like 0.04.08.

[01:16:11] Those first three are the major ones. And also custom formulations. Y and the few times I tried to use this like I couldn't do it every day. It just got me too red. Did that mean I was on too high a formulation? I should have gone back to the aldahhide. I was too young. I probably tried this 10 years ago and never did it again. So, I have a I take a different approach than even most of my colleagues. I tell people if they're trying to achieve a goal, whether it's treating me malasma, sun damage, or they're getting ready for a child's wedding or we have to do a procedure,

[01:16:45] I would tell them to tough it out because if you use that retininoic acid every single day, your body acclimates to it very quickly. It may take 6 weeks, 7 weeks, 8 weeks, but you get your skin used to it and then you reap all the benefits. But some patients are always going to quit. So from that standpoint, then I'm a quitter. Yeah. So we would give you 5 days a week retinaldahhide, two days a week retinoic acid and tell you to start that way and then maybe as your skin acclimates to it you can change that proportion. Okay. And by the way do you become more light sensitive when you take this? Do you does it make you does it make it even more important that you're wearing sunscreen in the sun? So those studies came out very early on which is why people start to say oh I stop my retinoid in the summer and that's the last thing you should do because initially when you start a retinoid you will get exfoliation at the level of the dead layer of the skin the start corneium but after you've been on the retinoid for a long time that builds back up. So you you become less light sensitive. You might always still be a little bit but you're a lot less light sensitive than when you first start a retinoid. But you should always have a sunscreen on and a hat. And retinoids have been shown that even if you get sun exposure, they have the ability to repair some of that DNA damage early on.

[01:18:04] So you really want to be on a retinoid all the time. Okay. Um, anything you would add to that, Tenuj on the retinoid before we go on? No, I think that was great. I I I totally agree with everything Susan just said. I I have a slightly different protocol with retinoids and people who are sensitive, I might have them um start out two or three times a week and then gradually build up to kind of nightly use over a couple of months. That's one way to avoid the inflammatory aspect of retina.

[01:18:30] And then the other option would be to mix it with some over- the-counter hydrocortisone 1% cream. I know people get really worked up about putting steroids on their face, but over-the-c counter hydrocortisone 1% is so such a low concentration that it's just enough to reduce some of that annoying irritation from the retina in that first few weeks or months. But I was going to also add um you know when people are thinking about the core aspects of what should they be using on their skin now that they're starting to notice some changes in their 20s or 30s um in addition to sunscreen and retinoids. Um

[01:19:07] I think that vitamin C is a really important molecule to get onto the skin. Also tried that too. Let me tell you why I stopped. It was mixed with like feric acid. Feric acid. Yes. Yes. and it stunk. I just hated the smell of it. And the reason for that is because vitamin C is a notoriously complicated, easily reduced molecule. And when manufacturers are formulating their vitamin C serums, it it'll it might be a year from when it leaves the factory and gets onto your skin, if we're lucky. Um, and in that year, all of the relatively inexpensive vitamin C serums are going to degrade and not actually have any bioavailability when that vitamin C is applied to the skin. And so, the relatively more expensive formulations are being produced by manufacturers that are doing all sorts of manufacturing flips and tricks to try and stabilize that vitamin C. the the product you're talking about which I I I think I can probably guess um is uh that they use the furic acid to stabilize the vitamin

[01:20:16] C so that it maintains it bioavailability. Other formulations of vitamin C will use um you know an oil-based formula. It's not aquous because then the vitamin C is much less likely to be reduced in that kind of formulation. But those products tend to be petroleum oilbased and also have all sorts of negatives associated with it.

[01:20:37] And then there are some products that will microenccapsulate or find other creative ways of making sure that the vitamin C is actually bioavailable when it hits your skin. So that product may have not worked for you, but there are other options to find a stable vitamin C. And and this is one of those products where, you know, again, we have our own, you know, custom formulas, but I'll tell people who are price sensitive, go to

[01:21:02] Walgreens, buy a retinoid, buy a sunscreen. You don't need to spend more than $10 or $15 on effective products. Um, you know, but vitamin C is something where you have to spend the money on it. And by the way, what retinoid can you buy at Walmart? Retinol and some retinol. They have I see. But you can't get retinoic acid without a prescription. Right. Got it. And is there any downside of using retinol or do you just need a lot more of it to make sure you get The problem is if you try to push that enzyatic chain reaction, you'll get a der dermatitis.

[01:21:33] Got it. Okay. So, in other words, if you can afford it, it's better to get the prescription. And I'm guessing retinoic acid is not expensive. I finally it's come back down in price. I think now that they realize more and more people are willing to spend out of out of pocket to buy it. It's about $80 to $100 for a tube. That tube will last about three months. Okay. If it's lasting longer, you're not putting enough. And just show me as though I'm doing this like we're going to talk about how to wash the face and do all that cuz I'm guessing you don't do this without washing your face, especially if you've had sunscreen on all day. Um, are you putting this on like all over your face like this? Even over my beard and stuff.

[01:22:10] So I tell people first things first, you have to put the right amount on. Okay. Right. Because every time we give anyone any prescription, we tell them take this many milligrams once a day, twice a day. We don't do a good job. Yeah. Right. Of telling people how much sunscreen to put on, how much retinoid to put on. So I always tell them hold up your finger and it should be from the tip of your index finger to your DIP joint. Oh my god. And that's how a fingertip unit. And if you can do a fingertip unit of retinoid every night, that's a great way to measure that you're getting enough on.

[01:22:40] And I can see your face. You can see I'm getting a tropponin leak right now just thinking about applying that much stuff. Yeah. And I have them put put it on their face including the under eye area because that's the thinnest skin and that's the skin that's going to wrinkle and age first. So most people are afraid to go around their eyes and um I would tell them just don't get it in your eyes. Go go go around but make sure you're getting that under eye area. once a week maybe on the upper eyelid and then once or twice a week on the neck because again this is the thinnest skin.

[01:23:10] We've got to keep that skin building collagen and elastin. Okay. The vitamin C and furillic acid. Would you put that on after first? So you always put the liquid okay before the thickest stuff. So you want thinnest to thickest. Okay. Let's talk then about how you wash your face before you begin this procedure. So, I've just come in from whatever I've done. I've, you know,

[01:23:38] I'm brushing my teeth because that's the only time I'll do this. And, uh, I'm going to wash my face now. What should I do? I I'm guessing that the hand sanitizer next to my sink is not the thing to use. So, there there's been a huge shift in so many areas of skin care that is now sinking more with what science is telling us. And so historically there was a belief that you would need to strip all the oil off your face and debris and dirt before you apply products. We're talking about, you know, skincare routines from 10 or 20 years ago. And we now know that that is harmful. It creates inflammation. It disrupts the microbiome of the skin. It does all sorts of negative things. And so a modern uh cleanser that we suggest is usually something that is glycerin based. Usually there's also other other versions, but it's a it's a way of cleansing the skin without overly stripping the oils out of the skin. Um, and uh, glycerin based cleansers don't don't foam. Um, and so that's certainly my bias. I'm sure you might have some other thoughts, Susan. But that that's the first step uh to to get the debris and superficial oils off the face and, you know, previously pride product. And then as Susan said, you go from um thin to thick. And so usually on top of that will be serums like vitamin C serum um or uh retinols and and then finally you'll put a moisturizer on it. Serum um any antioxidant serum. Okay. So we we mentioned vitamin C but there's so many.

[01:25:16] What are the others? There are great antioxidant serums that contain sulomearin floritin. How does one pick? How do you what that's where you have to look and see who's invested in doing the clinical research based behind the products that they're promoting. So you tell me what are you guys using? I mean, I I would say that generically speaking, um, if you can find a vitamin C serum that has a higher quality vehicle to make sure the bioavailability of the vitamin C gets to your skin, that product is going to have additional, you know, associated antioxidants that are going to be very useful and helpful. And, you know, again, to avoid naming brand names here, you can find that quite easily and especially with the advice. Can we go ahead and name brands because honestly people just want to know. So let's just give some brands that you guys trust uh maybe across a range of price points.

[01:26:12] Sure. I mean I I'll give you some names. So I'll give you my brand name but then also brands that I suggest other people as well. Uh my brand name is called AAS Skincare and it is designed to AVIA. AVIA. Yes. And we um formulate these products to have medically grade efficacy but we also incorporate some

[01:26:31] Ayurvedic wisdom which is anti-inflammatory. So it has turmeric and other kind of eastern botanicals for anti-inflammatory care. And we have a vitamin C serum that is microencapsulated that also has a retinol in it and also has various other antioxidants that are nyinomide that are all useful to apply to the skin right after you've washed it. Now there are other brands as well. Um you know I mean we can name a hundred of them probably.

[01:26:58] Um you know I think uh but if you couldn't use yours what are two others you would recommends is probably one of the most that's the one I tried. Yes. You said furic acid. Yes. And that that's a wonderful brand. I mean they they they're really have nailed but there's no getting out of the stink of it. There is if you go again with a different brand vitamin C formula. So they they chose to use the the furulic approach to to kind of stabilize the vitamin C. Um but there there's many other brands as well. Um so what's another non-stinky one? Oage. No, actually that's not me. So that company's publicly owned and I only I formulate for them a Susan Oaji MD line, but their their vitamin C serum has been around quite a number of years. Got it.

[01:27:45] So it's not you're just Yeah, that's so the original founder of Oaji is Zay Oaji, my father, but he has since left that company. Got it. And so this brand is has been time tested for 35 years now and they make their vitamin C under a nitrogen vapor. So it makes it so much more difficult and challenging to produce, but it's a very stable form of elcorbic acid without the furulic. So what I'm hearing here is this is not unlike what's the best diet for me. The best diet is the one that allows you to maintain energy balance that requires the fewest amounts of neurons to stay on. Yeah. So, I need to get three of these and figure out which one is the least annoying for me to put on. And it's no offense to that company. It won't be Skin Sudicles cuz every time

[01:28:32] I've tried it, the smell of the the the furyoic acid or whatever has just been annoying to me. So I also know in Oaji they not I didn't do the study for them but they have a study that shows that their eloscorbic acid penetrates about four times deeper than the one from skin suiticles. Okay, great. So I'm going to try both of yours and we'll just to name some other brands. I mean there's skin better is another one that I think uh you know produces good products and and you know maybe it's worth also mentioning because we haven't done this yet. You know why is vitamin C so important? Um I assume it has to do with proline and collagen. That's one aspect.

[01:29:08] So, vitamin C is is sort of like a wonder molecule when it comes to facial aesthetics because yes, it is a precursor for the collagen synthesis pathway um in in the proline um synthesis pathway, but it also is a powerful antioxidant. And so antioxidant application to the skin not only has the power to um remove injury, oxidative injury that has happened during the day, but it also has the ability to reverse some existing damage that's in place. Um vitamin C also regulates the tyrrosen pathway which is sort of a scientific way of saying that complexion which is you know people talk about wanting to have good complexion. What does that mean? Complexion is something that across societies, no matter what your

[01:29:57] Fispatrick scale is, people like to have a good complexion. And that means having an even skin tone, which is even distribution of melanin. It doesn't matter if you're black or white or brown. You want to have people desire to have their skin look even without splotchy areas of pigmentation or nearby areas of relative depigmentation. And so regulating the tyrrosin kindus pathway so that there's an even production of melanin throughout the skin is something that is valuable very valuable in an aesthetic sense and that's something that vitamin C does as well. Okay, we're we're going to go from the serum to the retinoic acid. Again, I'm being selfish and talking about my demographic, so people that are 40s, 50s and beyond. Um, and then it sounds like the last thing you said we want to do is is a is a a moisturizer. Yes. Is that fair? Okay.

[01:30:49] Yeah. I would say the cheapest trick in skincare which actually is is really true is that deep moisturization locks down the skin barrier function and allows the skin tur of the skin dermis epithelium to thicken just by having that olusive barrier. So, you can go to Walgreens and spend $6 on Aquafor, which is basically petroleum jelly, and put it on your face nightly, and your skin will look better in 30 days, guaranteed, because your skin will thicken and a lot of the fine lines and crinkles will actually start to disappear because your skin is being more hydrated. That's hydration. That's hydration. That's hydration. Yeah. But it's What if I don't want to grease up my pillow? I'm not I'm saying that as sort of like tongue and cheek. I'm not telling people to do that, but um if you if you actually did a double blinded study, you would see that there are real results in 30 days. But the reason why I mentioned that is that um good deep hydration can be performed with an inexpensive product that you're using regularly and it'll make a real difference because the moisturization, especially overnight while you're sleeping, is a powerful tool for aesthetics. And you know, I don't like I wouldn't give you though a moisturizer.

[01:32:06] So you can just tell I'm a grease ball to begin with. No, but you have young thicker skin. So again, just like uh women age 20 years faster than guys in terms of the bone remodeling and fat atrophy, the skin as well. So you say I my my routine would be done after the retinoic acid from from my standpoint.

[01:32:25] Yes. At this point. And then we might revisit that in a few years. Yes. And I tend to give moisturizers as women become more mature. I don't want to use the word older because they do start to make less of their natural moisturizing factor that even starts to diminish even when we're 18. So most people I think in into their mid4s and 50s even might not always need a moisturizer with everything that they put on at night.

[01:32:51] One caveat though, sorry, is that your morning sunscreen and your serums have some moisturizing quality to them also. And I always have them put a super antioxidant serum or a vitamin C serum on at night before the retinoid because my feeling on this is that you spend the whole day outside or in your car or um being hit by LED lights and ultraviolet ultraviolet lights, those are also damaging the skin. And so I think you should have an antioxidant on first thing in the morning, but it's going to get depleted by the end of the day. And so by the end of the day, wait, I'm sorry. I missed that. Are we putting the serum on in the morning? Yes. And at night. And I always have them repeated at night because it's depleted all day long. Oh god. And we know that the cells undergo mopagy and autoagi at night. We want to help the repair factor. We want to put on an antioxidant at night again just to replenish the skin. And the retinoic acid, it also goes on top of that. And it also has no no at night.

[01:33:52] And the retinoic acid has anti-inflammatory properties to it in addition to all the good things it does in terms of building up collagen and elastin. Okay, so just to go through this cuz I'm you can tell not the sharpest tool in the shed. My AM routine is going to be wash. Okay, let's assume I just came out of the shower. All right. Okay.

[01:34:13] And by the way, in the shower, don't use your body soap on your face because it's going to strip the oils out of your face. So again, you need a separate facial cleanser. Oh god, what what do I need? The same glycerol based thing. Well, it depends on your skin type, too. Like I I tend to be maybe a little bit more picky about if you saw the crap that I like I'm I've got like a 2.99 bottle body wash from Target that I scrub head to toe. Like I am the lowest com like the put it this way. When my wife met me in the hospital, the first thing she noticed was how disgusting I was in that I used to take alcohol pads and clean my face. Like just like that was my shower in the hospital. It wasn't bad. It was a little harsh, but I mean there were worse things you could do.

[01:35:03] All right, so we're going to do we're going to do soap. We're going to do serum. Yes. And then we're going to do sunscreen. Yes. That's the morning routine. And some people might in there need depending on if they have clogged pores, oilier skin, they might need all the alpha hydroxy acid or polyhydroxy acid before their sunscreen. But you've nailed it right there. That's a very simple regimen you can follow. Okay. And then the PM is soap serum. We'd prefer if you call it a cleanser, right? Soap soap opens up the door to the target 29.

[01:35:33] Fair enough. Glycerol. And now the difference is, you know, I do have lots of patients like you, Peter, who are minimalists. So again, it's trying to get them to use whatever they can to protect their skin and hopefully start to improve the aging process. All right. I might I might just to do the experiment for 90 days, try to commit to cleanser, serum, sunscreen in the morning, cleanser, serum, retinoic acid in the evening. That we agree that would be Yes. Okay. By the way, in the show notes, we'll get from you products that you guys like, including your own.

[01:36:10] I just want to let people kind of look through this and decide and and you know, obviously you guys disclose your own products. Great. But let let people see the full breadth of things. Um, you know, I'm and I'm sorry. And one of the things people ask about though, especially when they're very into their nutrition and eating healthy, they say, "Well, why do I need to apply an antioxidant if I'm eating a lot of antioxidants?" And the skin being the largest organ in your body is very unique. It's very good at keeping things out or from the inside coming out as well. So outside things like water pollution, it tries to protect that from getting in and does a good job at keeping kind of homeostasis. So they have shown that the level of vitamin C that you can achieve in the skin by topical application far exceeds what you can do by ingesting it. the amount you would have to ingest, sure, to get the right amount in the skin, you'd have GI issues, which that that would definitely make you quit. Before we leave this, I guess one thing I just want to chat about is acne. Again, it's mostly something I that adolescence are experiencing, but adults get acne as well. Um, is that something you guys spend much time on? I do. What? So, give me give me the the the sort of playbook you have on on acne. I assume it involves spironolactone if it looks to be, you know, endocrine in nature. Um,

[01:37:34] I'd be very curious to hear about, you know, Accutane. I hear horror stories about it, but obviously it probably works very well. What do people need to be aware of? How what's your playbook for addressing acne? So, my number one thing I tell people is for themselves or their children, y try to treat the acne before it scars because I cannot tell you how many times I see patients for consults for acne scars. They're in their 70s and they're still crying about it as if it was yesterday. They've been traumatized all their life with these acne scars. And what causes acne to scar? So, it depends on how inflammatory your acne is. There are different types of acne. There's comedonal acne, which are just your run-of-the-mill small pimples, white heads, blackheads. Those don't typically scar unless someone picks at them. Okay? So, number one rule for patients, don't pick at your skin.

[01:38:21] Second thing, they can have a little bit more inflammatory acne and those tend to be the red ones that come up and they're maybe posture postular on the skin and if you don't pick at them, those also might heal without scarring. And then there's cystic acne and those are a completely different type of acne where you're getting inflammation that sebaceous pyosbaceious unit. Yep. which is the hair follicle and the oil gland feeding in there and you get swelling deep in the dermis and then you might get enough inflammation and rupture of that cyst that you leave a divot at that point and that causes what we call a valley scar or you might have enough damage even if not picked even if not picked. So cystic acne is a true in my standpoint a medical emergency because you want to treat maybe not on the level of anaphilaxis but correct correct but for parents it's a dermatologic medical emergency yes very because it can cause so much psychological trauma to the child people with cystic acne even bad inflammatory acne they're shy to go out in public they want to hide their face they hide their face percentage of adolescence will develop cystic acne I don't know that I can quote the exact percentage is what about 20%. Oh wow. So pretty high. Yes. Um so this patient and it's very difficult to fix later. And those patients I'm not a big fan of antibiotic use. I don't want to alter their gut microbiome. I do think that we're just touching on the surface of how important that is. Those patients I would quickly move to Accutane because nothing topical is going to work. And so photodynamic therapy. Okay. say more about that. So photodnamic therapy is where you take a molecule like alpha aminovolonic acid ALA and you paint it on the skin and you let it incubate for about an hour and then you shine a red light onto the skin to activate it. And that chemical gets into the sebaceous glands and percolates down through the skin. And when you activate it, it causes a heat reaction and basically induces damage in that whole area that's picking up that medication.

[01:40:31] So you're basically causing the oil glands to shut down. You're taking away the nidis for the inflammatory acne. And for some patients who cannot take Accutane or isotininoan, that's a great alternative for them. It does feel uncomfortable and not every doctor offers it but it's a great adjunct or alternative if they can't take isotrino and would would would antibiotics work if not for the limitations and you know side effects of you know long-term systemic antibiotic use. So antibiotics will work to a small degree. They might help shut down maybe a good proportion of that cystic acne flare, but they won't get to the root cause, which is the sebaceous unit over production of oils, the the bacteria that are in there feeding off of that and the whole cascade. And there's something genetic cystic acne tends to run in families. So there's some kind of genetic tendency towards that millu that causes that cystic acne. How does how does Accutane work? What's the mechanism? So Accutane is a type of retinoid and it's basically going to go in there and dry up the oil production that's in these overactive sebaceous glands that are being driven by your androgens. But you have to take it orally. It doesn't work top. It doesn't correct. So they have used some topical variations of it for psoriasis and things like that. But the best is to take it orally because then you bypass a lot of the surface dermatitis.

[01:41:57] What is the main side effect or toxicity that people are trying to avoid with Accutane? Why does it have a bad name? So, it has a couple of bad connotations with it. First, it dries everyone out. So, for the 5 months you're on it, you are going to have dry lips, dry eyes. Um, some people complain that their skin is too dry. Some people on very high doses might get shedding of the skin of the hair. Wow. And then you're not allowed to drink alcohol while you're on it. So, that's a whole other issue with kids and making sure they're compliant with that because it is metabolized by the liver. M and other than that patients if they're using it correctly tolerate it very well. It got some bad publicity effect the Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:42:37] Yeah, there's againity because you want to make sure you're not you're not getting pregnant on it because it will cause defects. So, we have to go through this whole FDA required modules with the patients to make sure that they're using two forms of birth control for the female patients while they're on it. They're not donating blood while they're on it. But it got a very bad reputation when I think it was a child or son of a senator committed suicide while on that medication. And they said it was a depression induced by the medication.

[01:43:08] When it turns out when people look scientifically at the rate of depression, I'm that sounds like junk science written all over it. Exly. If you look at depression scores in acne patients with cystic acne, it's significant and their depression actually improves when they take something like acute. Do you have to monitor liver function tests while patients are on it the same way you do with lamed or any of the toe fungus type things? Is it that severe potentially?

[01:43:32] It could be. It changes your lipid profile while you're on it. It can elevate your triglycerides and elevate your cholesterol. And there are very few instances we would adjust the dose. We just tell people to try to eat healthier while they're on it, especially triglyceride elevation. Um, liver enzymes. It's a rare patient that gets a real significant bump, but you want to watch for that because you want to stop the medication if that's the case. And it's also a proxy to make sure they're not drinking. It's sort of a way of know finding out if they're following the rules. Yes, we tell them. We can tell.

[01:44:03] And I don't prescribe Accutane. This is usually something specific physicians are um Yes. And you mentioned five months. Does that imply that you do this very lengthy five month treatment and then you're done with this? It eradicates the sebaceous cysts uh the sebaceous glands to the level where the the child the teenager is done with this treatment afterwards for 85% of people that take it for 5 months they're done then you've got the small subset then need to take it again and then I have my adult patients who might not have a lot of acne but they're very oily I put them on it one month out of a year just to dry them up a little bit and it helps them feel better makes their pores look tighter, makes their skin have a better texture to it.

[01:44:51] Because we always said, "Oh, if you have oily skin, you're going to age better." That's so not true. You're just going to oil is inflammatory on the skin. So, from that standpoint, I'd rather have them uh use it to dry them up for about a month and then allow them to enjoy the beautiful skin for the rest of the year.

[01:45:08] How does one know? I mean, it sounds like a dumb question. How does one know if they have oily skin? Like, I've always thought I have oily skin. Do I? Well, your pores would be enlarged and you would literally some people have to blot their face midday. Okay, that I don't have that, but okay. Um, let's move on now to By the way, that was super interesting to me. Just kind of um and and by the way, I want to make sure we also get good products. We didn't talk about it, but can you can you tell me uh you mentioned for the um cleanser, it just needs to be glycerol based. Are these easy over- the-counter things to find? Should I be going to uh

[01:45:43] Target or Walgreens and literally just going through the skin aisle and looking for cleansers that are glycerol based that won't lather when I use them? Is that the litmus test? I mean, that's one way to do it. And we can also provide give us a bunch of links to products. Include your own. I don't care. Just just And if you're a familiar, I'm going to give you one that's not quite so hydrating when you wash. Okay. Um All right. Let us move now into the really confusing realm of

[01:46:15] I show up in your office. I can't tell you what's wrong, but I show you a picture of me 10 years ago and I say I want to look like that. And I should have brought a picture in of me so you could actually see it. But like I you've already described it without having seen the picture, right? I don't have bags under my eyes. My skin just looks better. Everything just looks better. Part of it is color. I I will admit 10 years ago there was no gray anywhere in my beard. We're not going to fix that problem. That's fine. But but aside from that, um like oh and the wrinkles in my forehead. Like I notice in pictures of me in the past, I had some wrinkles. Now it looks like I have a wrinkle farm, right? So, so go again go over the changes assuming I had that photo. How would you describe them pathologically or maybe that's too strong a word, but you know what I mean.

[01:47:12] So, I think um there are three basic changes that happen to every single person with aging and we've touched on this a little bit and and we'll dive deeper now. So there's skin changes, uh there are volume changes, there are gravitational changes. Um and and maybe we should throw in the fourth, which is, you know, bone structural foundational changes. And so those happen to everybody. Um, when we see patients in our clinics who are presenting the way you've just suggested, we will spend extra time analyzing the individual nuances of skin volume, bony, ligamentous anatomy, gravitational changes that are specific to your face. Um, and then also we'll just rely on just general knowledge that we have about what types of aging changes we see at this point. And um, it's a very um, complex process. I tried to analyze this a little bit before walking into this podcast today. Like what am I actually thinking about when

[01:48:10] I'm starting to comm communicate with the patient. As soon as I see the patient while I'm, you know, making some nicities and saying hello and get to know them, I'm already analyzing. I'm already looking at their skin. I'm looking at the bone structure. I'm analyzing the facial proportion. I'm looking at areas where there's volume loss. It's obvious. I'm looking at the dynamic movement of the forehead and the face. I'm analyzing how much um heaviness is on the eyes that might be driving frontalus muscle tone that's causing forehead wrinkles. I'll be I'll be looking for facial asymmetries. So, a lot of the lot of the physical exam that we do in our offices happens in the first 15 seconds because we're just this is what we do and it just happens quickly in in our mind. It's that moment. It's that blink moment. You look at someone, you're like, I know what I'm going to do on them. Yes. Yes. the urologist doesn't have this advantage that he can't, you know, examine the prostate and the scrotal tissue during that first 15 seconds. Very good point.

[01:49:10] Yes. So, so we do that um when we walk into the room, that analysis already happens. And then because I've already got that sort of snapshot anatomic analysis already in my mind, then the next step that I'm doing is and I'd love to hear what your process is, Susan, but the next step is I'm now going into their mind and trying to understand their psychology and what their motivation is. And the problem that we have is that the patient doesn't know what words to say. Yeah, they're like me. for them to communicate what's actually driving them. Y and so I have to pull that out of them. This was a little bit of detective work. Um a little bit of background. Um my parents are both psychiatrists. I actually went to medical school thinking I was going to go into psychiatry and then I rapidly pivoted into surgery and ended up where

[01:50:02] I am. But that initial love and appreciation for what's happening inside the neuronal processing and subconscious is something that we actually work with every single day in our offices. And so um so the next step that happens in a consultation is I would say hopefully I I mean to me that's a that's a great thing but I I I don't know and not to be a downer I I don't know that that's true of every you know person who is who is dealing with with aesthetics. I would guess there are a lot of people who are just kind of doing this in a coin operated way. Yeah. Unfortunately, there is a there there can be a tendency to take a cookie cutter approach where you recognize this and here's a it's a knee-jerk reaction. There's wrinkles on the forehead. Inject Botox. You know, there's gels, do a facelift. That's not the way that we should be practicing aesthetics. Every single individual has a totally customized situation anatomically, physiologically, and psychologically. And so our job is to try and figure that out when the patient doesn't have the ability to express. So sometimes this almost overlaps into pediatrics, which is something that I know you've got some history with in in in surgery, but you know, you're trying to do a physical exam and get history from someone who's unable to communicate what they're actually able what they what they want you to figure out. And so we'll I'll start asking questions, you know, did you like the way you looked when you were 20? If they say yes, that means that they actually like their natural facial proportions and they're probably looking more for rejuvenation.

[01:51:39] But if they say, you know, I always had a heavy eyelid and I never could put makeup on my eye, then I know that they're maybe looking for something that's a more substantial result in that particular area. That's just one example. And then um I'll try to get to know them from a just what do they what kind of what's their occupation? What's their situation at home? Do they have kids? Tell me a little bit about your life. I'm trying to understand their social history to to see if there's any red flags that would stop the process and say, "Okay, this is not the right time to be considering aesthetics. You got to get your mental health in order before we proceed," which is something that I would, you know, very openly tell a patient, you know, at the right time in the consultation. But, but if a woman came in and said, "My husband is leaving me," right? Which is unfortunately probably not an uncommon thing. Um, and and let's make it more extreme, right? A 50-year-old woman comes in and says, "My husband of 25 years is leaving me for a 20 year old."

[01:52:39] Understandably, she's in duress and she's probably comparing herself to a 25year-old. Would that be a non-starter in your mind? So, the scenario you described is actually very common. Yeah, I see this kind of situation all the time. And then um and this is why I schedule 45 minutes or an hour for initial consultations because once we start talking about that tears may start flowing because the patient is now in a safe zone talking to a medical professional who's actually listening to them. We were talking about time in a clinic before and so then then we start to fall into the role of a therapist and we're letting them express because I want to see how deep is this trauma? I'm trying to understand, you know, is this something that is now a non-starter or what should we do here? Because there are scenarios where someone is in that kind of scenario situation where um we certainly would not want to make any drastic moves or big changes or shifts.

[01:53:40] But is it appropriate to recognize that this person is you know desiring something that is a reasonable goal but the current emotional state is not appropriate to do the procedure to get there. So maybe we say look let's think we do something irreversible or so we do something reversible. Yes. Exactly.

[01:53:57] Because the fear sorry to interrupt but I'm guessing that the fear here is if you say no to her she's going to find some guy down the block who will do anything. And it's better that you do something small and develop a relationship with her that will ultimately serve her interests, but but you can't give her everything she wants at the moment. Is that a fair assessment? Very well said. I that's exactly right. We're trying to build that trust and build that relationship on the front end so that this individual who's trying to get from A to B, we're going to take them there safely. Whether it's, you know, over a couple of months or 10 years, we're going to try to get to that goal. And there may be some obstacles along the way and choices that we have to make, but we'll navigate it together. And it's all built on building that relationship on the front end. So the trust exists where I can tell the patient we are not going to do this maneuver right now and then that patient will listen to me because the trust has been built up enough that this individual knows that I have their best interest in mind and we're going to get to that goal eventually. And so so yes, this this scenario that you're describing, the individual might be best served with, okay, look, I think we can get there one day with procedures, but right now I'm going to refer you to a therapist. You have a lot going on in your life right now. Let's do some simple things that we're not going to regret like neurom modulators and fillers and some skin treatments or lasers, things that are low risk.

[01:55:27] They're not going to create any scars or permanent changes and then we can eventually get to that that next step. We're not going to do the facelift next week. Correct. Yes. That that's on hold. Um so so you know the first step is we do this kind of snapshot anatomic dynamic analysis. It's not just a an a single image as we're looking at the muscle movement and then the second step is this deep dive into their social situation psychology and then um presuming that everything's kind of moving along smoothly and now we're getting ready to talk about what we're you know what should we do now then I'll spend time educating the patient on their actual anatomy because they've never actually had that information presented to them right so I will put the mirror in front of the patient and I will say Let's go through what I'm seeing with on your exam today together and we'll start at the top and I'll go through every little detail and I'll throw in little caveats like I'm sorry

[01:56:23] I'm not trying to make you feel bad about your features but you're here for me to tell you so I'm going to tell you everything. We're going to talk about your bones. We're going to talk about the wrinkles. We're going to talk about the asymmetry you never noticed which by the way is almost always the case.

[01:56:34] People don't notice their asymmetries. And so we point out these asymmetries to them. And then after that kind of you know relatively um you know lengthy discussion about their individual anatomy. Then we'll start to say okay now you initially told me that these are some of the areas that bother you.

[01:56:54] Here's what we could do to fix your eye region, your cheek, your mouth, your gel, whatever it is. And I'll present typically options that go from minimally invasive to more substantial. And based on how the individual is responding to the conversation, I can usually at this point 20 years in my practice dial in like what is the appropriate scope for this patient. They don't really know whether they want a facelift or not. um maybe I needed to show them maybe I need to explain them the complications where the incisions are so they really understand what that procedure means and then if that seems like it's too much for them we will dial it back and I'll have to tell them look we're not going to be able to get the results of a facelift without a facelift but I don't think you're ready for a facelift so maybe we should start with something smaller and kind of taking baby steps and then just to conclude I I usually will end up finally telling the patient what they showed up to hear which is my opinion and that I won't give them my opinion about what we should do until we've gone through this whole process and I've watched their body language as we've talked about procedures. Sometimes

[01:58:02] I'll suggest something that's minimally invasive and they seem uninterested because it's not enough for them and I'll read that body language and kind of dial in the treatment for what I suggest for them. And so that'll happen at the end of the consultation typically. So um I know that was a long answer but that that does I would say describe my typical consultation. How about you,

[01:58:22] Susan? Yeah. Oh, pretty much everything that Tanish said and I was so glad to hear that you would talk to the patient about their mental state at that time, too, because we do a lot of almost like psycho psychology and therapy with our patients. If they open up to you, then that's an honor to you and you have to take that and you have to help them through that issue. And my I have a psychology background as well. So I was biology and psychology double major in schools and I find that I use it a lot.

[01:58:53] It's so important but um I approach patients very similarly but I try to put things in terms that they can understand. So I tell them there are the five Rs of rejuvenation and it doesn't mean they need all of it at that point in time but at some point in their life they're going to need one of them and they'll make it through all all five.

[01:59:12] And that is we need to relax overactive muscles. And I'm showing them on their face the movements. I will say we need to refill lost volume whether it's through fat grafting which is still one of my favorite procedures to do or refilling with fillers. And I tell them we need to resurface the skin because to me the how the skin looks is absolutely much more important than how tight they are. So patients sometimes come in, they're like, "I just want to lift here." And they want to lift their lower face and their skin is terribly wrinkled and uh they have hyperpigmentation and sunspots. And I'll tell them, "If I lift you now, no one's going to notice that you look better. But if I make your skin look better, people are going to notice you look better before I even do the surgery." So we have relax, refill, resurface. We need to do red. So there are going to be times that you can't lift in I'm sorry, fill enough. have to lift. So they either will lift with devices such as micro needling radio frequency devices or ultrasound devices to tighten the skin or a faceelift of some sort. So those you need to do. And then what people don't realize my fifth are is that you have to keep renewing because the aging process continues and the minute they leave your office everything you just did on them looks great and it starts to diminish. And that's what we talked about a moment.

[02:00:35] That's what we were just talking about. The renewal was the maintenance. Absolutely. So, you have to keep renewing because otherwise you're going to lose that benefit. And what do I mean by renewing? You definitely maintain your neurom modulators and your fillers, but they have to be strategically placed. You don't need a lot of fillers.

[02:00:51] You need to keep the skin priming itself and turning over. And so, you can achieve a lot of that at home. And I think people underestimate how much they can do at home with their skinincare regimens and then have to do less in the office. And that's my big emphasis. Do more at home and then let us do in the office a little boost here and there afterwards. And so those five Rs make it very easy for these patients to comprehend. And they might not need all that yet, but at some point in their life, they're going to have all those five. So what I want to do then is I want you to go through the five Rs looking at me. And Tanish, I want you to go through your four changes looking at me. So that just feel free to brutalize me. You're not going to humiliate me. Um so so let's start. So So Susan, you look at me and let's start with relax. What needs to be relaxed in my face? Yeah. So here's the thing. You do move your eyebrows a lot in your forehead. So you've got a lot of forehead wrinkles. I do notice the gloellar 11s. What are the

[02:01:54] Oh, these are those little sharp lines there. Yep. Yep. So knit your brows for me. Yeah. And so raise your eyebrows up. Now, part of the reason you're raising your eyebrows maybe now more than you did 10 years ago is you have a little more hooding on your upper eyelids and your eyelids are almost touching your eyelashes. And when that happens, you're sending a signal to the forehead to lift so you can see better. And is that because I've lost elasticity in the eyelid and it's just drooping more?

[02:02:21] Well, no. More so, going back to what we were talking about, the bony structure, we're losing support, fat atrophy, including the brow fat pad. And so now you've got to descent a little bit of your brow, but a little more of the extra redundant skin there. I got it. So part So I'm I'm actually using this muscle more to try to keep these guys up. Exactly. Now, if you go to someone who doesn't evaluate you like we do, they might look at your forehead like target practice and say, "I'm going to use a neurom modulator across that entire forehead and make it so you can't move." And then you're going to walk around very hooded. I would feel silly.

[02:02:58] I wouldn't want to look that way. you would hate the feeling. It would feel very hood and very heavy. And I've done that on purpose to myself just to see what patients experience. So, and it's not a nice feeling. Secondly, you are very fit. So, you have not a lot of fat in your face. And like I said, doesn't matter what you think your weight is on your body now or how much fat percentage you have on your body, you've atrophied some of the facial fat pads. So, you you've exposed the entire orbital rim. I can see that. And you may also notice I have a scar here and it has created an asymmetry in the drooping. So, uh, from back in the my teenage years when I was boxing, I actually had I was split to my cheek there. So, that is a very deep scar um that I I'm I suspect the connective tissue there is actually tethered near the bone. Wow. And we can free that up with subsision. So that is kind of similar to the micro needling

[02:03:52] Touch did on your other scar, but this is going under the scar, the whole length of it, and subsizing or freeing up that tethering and that adhesion. Got it. With or without adding fat or filler. Okay, got it. Um, but I would So if you look at what makes the eyes look youthful, it's definitely having a little more platform show on the upper eyelid, but also it's reducing what we call the length of the lid cheek junction. So the length from your eyelash line Yeah. down to where you can actually see the cheek, that's elongating in me. Yeah. Because you've lost all that volume that was I think that if you were to ask me, Peter, what are you most self-conscious of aesthetically?

[02:04:33] I think this is it. I think it is this thinness here, which I believe makes me look constantly tired even when I feel like a million bucks. Um, I think I'm more subconscious of this than I am my wrinkled forehead. Yeah. And that's where I would either use a little bit of your own fat if we could find some. Oh,

[02:04:55] I've got plenty. And I would use that to rebuild this area and shorten that lid cheek junction so that we create more of a youthful length rather than this kind of long hollow. Why? We're going to talk about this of course, but but when do you guys make the decision of an an an autograph of fat versus wtolin? you mentioned earlier, I love fat if we can do it. Now, with the advent of fillers, the volume of fat grafting we do goes down. But I just did a lady yesterday, and I'll tell you why. On her, she came in, she had never had anything before and she was hollow everywhere. So, yes, we could use seven uh 69. Okay? So, yes, we could use lots of fillers, but she'll spend a small fortune putting a lot of fillers in her face over time. And I personally don't like to inject more than two or three syringes of filler in one visit. So, it's going to take a process to build up different areas on her because I just don't want to have a reaction. And I also want to see where

[02:05:55] I'm placing everything. But in her case, we went straight for the fat because she has a thin face, but she has a normal body mass index. So, her fat is going to do well. How much? How much uh filler would I require for just B? What would your guess be? I'd start with a syringe split between both under eyelids and then I would do another syringe probably in about 3 or 4 months if I need to. And that what's the cost of each syringe? Not the not your cost, the patient's cost. Yeah, about $800 to $1,000 depending on the filler.

[02:06:26] And what is the cost of the procedure, the fat graft procedure? That's obviously much more, but it's a lifetime presum, okay? So five years worth of treatment basically. So, it's cheaper in the long run to do a fat graft presumably. Yes. But also remember that we're just talking about your under eyes, but let's say you're my typical patient. They need their temples filled. They need their cheeks filled. They need their chin filled, jawline enhancement. So, yesterday I did about 35 40 mls of fat on my patient.

[02:06:57] So, that if you were to multiply that, it gets very expensive. Um, are my temples too sunken? Yours are still good. So, and your cheekbones are still good. Your jawline is still good. I would put a little neurom modulator or Botox in your platisma muscle because I am starting to see some platisma banding there. Mine's worn off. So, you don't want to look at mine. Um, but that helps to relax that muscle that does nothing but pull lower to the lower face down.

[02:07:26] And I would possibly add a little volume right in your mar. In your case, I would love a bio stimulatory filler, something like polyelactic acid or sculpture is the other name for it to start building collagen and thicken your dermis thickness in here because I'm starting to see some of your buckle fat pad atrophy as well. And that just goes along with how fit you are. So using this to build your own collagen is a great way because and if you were a female, very thin, we would have an issue because those patients tend to burn through their fillers very quickly.

[02:08:00] So, if we can get a bioimulatory filler on board where they're building their own collagen, sometimes that works a little better. Now, do you ever look at a patient like me and say, "You're you're most fat depleted here and here, but you're not yet fat depleted here and here. I I only want to do one fat graft on you. So, let's cost aside. Let's use fillers until I have to do this procedure once and for all and then I'll literally just take a bunch of fat off you and do it or absolutely is that a better approach or do you are you afraid to do multiple fat grafts? Oh no. I have patients that come for fat grafting as they need it. So

[02:08:38] I've done some patients three, four times, but I have turned down a lot of patients who come in actually asking for a fat grafting for lips or for under eyes and I tell them that since they don't need it elsewhere, that's too much of a procedure to go through for like one anatomic area and in the lips it doesn't hold as long. But under the eyes, it works beautifully. But I would do it when they need it elsewhere. I will probably never need lip fat grafting. I when I was little, people made fun of the size of my lips. So, well, I'm I'm pretty sure I'm safe on that. Um, okay. Before we go on to resurfacing, Tanuj, what would you change or add or how how would you approach my face? Well, I think um, you know, Susan's uh, analysis was was spot on. I agree. Um, you know, I think that what I hear you saying is the biggest issue that bothers you is your undereye area. So, because you're someone who's never had a procedure before. No, actually Brett Cotless did stick wtolin in there.

[02:09:38] Gosh, how many years ago? Probably 2018, 2017. Okay. Um, I'll tell you what I remember of the procedure. I was amazed at how much I bruised. He told me I would, so it's not like this was an unexpected complication, but I looked like I had two black eyes for a couple of days. Otherwise, it looked really good and then it went away after a period of time. But it definitely was not a year that it lasted. So I also suspect I metabolized it very quickly.

[02:10:05] We have longerlasting fillers though that we can use under that. He also mentioned that this scar was problematic. He said that scar is is creating an it's it's very difficult to fill this eye. And you might ask, well, why didn't you just keep doing it? Just the same reason I don't do anything. Just sheer laziness. I was just like the thought of actually doing that again, having a couple black eyes for a couple days, blah blah blah blah blah. I just sort of gave up. But but I So anyway, I have that one experience. Mhm. Yeah. So, um your under eye area and and by the way, um being lit this way is an abomination. Yeah. But but just by the way, um bruising from fillers is a lot less these days because we don't use needles as much anymore. We actually use canulas, which are blunt tipped catheterss, and they don't typically bruise hardly much at all. So, that's one big change that's happened in the last 5, eight years is switching to canulas. And people have different philosophies on that. Some people use needles for specific locations, but just wanted to mention that that bruising in your under eye would probably be less if you had fillers skin. But again, kind of going back to the way that I do a cosmetic exam because I just heard you say the thing that bothers me the most is this area. And we could list off another 10 things that are quote unquote. Like I didn't even notice this.

[02:11:22] So now you've given me something to be self-conscious about. I should have prefaced it saying I'm just going to point out something. wanted you to I I'm totally teasing. I'm totally teasing. So, I would laser focus on the area that the patient is now presenting to me as their major reason for even calling up my office and making an appointment is probably because they wanted to address this area. And yes, they're curiously interested in all the other things that I had to say. But because this patient, you know, in this case you is um never had surgery on their face, is probably not looking for massive shifts in their face, I would probably laser focus on this one area, not just because it's what you pointed out, but also in the um realm of uh rejuvenation procedures that we we perform surgically or non-surgically, the eye region is probably the sweet spot. You know, just again going back to psychology, evolution, we focus on people's eyes in conversation. We, you know, when we talk about beauty, we're looking at the eyes. So whe when people's eyes are now starting to become further and further away from the way they remember it when they were younger, it creates this discomfort. It's it's the self-discre theory from psychology where you've got this self-image of yourself and then you look at yourself you're like wait a second that's that's not me right and then it creates this discomfort of like is that what I really look like and then it creates you know the psychological effect of like maybe a little less confidence or dissatisfaction with your appearance that's the big motivator for why people actually end up coming to see someone like like us is because that that self-discre theory is kicking in and they're the the the the delta between their self- view and their actual appearance is getting greater and greater. It it's one of the reasons I it sounds ridiculous that I'm saying this on video and that I have a podcast. I freaking hate being on video. I don't mind the sound of my voice, the seeing me on a video. And as you know, in this type of a situation, you're always overhead lit. It is an unbearable appearance because when you have these bags under your eyes, overhead lighting just makes it look 10 times worse. So if

[02:13:37] I if I pass myself in the mirror, I'm like, "Yeah, I notice it." If if someone ever sends me a clip of me on video, like on YouTube or on I'm like, "How in the hell are we allowing this to be in the public domain?" I mean, seriously. And part of it may be what we were mentioning earlier that subconscious posing because when you're looking in the mirror, you know you're looking in the mirror and your subconscious makes you lift your cheek. Maybe I angle my head different or something. You angle your head or you smile a little bit and it pulls the cheek up and minimizes that hollow between your under eye and your cheek. And everybody does this and that's why people tend to be shocked by photographs that are taken of them when they weren't prepared for it because they they're not prepared to pose for the picture and their um flat undynamic face in a photograph that's taken like that is shocking to them and is often a big motivator for them to come to see us. I also made the mistake of once reading some comments on social media where people were just ripping me apart for how horrible I look and it's like you can say what you want like I don't care but you do care if you read a bunch of people saying you look horrible you're like well that sucks I don't I don't like that but you know when people show you that picture of themselves that someone took because they bring it to the cons they bring a picture and like oh my god I saw myself last week look at how I look and you're like give me your phone I take their phone I take a picture of them in the exam room and

[02:14:58] Show them like look how good you look. Yes. Like this was one ncond in one way you were moving your mouth or tilting your head or shadow. You don't look like that. So delete that picture. We will not address how you look in a nancond compared to how you look the rest of the day. Totally agree. Yeah. So um and then what about the wrinkle situation? Yeah.

[02:15:20] So, um, you know, I would kind what I would do is I would kind of go through all of the areas, the four areas that we're talking about, and then I would laser focus on the eyes. So, to go through the four areas, we're talking about skin. Yes. Um, we we've done a lot of discussion already on skin care. I think that you should start a skincare regimen. I think you'll appreciate it as time goes by. I'm going to cut it to three months for sure. You you have you have uneven pigmentation in your face.

[02:15:46] Yep. um you have some fine lines that are more concentrated in the eye region because that's the eyelid skin is the thinnest on the entire body and there's it's the one area of the body um and you're you're a surgeon by training. You know that when you cut into the body there's always a fat layer. Yep. Not in the eyelids. So the eyelid does not have a subcutaneous fat layer. It's the only place on the body. And so so what's underneath the skin? The muscle muscle.

[02:16:09] Wow. And so there are four causes of dark circles under the eyes. There's visibility of the orvicularis muscle. There's shadowing which is why you probably don't like your appearance in this kind of situation because the shadowing is visible down here. Um there's hemocetarin deposition and then there's hyperpigmentation. So those are the four reasons why people get dark circles under the eyes and and and you actually have all four of them.

[02:16:32] Wonderful. Um and then so so we would definitely want you to get on to a good quality skincare regimen because it it it's one of the four areas that needs to be addressed not only to reverse some changes but for prevention purposes. And when it comes to volume loss, I think Susan sort of already picked your part there. You've got, you know, volume loss in the midface. I think your temporal volume loss is enough where if you were going to have some kind of volume treatment, putting a little bit in would be nice. Your left temple sinks in a little more than the right. I can only see his Oh, okay. Yeah. I'm mostly looking at this side of his face. Yeah.

[02:17:07] Yeah. The right temple's less less hollow. Is that extremely common? So, um, when I put that mirror up in front of patients to start pointing out their asymmetries, I'm I'm not kidding. 95 to 99% of the time, people are unaware of their own asymmetries until I point them out to them. And the reason why it's important to point it out to them because if I'm going to be employed to manipulate their face, they need to know where the starting point was. Now, do we want to fix asymmetries all the time?

[02:17:34] Like, does it matter? sometimes. Um um so we don't want to make it worse the for certainly, you know, that that's probably a big big factor. Um and then if there's a way to make it better when we're doing maneuvers, we'll dial that in because again going back to the three, you know, biological reasons of why people perceive beauty, it'll make that person look more more handsome or beautiful.

[02:17:56] Okay? And some people do have significant asymmetries. I have ladies for some reason where one jawline heel is um aging beautifully and very well defined and the other one's like a centimeter shorter. Yes. In length. And Peter has some of the asymmetries too. I mean his right side of the face even though you had that injury on your right cheek, your right side of your face is the smaller side of your face. So imagine in utero literally no idea. Yes.

[02:18:22] And so and and the other funny thing is that when people another reason why people feel uncomfortable when they see photographs of themselves is because you're used to looking at your mirror image of yourself. Think about this. That's right. Nobody on the planet has actually ever seen themselves. You've only seen yourself in the mirror or you've seen a photograph of yourself.

[02:18:42] You actually don't really know what you look like in in in in the flesh. And so because there's that discrepancy between the mirror and a photograph because the mirror is a flipped image of yourself and the photograph is not. That's why people don't like photographs of themselves especially when they're more asymmetric. So So if we measure the distance between the outside corner of your eye to your mouth, it's about 10% longer on your left side because the bone structure is wider. So, so again, imagine you're laying in uterero, right?

[02:19:15] You're you're you're in in the womb and you're probably spending more time on one side of your face than the other. There's so many factors we can imagine as to why why do we get facial asymmetry? It's because of maybe the growth rates were different. Maybe there's a slightly different cytoine difference between the left and the right at, you know, at six weeks and and then maybe you're laying on one side of your face for two months. You know, these are all the reasons why we end up with a little asymmetry. And these things are present at birth and they become more exaggerated as we age because when you have that de devolmization of the fat pockets and the ligaments show up those the underlying bone structure starts to become more visible. And then finally, you know, if we saw some pictures of you, you know, when you're 20 and we put them side by side with you right now, even though you have a great jawbone, it's probably lost about 10 to 15% of the volume that you had when you were, you know, 20. And so, you know, a comprehensive treatment would be to volumize either with some fillers or some fat grafting to the areas of volume. We talked about the skin care regimen we talked about. I would probably put some volume along the jaw and your cheekbone because you've lost that projection with aging. We just know that, you know, someone of your age is going to have a certain degree of deep.

[02:20:32] How do you put volume along the jaw? How do you keep it like in the area you want it to be without it looking sort of odd and protruding? So, the art of fillers and fat grafting is is really truly an art. Um, you know, it's there's depth of placement. you know, replacing it in the prepario layer to emulate as if it were a a larger bone structure. Um, if you're trying to hide jowlling, then you might put it into the muscle layer because you're trying to plump up the valley next to the hill so that it becomes smoother looking. Um, so those are some of the choosing the right choosing the right filler, choosing the right filler.

[02:21:12] Is fat always a superior filler? Not not necessarily. I do like fat because it's your own living tissue and of course it has those stem cells in it that can become multiple different types of tissue. So if you place it at the perryostial level it can build bone. If you put it in fat it becomes fat and if you put it along muscle it can turn into muscle and if you put it um under the skin it enhances how the skin ages. So something anecdotally that there are many of us that do a lot of fat grafting and we were on a panel one day talking about it before we knew about the stem cells being in the fat. We're talking 15 20 years ago and we're talking about the fat grafting patients and how they all uniformly look like they just age better and their skin ages better and now realize it's all of that. Yeah. Um where do you harvest from? the the most po uh like numerous areas of uh podiposices I should say the tissue that has the most priiposices is the abdomen so subcutaneous abdomen but I really like the flanks because it turns out you don't just want the fat and the fat stem cells you need all the connective tissue stem cells as well and when you go to the flanks the reason the flanks feel so firm even though they may have fat in them is they have a lot of septe and steral tissue there. And when you aspirate the fat, you're also aspirating along with it some of that stromal tissue. So you're getting the matrix and the scaffolding cells that will help that fat also repopulate.

[02:22:46] And just to give me a sense of volume, so if you if you decided to go full bore on somebody and do temporal and eye and you know outside of the lip and jaw, you you're how much fat are you putting in and how much fat and tissue do you need to harvest to acquire the necessary volume? So we may differ in our techniques. So, I'll let Tanish speak to his. Um, I will typically harvest about 120 cc's of fat. So, we're talking about an area about the size of a small can.

[02:23:13] And just just to put that in perspective, if if a person under goes lipos suction, how much is being harvested? Probably um so usually we're filling canisters of liters liters. Okay. So, this is 2, three, four liters of so make a material difference in your subcutaneous fat depot in your body. Correct. And if we artistically do it, we can take it from both sides so that you don't have any divots or asymmetries. But people always have an asymmetry even on their body. So I tell them, you know, the benefit of this is

[02:23:43] I'm taking also the fat and evening you out with your other hip and they're like, "Oh, I never even knew I was asymmetric." So I typically harvest about 120 cc's and then we centrouge it. Yep. And it condenses it down. So it takes off all the anesthetic fluid you put in. And we have albumin in there to to restore some of the encodic pressure as well. And we are taking people's own

[02:24:05] PRP spinning that spinning their blood down to get the PRP the platelet rich plasma and adding that in along with something that we call nanop fat. So it turns out if you take fat and you graft it into tissue a certain percentage will take. But if you take fat and then you add in extra stem cells more of that tissue will take. So what we do is we harvest extra fat and extract the nanofat from that meaning all the podiposytes by running it through some meshes and adding that back in to supplement the fat patient everything the PRP all of that okay how does your protocol differ from that very similar remarkably um and and and full disclosure when I was coming through training in 2005 to 2007 finishing up my fellowships I spent a lot of time listening to Dr. Oaji's talks at conferences. So my fat transfer technique has basically mirrored hers for for quite some time. Um I probably do a little less harvesting, a little less injecting because most of my fat grafting is being done in conjunction with a facelift or an upper and lower eyelid surgery called blroplasty. So when I'm surgically manipulating the tissues, I'm lifting and moving tissues.

[02:25:22] And so I I I'm not in need of as much volume to make the change that that we're looking for, but very similar overall. Okay. That gets to the eyelid problem. You alluded to a procedure that lifts the eyelids. Um and doing so presumably makes you require less these frontalus muscles. Yeah. So, uh, do I need are my eyelids a problem? So, um, the short answer is at this point you would probably qualify for your insurance company to cover your upper eyelid surgery because that's how droopy they are. Holy crap. They're sitting on your eyelashes. Yes. Now, I mean, this is hilar I had no idea how how bad I was. Now, we're not saying you're bad.

[02:26:07] No, no, no. But like if you're telling me insurance would cover a cosmetic procedure in me, if we did a visual field test on you where you relax your forehead muscles and you were required to look straight ahead and kind of hit a button every time you saw a light flash in your peripheral field and we did the same test with your eyelids taped up, you'd probably have a 30% difference in your peripheral. So this could be affecting my driving probably. you're probably finding yourself having to like look a little harder at your blind spot because of that. Now, it becomes a very complicated issue. One of the most common things that we'll see in our practice here in

[02:26:44] Austin um is that patients will come in and say, "I think I need to have my eyelids done." And then we say, "Yes, but and the thing is people don't realize that the face is not isolated into individual pieces of anatomy. your eyelid is connected to your eyebrow which is connected to your forehead. So, if we're going to do an upper eyelid surgery because you're constantly lifting your forehead muscle to be able to see better, your brain's compensating for this this pathology. Um, if we do an upper bluffroplasty, whether it's insurance or cosmetic or whatever, all of a sudden that visual field will improve and your frontalus muscle will automatically relax and your brow will come down and it'll create a new problem that you didn't know you had. And so these are some of the conversations we have to have with patients that maybe we leave you alone unless you're also ready to have your forehead lifted or at least have what we call a medical brow lift with Botox. So you know muscles pull the eyebrows up, muscles pull the eyebrow down. If you preferentially uh inject Botox into the depressor muscles which are here and here, naturally the tone of the frontalis will lift the forehead a little bit even without wrinkles showing. And so so I'll tell patients look if we do an upper lid surgery that'll be fine but we either have to commit to regular use of Botox to keep your eyebrows in check or we have to do a brow lift at the same time.

[02:28:18] And if you're not ready for that, where's the incision for the brow lift? Do you do it through the same incision? I would say that when it comes to designing surgeries there, what I what I train my fellows and residents is that there is no single surgery. Every single surgery is totally customdesigned for the individual patients anatomy. There's general patterns we use, but we should always infinitely manipulate the procedure to achieve the goal of what we're trying to do artistically. In your case, it's complex because someone who doesn't have hair, we usually would hide incisions behind the hairline. Yep. Um, it is possible for you to have an endoscopic forehead reset kind of procedure and we would make the incisions further back and smaller and it'll be a more technically challenging procedure, but there's a way to lift the forehead with incisions that would not be socially visible. And then those incisions can be closed in such a way that as time goes by especially with post postsurgical you know treatments like micro needling with fifllor uricil and topical treatments that you can get those scars to become what I call socially invisible which I mean it just to me seems like I could never commit to that much work. You know what I mean? So does that mean I'm just stuck with eyes? So then then in the conversation with a patient what we would come to probably in your case is okay we can do a blroplasty which is an upper lid surgery but we're going to undertreat you do less than what you think you need. It's not going to make a huge shift but on the other hand we also don't want to change the entire relationship neurologically that your your frontalis muscle has with your eyelid. So that you know we by by taking a patient through all the potential pathways they sometimes recognize they can't get what they thought they were coming for and we're going to undertreat them. So we avoid a potential problem.

[02:30:14] And similar things happen with the undereye area. So you know your under eye area is pretty complex too because you do have bulging fat visible in the undereye area which by the way is exactly the same contour that you had when you're 20. It's just become unveiled because you've lost volume and the cheek has descended and now we're looking at the orbital retaining ligament and the malar ligament. So this line right here corresponds to when you're looking at a skeleton and there's a big circles where the eyes are supposed to be. This is that bottom half of the circle where the ligament is sticking down. So if you put your finger on the skin right below an eye bag, you'll be touching the edge of your orbital rim bone right there. And so in from my standpoint, you know, if we're going to do something that is definitive to treat that, it's going to also have to treat the volume issue in your cheek.

[02:31:03] It's also going to have to address some of the skin textural issues in the region. And then sometimes some people have an issue where there's a triangle that catches between the orbital rim which is that hollow we were talking about in the under eye area and another line that exists in the cheek a little bit lower and it creates a triangle where fluid can can collect. So I don't know if you've noticed that but you've got that little triangle right here on both sides and um that area is called a marar mound. It's kind of like a sponge under the skin. It collects fluid. It's worse in the mornings because we're laying flat and we have a little more edema in our face. If you've had salty food the night before, it'll kind of puff up a little more. People will use preparation H. Uh this is a time-tested kind of, you know, u home remedy to try to shrink down that swelling that's present there. So, but this would have to be part of what's addressed if we were going to address your under eyes.

[02:31:59] And if we were going to do something to address your under eyes, um it's it would be something that would reduce the bulk of the bag, fill volume in the cheek, smooth the skin out, and address that mailor mound. And so this is a common maneuver of what we would do in our practice, which is we would under anesthesia make a hidden incision behind the eyelid and take those eyelid fat pads that are making that bag and create a pocket down in front of the cheekbone where the volume loss is occurring and where the ligaments are showing their hollowing and then move that fat down.

[02:32:36] That's called a transposition lower bluffroplasty. So, one of the big changes that's happened in aesthetic surgery from 1995 to now is back in the old days of cosmetic surgery, there was a lot of cutting fat out, cutting skin out to make eyelids look tighter, cutting skin in front of the ears to tighten the face, doing surgeries that mostly remove tissue. And now we're becoming much more sophisticated where we're actually manipulating the ligamentous attachments to the bone. And so because we're recognizing the ligament, you don't have to remove the skin necessarily. You don't have to remove as much. Yes. And so so if you do, you can tighten it with lasers and peel. Yes. Rather than cutting it out.

[02:33:18] So, so you know just to kind of um conclude what the suggestion would be for some of with your kind of anatomy, we would transpose the fat which would two birds one stone reduce bulk here, add volume here, three birds actually because it would basically eliminate the visibility of the ligament because there's fat under it now which is pushing it forward. Um and then um we would do something to improve the skin as Susan said, either a laser resurfacing or a chemical peel. And then there's a new technique that we're using where we're injecting tetracycan into areas of swelling of the face. So this is pretty cutting edge. You know, it's been around for several years now and we've got pretty good experience with this technique. But tetracycline is an old drug that was repurposed by the pulmonologists to address pulmonary issues where they want the the the plura to stick to the lining better. And because it has that property of um you know basically creating fibrous attachments, it can be used to shrink that sponge down by injecting delicately into the mail or mound to kind of flatten it. And so that would be the constellation of procedures. And what can go wrong here? Because you know I think for many people that would be contemplating something like this you know it's one thing if you are are having a procedure where you you know well first off this is a cosmetic procedure. So so out of the gate a it's not essential b if you don't look better when it's done it's it's the worst possible outcome and then c it's the most visible part of your body. You know, I've heard stories of women who have breast augmentations where they have complications and you know, at least the breasts aren't always visible, meaning the actual skin itself. Um, so even if you have to reoperate and it creates another scar, um, you know, it's only visible to her partner, right? Um, but but here it's just the highest stakes game. So, how do you navigate complications, risks, and mitigation strategies? And that's what we were talking about before. You have to make sure that whoever is doing your treatments a is well trained, qualified to do the injections and can manage the complications because everyone's going to have complications. You we've had complications. I'm speaking for me. I'm sure you've seen this. You can't treat patients and then not do enough cases to not have a complication. But there are some really notable complications that are vision threatening or tissue threatening. So when you're treating around the eyes for example or even into the temples, there are reported instances of stroke and death and vision loss and including treating around the nose because all of these vessels interconnect with the internal corateed system. So anywhere you inject a filler and you get into a vessel on the outside of the skin, you can create an embolism.

[02:36:17] You can create an embolism and it's going to go follow the path of least resistance once you bolus it into the tissue. It's going to backflow, but then it's going to be pushed forward again. It's going to go to the opthalmic artery. It may go into your central nervous system, I'm sorry, into your brain, I should say, and the vasculature there and create a stroke. Now, some of the more serious strokes were caused by people injecting fat with needles, but all these other complications really come from injecting fillers in this kind of central face area. So, there is a technique, there's knowledge of the anatomy, there's knowledge of um how to do to do very little pressure um aspirate where you need to aspirate depending on the filler you're using and watching the tissue looking for signs of any kind of embolis that's forming. Now, what about the the the obviously less consequential but but still troubling side effects where hey, the person doesn't have a good cosmetic outcome.

[02:37:12] So, they didn't have a stroke, they're alive, their vision is fine, but they don't look better, something went wrong. What would go wrong? What are the things that go wrong here? I would say the most common um types of complications that we'll see either, you know, I I will any surgeon will have complications. I've had complications, but we all in in our practices and in my practice, I will see a lot of patients referred in with complications where we have to try to identify how to improve a bad outcome.

[02:37:38] So, the most common reasons why bad outcomes occur in the world of cosmetic surgery, and you're right, the stakes are high, is because either the wrong procedure was done, which is much more common than than one might expect, um, or there was a technical issue where the surgery wasn't done correctly. So, those are the most common causes. Now, you know, I will certainly have patients where I will do my very best and one side will be a little asymmetric and 6 months after surgery, we might have to go to the procedure room to do a minor touchup to kind of enhance things.

[02:38:14] That's one level of of a problem. But when it comes to the more substantial disfiguring situations where people have had have been quoteunquote botched is the word people like to use for that. Um it's usually the wrong procedure was done or it wasn't done well. And I think that that is a very scary topic for listeners to be thinking about if they're even considering going down the pathway of rejuvenation or some sort of plastic surgery procedure on their face.

[02:38:43] And it can it can be very confusing because you're getting so much information from marketing and social media and physicians who perform cosmetic procedures are are advertising and and and showing their best before and afters. And so how does someone figure out how how to navigate this? And I would say probably the best advice that we could give someone who's thinking about going down this pathway is you got to take the narrative into your own hands. You have to understand your own anatomy. You have to do a deep dive in understanding some of the techniques, not some all the techniques that are available to address the issues that are your particular concern. And that might require multiple consultations. It might require choosing good resources online which are usually society websites. So the American

[02:39:35] Academy of Dermatology, the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery, um ASPS, which is the plastic surgery society, th these society websites will have accurate information on procedures and you should avoid getting secondhand information from people you know or from social media. But you got to do your homework. You have to learn the anatomy.

[02:39:55] You have to understand your own situation and your choices that are available to you. And then it's kind of like analogous to dating and marriage. How do you know when it's the right person? You just know, you know? I mean, how's Let's go deeper into that. So, if you were walking into um if if I if I said, "Hey, I'm going to introduce you to my friend um and and she's going to go and sit down with a surgeon." um you're not going to do the procedure on her, even though you'd be fully qualified to do it, and she's not going to you're not going to do the procedure, but I want you to be her advocate while she sits in the consultation room. And you can tell her what questions to ask, and you can help her interpret the results, but your your job is to help her find the best doctor.

[02:40:44] What are the questions you're asking? And what are the red flags you're looking for? And what are the green flags that are making you say I like and trust this person? I think it's starts with your rapport with the patient too. You can quickly get a sense with the doctor you're working with if you and he or she can see eye to eye in terms of what you're seeing, what they're seeing, how knowledgeable they are describing the procedures that they're suggesting for you. Does it make sense? you know, did do you really, for example, if they're telling you you need a brow lift? Is that and you've seen several other people and no one mention a brow lift, maybe you need to think about why did this person mention a brow lift and the other ones didn't? Or if everyone says you need a brow lift and one person says you don't, you have to figure out and go back and look in the mirror and try to understand what they're trying to point out to you as to what makes sense from that standpoint. Is it a comprehensive approach or are they just attacking basically the issue that you have that you're bothered by? I think people should take a comprehensive approach and just at least get that information even if they don't act on all of that. The person evaluating you should give you an overall look at everything just like we tanoj did just like I did addressing all the different areas that maybe you didn't even know to ask about and on top of that understanding their strong suit. I don't do rhinoplasties. If I start telling a patient I'm going to do a rhinoplasty on them, they should run. They should ask me what how often are you doing this?

[02:42:17] What are your complication rates? What is the retreatment rate? How happy are your patients with this procedure? So, to everything I do, I can show them my before and afters. I can tell them this is um and I show them multiple, for example, a facelift. I'll show them different faces because everyone has a different shaped face. You can't do the same get the same result depending on their anatomy. So, I'll show them different things. I'll say, "Now, this one looks more like your neck and your jawline. This is kind of the result you can hope to get." And I tell them the complications in my hands. I tell them the overall complications, but I tell them in my hands, this is what I see.

[02:42:52] And it's one of the challenges. By the way, that's exactly what I tell people in general when they're interacting with with surgeons is um it's one thing to know the complication rate when you're getting a colonoscopy. It's another thing to know their complication rate and their patient population because it's not always the case. For example, if you're having cardiac surgery, a low complication mate rate isn't always a great thing. It might mean low complexity, right? So anyway, it gets more complicated. Anything you would add to that, Tenuj, as far as like questions that they should be asking or red flags or green flags. Sure. Yeah, I think um I agree completely there with what Susan said and you know maybe some additional things to add which um you know some of these things matter more than others but

[02:43:35] I think you know having had the right training and board certification is one level that should be met the whoever is doing your procedure should have board certification in the specific thing that they're addressing. Yes. Yes. And then so so sorry just interrupt for eyes what percentage of people doing eye procedures like a lift a blroplasty would be oculoplastics trained is that a rare thing is that uncommon or common it's the most common procedure that an ocoplastic surgeon would do prior but how many nonoculoplasticians would do that procedure? A lot. A lot.

[02:44:12] Yeah. So, so you know, in 2025, there's so much more overlap that's happening than what used to exist because um each field that has an aesthetic aspect to it. We're talking about dermatology, plastic surgery, ENT, ofthmology, or maxyl facial surgery. These are the most common specialties that have an aesthetic overlap. The aesthetic focus in these training programs has dramatically ramped up in the last 20 years where part and parcel of these training programs include aesthetic surgery. Um, but in addition to all those birth certifications, I think that experience matters. What's the minimum number of procedures you want to see done by the practitioner in a year to say, "Yep, you've got enough reps." You know, it really depends on the procedure. Okay. for a rhinoplasty, something like that. For a rhinoplasty, you're going to want to have someone who's at least doing 25 a year. Okay?

[02:45:10] For a facelift. For a facelift, you want someone who's doing at least 25 a year. But I think it also is going to matter how many other procedures they do, too. Cuz like someone who's doing face and body might be doing a lot of body liposuction. So, they're doing faceelifts, but they're doing also body lipo, maybe they're doing eyes, all of that. So, do you want generalists or do you want specialists? Do you want people who are like if you if you're going to get something done to your face, my intuition, which could be entirely incorrect, is I don't care. I don't want them doing breasts and butts and lipo.

[02:45:41] Like I want them to be maniacally focused on the thing that I want them to do to me. Is that a fair? In my practice, I do five things for example, but I do those five things a lot. Yeah. But I don't do only one. So, and you don't do only one even though your ocular plastics and your facial plastics as well though. Yes. Yes. So I I generally agree with what you're saying is that um you know I don't do any body surgery. So I'll refer that all out to people who specialize in that and most people who do body cosmetic surgery will focus on body cosmetic surgery because facial cosmetic surgery is a different animal altogether. Um and so I think that that kind of specialization matters. Um, and you know, look, I was a young surgeon once and certainly, you know, going to a surgeon who's right out of training can be fine for, you know, a limited isolated procedure, but, you know, I'm I'm sorry to the young physicians in the audience, but a few years of training is usually helpful in building your repertoire and experience to be able to handle complications. And you know, sophisticated listeners would probably naturally end up choosing more experienced surgeons for that reason.

[02:46:52] Um, and you know, I think another important thing, um, is that this is a creative, uh, specialty we're talking about. And so, um, you want to choose someone who is evolving and moving with the times and preferably is helping to advance that edge of medicine. That means that they're constantly thinking and questioning and improving their results and not resting on laurels and not stagnating in one particular way of performing a procedure. Um I think that's a very very important aspect of trying to identify. So in that sense do academics because you would normally not associate uh cosmetic surgery with an academic affiliation. You would normally say well I get it if I have an oncologic issue. there's an advantage to being in an academic setting because of the research and because of the affiliation with the other branches of oncology etc.

[02:47:47] You can come up with some but but um you know you don't always think that way about about uh people doing cosmetic surgery but what you're saying would probably fit more uh neatly into the box of someone with an academic affiliation. Right. I agree. And the interesting thing about aesthetic surgery is that it's a little bit of the black sheep in the world of medicine. So academic cosmetic surgery, academic plastic surgery is different from the traditional sense of what academic might mean. So um in the world of facial aesthetics, you can have a single surgeon in private practice, no university affiliation, who is 100% academic because they are publishing.

[02:48:31] They're going to meetings, they're lecturing, they are helping to move the dial in the artistic world of what we're doing in in facelifts or eyelid surgeries or brow lifting. Um, and it it might be someone who's at university full-time, but it doesn't have to be. And that's very unique to aesthetic surgery. I also think that the universities don't support their aesthetic doctors. So, a lot of times universities cannot figure out a model that works for them to profit share or to find a compensation model for an aesthetic doctor that's appealing to them to make them not go into private practice. So they end up shortch changing themselves and then the doctors leave and they go into private practice.

[02:49:13] Whereas I think if you can get the universities to wrap their head around how to build out a really strong academic practice like we did in our with our university at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. We were rare. We were one of the first in the nation to purposely build an academically based cosmetic surgery practice with the intention of training plastic surgery residents if they want to rotate ocular plastics, facial plastics, dermatology residents and people from I mean it makes a lot of sense because of the amazing overlap between surgery in general especially oncologic surgery and reconstruction right like if you think about it every time a woman underos a mastctomy she should be immediately plugged into a plastic surgeon to if nothing else make sure that that reconstruction is as uh cosmetically pleasing as possible. And then you think about all the head and neck cancers and things like that.

[02:50:06] There's there's a there's a clear incentive. Maybe incentive is the wrong word. Just if nothing else, a business case to be made for better patient care with the integration of that type of service. The universities can't see that though. The problem is they think it's a one-sizefits-all and they don't understand the differences. Like for example, your cosmetic practice has to have a more aesthetic look. It's going to cost them more to build it out.

[02:50:30] They're going to need the devices. They need investments. And it's really hard to get some of these universities to to see that. You have to work with them and become your own business manager, for example, and propose to them a business plan, return on investment, all of that. But but practically speaking for the listeners uh you know if you're trying to find someone to help you on a path in this category of aesthetic surgery finding someone who is um speaking at conferences teaching involved in the cutting edge of medicine that I think that's that's definitely a qualification. I think another thing that you mentioned earlier is a qu maybe asking them how often they are receiving complications and managing them. that's probably a sign of skill and seniority in the field if you're kind of the person who's and again it's not about calling out who those complications belong to but it's hey you know uh I'm so okay so last we we've we've talked for a lot longer than I thought we we uh we would but I I'm sorry if we can get you to hold on for a minute longer we can't get out of this podcast without me understanding the difference between lasers micro abrasions micro needling chemical peels. I can't understand any of these things. But you mentioned resurfacing. You mentioned my skin sucks. So clearly before I go on the path of my rejuvenating uh anti-aging protocol, I might as well do something to fix the situation we have going on here. And um so tell me about all these different techniques. We could do a crash course. I know this podcast is running long, but it's just a massive subject to cover. Let's start with lasers. What I mean I I mean could we take one step back maybe and talk about the difference between ablative and non-ablative and maybe talk about peels.

[02:52:21] So, so maybe maybe the way to go is there are various technologies that will in a controlled manner injure the skin to harness the body's natural healing cascade which then will produce the aesthetic benefits we're looking for, which is more collagen production, smoother skin, you know, less pigment issues. And that's the goal, right? And so the bottom line is there's there's a relationship with how aggressive the treatment is and how much of an aesthetic improvement you're going to get. But the more aggressive it is, the more downtime there is. So that's all that's always the kind of balancing act.

[02:53:01] And that's why there's such a confusing array of options that exist because there's a huge spectrum going from the least invasive with which has the least result to the most aggressive with the best result. And so I guess to generalize, there are treatments that are not truly ablative, meaning they're going to penetrate through the skin, and then there are treatments that are.

[02:53:26] Shall I I think hopefully I set that up for you, Susan, to maybe go from there. So that's the definition. Ablative means it penetrates the skin. No. Oh, yes. Ablative, yes. And non-ablative, not doesn't penetrate the skin. So what are the non-ablative which are presumably the less severe which means shorter recovery time less overall response. So non-ablative things you can start with even your topical skinincare regimen because that is going to remodel the skin and set the stage for you to even prime it so you make more collagen and then you can do things such as light chemical peels which are only going to affect the epidermis of the skin. You can do things like non-ablative fractional lasers and those are going to again send tiny fractionated beams of light onto the very surface of the skin and just damage the upper layers of the epidermis and that's going to stimulate a cascade of cytoines to build on the collagen and texture but it's going to be minor and they might help with some minor pigmentation issues. Those are um non-ablative devices for resurfacing.

[02:54:33] What was the last one? Not fractional non non-ablative fractional lasers. We also have non-ablative vascular lasers. Those are lasers that are going to penetrate with a beam of light to hit the dilated blood vessels and people who have rosacea. And what's the brand name on one of a nonablative fractional?

[02:54:52] Fraal or clear and brilliant? Okay. Those Yeah, there are different ones. So frail has multiple different ones. The clear and brilliant is just superficial. And then you have non-ablative things like uh vascular laser that will help treat broken blood vessels, scars, texture change. And that one even though it's shattering some of the dilated blood vessels deep in the skin, it's not leaving an open wound on the surface. So when we say non-ablative, there might be things happening deep down, but the surface of the skin is intact. So there's no raw wound. We might want to pause on that category for one second just because that is probably the one of the most high yield areas for someone to try out as an initial kind of intervention at at a you know with a physician or provider because the downtime's easy. We're talking about non-ablative, you know, um like for example intense pulse light or broadband light which is IPL or BBL for short.

[02:55:52] Those are in the category that Susan just mentioned of non-ablative light treatments. And it's a huge, huge category. There are so many devices in this category that it would be kind of silly to even list them, but they're very effective in that they don't have a lot of downtime and produce improvements that are are real for patients. Sorry to interrupt. I just I thought we should just pause there for one sec.

[02:56:16] Absolutely. And I think a lot is another non-ablative. So, I'd have to look and see what the technology on Moxy is. Okay. If it's I if I'm not mistaken, I think that one might be radio frequency micro needling. I think that's right. Yeah. Yes. So, that one kind of bridges the gap a little bit. It depends. It is semi-ablative because you're literally piercing the skin with a bunch of needles. Got it. And delivering radio frequency energy through those needles.

[02:56:45] Um and those will stimulate collagen. So anything that generates heat in the skin to a certain level will to a certain temperature I should say will then cause the formation of something called heat shock protein and that causes a whole cascade of other activity within the dermis of the cells the dermis of the skin to make you produce collagen elastin shrink the overactive sebaceous glands and reduce some of the dilated blood vessels. So there is a lot of benefit beyond just treating the vascule that you see. So I tell patients like for example if we treat their rosacea and they get improvement after two or three sessions they should come every year and repeat it even if their rosacea is quiet because it really does help with anti-aging. And so from that standpoint those are your non-ablative.

[02:57:33] And then if we go to ablative we've got deeper chemical peels. We've got the modified TCA peels. We've got modified phenol peels. And then we have our ablative and abl. So we don't need to worry about brand names at this point. We're really talking to the practitioner and saying, "Do we want to move into an ablative peel? I'm going to get a better result, but I'm going to have a greater downtime and presumably I need to do it less frequently." Yes. And that's exactly it. What you said is key. I think the big mistake is to come in and say, "Oh, all my friends are having

[02:58:05] Moxy. I want Moxy." Let's let's talk about what it is. we might have something that does similar results or maybe even something that does better results and del maybe it's not the right choice for you even though your friend thinks you should get it and so the the field is so confusing to consumers and honestly even practitioners because it's a gold rush right there's so much money to be made in this area every company is is getting private equity money and and and getting an FDA approval for some kind of device because they want a piece of the action and they're purposefully confusing everybody because it's like snake oil, you know, everybody wants to sell their product and some of the products work well, some don't. Any products you think people should just absolutely avoid just based on lack of efficacy? No, but

[02:58:53] I do caution my younger patients, the ones who are under the age of 40, even up to 45 in some cases, to really avoid doing things such as ultrasound tissue tightening, radio frequency tissue tightening at that young of an age because there is some fat atrophy that happens and I would caution against prematurely aging their face. Yeah, I agree. I mean, those are the categories that are probably have the most hoopla with the least effect. Yeah. Um is ultrasound based energy. And look, I mean, there once was a time where that was the only non-surgical option for tightening the neck, but it didn't do a great job. And most people have left it by the wayside. Uh I like it though in addition to a bio stimulatory filler. So you inject a little sculpture under the skin and then you come over it with a synergistic properties can exist for those devices. And that's what I was going to say is, you know, if you know your physics with all these devices, you can achieve so much with your lasers beyond what the company tries to sell you. How do you then decide? I understand why I understand the fork in the road between ablative and non-ablative, but like let's say once you commit to an ablative therapy, how are you deciding between a chemical peel, a laser, a micro needle? And I vaguely remember my wife telling me something or overhearing her and her friends saying that if um if you had mealasma you couldn't do this one but you could do this one. What are some of the dos and don'ts as you navigate that?

[03:00:23] So I think um there there are a lot of nuances to this conversation but to generalize a little bit um chemical peels are generally safe for all skin tones generally. Um, laser resurfacing, a blade of laser resurfacing can be riskier for higher Fitzpatrick skin types that have more pigmentation because the melanin the melanin cells are sitting deeper in the skin. And the deeper the laser goes, the more it can create permanent injury to pigment cells and create permanent pigment problems.

[03:00:57] Whereas the chemical peels, you can control that depth a little differently. And and so that's one I would say generalization uh that that's probably worth mentioning. I would not I should not do a laser peel because I'm a you can have a laser, but you're the kind of person who needs a lot of preparation and caution heading into it. You would need to probably get onto a regimen to control your pigment cells with hydro.

[03:01:20] Why would I bother? Like why take the risk? Why not just could be better? I see. So, so I guess just to complete the conversation about the the different categories, the most effective uh non-surgical skin interventions are in the category of a blade of lasers and phenol peels because they go the deepest and TCA. I'm going to have to throw that in there.

[03:01:42] TCA. Sure. The deep TCA. Deept TCA peels are something that should be done by someone who really knows what they're doing. Yeah. And I And so going to your point, how do I choose? Sometimes on the same patient, I'll do all three. So on most of their face, I may do a medium-depth TCA peel. Especially because I can get the ears, I can get into the brows, I can feather onto the neck, into the hairline, so I don't leave any area unresurfaced. And the medium depth peels are going to go just to the level of what's called the papillary dermis, which is the sweet spot for tissue tightening. And peels of that sort, and this is TCA or phenol,

[03:02:17] TCA. And these peels penetrate and they percolate into pores. So I love peels for large pores and they'll you'll see the solution sit in the pores and they'll just go a little bit deeper just in those pores and as the tissue heals they'll contract. Then I may take a patient who has very deep peroral lines and use my fractionated ablative CO2 laser on those. And then someone with redundant skin on the lower eyelids, I may take my phenol peel and apply it there. So, in one sitting, the patient might have all three. I'm going to pick and choose where I do it. In some patients, I may, depending if they don't want an eye lift, or I did an eye lift on them a number of years ago and they're just starting to get redundant skin, I may just ablate that tissue with either my laser or the phenol peel and get a mini eyeelift again. That might buy them two or three more years. And what is the downtime from an ablative intervention?

[03:03:16] You know, again, every treatment is customized to the patient, so it can vary. But in general, um, a patient who's going to have an ablative CO2 laser, which I would say is sort of the relative gold standard for, um, an ablative laser is going to have 7 to 10 days of requiring an occlusive dressing with, you know, some kind of ointment.

[03:03:38] Um, so that's that's, you know, some real downtime there. Um and then in weeks um from from weeks one to three, their skin will be transitioning and epithelializing. They'll start to return to normal activities, but they'll still scare children at a at a grocery store for 3 weeks because they'll be red, a lot of redness and swelling still. Um and then beyond three weeks, they can use concealer, which we actually encourage them to do because it's a built-in UV protection also. um and they can kind of get back to life. But without makeup on, some people can have redness for months. Um and again, expect this person to do this procedure. How often? This might be once every 5 or 10 years to have a full ablade of CO2 laser. Um is it uncomfortable?

[03:04:25] If they're awake, it can be. Um these can be done under some sedation. Uh it's also quite common these days to have these done with um a nitrous delivery device. So there are now FDA approved devices that mix oxygen and nitrous so that it can be done in the office without an anesthesiologist because they're getting 50% oxygen but yet they're getting the benefit of the nitrous as well. Laughing guess.

[03:04:48] Exactly. Yes. I I mean that sounds absolutely unappealing. I also painted the picture of the most aggressive skin laser that we do and of course it can be dialed down like if a patient has a certain time frame in mind I I'll tell them all right so what would I do so I can't go a week off I mean a week offline would be tough doable but tough but certainly 3 weeks four weeks offline not an option so one thing that is is useful information is that some of the lasers that are still ablative but are dialed down in their intensities So now we're talking about fractionated lasers at lower intensity. They can have a downtime that's a week or less, more or less. And then it's not going to produce the same results, but the effects stack over time. So if you committed to doing a a light herbium laser, and the reason why I'm talking about herbium laser instead of a CO2 laser is because the herbium lasers tend to burn with a little less heat, thermal injury, and so the recovery is a little bit faster. Um, if you committed to doing this once a quarter, oh my god, as time goes by, you would get a similar effect to the full blade of CO2 laser that you can do in one sitting. So, and

[03:06:02] I would also say you can manipulate other things. So, like we'll take a clear and brilliant laser and apply a light chemical peel solution on top of that the same day. So, two non-ablative therapies. Correct. And then you get like three or four days of peeling and then you're done. And someone like you, because you're a male, you're thick, you have thicker skin, you need us to push it a little more than just what the clear and brilliant will do or the light peel by itself. But synergistically, they can have a nice effect. And over time, there will be cumulative improvement in your skin, especially if you follow your home regimen. But what I would tell people like you, Peter, is that really think about it hard and embrace this investment in yourself because you do everything else right.

[03:06:46] You eat, you exercise, you watch the sun. It's much much better to do this now at your age than to wait five or 10 more years and say, "I wish I had done it." Because at that point, what you need might be a lot more drastic. And to maybe bring this full circle, Susan, um, I know we're concluding the podcast here now. Um, you know, beauty and aesthetics is an integral part of being human and that's why we're even having this conversation because people really want to know how to um navigate this world of aesthetics and choosing to make changes that are appropriate for your situation will has the potential of increasing quality of life. Um, you know, humans as we age and we live longer and longer and longer, you may have someone who's 60 or 70 years old who's following Peter Aia's regimen and you know, they're out there playing golf, living their marginal decade, you know, in the way they want to. But, um, they also they also care about their appearance. I mean, you've seen this, right, Susan? that I have patients who are 94 years old who are coming in for skin cancer reconstruction after mo surgery and you're not thinking at all about putting your aesthetic hat on. I'm now I'm a reconstructive surgeon. This, you know, 94 year old woman is terribly concerned about what it's going to look like afterwards. So that that desire for our to limit the the delta of the self-discre theory for ourselves continues until we're no longer on this planet.

[03:08:21] Well guys, thank you very much. This was um fantastic and honestly accomplished goal number one, which is I feel like I have a greater understanding of the solution space. Um again, I think I'm going to probably um have you guys send me a few links on some of the serums and cleansers. And I guess I need to get a prescription for some retina or steal my wife's. Um, I'll double check my sunscreen.

[03:08:52] Um, I know that my sunscreen that I use like when I'm going outside for prolonged periods of time, my Ulta MD is a good one. I don't think I have a good daily throw it on like just because I'm indoors even and I'm going outside for 5 minutes here and there. So, I need to double check on that. Um, so I think that's a win. I guess if I do nothing but commit to a daily skin routine, that's great. Um, I will admit this whole ablative, non-ablative skin thing has me a little shaken up and now reeling in the idea that I just don't know if I have the intestinal fortitude to go through with an ablative therapy.

[03:09:34] But maybe I start with some baby steps like two non-ablative therapies. Um, and then I think we're going to have to, you know, think about do I want to fix my face, right? How far down the rabbit hole do I want to go with uh with the with the under eyes, over eyes, and and all that stuff? But I but the point here is I think I've uh I have a better understanding and I hope that more importantly the people listening are able to see bits of themselves in me because I'm I think I'm not that uncommon in my problems. Um so hopefully they've been able to pick up on these things as well. So thank you very much guys. This was this was a different podcast nonetheless, but it was it was super interesting for me. Thank you.

[03:10:13] Thank you for having us. It was fun and we didn't mean to pick you apart. I I asked you to, so no, it was fully appreciated. Thanks, Peter. We appreciate the opportunity to be here and have this conversation. [Music]
