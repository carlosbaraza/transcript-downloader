## Description

Original release date: 9/10/2018

In this episode, Rob Lustig — a researcher, an expert in fructose metabolism, and a former pediatric endocrinologist — discusses what’s wrong with the current food environment, and what we can do to reduce our chances of becoming part of the obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) epidemics. Rob recently earned a Master of Studies in Law because he believes that educating people about sugar from a scientific standpoint is only half the equation: the other half involves changing policy, which he explains in this episode.

We discuss:
-What’s the difference between glucose and fructose? [7:00];
-Do we have biomarkers that can give us some indication of average exposure to fructose over a given period of time? [14:20];
-What’s the difference between ALT and AST? [18:45];
-Inflammation, endothelial function, and uric acid [21:30];
-Is there something that fructose does better than glucose? [23:45];
-For children that undergo a remarkable shift from metabolic health to metabolic derangement, is there a concern that these kids suffer an epigenetic hit that makes it harder for them later in life? [26:15];
-How many times do you have to introduce a savory food vs a sugary food to an infant before they will accept it? [29:30];
-How are alcohol and fructose similar in how they affect the brain? [33:51];
-Advice for parents and kids for creating a sustainable environment that’s going to prevent them from running into metabolic problems [40:30];
-Why do some populations have a higher risk of NAFLD? [45:42];
-What causes NAFLD? [48:45];
-Is insulin resistance the result of NAFLD or is NAFLD the result of insulin resistance? [56:00];
-HRV, cortisol, and norepinephrine [1:00:30];
-What are the actual mechanisms that links metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, fatty liver, and type 2 diabetes? [1:03:00];
-Is the food industry still saying that all calories contribute equally to adiposity and insulin resistance? [1:09:00];
-What is the difference between soluble and insoluble fiber and why do you need both? [1:13:00];
-How can we change the food system when 10 companies control almost 90 percent of the Calories we consume in the US? [1:15:00]; and
-More.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast with Dr. Robert Lustig:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Robert Lustig, a pediatric endocrinologist and expert on sugar metabolism, discussing the relationship between processed foods, fructose, and metabolic disease. The conversation focuses heavily on the biochemical differences between glucose and fructose, the role of fiber in diet, and the mechanisms behind non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Dr. Lustig also discusses policy implications and potential solutions to the processed food crisis.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Fructose is metabolized differently from glucose and causes 7x faster protein glycation [10:45]
- Liver can only metabolize limited amounts of fructose due to specific transporters [16:00]
- De novo lipogenesis accounts for ~25% of liver fat [53:36]
- HRV (Heart Rate Variability) correlates with glucose levels and stress response [59:30]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:

- Ensure both soluble and insoluble fiber intake [40:40]
- Minimize added sugar consumption [40:00]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- Allopurinol mentioned for treating high uric acid [16:31]

5. **Nutrition & Diet**:
- Real food diets (Mediterranean, Paleo, etc.) work because they're unprocessed [44:08]
- Both soluble and insoluble fiber needed together for optimal benefits [40:40]
- Processed foods often contain hidden sugars [40:51]

6. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- ALT should be below 20 [26:57]
- Uric acid should be below 5.5 [27:30]

"A calorie is not a calorie" [1:14:42]

8. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What specific policy changes could most effectively reduce processed food consumption?
2. How can we make real food more accessible and affordable?
3. What role does gut microbiome play in fructose metabolism?

Would you like me to expand on any particular section?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD com

[00:00:40] in this episode I'll be speaking with my friend dr. Rob Lustig who I suspect a good number of you will have already heard of and certainly have been familiar with through his pretty impressive presence on YouTube and his talk called sugar the bitter truth that went viral I believe in 2011 and that's about the time when I met Rob now this podcast kind of grew out of a really interesting discussion that I think I get into in the podcast a little bit but I think it was in 2016 when Rob and I were both invited to Hong Kong to speak at the

[00:01:14] Credit Suisse Asian investment conference and we were on a panel together and it just so happened that we were in the same flight back to San Francisco which was not just a long flight but more importantly a flight where you weren't gonna be sleeping much and Rob and I ended up huddling together over a laptop going over some really interesting data on Nathalie which we'll get into in this podcast and I remember thinking like that just kind of left an impression in my mind which was god this is the kind of discussion I really enjoy having with people like Rob because it gets into the nuance and away from the headlines and obviously many years later forward fast forward to where we are now

[00:01:53] I'm starting the podcast one of the first people I wanted to reach out to was Rob to have this discussion Rob has very recently stepped down from his clinical responsibilities as a pediatric endocrinologist at UCSF however he still has a very active presence in his research department Rob holds a bachelor's degree from MIT he got his MD from Cornell and he also has a master's of studies in law from UC Hastings something that he did probably about four years ago as he began to realize that only one half of the equation in educating people about sugar was going to come from the scientific standpoint the other half was going to have to be policy related in this episode we talk about a lot of things but among them we talk about why

[00:02:33] Rob believes the food business has really pushed towards having more and more sugar in it and why these have led to the epidemics of addiction depression etc he talks also about how you can combat that and I think something that people miss in Rob's headlines is that he is not just talking about avoiding sugar he's also talking about the importance of fiber and we actually get into a very nice discussion about the differences between soluble and insoluble fiber and how it's actually not uncommon for people to load up too much through processed foods on the soluble fibers but they're not getting the full benefit without having the insoluble which is really stuff that's hard to get without looking towards real foods particularly vegetables this was really a fun podcast and I think that comes across and how often he unfortunately probably talk over each other so I apologize for that in advance it's also one of the first podcasts I record so I was still sort of and I'm still sort of learning the ropes of how to do this unfortunately Rob had to go to I believe to a deposition that morning and so we had a really hard stop that didn't give us nearly as much time as I think we would have spent on this topic but I do suspect that Rob and I will talk again we also get into some of the really I think kind of practical stuff around what does it like to be a parent when you're trying to balance the desire to you know let your kids be kind of normal and deal with the convenience of not making every meal something that requires a day of planning but how do you prevent them at the other end of that extreme from you know sort of mainlining those nasty Capri Suns and

[00:04:05] Wheat Thins and things like that so I think some practical advice there is helpful we do go really deep on fructose and there is some biochemistry in there it does get a little nerdy Rob can talk kind of fast and he really knows his stuff on this topic so he does not pull back from any of that terminology we're gonna do our best to link in the show notes to some of the definitions and some of the things in there that we get into that will give you a little bit of background we also get into liver function testing something that I think many people take for granted when they go to their doctor but it becomes really important when you're trying to screen out people who might have naphthyl d non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or nash it's more progressed sibling we talk about uric acid we talk about metabolic syndrome we just talk about a whole bunch of things including we talk about heart rate variability near the end and at the time

[00:04:53] Rob asked me a question I didn't know the answer to we have since learned the answer that question because I was really intrigued by the discussion and so for anybody who's interested in that little nuance on heart rate variability we're gonna link to that as well you'll be able to find a lot more information about this including information about

[00:05:09] Rob himself and what he's doing and also just the stuff that we talked about at Peter attea MD com forward slash podcast so without further delay here is my really interesting and intense discussion with dr. Rob Lustig all right Rob well thank you so much for making time today we've known each other for I think about six or seven years now and what made me think about talking to you at this point in the podcast which is to say very early on as I was thinking back to two years ago when we went to Hong

[00:05:44] Kong together and by sort of luck we ended up on the same flight back to San Francisco right and we were probably the two geekiest guys on the airplane cuz the last ones not sleeping right right and then the laptop came out and it was all data all flight and it was awesome and it's yes experiences like that that it made me think like a podcast can be a fun way to reproduce some of those discussions that I often find myself having and then thinking god I wish everybody could have heard that because

[00:06:13] I learned a lot during that time it's vice versa by the way and people wish they were flies on the wall so you know I'm happy to do this this is great awesome well you've spoken so much and so eloquently about sugar and fructose and certainly we're going to talk about a lot of that stuff today but I also want to talk about some things that I think are a little less understood for example the impact of fructose on inflammation and things well what data we have yeah by the way let me qualify while I do know a whole lot about sugar fructose you know metabolic disease really my issue is processed food processed food has several things wrong with it sugar being one of them but lack of fiber being another and I think that that is equally important and I'm very willing to talk about that issue as well perfect so let's start with a very brief set of the semantics that I think it's important for people to understand when they do confuse fructose and glucose they're both carbohydrates what's the difference well they're both monosaccharides glucose is the energy of life every cell on the planet burns glucose for energy glucose is so important to functioning in all eukaryotic organisms single cell versus multi cell doesn't matter it's so important that if you don't consume it your body makes it it can make it from amino acids it can make it from fatty acids called gluconeogenesis those amino acids or fatty acids will go to the liver the liver will metabolize those and produce glucose and so you can consume zero glucose but you will still have a blood glucose level the Inuit they didn't have any carbohydrate they didn't have anyplace to grow a carbohydrate they had ice they had whale blubber they still had a serum glucose level and we knew that as early as 1928 so glucose is super important and I don't argue that it's so important that your body has a fail-safe mechanism fructose however is completely vestigial to all animal life it is a storage form of energy in plants plants can utilize fructose for energy we have the capacity to metabolize a limited amount of fructose for energy really when you're consuming fructose your gut bacteria are more adept so they're plants at being able to metabolize that fructose than you are so when you're consuming fructose yes you will absorb some but the most part is actually more plant food than it is animal food in addition there are some very specific biochemical differences between the two molecules glucose is a six membered ring fructose is a five membered ring now that becomes important because both glucose and fructose and every monosaccharide exists in two forms one is called the ring form and the other one is called the linear form the linear form has the capacity to bind to proteins called the mired reaction it's what makes hemoglobin a1c and diabetics also known as the a Midori rearrangement this is a biochemical process that occurs normally it is the browning reaction it causes bananas to brown it causes humans to brown in fact we're all browning right now because our mitochondria in ourselves are engaged in the a Midori rearrangement it is what makes people age it is the aging reaction and I show a slide which shows newborn rib cartilage nice and white an 88 year old rib cartilage nice and brown okay we're all browning so you can roast your meat in an oven for 375 degrees for an hour or you can roast your meat at 98.6 degrees for 75 years ultimately the answer is the same you brown why do I bring this up because glucose causes that browning reaction at a relatively low rate fructose makes that reaction occur at seven times faster rate now this starts with this shift reaction correct so it forms a shift base okay so it starts with and it's non enzymatic it happens just in a test tube with no enzymes needed you just put it in the sunlight it will happen what happens is that the Alda

[00:11:07] Moya T of the glucose in the linear form will bind to an epsilon amino group of lysine which is at position 1 in hemoglobin and form a schiff base which then spontaneously decomposes to form a covalent linkage which won't come off and basically will stay there until that hemoglobin molecule is recycled by the spleen so this is why you can measure glucose levels through hemoglobin a1c is because the higher the glucose level in the blood the more this reaction occurs and therefore the higher the hemoglobin a1c turns out fructose does it 7 times faster and not only that every time it happens it's causing those proteins to become less flexible so less functional and every time it happens it throws off a reactive oxygen species in oxygen radical hydrogen peroxide which then can do damage unless it's quenched by an antioxidant so in the face of antioxidant deficiency which is called processed food it can actually cause inflammation and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and many other problems related to the inflammatory response so fructose does that seven times faster than glucose a third thing that is different is that when you put glucose in the stomach your hunger hormone called ghrelin goes down when you put fructose in the stomach it doesn't change so when you consume a lot of fructose your brain doesn't know you've eaten and so you end up consuming more and lastly glucose is metabolized in the brain the areas that basically metabolize glucose and give you a functional MRI signal are areas that have to do with the sensory motor cortex for the most part and for the basal ganglia fructose specifically lights up the reward center and has been now been shown to induce the same physiology in the brain that cocaine heroin nicotine alcohol any hedonic substance also Jen it is the reward signal and in fact we treat it as a reward signal it's called dessert so fructose and glucose are not the same the food industry would have you believe a calories a calorie a sugar is a sugar you need sugar to live those are all food industry mantras they're all out in the cyber sphere and in the blogosphere it is absolute garbage they are quite different and it does matter I want to go back to just something very minor that you mentioned I get asked this question all the time and I've never had a compelling answer but we use hemoglobin a1c as sort of a surrogate proxy for average glucose levels now I for reasons we won't get into today just for time I'm not particularly convinced hemoglobin a1c in an absolute sense provides great insight oh I agree on an a relative basis it can be somewhat helpful but at least directionally it's helpful within any given patient a lowering of a hemoglobin a1c from point

[00:14:20] A to point B would be a good thing I won't argue that so the question becomes do we have comparable biomarkers that can give us some indication of average exposure to fructose over a given period of time right awfully good question so fructose also binds to hemoglobin but it does not bind at position one therefore you don't measure it in hemoglobin a1c so it binds at positions 66 and 110 now the hemoglobin a1c assay is not set up to look at 66 and 110 this requires a major research lab it requires tandem mass spec it's a huge undertaking it's only done as a research tool and the only lab I know that does it is in Japan so that's not a rational thing to expect right now people are looking for long term biomarkers of fructose consumption and there have been several papers that have come out that are pointing to individual options but none have been put into clinical practice none have been shown to really validate consumption in a meaningful way so at this point in time we don't have that for consumption what we do have are some indirect measures of fructose shall we say bio toxicity yeah like uric acid or alt would be exactly those are the ones I was going to bring up exactly uric acid and lt so we know that the more sugar you consume the higher your serum uric acid goes and the more risk you have forget Benjamin

[00:16:00] Franklin knew that and wrote about it the reason that happens is because since fructose can only be metabolized in the liver because the liver has the glute 5 transporter every time a fructose molecule enters a liver cell it has to be phosphorylated so it goes from fructose to fructose one phosphate and the enzyme that does that is called fructose kinase well the phosphate has to be donated and ATP is the donor so

[00:16:31] ATP becomes a DP adenosine triphosphate becomes adenosine diphosphate now there is a scavenger enzyme in the liver called adenosine deaminase one and what it does is it then takes adp down to a MP mono phosphate then to iymp inositol mono phosphate and finally to uric acid so the uric acid concentration in the blood is a proxy for total fructose consumption now there are other things that make uric acid go up too like protein but all things being equal they do correlate with each other and we've shown that serum uric acid in children and adolescents correlate with sugar beverage consumption for instance and other people have shown that that uric acid matters because uric acid is the inhibitor of endothelial nitric oxide synthase that's an enzyme that exists in your vascular tree that vaso dilates the blood vessels and that keeps your blood pressure down and we have shown that every increase by 10% in fructose consumption increases your blood pressure by two millimeters of mercury consistently and that increases your risk of stroke by 10% we have data and it's also been shown by Dan Fayette UT San Antonio that if you give an inhibitor of uric acid synthesis allopurinol which is what we give to gout patients you can actually lower adolescence blood pressures when they have essential hypertension so this is a mechanistically valid problem and it is a surrogate proxy biomarker sort of for sugar consumption alt is also a surrogate marker in a similar way alt goes up when your liver stores fat what's the difference between I mean patients are sort of familiar with the difference between alt and ast but they both show up as liver function test but guys like you and I tend to spend a little more time looking at alt right so ast which is aspartate aminotransferase is a biomarker for mitochondrial function and alt is alanine aminotransferase and it is a biomarker for degree of liver fat so they're both important but in different ways ast is much more minute-to-minute like what did you eat that's your last meal alt is a little bit more shall we say stable over time so we tend to use alt however we've shown that when you cut sugar back ast changes so Jessie mitochondria or actually getting better and the range is on these things keep drifting upward for what people deem acceptable I tell my patients I want their alt below 20 and they say but Peter the range says up to 42 indeed this is huge and I'm glad you brought it up so I entered medical school in 1976 and at that time the upper limit for normal for alt was 25 now when we talk about upper limits for normal where do those calculations come from basically you take a bunch of quote normal people and you figure out the mean and you look at two standard deviations around the mean and that's how you decide what is normal so in 1976 twenty five was two standard deviations above the mean today forty years later forty is two standard deviations above the mean did something happen to the assay no something happened to us because now everyone has fatty liver disease in fact the Dallas Heart study showed that forty percent of normal people have hepatic steatosis liver fat well that makes your LT go up so what I say is 25 was the upper limit of normal 25 should still be the upper limit of normal despite what it says on the lab slip because that's just looking at two standard deviations above the mean so we use that very specifically in clinic to show parents and kids what is happening to them and why sugar is the bad guy because when we get them off sugar the alt drops within a month yeah and going back to the uric acid thing I was very influenced by the work of Rick Johnson and Rick has been always incredibly generous with his time and insights and deed you know one of the things I started doing probably about three years ago was just basically saying it's non-negotiable all my patients need a uric acid below 5 even though the assay says we will consider normal up to seven point zero exactly same issue so in clinic we basically said five point five as sort of the breakpoint so we're pretty close yeah alt at 25 uric acid of 5.5 you know we can argue about the we're within an order right now and in that point is the same and I think it's interesting because when we think about cardiovascular disease one of the things that the endothelial story gets overlooked a little bit the inflammation story is now getting its de based on this two very recent trials well one recent trial and one that was halted likely because of a significant improvement in the outcome of using methotrexate Piatt when you look at the impact of uric acid on nitric oxide synthase when you look at the impact of homocysteine on a symmetric dimethyl arginine which also then in turn inhibits nitric oxide synthase yep these things start to make a bit more sense which is we always kind of knew having high uric acid was bad and we always kind of knew having high homocysteine was bad but now we're seeing these mechanistic reasons why all of a sudden oh wow like that's a bad thing to have you know vasoconstriction in your coronary arteries I couldn't agree more the fact that matter is we didn't have the empirical data we always had the plausibility argument but we didn't know how important it was now we have the empiric data and we have interventional data to say that this phenomenon is quite important and it's not it's own phenomenon it is a another manifestation of this global phenomenon we call metabolic syndrome and when you look at it that way and say well if it's doing this what else is it doing all of a sudden things start piecing together you know it's like the puzzle you know and you sort of needed the piece in the middle to fit all the other things together to be able to tell what's really going on and your uric acid is part of that puzzle now Rob is there any situation under which fructose consumed in its natural state which is to say with water with fiber ie in fruit yeah poses an advantage over glucose because clearly glucose has many advantages in terms of how metabolically flexible like you know every organ can basically consume it you don't have a lot of these other negative reactions is there something that fructose does better than glucose yes one thing so if your liver is glycogen depleted for instance if you're a football player three hours on the gridiron and you have depleted your glycogen stores from your liver and you consume a say energy drink or sports drink you will replete your glycogen faster it will do that I won't argue that the reason being but this to be clear is only liver glycogen not muscle glycogen absolutely and once a linkage in is a much bigger store absolutely you will replete your liver glycogen faster there is a back door where you can turn fructose back into glucose which can then restore your liver glycogen now the sports drink industry makes a huge deal about this I think this is truly a tempest in a teapot I think this is really irrelevant and the reason is because after you've spent three hours on the gridiron you're not gonna spend another three hours on the gridiron okay and you will by tomorrow have repleted those glycogen stores anyway just from eating real food so the idea that somehow you have to replete your glycogen rapidly just to me does not hold water yeah it's fine to expend your glycogen stores in your liver and real food will get you back to the same place by tomorrow it also doesn't even make sense physiologically because the limit to performance is not liver glycogen it's muscle glycogen well not even sure that's true well that's right when you hit people with glucagon who claim that they've sort of bonked and hit the wall and there is no more glucose left you'll still see a transient glucose spike absolutely plus we have all these people who are now on high-fat diets ketogenic diets and how about the Ethiopians they're not eating carbohydrates the fact is you actually have better sports performance using fatty acids and ketones than you do with carbohydrate and the reason is insulin so I don't buy that for a minute as being important yes it is true you will replete your liver glycogen faster and that's true true and unrelated it's like so what yeah you very recently retired clinically yeah you're nowhere near retirement I've got a lot to do but you spent a lot of time your pediatric endocrinologist you spent a lot of time in clinic with children who had diabetes have been overweight have been obese have had naphthalene ash etcetera you then do you have a concern that children who undergo such metabolic transformation suffer an epigenetic hit that makes it harder for them later in life what I know about epi nedick's suggests that that is possible i would even go so far as to say likely is frightening if it's i mean it's one of the things you hope is so untrue right but i don't know that here's what

[00:26:57] I do know and it's related but not exactly the same we know from animal work from both children's of Philadelphia and also from the leggins Institute in New Zealand that maternal hyperglycemia causes epigenetic changes this is in utero in utero causes changes in h19 the different epigenetic markers that we have on chromosomes that then portend metabolic dysfunction later on so if that's true in humans and no one's proven that that's true in humans it could explain a lot of the things that we do see we know from a biochemical standpoint animals that are stressed or animals that consume large amounts of sugar during pregnancy end up with offspring that will manifest various aspects of the metabolic syndrome later do we know that that's through epigenetics not yet but if the rodents studies are similar to you know what happens in primates and humans it's not too far afield and it's not too much of a jump yes I'm very concerned about it because as you know epigenetics is the gift that keeps on giving yeah you can change the f1 generation and still find that epigenetic change and therefore the metabolic alterations in the f-4 generation so it might explain why things keep getting worse year after year is because we're adding on all the time and more people are entering this epigenetic disaster but I don't know that that's things where we have to sort of take a little bit of the precautionary principle right so you say well if there is an epigenetic reprogramming that occur then as parents we need to be thinking a little bit more about the food environment our kids are in because this is one of those things you know that we're pretty familiar with the notion that if you don't discipline your kid you're really not doing them a favor 20 years down the line and this would be another variant of that and of course you would say well what if this turns out to be untrue what if there is no epigenetic signature it's like okay well what was the downside of trying to get your kids to eat well no argument there's one downside and that's it's the effort that's required exactly that's the downside so we have these data how many times you have to introduce a savory food to an infant before they will accept it oh I don't know three four median 13 Wow how many times do you have to introduce a sweet food to an infant before they'll accept it let me tell a funny story for that when my daughter who is now 10 turned 6 months old and I have this on video we took her down to Del Mar for a walk on the beach and got an ice cream cone and we were like alright she's had nothing but breast milk and some formula for the last six months what will she do with some soft vanilla ice cream and our thought was the cold would turn her off there was a foreign substance whatever and it's one of them funniest videos

[00:30:13] I've ever seen because she puts her face into this vanilla ice cream and I've never seen her eyes open so much and I joked about it I was like holy look at the dope you can almost see the dopamine firing you needed to put her in the functional MRI right then and there Michael Pollan describes this in the I'm the worst dilemma that first time he introduced birthday cake to his son and he looked at him like you've been holding out on me this exists in the world and this is the first time I'm getting it I'm gonna devote my entire life to sequestering all this stuff just to spite you it's incredible actually my youngest son turns one on Wednesday of this week and that's oh thank you so he's gonna get a cupcake that'll be his first oh boy junk food you sure you want to do that just because I love watching this reaction going back to this thing I'll tell you something MRI yeah yeah when my daughter was growing up so before she got to school all she drank was milk and water and when she was about five years old she was at a birthday party and they had these things called Capri Sun which are like I don't even know how these things are legal because they're basically syrup in a tinfoil bag they're really gross I mean they they take it to a new level they do she took one sip of one and pitched it like Oh Olivia why didn't you drink that she's like it's really gross it was grimace well fast-forward five years later she drinks that stuff anytime she's at a kid's house right like even something that seems so physiologically nauseating at one point in time she's acclimated to right and there's data on desensitization of taste buds and one of the reasons why you keep wanting more and more sweet is because the taste buds go get down regulated and there's data now that actually supports that in humans so there's this desensitization issue there's also the desensitization of dopamine receptors because dopamine receptors go down in response to constant bombardment by dopamine dominant of Tolerance this would be very is this a controversial point because this is the sin qua non of what makes cocaine so dangerous I mean I have a number of patients who recreationally use cocaine and I I don't want to be like the alarmist who just says it don't do drugs because drugs are bad I want to make the point that says look not all drugs are necessarily bad but cocaine has two problems at least as far as I can see the first is you have a nonlinear asymmetric risk of something really bad happening as far as cardiac dysrhythmia so why would you take that risk but the second issue is this down-regulation of dopamine receptors right that develops this tolerance right and therefore makes it actually harder for you to experience joy subsequently indeed so here's the deal neurotransmitters are either excitatory or inhibitory now neurons like to be excited that's why they have receptors in the first place but neurons like to be tickled not bludgeoned they like to receive the neurotransmitter fire and then come back to baseline chronic over stimulation of any neuron leads to neuronal cell death period and we know this because we take care of all these kids with chronic seizure disorders in the ICU and we're doing our best to try to stop those seizures not because of the seizure but because of the brain damage that occurs from continued over stimulation so any neuron that is an excitatory that's downstream of an excitatory stimulus it wants to protect itself it has a plan B it has a failsafe what it does is it down regulates the receptor that means that there's less likelihood that any given molecule will find a receptor to bind to thereby reducing the risk for cell death so what does this mean in human terms you get a hit you get a rush receptors go down next time you need a bigger hit to get the same rush and the receptors go down and then a bigger hit and a bigger hit and a bigger hit until finally you get a huge hit to get nothing that's called tolerance and then when the neurons actually do start to die because chronic stimulation causes neuronal cell death that's called addiction and those neurons don't come back once they're dead they're dead and that actually limits your ability even after rehab of being able to experience that same level of reward because now you don't even have the dopamine to be able to do it because those neurons are dead so not every drug is stimulatory there are drugs that are inhibitory if you're inhibiting the next neuron do you have to down regulate the receptor no so like a benzodiazepine for dependence or die as opines are inhibitory turns out haha psychedelics are inhibitory so serotonin 2a and 1a are inhibitory so when the DEA clamped down in 1970 with the Controlled

[00:35:22] Substances Act that made marijuana and psychedelics and you know everything Schedule one and you know unavailable there are a whole bunch of people using psychedelics they didn't end up in the emergency room right they didn't end up with withdrawal and the reason was because they didn't have down-regulation of their receptors because those were inhibitory so not every drug Fry's neurons so but cocaine does yeah help me understand how alcohol fits into this because alcohol is of course a gap ethanol per se as a GABA agonist so it should be at least depressing in that sense but yet ethanol has some of these negative properties in the brain that you've just alluded to well what the problem is ethanol in the brain also because it's polar and it dissolves lipids it also creates acetaldehyde so that's the first step in terms of metabolism of ethanol which then can cause that mired reaction because you've made an aldehyde which then generates reactive oxygen species so you can kill neurons not necessarily from excitation but from the biochemistry of the molecule so we talked a lot and we might not even get into it today because you've spoken so eloquently about it elsewhere about the similarities between ethanol and fructose in the liver in the liver yes how are they similar in the brain if at all so they both stimulate the reward center though it seems through different mechanisms yes likely through different mechanisms there are a lot of different dopamine stimulators there are substances and they're all different cocaine alcohol nicotine sugar heroin they have different mechanisms but they all ultimately impact on dopamine the same way we also have behaviors that are addictive gambling shopping internet social media pornography okay there's an a holic next to every one of those two right chocoholic sexaholic whatever because they're stimulating dopamine also but they're not chemicals they're behaviors but they still generate that same dopamine response and therefore they still induce the same phenomenon of

[00:37:27] Tolerance now they don't have withdrawal withdrawal is the effects of these substances on the peripheral body not the brain but the peripheral body because cocaine has effects at every adrenergic synapse morphine has effects on other places other than the brain cetera said caffeine too you know and it's interesting how withdrawal can sometimes be physiologically deadly for example ethanol with you know will the

[00:37:55] DT we know just stuff I mean we used up when we would operate on patients who were alcoholics we would actually just continue methanol throughout surgery I got it keep them on alcohol the whole time not sure so you can kill a patient if you take alcohol away from them too abruptly right whereas opiates the withdrawal is unbearable but you won't kill the patient by removing it I find the physiology of withdrawal to be quite interesting well it's true in fact the way to deal with opiate withdrawal is opiates or give naloxone you know to counteract the opiates which you know is now going on you know everywhere and now the police you know carry narcan and when they find opiate overdoses in the field and they're even now having at schools which is really bizarre and horrible so yes they are your earlier point right which is in Gabor maté a who has written about this quite eloquently stated that we're all addicts oh and so you just get to choose your substance of abuse or your behavior abuse that's right and as you said it's not and it can be work the point is sometimes it can be things that are not socially punished right so as those are the hardest right uh addictions to treat I'm gonna admit to you right now

[00:39:04] I'm a caffeine addict I've already had four cups of coffee this morning and as soon as we're done with this I'm gonna have my next and you know if you take my Starbucks away from me I will kill you on the other hand caffeine is not dangerous unless you mix it with alcohol in which case then you have four loko and you end up with arrhythmia x' and other things so and it's still socially acceptable nicotine is now not socially acceptable but it took a long time it took an entire generation of teaching kids why cigarettes were bad before it became not socially acceptable so we have a long way to go with sugar because it's still socially acceptable I want to get into some more geeky biochemistry stuff but I also know that there's probably at least one person listening to this who's a parent who's thinking oh man do I have to simmer down how much sugar my kids are eating so when you saw kids in the clinic obviously you're seeing their parents that's one of the advantages of

[00:40:04] Pediatrics so some of the disadvantage you have to patients to patients and I don't get paid for both but the beauty of it is you have you have a patient who you need to take care of which is this child but then you also have another caregiver who for the most part wants what's best for that child mostly and how would you counsel a parent who would say look dr. Lustig there's no way my kids gonna have no sugar in their life can you give me a way to create a sustainable environment and set of rules that's gonna prevent my kid from having the metabolic derangement that hoses them for the rest of their life but allows them to still be a kid yes so that's what we did in clinic every single day here's the problem it's not the added sugar you know it's the added sugar you don't know it's almost like a

[00:40:51] Rumsfeld tone to that right well yeah I mean there's the known knowns and there's the unknown knowns and the fact is when you look at the amount of sugar that is in sodas it's bad when you look at the amount of sugar that's in candy cake ice cream it's about half as much that adds up to 50% of the added sugar consumed by children and what is that number by the way in grams per day approximate but the median is 18 teaspoons so that's about 90 grams sugars her day yeah it used to be 120 this actually come down because the obesity epidemic 90 to 94 grams of added sugar per day half of the sugar is in foods you didn't know had it bread pasta sauce pretzels or pretzels have sugar okay bread right why do they put a sugar in bread any idea I guess it probably helps with preserving it does exactly so if you buy a loaf of bread at the bakery how soon before it's taeil's two days directly two days if you buy a loaf of bread at the grocery store how long before it's taeil's 10 to 83 weeks okay why they're both bread right well what they did in the grocery store bread was they added very specifically because the sugar doesn't boil off when you put it in the oven water does so it acts as a humectant it that's why it's so much moister when you have store-bought bread exactly that's why if you threw a loaf of bread at my head it would just bounce off is because it's kind of spongy right but there are also breads like German fitness bread which don't have that they're real bread they use whole grains they're lumpy bumpy and they're small the loaves they're the size of their weapons and their weapons right you could like kill somebody if you through German fitness bread at their head okay it is dense they're both bread but the store-bought bread had sugar added very specifically to hold on to water because sugars polar and so the water stays in and therefore the bread doesn't stay as quickly therefore you can put a cell on there by date way later decrease depreciation increased profit so if a kid came in and the kids got an apple D and you've surmised that this child's eating about a hundred grams of sugar a day mm-hmm do you say to the parent our target is what 20 grams per day what we say is we don't worry about target numbers what we say is processed food is the problem because processed food is high sugar low fiber what you want is a low sugar high fiber diet that's called real food every diet out there that works and they're a whole bunch of diets at work okay certain vegan diets work remember coke is vegan so it's not like every vegan diets okay the college vegan diet doesn't yes the college being the diet does not work exactly right the traditional Japanese diet the Atkins diet ketogenic diet

[00:44:08] Paleo diet Mediterranean diet all of these diets raise diets sure they all work because they're all real food every diet that works is real food and every diet that doesn't is because it's processed food problem is parents don't know that difference they don't understand that grocery store bread is processed food they think it's food they think you know if it's sold in the supermarket it's food no there's real food and you know what that is but the parents don't and what we teach them in clinic is if there's a label on the food that's a warning label because that means it's been processed because real food doesn't need a label is there a you know Nutrition Facts label on broccoli is there a Nutrition

[00:44:57] Facts label on carrots no is there a Nutrition Facts label on the meat in the meat case no the reason is because it's all real food now when we get to meet you know there's ways of making meat a problem - it's called corn-fed but the bottom line is at least they're real food because you don't necessarily fixate on targets you say look right we're gonna talk about we're gonna make a conceptual change we don't ask them to do meth we ask them to purchase and consume real food now we have to teach them what that is so what we do we bring all of the new patients in on the same day you see all the new patients on one day it's like chaos and they all meet with a dietician they come in fasting and we draw their blood and you know we we evaluate them and then they all sit down at a communal table and we do an hour-long teaching breakfast and the dietician narrates why those foods are available for breakfast so whole grain bread natural peanut butter you know not

[00:46:10] Skippy jiff Peter Pan but you know the real stuff plain yogurt etc and we explain why these foods were chosen and how they meet the criteria of real food as opposed to what they're currently buying most parents get it now there are some who don't there are some who say I'm sorry that takes too long I can't spend the time preparing real food and then is there an economic consideration also absolutely do you have a sense of what it all things equal don't go for so a parent's gonna basically have to double their food budget if they want to start eating real food that's right they're gonna have to double their food budget and they're also gonna have to double their food time in terms of preparation that's a big-ass it is or I mean when the CDC last looked at this the estimates of naphthyl D which we'll get into in a moment so we can let you explain that in some detail but when you look in particular along ethnic lines at the time I last looked at this 50% of

[00:47:11] Hispanic boys who were obese had naphthyl D my guess is that's a gross underestimate likely the fact is that Latinos are more risk of developing right there's a genetic predisposition they have a specific polymorphism of a specific gene called P n PL a three-peat Aten like phosphoprotein domain a3 and it's been shown that if you have the homozygous form the GG mutation of polymorphism of this gene a little sugar in your diet makes a lot of liver fat and 19 percent of Latinos have it so this is particularly worrisome for the Latino population and yes they have fatty liver like nobody else so there are people at more risk and so it becomes even more important to get the sugar out of their dye and we explain all of this to them we explain why this is and we show them the lab data we show them the a Cantho sustar cans on the back of the kids neck to explain how the environment changes the biochemistry we also then explain how the biochemistry changes the behavior we know from our study where we actually substituted starch for sugar say kids actually couldn't even eat as much food as we had to supply let's talk for a moment about that this is the isocaloric substitution of fructose for glucose that's right so let's take a step back and explain what a phildee is let me start with one anecdote before we get which he'll appreciate when I was in my residency so we're talking about you know what 18 20 years ago one of the questions your young surgical residents you're always asking the patient during crap is how much alcohol do you consume and the reason is going back to the DT thing we don't want to ever get into a situation where two days post office having DTS so I remember on at least three occasions but probably more where a patient claimed they did not consume alcohol or that their you know they consumed like a beer twice a week and then we'd get in there to do the case and they'd have fatty liver and we would look at each other and go god damn it this guy lied to me I can't believe this you know I wasn't there to judge him I just needed to know he clearly is drinking like his life depends on it and he was in denial well it never registered to me what was going on until 10 years later when I learned about novelty and I said wait a minute those patients weren't lying to me they had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and you can't tell the difference under the microscope they look the same so my first natholi patient was in 1996

[00:49:56] I had just moved to Memphis Tennessee and I had a patient who had a lt''s in the 300s and the liver was enormous and they were just sure this it was a kid you know so it wasn't an alcohol thing you know but they were sure this kid had hepatitis or something else it and it turned out you know they went and did a liver biopsy it was you know fatty liver disease I said what the hell is this and soon all my patients had it same thing with type 2 diabetes I saw my first pediatric type 2 diabetic back in 1992 and now one third of all new diabetes diagnoses and kids is type two what's going on you know we were at the beginning we both of us were seeing this at the beginning of this epidemic and now everyone's got it you know this can't be genetic this is an environmental insult and the good news is we figured out what the insult is the bad news is there are dark forces on the other side keeping it that way let's talk for a moment about that about four or five years ago there was certainly a controversy around the etiology of Nathalie there were camps that said look it's got to be the fructose for reasons that you'll articulate there were other camps that said actually it's fatty acids it's kids that are consuming too much fat others said actually it's just a proxy for obesity in other words quote unquote caloric excess leads to at a paucity which leads to naphthyl D I'd like to hear your thoughts on in the most unbiased way we could how do you make the case that it's fructose that is disproportionately driving this vs. some of these other factors it's very easy to imagine how you get liver fat there's production and then there's clearance okay and the amount of liver fat is the equilibrium between those two phenomena there are two methods for production one is through diet and so dietary fat can contribute to hepatic fat but there's also de novo lipogenesis which is new fat making it's the process of turning sugar into fat now that had been discounted for years because of a one study this is Hellerstein study that basically looked right the parks you know Hellerstein study from Journal investigation 98 1998 where they said oh this is a minor pathway the fractional dnl was only 3 percent well the reason it was only 3 percent was because number one these were healthy people number two they were fasting which means they were glycogen depleted and so the fructose went into repleted the glycogen like we talked about and there were also people who hadn't been large fructose consumers in advance and we now know that fructose absorption at the level of the gut is inducible we learned this every

[00:53:07] Halloween because the kid eats a lot of sugar and then ends up having diarrhea like crazy because basically they malabsorption it they've got malabsorption because their enzyme hadn't been induced yet but if you continue to supply it the process increases and we now know the reason for that is a protein in the intestinal epithelial cell called thyroid ox an inhibitory protein or txon if this has worked from Richard Lee at

[00:53:36] Harvard there were a whole bunch of reasons why people thought that de novo lipogenesis was a minor pathway it's not a minor pathway it is a major pathway and Donnelly showed in 2005 that de novo lipogenesis was worth about 25 percent of the fat in the liver Wow and then I mean you're gonna get to this but how much of that is getting exported in VLDL that's the clearance side there are two ways to clear there's oxidation fatty acid oxidation this is why diseases that cause mitochondrial dysfunction like

[00:54:13] Reye's syndrome end up with fatty liver and then there's export and the export can be through VLDL or can be through phosphatidylcholine but it's basically export out of the liver so there's oxidation is clearance and export is clearance so you have two ways come in two inputs to out two inputs to outputs and so the question is what's changed and the answer is our dietary fats gone down so that ain't it but our Genova lipogenesis has gone up and when you look at the exports we now have fatty liver which actually makes things worse because it causes inflammation which ends up making mitochondria less functional which causes less fatty acid oxidation and we have data on that and we have high triglycerides in patients who consume fructose so if that pathway out is going up then you know that if you've got fatty liver it's because more is coming in bottom line so the driver so you could say because triglycerides typically go up with naphthyl D that says it's not a problem of exporting it's not ineffective exporting patients who have a beta lipoprotein emia they can't export they can't make the VLDL you know how many patients that is okay that's like 1 in 10,000 we have a 40% novel rate in this country it ain't one in 10,000 it's not because of the fatty acid oxidation defects it's not because of the export problem it's not because of the increased saturated fat it's because the de novo lipogenesis by process of exclusion that's the only pathway that's gone up do you believe that insulin resistance is the result of novel D or is naphthyl D the result of insulin resistance yes the two feet off each other let's talk about metabolic syndrome because the one aspect of metabolic syndrome that everyone agrees on is this phenomenon called insulin resistance the question is where's the insulin resistance come from everyone assumes well you get fat therefore your fat cells make cytokines like tnf-alpha and il-6 those then go via the portal system to the liver and cause the liver to be dysfunctional and therefore you increase hepatic glucose output that then causes your beta cells to have to over produce insulin and then that drives the insulin resistance that's what you learn in medical school undoubtedly there are some patients where that is the pathway

[00:56:52] I actually think that's actually a rare way that this happens maybe 10% I don't think that's the majority but that is one way we'll call it the a dupage Enic hypothesis of metabolic syndrome because clearly that patient is not insulin resistant at the adipocyte as evidenced by the fact that they can increase the size of their adipocyte exactly right so they have liver insulin resistance but they're adipocytes are insulin sensitive because they keep storing and in that model you haven't necessarily specified what's happening at the level of the muscle which some would argue is the harbinger of bad things in other words once the muscle stops disposing of glucose taking it in yep in fact muscles don't need insulin to import glucose if they did then every diabetic would be paralyzed the reason insulin works at the muscle is for import of amino acids so for muscle growth but not for muscle metabolism so the transporter on muscle is which glute glue - it is glute or 4 it's not four that's in adipocytes glue - is in the liver I'm pretty sure it's three one is in the brain I'm pretty sure it's three I got a look at that again but I'm just trying to remember but it's not glued for mm-hmm so that's one pathway of metabolic syndrome starting at the fat cell and I think that's rare there's a second metabolic syndrome we see it in clinical depression now clinical depression causes weight loss so you'd think that that would actually obviate metabolic syndrome but in fact clinical depression increases metabolic syndrome it decreases obesity but it increases metabolic syndrome and when you do CT scans or MRIs across the abdomen of people with clinical depression they have increased visceral fat now why do they have increased visceral fat cortisol drives visceral fat accumulation we know that from the

[00:58:53] Cushing syndrome patients okay glucocorticoids drive that so the question is why are stressed people accumulating visceral fat irrespective of their sub-q fat and the answer is because the sympathetic nervous system normally which is lipolytic at least acutely becomes lipo Jenna chronically and the reason is because of the co factor that's released with the norepinephrine called neuropeptide Y neuropeptide Y actually changes what would be a lipolytic stimulus to a lipo genic stimulus so chronic over stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to visceral fat accumulation and of course chronic stress increases cortisol the two together increase visceral fat well that visceral fat was you're saying independent of subcutaneous fat but also the cortisol and the sympathetic piece the norepi piece yeah you're saying are both basically conspiring to be both pro like purgenik am connected didn't realize the norepi connection so acutely nor epi will cause lipolysis through the beta3 adrenergic receptor at the level of the adipocyte but it causes lipogenesis when there are peptide Y's available can neuropeptide Y be measured or is it too short-lived too short-lived can you measure urinary metabolites of it not to my knowledge you know I wear a continuous glucose monitor and as everybody says to me you know why the hell do you wear that thing you're not diabetic but I will tell you the insights I gleaned from this are remarkable and now that I wear this thing called aura ring oh so this thing's measuring heart rate variability so every morning when I wake up to me the most interesting thing I can look at is what was my glucose over the last eight hours and what was my heart rate and heart rate variability okay and the interesting correlation I've noticed which now maybe you've provided an explanation for is when heart rate variability is lowest we know that we are which heart rate variability low frequency or high frequency Meiners looking at the rms SD of the total signal okay so the way that it's quantified here is I don't know that it's specifying it matters interesting well let me tell you what is my frequency heart variability is vagal and low frequency is a bunch of things thrown on top of each other baroreceptor respiratory rate and sympathetic so it's the low to high ratio that gives you the same path of a goal balance because you cancel out the other things so taking your HRV and you know binning them into low and high frequency matters mm-hmm if the do you know what the ring Grassi good RF is 0.3 okay I'll look into this is interesting just looking at it at the level that it's reported the lower the HRV obviously the imputed or inferred higher sympathetic tone right well generally the higher the glucose level I believe that and I've always assumed it was just cortisol coming along for the ride I never actually thought first of all does go up 5 6 7 8 a.m. they know it's the diurnal variation so maybe that's well my cheek glucose was at 2 a.m. yesterday my peak for 24 hours hmm was it 2 a.m. now I was sleeping in a hotel having a shitty sleep who knows what I was stressed out about I remember I had a weirdest dreams imaginable but it's it's really interesting how much cortisol plays a role in this I agree of cortisol plays a major role in it we know this from all the data from the Whitehall study in terms of stress you know that workers are under etc and shift workers you know really have problems with cortisol so anyway the point is you can have visceral fat mmm which release the cytokines and goes to the liver so it can come from the sub-q fat that would be obesity and come from the visceral fat that would be stress and then there's a third way and that is making the liver sick straight away mainlining the toxin that's called sugar and what is that and that's what the one

[01:02:52] I think is the biggest problems because the one that's increasing the most early what is the actual mechanism by which all of those things which lead to things we know are bad right the homocysteine going up the uric acid going up the alt going up fat actually accumulating grossly right how does that translate to a peripheral problem that actually becomes the runway to diabetes if you have liver dysfunction which occurs due to those cytokines from either the sub-q fat or the visceral fat or because you have primary hepatic dysfunction as in

[01:03:28] Nathalie what's going to happen is you're going to have increased hepatic glucose output because now your insulin resistant at the level of the liver so your liver can't inhibit the enzymes that cause gluconeogenesis so the process of hepatic glucose output is because the insulin phosphorylates FOXO one which is a four ket protein that normally goes into the nucleus of the liver cell and transcribes the enzymes that are involved in glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis that's how you raise your serum glucose when insulin is unavailable insulin supposed to suppress that by phosphorylating the Fock so one if your insulin resistant because there's liver fat or because of the cytokines coming in now you can't phosphorylate FOXO one you can transduce that insulin signal so now your glucose output goes up which then increases your serum glucose which then goes to your beta cell and acquires no off switch there's no off switch correct and your beta cell then has to make extra insulin and it's making it fasting it's not just making it in response to a meal it's making it all the time and insulin is both good and bad it's good when it lowers your blood sugar it's bad when it does everything else insulins job is to store energy okay it is not to keep your glucose normal it is to store energy it keeps your glucose normal as a function of storing energy if you're storing energy you're gonna gain weight in addition insulin stimulates a different pathway in cells that is the proliferation pathway it's called map kinase and Earth this pathway is responsible for vascular smooth muscle proliferation coronary artery vascular smooth muscle proliferation thereby making your coronaries tighter and less likely to be able to vasodilate when they need to thus increasing risk for heart attack it also causes cell division because insulin is a mitogen it causes cells to divide well if it causes your breast cell to divide you might end up with breast cancer and so hyperinsulinemia is associated with all of the chronic metabolic diseases we know about because of this second phenomenon that insulin does not just lower in glucose which it does is a sidelight of storing energy but in fact because it causes both inflammation and cell division my hope is that as time goes on more and more physicians will realize that hyperinsulinemia per se independent of what's happening at the level of glucose in other words you have a patient with a quote-unquote normal hemoglobin a1c but their hyperinsulinemic that that is taken as seriously as we would take diabetes absolutely and this is one of the reasons why if you look at all of the diabetes studies that are out there in terms of diabetes control they all improve hemoglobin a1c and the patient dies anyway the UKPDS the Accord study and several others all show that you can lower blood glucose you can reduce micro vascular complications diabetic retinopathy neuropathy nephropathy all small vessel complications by lowering the glucose but what you do is you exacerbate the large vessel complications like coronary heart disease or cancer and you end up dying just the same so getting your blood glucose down is only half the job in diabetes getting your blood insulin down is the other half and taking drugs that increase your insulin ain't the way yeah yeah it is it totally the object is to increase your insulin sensitivity and the only way to do that is by diet not even by exercise alone you can't outrun a bad diet you have to fix the insulin problem and exercise won't fix the insulin problem by itself it seems to me that a large part of this now becomes a policy issue which I know you went back to graduate school law school yeah about what six years ago five years yeah and I know that even though you've quote-unquote retired from your clinical practice that's simply given you more time to focus on these other issues yeah in fact it's one of the reasons I retired I realized about seven eight years ago that I could actually take care of a million kids easier than I could take care of one and so I'm devoting my time now to research we have a study now that is ultimately if all goes well and so far it is will put the final nail in the coffin on a calorie is not a calorie and will basically prevent the food industry from ever saying it again that's my goal and currently the food industry says I mean I haven't really paid much attention to this to be honest with you in the last few years but is the food industry basically still saying that while a can of coke is not ever deemed even by coca-cola to be as nutritious as a carrot in the end are they basically saying that all calories contribute equally to adiposity and insulin resistance yes they are all saying it's about obesity and therefore it's about energy balance therefore it's about calories therefore all calories are the same that's what they say it is absolutely not true and we have all the reasons in the world to show why it's not true we have empiric data we have mechanistic data we have plausibility data we have hard data that show that is just not the case and if you want I'll give you examples of it all right let's start yeah let's talk about fiber you need 160 calories in almonds how many do you absorb 2/3 130 yeah I mean 75% okay well what happened to the other 30 presumably it's going to drag some stuff out in your colon well no what happens is the soluble and insoluble fiber in the almonds forms a gel on the inside of the intestine you can actually see it on electron microscopy a whitish gel that's going to act as a secondary barrier preventing absorption of some of those almond calories early on well if they don't get absorbed in the duodenum where they go next

[01:10:10] Jim did you know did you know well what's in the jejunum that's not in the duodenum the microbiome yeah the duodenum is essentially sterile it's got a pH of 1 only h pylori can live there you have to get the by car when you're saying that that lining is formed in the duodenum duodenum you exactly to prevent your liver from getting the whole dose because anything that's absorbed in the duodenum goes straight to the lyric so how much fiber is in an apple a lot I mean I can't give you a but but I'm directly uh I'm making this number up but let's say there's how many grams of fructose in an apple 20 there's 30 calories in a standard apple half of which would be fructose of 15 that seems low last food yeah I mean I'm not a big you know mother apple but you know like an app level but so based on that you're saying only half the fructose that you would eat in a piece of fruit might actually get to the liver yeah or less most of it's going end up in the jejunum and once it goes to the jejunum it's a free-for-all do you absorb it or do the bacteria digest it and metabolize it for their own use remember you have ten trillion cells in your body but you have a hundred trillion bacteria in your intestine every one of us is just a big bag of bacteria with legs those bacteria have to survive if the fructose gets absorbed at the level of the genome in other words if the gut outcompetes the bacteria can it still get back to the liver oh yeah yeah but the because any area will be wider which means the insulin response will be lower which is what you want because it took longer but a lot of it won't get absorbed it'll be digested doesn't come out in the stool it gets to just a by the gut bacteria who use it for their own purposes now here's the thing that I only learned about a month and a half ago which is absolutely essential if you don't consume fiber that means that your gut bacteria are not getting the food they need because you're absorbing it all early well they still have to survive so what do they do they Protea lies and lipo lies the mucin layer to digest they Auto digest the mucin layer that sits on the surface of your intestinal epithelial cells protecting them and you can actually see on electro microscopy an increased opposition of the bacteria with the intestinal epithelial cell which likely causes damage possibly a leaky gut and possibly GI disease like colitis and even maybe Crohn's so the idea is to feed your bacteria or your bacteria will digest you and what sources of fiber do you think I mean people talk about using psyllium husk and all these other things to sort of augment fiber you think that's necessary or do you think you can get enough of it just from well so psyllium is soluble fiber it's not in the soluble fiber you need both fiber has soluble enzymes soluble like pectins like what holds jelly together insoluble fiber like cellulose you know string stuff in celery you need both to make that gel so the insoluble fiber formed the latticework like the net let's say you put a layer of petroleum jelly on a strainer you would have an impenetrable water barrier right yeah so the insoluble is like the strainer and the soluble becomes the thing that fills in the lattice that's right exactly so when you have both it works and there's data that shows that if you have either one or the other doesn't work you need both well you get both in real food and this is why the food industry keeps adding soluble fiber like psyllium husk to food like fiber one bars doesn't make a damn bit of difference they have insoluble fiber in things like certain breakfast cereals but if you don't have the soluble fiber also doesn't work you need both real food has both the point is for the fiber fortified stuff is the easy way to do it is to add soluble fiber that doesn't work okay and that's what the food industry keeps doing and keeps telling us that it's good because it's got extra fiber wrong doesn't have functional fibre doesn't have the fiber that does what you want it to do that's what reason a calorie is not a calorie all by itself I know that you've got to go soon otherwise we could do this for another two hours but I do want to ask you one sort of final question or final thought on something which is I looked into this a few years ago and maybe the numbers have changed but directionally I think this is still correct there were something like nine companies that controlled basically all of CPG consumer packaged goods ten there's ten okay ten control 90% of the food yeah that's basically my calculation was ten of them controlled eighty-five percent of the calories that people consume yep you face a very uphill battle in because you're trying to get them to change the way they do business mm-hm but they answer to shareholders not to you and the way they were doing things right now is working out reasonably for their shareholders not great these aren't the most high-performing companies in the world but how in the world when such a small group of companies control so much and going back to what you said earlier you're asking parents to double their food budget I feed their kids correctly and spend twice the time doing it right what does this look like in ten years how does the story end well I don't know how it ends this is a battle royal like tobacco was and it took a long time to win that and there are people who say we haven't even won that one yet you know II cigarettes now come over have another proposition here in San

[01:15:42] Francisco tomorrow about tobacco to kids here's the deal the food system needs to change they're not going to change it from the inside because right now sugar is their business model it's the thing that increases their sales when high fructose corn syrup and the dietary guidelines of 1977 were first available the profit margin of the food industry went from 1% per year to 5% per year this is their juggernaut this is their gravy train they add more sugar they sell more food and they know it and that's why there's sugar and all the food because when they add it you buy more for all the reasons we've discussed they have to change the food which means they have to change the business model so how do you change the business model well there are four potential ways to change the business model one is educate the public so that they don't want that food in which case then they won't sell it we're trying to do that that's one reason I am the chief science officer of a nonprofit trying to do just that okay called eat real and real is an acronym responsible epicurean and agricultural leadership we are trying to change the food system by praising the good and hoping that that will induce competition amongst restaurants cafeterias hospitals schools to procure market and sell real food or you can have executive branch efforts like the

[01:17:19] FDA or the USDA but not in this administration if anything they've rolled back opportunities for that like the Nutrition Facts label or you can have Congress legislate specific changes they're not doing that because they're all paid off from the American Legislative Exchange Council and other concerns like the koch brothers what have you or you can have judicial impact and so there are lawsuits against the food industry as we speak in an attempt to try to shall we say regulate from the bench which no one thinks is optimal but seems to be the only thing that's available at the moment aside from education so those are the four ways to do this my goal would be to get rid of food subsidies are the food subsidies what enable the junk food to be basically half the price of real food or is it that the real food is twice as much to make not independent of the subsidy it's about the subsidy making junk food cheap if you got rid of the subsidies then the market would work ok right now any subsidy distorts the market and there's no reason for food subsidies in fact there's no economist worth their salt today that believe in food subsidies because they distort the market so the question is would food get more expensive if we got rid of all food subsidies the genie knee foundation at

[01:18:46] UC Berkeley engaged in this exercise several years ago and they computed what would happen to the price of food and it turned out that the price of food wouldn't change except for two items corn and sugar will go up but how would that not impact the cost of all other foods given how ubiquitous they are it's a complex modelling and I'm not I'm not an expert in how they arrived at this but empirically this is what fell out of it is that you know the price of wheat wouldn't change the price of soy wouldn't change only corn and sugar and that is where the dietary sugar in our food comes from so I think that that would be a really smart way to start you know the farm bill is you know reapportioned every five years and right now there's actually tension around that farm bill it has to do with other things but I would like to see the issue of the metabolic cost of food built into the farm bill because right now our government has not linked or yoked the productivity and economic costs of

[01:19:57] Medicare Medicaid Social Security with food I would like to see that link strengthened because we have the data is there any maybe is there right now that you consider a victory because when you look at the smoking story you had surgeon general's report first you had changes in advertising next you had excise taxes and then ultimately environmental changes we have excise taxes for soda do you have any advertising rule changes yet well here in San Francisco we have a warning label on billboards that is right now there's a temporary injunction about because the food industry but the smoking one was interesting I didn't know this until a few years ago but basically a law came out that said any time a tobacco commercial was on TV it had to be followed by an anti tobacco commercial right it turned out the Fairness

[01:20:46] Doctrine yeah it turned out the anti de Beco commercials were so popular and so effective that tobacco voluntarily withdrew from television indeed is there anything around creating that type of awareness know what there is is the question of marketing to children and the thing is that many of the conglomerates have said they voluntarily will not market to children at least during certain times of the day when kids are more likely to watch but in fact watchdogs have been looking at this and they say that it's slip service that they're not actually doing it so you cannot expect the food industry to police itself I hate to end on this note

[01:21:31] I know you have to go I want to respect your time I hope we can come back and do this again and talk in more detail Peter okay there are a few people that I don't just make myself available for but that I want to see my pleasure you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog and the nerd Safari at Peter Tia m.com what's a nerd Safari you ask just click on the link at the top of the site to learn more maybe the simplest thing to do is to sign up for my subjective lean on lame once a week email where I'll update you on what I've been up to the most interesting papers I've read and all things related to longevity science performance sleep etc on social you can find me on Twitter Instagram and
