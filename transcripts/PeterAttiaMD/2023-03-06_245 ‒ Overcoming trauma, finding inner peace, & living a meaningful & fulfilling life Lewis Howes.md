Lewis Howes is a New York Times best-selling author, entrepreneur, speaker, and host of the popular podcast, The School of Greatness. In this episode, Lewis opens up about the various hardships and traumatic events he experienced starting at a very young age and reveals the valuable lessons he learned as he worked through those traumas to improve his emotional health. He talks about how his past hardships likely contributed to his success in business and athletics, only to leave him feeling unsatisfied and unfulfilled. Next, he discusses how many aspects of his life were suffering, the inflection point that drove Lewis to seek help, and the long but beautiful healing journey that followed. Lewis makes the case that adversity, and even trauma, can be beneficial if one finds meaning in tribulations and has the courage to face one’s fears and insecurities. Finally, Lewis shares the many modalities of therapy that helped him along the way and gives advice for those wanting to find inner peace and live a fulfilling, rich, abundant, joyful life.

## Transcript

[00:00:01] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter attia

[00:00:09] Lewis man thank you for making time to sit down I feel lucky that I'm going to be one of the sort of first people to get to talk with you um on the heels of the book coming out because we're recording this in January um your book is coming out at the beginning of March so um I know that you know you're going to be talking to a lot of people and I've been thinking about this as I kind of read your book which is given this is the first time we're speaking uh not the first time we're speaking the first time I'm having you on my podcast to talk about it I also want to talk about things that you know precede this book in particular um and I could think of no better way to start talking about it than to really go kind of more deeply into your story because I think your personal story is what is at least the substrate for three of your four books right you you I think your first book was really kind of about optimizing LinkedIn and uh we'll probably not get too much into that given that I don't use LinkedIn too much but uh it'll probably come up as part of the other so um yeah um so remind me you grew up in was it Ohio yeah small town in Ohio near Columbus and um but then I bounced around when I was 13 I left home I went to a private boarding school in St Louis Missouri I begged my family my parents to send me away for about two months in the summer just because there was a lot of kind of turmoil uh inner turmoil and my environment turmoil um and I begged him to send me away they didn't want to send me away most kids get sent away for being bad I begged my parents to send me away sort of funny our our daughter is half joking and she's in eighth grade saying she wants to go to boarding school for high school and I'm like yeah that's not gonna happen we have the rest of our lives to be away from you we're not going to do it during High School you are you're gonna see it I hear you man yeah I mean it was it was like it was actually like it transformed my life though because there was so much discipline there was so much organization you had to wake up at 6 a.m it wasn't like a military school but there was definitely strict rules and guidelines and um that that that organizational feel gave me structure when I felt like I didn't have structure in my life necessarily so it was extremely transformational but if your daughter doesn't want to you know if you want to keep your daughter home then keep her home I think she I think she might be wanting to go because she thinks they'll have like less stringent rules about phone time or something yeah right so um remind me do you have siblings

[00:02:40] I know you have a brother yeah three old three older I'm the youngest of four uh older brother two older sisters okay and and what's the what was the relative differences between ages there my brother is 11 and a half years older than me and then it's kind of a three and a half four year gap between each one of us um and so that probably means you didn't play with your brother much growing up no and I mean when I was eight he went to prison yeah for four and a half years so I I have a few fond memories from five years old till about you know eight before he went away of him being essentially like a hero of mine you know an older bigger older brother an older teenager who was very gifted and talented in a lot of different ways extremely intelligent he skipped a couple of grades uh in school because he was so intelligent and gifted and so you know he was kind of like a hero of mine and when I was eight he went away to prison if I were only five years this was for he was caught selling LSD or some he sold LSD a sheet of LSD to an undercover cop when he was like 18 in college and um is an unfortunate event because back in the I guess it's the early 90s it was the war against drugs in America it was like the most they were just cracking down on anything yeah and giving extreme you know case cases in jail jail time to make an example for others and so he got six to 25 years um it was kind of devastating you know I

[00:04:14] I never I didn't grow up think knowing anyone that went to jail or going to prison you know I grew up in a small town and it wasn't like there were bullets wisen by my neighborhood every day so it wasn't like something I saw unless you saw in the movies and you see that in the movies when you're a kid and you're like oh these are really bad people these are people that kill or rape or murder and all these different things I was like that's not my brother you know he didn't do those things you know he did something illegal at the time but he he didn't do he wasn't bad like that so it's very confusing in a lot of ways very traumatic for my parents and my siblings and we had the the opportunity to go visit essentially like once a week there was visiting hours visiting room um and that was kind of interesting because

[00:05:04] I don't know many eight-year-olds that go to a prison every single weekend for you know three to four hours and sit in a room with 40 convicts in their families uh so every week we would drive a couple hours to the prison for essentially four years and it was a it was a wake-up call on just different cultures different ethnicities different backgrounds different experiences and it was also a wake-up call for me because you know I had a lot of judgments from I guess movies and TV and things like that about convicts and I actually met a lot of them you know and they were you know they were extremely friendly they were kind you know a lot of them were with their families reading the Bible they'd been in there for a long time and they'd they'd transformed in a lot of ways not all of them but the the ones that I were meeting it felt like man these are actually good guys at least the way it came across and um so it was kind of a it was a dark time in a sense because our whole family was just like overwhelmed by the trauma of it and uh the shame and the guilt and and I couldn't really have friends during that time being in a small town everyone knew on our neighborhood and so none of the parents on my block wanted the kids to hang out with me uh so it was just kind of a confusing time for me because I felt lonely and insecure and never really accepted myself um it was just a confusing time you know it's interesting you said um you you had judgments and and stuff about you know what prison was or wasn't like I mean that's actually kind of a remarkable Insight because when I think about what I did or didn't know when I was eight I can't imagine it was much of anything so right you know this this strikes me as a a very complicated uh introduction of factors that because again I think there's also something you don't understand when you're eight which is there's a difference between doing something wrong and breaking the law like yeah you know there are a lot of people who do things that are wrong and awful but they're not breaking the law and as a result of that there's no consequence right at least there's no legal consequence similarly there are a lot of things that are against the law that are really not morally particularly wrong and yet there's an enormous consequence and I think it's very I mean that requires a certain level of maturity that wouldn't be expected of an eight-year-old so well I just think it was like you know you you hear stories about people in prison and on the news and you just see that they did horrible things right yeah so I was like oh wow okay my brother he he committed a crime but I don't feel like he's a bad guy you know what I mean he wasn't like trying to hurt people intentionally he was just trying to make money and as a college kid and someone you know uh asked him for some weed or something and he he would like sell a little bit here and there on the side to make some extra cash and then they're like OD of LSD and um he was like no but it was all part of a bigger thing to like get a bunch of guys to go to jail so it was just kind of part of a scheme an undercover scheme and it was his first time and he had six to 25 years on his first offense do you remember what the impact of that was on your parents I mean I I was devastating it was devastating again my dad was a you know pretty well respected like life insurance salesman in the community again a small town he was a part of rotary we had exchange students living with us since uh since I was five we had like seven different exchange students lived with us from around the world uh for six months at a time he was you know trying to be a part of the community with rotary he was giving back to the community he he knew everyone in the community he was like the life insurance guy in our small town um and so it was kind of devastating I couldn't imagine the impact it had on him and his business and his reputation

[00:09:02] I can imagine like the guilt and shame that my parents had from asking themselves you know where did we go wrong did we did we do something wrong where he straight away in some ways he was extremely gifted and talented he was one of the top violinists in the in the country under 17 in National competitions his classical violinist he was a savant he was a prodigy he was like second chair first chair at 16 in the symphony in the

[00:09:29] Columbus Symphony as a 16 year old and um he just did things with the violin classically that people couldn't do it was he was a mutant in the violin and one of the one of the crazy you know the beautiful lessons that came from this and I think all these different tragedies in our life are challenges and adversities you know hindsight is always 20 20 and sometimes it's hard to have future hindsight now and that's now that

[00:09:55] I've had so many different challenges in life and I see the meaning of them later anytime I'm in a diversity now I try to think about man this is going to be so meaningful in my future and it's going to give me so much more power in my future to serve others and more wisdom when he went to prison he got sent to a prison with like these special kind of um facility that had a prison band and because he was so gifted in the violin he got sent to a specific prison that allowed this kind of curriculum and it's kind of like a Hollywood movie in my mind because he goes to jail he joins the prison band he plays he's a classical violinist white kid from Ohio and he joins the band with everyone who's not white he's the only white kid

[00:10:44] They're all playing hip hop and Funk and blues and rap and R B and Jazz and they all teach him the culture of a different style of music for four years so he gets a master class from other inmates who are talented and and play and sing with their heart and their souls with so much musicality and passion from Pain and

[00:11:10] Trauma and they pour their hearts out in this band and we got to go watch him actually a few times and it was in it was so inspiring to watch prisoners inmates perform like they were free men it was incredibly inspiring to witness every time um and after he got out in four and a half years on good behavior um so we didn't have to serve the full 25. and he in the last 20 plus years has completely transformed his life goes all over the country and all over the world to perform and teach at schools he was a professor at Berkeley School of Music one of the most prestigious colleges in the in the world of music um he played with Les Paul for 10 years in Times Square he played a Les Paul's

[00:11:58] Funeral this is like one of the icons of jazz and invented the electric guitar he uh again has transformed his life to be of service and and Find meaning from that experience and he would have never been the greatest Jazz violinist in the world had he not gone through that four years of you know challenging education of being an inmate in prison so so you mentioned a moment ago that um from as young as when you were five your parents uh and your family would have exchange students um I know you you wrote about this in um

[00:12:35] I believe your second book that you know you had a really traumatic event occur when you were five that something that you know remained a secret for at least 20 years was that five years ago was that was that related to someone that came as an exchange student or was that unrelated it was unrelated yeah when I was five I was sexually abused by a babysitter's son it was probably like 16 or 17 and I would go both my parents were working and they'd worked till you know five six seven or whatever because when I was younger they didn't really have uh the financial abundance until you know maybe

[00:13:08] I got to be like 16 my dad finally started to get commissions coming in that uh were more than just kind of scrapping by month to month so both my parents were working while they had four kids and they sent us to babysitters after school um and so that was a an unfortunate event that for 25 years left me feeling with a lot of pain a lot of insecurity a lot of shame because I I didn't think this ever happened to any other boy I didn't know of anyone other boy I never heard of a man uh that I watched on TV or an athlete talking about sexual abuse growing up in the 80s and 90s no one ever spoke about it you heard about it from women in some cases um but I never heard about it from a male perspective and so I thought I was for 25 years that I was the only one who'd been sexually abused in the world essentially I was uneducated and unaware and I was left with a lot of Shame and self-doubt that caused me to put on and project a certain personality type that I wasn't and inauthenticity from of me um to protect myself so I wore many different masks to try to fit in to feel accepted to feel like I belonged in my peer group and um

[00:14:24] I remember just always kind of feeling like angry triggered um reactive when I felt like I was being taken advantage of or abused in life whether it was actually happening or not when I felt like it was happening I was on the defenses and in some ways that drove me to accomplish goals and generate some success in sports and then eventually in business but I remember I would have these big goals in athletics you know I wanted to be an All-American athlete I was a two-sport All-American athlete I wanted to be a professional athlete I made Arena Football League and was a pro athlete I wanted to go to the Olympics and I was on the USA handball team for almost nine years we never qualified but

[00:15:09] I played against a lot of Olympic teams and I remember accomplishing all these Sports goals and still not feeling fulfilled and joyful and happy inside it was kind of like all right I succeeded but I never felt like it was enough so I needed to go bigger I did the same thing in business for many years I would accomplish goals

[00:15:29] I would make money I would get the accolades and things like that and it still didn't feel like it was enough and it wasn't until I was 30 years old uh a decade ago now when I started to have multiple breakdowns in my life I was driven and fueled to prove people wrong to look good to win um and to get acknowledged and to be kind of the One Standing On Top that's what was a fueled by because I thought that would bring joy peace and fulfillment and it just left me feeling more and more angry and upset the more successful

[00:16:08] I got and it wasn't until I was 30 I had multiple let's call it breakdowns in life in an intimate relationship a Business Partnership and then I was also just kind of reactive in life um when I play sports I got into a bad fight one time on a basketball court and kind of all these things came together at once where my my best friend said I don't want to hang out with you anymore if you're going to keep reacting like this this is a guy that I played college football with and knew for a decade at that time he was like

[00:16:40] I don't like the way you're reacting it's not it's not fun anymore you know it doesn't what are you doing why are you getting so triggered and that was a big wake-up call where I thought I didn't need additional coaching or support I thought I kind of had all the answers at the time I had a massive ego thinking that you know what else can I learn you know

[00:17:03] I I'm I'm in the personal development space I've made money in business you know I feel like I've got the answers people just need to understand and accept me and um I started to take the advice from him and other friends and I went to therapy I went to a lot of different emotional intelligence workshops uh and I've been in the Journey of trying and testing lots of different healing modalities over the last decade that have been extremely powerful and inspiring and in one of these workshops I took 10 years ago

[00:17:35] I opened up for the first time about being sexually abused and that was the Catalyst for me starting the Journey of reflecting back on just all the little tea and Big T traumas that I had faced whether I thought they were a big deal or not just allowing myself to reflect back on the different psychological stages of my life that wounded me that created a scar that created this type of open wound and it was extremely healing terrifying at the same time but extremely healing when I started to open up about this in this workshop and then went through a process of telling my family one by one and then close friends one by one and then eventually about a year later opening up about it publicly on my podcast and that was about nine years ago when I opened up about it and

[00:18:26] I remember thinking to myself before I did this kind of episode talking about sexual abuse as a man I remember thinking my life is over my career is over my business is over uh No One's Gonna buy anything from me ever again you know everyone's going to make fun of me publicly and I'm gonna be ashamed but I just felt like it needed to come out of me and if it could help a few men who had been through something similar then it was worth you know losing my credibility and my business and everything and what happened afterwards was an extremely beautiful experience for me for weeks I just got essays from men opening up about for the first time about the traumas that they went through through sexual abuse and it was kind of like an emotional hangover reading these essays from men because I didn't realize how much trauma men go through in their childhoods and the stats are one in six uh men have been sexually abused it's one in four women but the the challenge for men is there has never really been a safe space until really the last few years for men to be able to open up and talk about it again it's traumatic no matter your man woman who you are but there's been more of a uh availability to talk about it for women over the last you know decades and I just never felt like there was a space for men and I think more men are opening up and talking about it more people are talking about mental health in general and just healing trauma and it's been um it's been a beautiful Journey over the last 10 years to continue to heal to continue to grow and reconnect and re-parent that five-year-old version of myself the 10 year old version of myself the 18 year old version of myself and and talk about and talk to myself in a meditative psychological state of how proud I am of that five-year-old for overcoming this for how proud I am of the 8 to 12 year old who didn't have friends for four and a half years because you know he was facing challenges with my brother in prison uh and for all the different stages of life that I felt like I was unsure uncertain unclear and being able to go back and have those conversations has been extremely healing experience what do you think it was Louis that um created that Crescendo when you were 30. uh it's not it's not it's not an unusual scenario right which is these traumatic events occur very early in life but they don't sort of the maladaptive side because because I sort of describe what your what you've explained is there were positive and negative adaptations to that experience the positive adaptations were the things that actually gave you discipline and gave you drive and yes probably enabled you to reach a lot of your potential but unfortunately it came with these negative adaptations that we'll just call maladaptations and that's what you know increased your temper and probably created emotional distance between you and others in a disa inability to connect with people but the story that that that sort of the thing that I find interesting is it took 25 years for that volcano to erupt yeah what do you think that was about why do you think you you were able to enjoy relative successes until you weren't you know sort of like it was sustainable until it wasn't yeah

[00:22:05] I love we're having this conversation because I'd only talk about this as much most people don't ask me this stuff so I'm glad we're talking about it because um I was really good at putting on a mask of the athlete mask of the know-it-all mask like I've got it all figured out I can take care of this you know um kind of the success mask of like using success as a mask to protect myself and I think it's really hard to transform when things are good and when things are bad like we get familiar with good we get familiar with bad or low level stress it becomes familiar it's really hard to transform unless some type of event occurs maybe it's someone close to you has a near-death experience maybe you go through a divorce or breakup or your business bankruptcy or you lose your job whatever it might be you get really sick something happens you lose a grandparent that you're close with and you start asking yourself like why am I doing the things I'm doing when there's there's not enough time left you start looking at life differently and I think for me it was kind of a perfect storm of events that occurred when Business Partnership broke up like I almost got in a fight with my business partner at one point in the middle of Times Square I felt like I was going to punch him because we were just not able to communicate and it was kind of like months and months of frustration and you know resentment and all these things and again I was immature and had a big ego and if I remember correctly from the book this is this was a business partner this was a 50 50 partnership where you were doing 80 of the work that that's my perspective of this yeah

[00:23:41] I was bringing in the revenue I was the one doing the sales so I felt like the only reason we're generating revenue is because I'm doing the work right that work and um so it wasn't that you didn't have a legitimate concern the problem was you weren't able to effectively say to your partner Hey listen Maybe This doesn't this doesn't feel Equitable to me how does it feel to you should we reconsider things exactly I didn't have the emotional tools to communicate maturely really is what it came down to I didn't have the tools to communicate my frustrations um peacefully and with gratitude and it's funny because after I went through this transformational workshop and and started practicing these tools and learning them and practicing them and integrating the healing I then later went back to this business partner that

[00:24:29] I didn't speak to for months and had a meeting with him and just thanked him I just said hey I'm so grateful for you I appreciate you uh and I was able to sit with him for a couple hours and find peace and actually then sell the business to him in a peaceful way but I didn't have the emotional tools on how to communicate effectively before then and afterwards he was like what happened to you like how did you communicate like this like I was so relieved because I thought you were to come here and you know get arguing and all these things um and I had the perfect storm of events

[00:24:59] I was in a an emotional up and down intimate relationship I was an emotional up and down business relations partnership and I was using the the frustration as an outlet with basketball and sports and I would kind of take all that aggression out on others in sports that's what I knew that's what I did in football you take all your anger out on someone else you inflict as much pain on them as possible but in a you know a legal activity right but you just spear them in their chest and their head as hard as you could you could hit people on the head back then head to head and there was no foul so you just head to head as hard as you can which probably caused a lot more brain travel I mean than I needed and at that time I was like I can only do this through basketball and then for me just I kept getting in more and more like kind of tiffs and shoving matches and eventually and this is literally just playing pickup basketball pick up basketball in a freaking Beverly Hills it's not like we're in the Mean Streets of Compton where there's bullets wasn't around or something this is just hanging out having fun with a bunch of you know 20 something year olds playing pickup ball on probably one of the nicest looking pick of basketball courts you can find and um for whatever reason when I felt like someone would give me a little like elbow to the side or they'd say something to me I felt like they were abusing me it felt like I was five years old the psychological child in me felt like this is an act of abuse and they're they could take it farther and farther and I could do everything in my power to protect myself physically emotionally psychologically uh because I never want that feeling of being powerless again

[00:26:47] I never want the feeling of being taken advantage of again and so it was a pattern that would repeat in different scenarios and again like you said that that fuel of needing to look good wanting to be right proving people wrong like building myself up to protect myself allowed me to be so consistent so driven willing to work at unlimited hours to get results but it left me feeling extremely empty lonely uh insecure and not free inside I still felt like a prisoner internally uh and so all these events came to a head around the same kind of few months and that was the wake-up call I don't think it I would have woken up if just one thing happened or you know but it was also so really it's these big three things right it's the your your best friend saying we can't yeah you shouldn't be playing basketball with us anymore yeah you can yeah your Your Business Partnership Your

[00:27:47] Business Partnership with your girlfriend yeah yeah so when you finally confront this harsh reality how do you then take the action how did you even figure out what this Workshop was did someone recommend it to you a few people recommended it to me kind of before this and I was like nah I'm good and what was it called it's called Mastery and transformational training and is an emotional intelligence Workshop in Los Angeles and there's a bunch of different these workshops out there they're kind of like five day workshops that that essentially have a bunch of different scenarios games and exercises to go back to show you how you react in life they're essentially designed to see how you are and create a mirror of real world scenarios in a small group setting with games activities one-to-one die ads um meditations and all these different things so you go back into the different events that caused pain stress overwhelm the things that keep you from being your most joyful authentic self now what is holding you back from giving your fullest self from being the most loving human being you can be from being your childlike joy as an adult what robbed you of your joy what took your joy away from you you know who hurt you essentially is what it's learning about and everyone goes through their own journey and their own experience but for me it was extremely powerful well actually that's kind of interesting

[00:29:17] Lewis that's a bit counter-intuitive um I can totally understand why for you that was the journey is that was that the explicit Journey for anybody who joined that in other words was anybody who came to that Workshop also put through a framework of anything that today is not happening for you that should be is probably tied to some for lack of a better word contamination of your true self as a child or was that kind of more your journey some type of belief I think there everyone goes through the same exercises and some of them didn't resonate with me I was like okay I got nothing out of it but for other people it was like the biggest I see eye-opening experience and then other exercises I was like oh my gosh this really impacted me in a big way and it was a big breakthrough and they're all designed to to show you how you show up in Life currently what's working for you what's not working for you and what are tools that you can use moving forward to be a better version of yourself it's essentially what it is through leadership training through emotional intelligence language things like that and um I got a lot out of it because again I think I had so much pain

[00:30:29] I was holding on to for 25 years and did you talk about it there for the first time I talked about it there for the first time and I remember like no girlfriend in the past knew my family didn't know I didn't tell any friends because I thought if people knew this about me no one would love me no one would accept me no one would be my friend and that was one of my biggest fears was people not accepting me but really what happened was I never fully accepted myself I wasn't able to forgive you know Find meaning in that experience and lots of different experience that occurred in my childhood and so I was just filled with so much Shame about these things and I thought if any of my like buddies knew these things about me my college football teammates or high school basketball team has knew this they wouldn't want me on the team and all I wanted to do was learn like how to fit in and be and belong but I never learned how to belong to myself and I think that's something a lot of people over the last 10 years of me doing the research I'm doing and you doing the research you're doing a lot of people from my experience don't know how to fully love and accept themselves with all the mess and all the stress and all the things they've been through and I'm saying you need to be proud of the things you've done there's many things in my past I'm not proud of but I can find meaning and accept and have compassion for the 11 year old that would steal candy bars you know almost every day for a year and a half and be like okay I I was that's where I was in my life I'm not proud of it but I can have compassion for the tools that I had the stress I was going through and then I stopped it and I transformed in a certain way so I I love that person and

[00:32:12] I heal that that person inside of me so that I am not in shame of all these different stages of my life because I don't think shame supports Us in in service it doesn't help us serve and give to the people we care about closest to us to our communities to our platforms whatever we're creating in the world it holds us back and for many years I couldn't sleep at night I would just sit up at night for about an hour hour and a half just ruminating and it was until after I started the healing

[00:32:40] Journey where I was able to fall asleep within minutes and it's been um you know it hasn't been a perfect Journey over the last 10 years but it's been a powerful journey of constantly healing do you remember what it was in the moment you were about to talk about this that gave you the the comfort that said like I in this moment I can do something that has seemed so taboo I mean it was it in part Lewis because they were strangers I mean did that make it a little easier in that moment it was part of it yeah it's part of it we it is this Workshop was like two weekend workshops so I did like a a four-day

[00:33:21] Workshop that kind of gave you some basic tools and understanding so we're kind of all on the same page of understanding like the language and tools and Leadership distinctions of accountability responsibility ownership of your life things like that it wasn't until the second weekend which was like a week and a half later where it got extremely intense I mean people are opening up and extremely vulnerable and crying and really sharing different things that had occurred so once other people started to share uh how messed up their life was it gave me permission to be like oh wow other people go through stuff too and way worse scenarios than I've gone through in certain areas um and I remember this was probably like the halfway mark of this this weekend

[00:34:08] Workshop and the first couple days of it the trainer the the facility the facilitator of the workshop said okay we've gone back and addressed a lot of the different things that have caused you to guard your heart that have caused you to be more Analytical in your mind and be less peaceful and not own your peace and own your love and give your love generously to others a lot of people just guard themselves right he said now we've addressed these different scenarios we've addressed your your mom your dad different scenarios from childhood we've done these different exercises and games then we have a reflection and journaling time kind of to start integrating these things and he said now we're not going to go back into the past anymore we've done enough we're going to start creating a vision of the future you want to create the who you want to be how you want to show up in the world what you want to create the type of relationship you want to have the type of dreams you want to manifest and we're going to start building tools into developing how to create that and getting clear on the vision you want for your life and he said but before we do if there's anyone who has yet to clear of their past and talk about or address the things something they need to talk about it's kind of like now is the time or forever hold your peace because we're moving forward we're not going back anymore let's go on with our lives and start creating a powerful Vision we can live into and the room is kind of silent and I remember just thinking to myself man I feel like I've been going all in on this

[00:35:51] Workshop like I I went all in talking about like challenges with my parents that I had about you know my brother going to prison and what that felt like about being dyslexic my entire childhood and being in Special Needs classes until I finished College uh you know just like being picked on being picked the last and sports all these things that were just kind of the painful memories I was like I talked about all of it and I go but why have I still not talked about this one thing like why have I yet to talk about it and for whatever reason I'll go it just kind of hit me I go I don't I don't know if I don't talk about this now I'll probably never speak about it in my life

[00:36:30] I'll probably keep it in my grave and I think it was just the the environment the the setting again other people were opening up before then it gave me the courage in that moment and I don't think I would have ever had the courage to speak to you know my future wife my you know my parents I don't think I would have told anyone because I didn't have the courage emotionally and I remember standing up there's probably 40 people in the room I remember standing up and kind of walking to the front of the room I didn't even like raise my hand I just stood up and walked in the room and this is what I remember I remember looking down at the carpet and walking through this story for the first time reliving it like I was in the bathroom being sexually abused by this man and it's almost like I could go to the the scene 25 years prior I could see the room the mirror the bathroom I could smell I could I could I went back there and I was so ashamed that I couldn't look up at anyone's eyes so I just stared down at the carpet and I walked through this kind of story step by step and I just said the whole thing and I remember walking back to my seat sitting down and just erupting with tears I just started bawling and I didn't really cry that much you know you're I was conditioned not to cry as an athlete and as a you know a man and I just bought I was bawling so much and it was so beautiful because there was two women on the sides of me um they're crying they're both hugging me and embracing me the whole room is like starting to cry and I'm just like my life is over that's what I thought and so I run out of the room I get so scared I ran out of the room and I left I left the event I went outside to the um you know out of this kind of hotel conference room and I went outside it's kind of back alley of this hotel and I'm putting my head in my on my hands like on the wall in this back alley just like sobbing and I was just like uh I'm never going back in there

[00:38:46] I'm done I'm going home like my life is over and one of the most beautiful things that happened in my life a memory of mine that I that I'm it was a beautiful moment was I felt this tap on my shoulder as I'm kind of like crying and on this uh wall and I turn around and it's probably a 55 60 year old man big guy and he's looking at me in my eyes he's probably my same height eye to eye staring at me crying and he said you're my hero I will follow you anywhere I remember this vividly he said you're my hero I will follow you anywhere and I had everything wrong about you again I was kind of showing up with an ego and you know thought I knew it all and all this stuff and he goes I had everything wrong about you and he goes let me tell you something uh you know I'm in my late 50s I've got four kids I've been married for 25 years my wife doesn't know my kids don't know no one knows this happened to me when I was 11 for many years and it was it's still the deepest secret that I have you're the first person that knows thank you for having the courage to open up and give me permission to start talking about it I'm gonna go tell my wife tonight I'm gonna start the healing Journey thank you and I was like

[00:40:01] I'm just kind of in shock I'm still like emotional I'm a wreck he's hugging me we're crying together and then one by one probably like 12 or 13 men come out of the room and they all come and give me a hug and not everyone had been sexually abused but a few other guys had been and they all came to me and said this happened to me when I was eight this happened to me when I was 13. this happened to me when I was seven and these few of the guys kind of said

[00:40:29] I've never told anyone thank you for opening it up this was so this is back in 2013. uh 10 years ago when I did this and I was kind of like wow okay other men have experienced this and they started talking about it and it was very therapeutic and very healing for us to experience it the weekend you know I go on over the next few days and finish the event and have a powerful experience of just catharsis and healing and and then sharing these these vulnerable moments with other people who had similar experiences which was extremely powerful but I remember thinking to myself like I can't tell my family like these are strangers I never have to see them again like you said uh what's my family gonna say what are my friends gonna say are they gonna be as emotionally available and courageous to be able to receive this information um and uh that was a fear and concern of mine but eventually I ended up telling them all I I reached out to a therapist friend of mine afterwards and I said hey this is something that happened that I started to open up about it but I'm terrified to tell my family and friends because I don't think they'll accept me and I said what's a what's a process I can use to connect with them to see if they're available to hear it and this friend of mine said um ask them all a question before you share with them ask them this question is there anything I could ever say or do that would make you not love me and based on their response if you feel like they're receiving of it then you can open up and talk about it and so I did that one by one with my family and then my friends and um you know it brought me closer to all of them they started to open up about things that I didn't know about them things that they went through I had no clue about and it brought it brought us closer together it created a stronger

[00:42:23] Bond of intimacy and connection and that was really the journey where I was like wow I've been missing out my entire life 25 years of true intimacy and real authentic connection because I'd been hiding myself from so many people and it doesn't mean you've got to reveal all your darkest secrets to everyone right now and publicly I'm not saying that's the case um but I do believe that we are missing out on something extremely beautiful and we will never be peaceful and fully free internally or externally until we can accept the things of our past that were most ashamed of and afraid of and insecure about we will always be a prisoner in our heart and mind until we can face it and accept it and embrace it you know prior to this this moment um what was your relationship like with your parents and your siblings

[00:43:23] I had a challenging relationship with my parents I had a it was kind of interesting I mean I loved my parents I had some great moments with them but I begged them to send me away because I just grew up in a lot of a stressful environment my parents were kind of explosive with each other growing up you know they should have probably never been married they got married when they're 18 they didn't have the emotional tools things like that until later in life so they stayed together because of the kids and then just kept having more kids but they probably shouldn't have stayed married right that that's probably not what it should have happened and so I just grew up in a lot of uncertainty and fear um and I don't blame them you know they were doing their best but it's one of the reasons what made me want to leave because I was the youngest all my other siblings were out of the house now I was 13 and I was just like I don't want to be in this stress I want to I want to be in a peaceful environment so subconsciously it was like the thing that wanted to drive me away and I was also doing kind of bad things at his 11 12 year old just stealing and just hanging out with people that weren't the best people that were influencing me to do bad things but I wasn't accepted by like other people in school so I just found anyone I could cling on to that would accept me and I was just like I don't want to be in this environment I don't want to live this life anymore I want to be around good kids good people and um so I had you know my my parents were great they would show up to all my sports games they're extremely supportive they encouraged me to follow my dreams they taught me a lot of great lessons but their modeling of a relationship was not a good model for me so that caused some underlying stress so again I had a great relationship but also a I didn't want to be around them but I loved them kind of dynamic um and I was away from them for five years you know I only went home for like a couple weeks in Christmas and breaks and here and there they would come out and visit and watch games but it would be for a few hours and then they're gone so I really was like lived alone with roommates from 13 to 18. and and my siblings were all older they were often College doing their life so we had a good relationship but I didn't see them that often and um and I remember 30

[00:45:40] I was like I want to reconnect with my family more and build stronger bonds and stronger relationships and so that allowed me to to start that process and your brother obviously by this point you know he's long since back from prison sounds like he's got his life completely back together yeah was he was he were you guys close um or you know the age gap of 11 years you know by that point he for all we know he's got a family he's he's kind of moved on you're the little brother um but but was that I mean let me rephrase this question I guess when you think about your siblings and your parents and your friends were you most concerned with with who in that group of having that discussion probably more of my friends to be honest because again I I still wanted to like belong in society beyond my family you know your family's got to kind of love you and accept you no matter what at the end of the day they're stuck with you essentially so I knew that like okay I told my family first and after I told them I was like in my mind well they have to accept me you know and after what my brother went through of course they're gonna accept me no matter what like um but my friends will they accept me and that was probably the scarier thing to talk to them about um but all of them were extremely like supportive and hey I got your back and open and loving and and again it just brought me a lot of inner peace which I never had because I I didn't have because I was being inauthentic to who I was and to accepting myself to fully loving and being acceptance of myself and therefore others didn't know who I was and so they weren't able to fully accept me because I wasn't able to reveal who I was and I think that was the challenge that I was facing with that I was always putting on a mask listen I was a happy fun-loving guy I was very I was the same as I am now but I just wasn't as vulnerable but I was fun I would like play you know all these different things but I just felt like something inside like I wasn't revealing and it was eating me up constantly you know I know you've had one of my best friends on your podcast Paul Conte so Paul Paul was uh Paul was probably one of the first people I met in medical school so we went to med school together and we've you know been largely

[00:48:00] Inseparable since and as you know Paul's sort of what I would consider one of the one of the experts on the topic of trauma one of the things I'm curious about is and as you as you think about the the the the line between trauma which would be probably net negative again I I describe these things as some positive some negative but that's probably a net negative versus adversity some positive and some negative probably a net positive where do you draw that line and I don't necessarily just mean in your life but I mean like as a person thinking about their own experiences where does one draw that line

[00:48:40] I try to think of adversity and Trauma as where can I find the meaning in both of them and and how can I find the useful tools that could come from them before I think I was just afraid of trauma and more embraced adversity you know the challenges of overcoming being down in a sports game or getting a minor injury and fighting through it you know playing with a broken wrist for 14 games as an athlete which is something I did playing with three broken ribs it was kind of like that's the adversity and you just got to tough it out and overcome adversity those are also kind of traumatic events too like breaking bones and just living with physical wound trauma but I looked at it differently than the emotional trauma the psychological trauma which really shaped my personality and my identity and as uh you know Dr Joe dispenza says your personality becomes your personal reality and that became part of my personal reality based on these emotional and psychological traumatic wounds um it became my inner world and then a reflection in my outer world of how I react and so I really look at them now that both of these events adversity and

[00:49:53] Trauma can be extremely beneficial if we find meaning and usually it's harder to find the meaning from traumatic experiences and things that no one wants to go through you don't want your enemies to go through loss of you know people close to you sexual abuse psychological abuse you know horrible things that happen in the world uh mass shootings like these things we don't want to happen ever to anyone and it's hard to find the meaning but I'm sure as you know uh you know

[00:50:26] Man's Search for meeting with Viktor Frankl and Edith Edgar who I've had on a couple of times who is a holocaust Survivor when she talked about watching her parents go into the you know the gas chamber uh in Auschwitz and the trauma that she faced for so many decades it wasn't until she went back there herself and was able to face it and forgive herself because he essentially told the truth to the officer and when the officer asked her is this your sister or your mom and she said my mom and so she watched her mom go and be executed and if she just would have lied and said her sister maybe her mom would have stayed alive and she had to like relive that facing it and find forgiveness in herself for the teenager that was fearful insecure didn't have the tools wasn't to be able to navigate such a traumatic moment and she was able to find peace and meaning from that and use the meaning to be of service to others and I think um I don't think any one of us are going to get out of this life without experiencing some type of little T big tree Big T trauma and and they can all be extremely overwhelming feelings and I think it's our mission and our goal to figure out what is the meaning from it how can how could I benefit from it and serve others in this meaning as well when you think about you don't have kids do you no not yet um do you think you want to yeah yeah so when you when you think about um having kids um obviously even though you don't have them I'm sure you can appreciate there's a very protective nature that comes up I mean I think every parent looks at their kid and thinks I want to Shield them from the bad things that happen to me and I want them to have wonderful experiences and yet of course there's always a fear that if we take that to an extreme we deprive them of something right um you know for me and I've talked about this with Paul I feel like that's a litmus test for me of you know the type of adversity that is you know character building and valuable maybe not getting picked for a sports team it hurts in the moment but I mean it also produces a lot of good um 100 versus this this this you know this sexual abuse when you're five it's just hard to say you know I don't think any parent under any circumstance could say I'd be okay with that happening to my kid even if on the other side of it it's going to become a huge part of their you know defining characteristic and it will make them a wonderful and empathic person you just you just couldn't imagine them going through that as as that child and and so I'm just kind of curious as you think about what this means for the the lumps and bumps in life yeah I mean here's the thing that those experiences could have ruined me you know had I not had supportive people around me 25 years later to encourage me to talk about it to go you know get support get coaching go therapy try workshops like I feel like I've done so many different therapeutic experiences in the last decade uh and tried it all and I'm like

[00:54:02] I'm always coming from a beginner's mind now since that 10 years ago uh Workshop because before I thought I knew it all I thought I had all the answers and it didn't give me a sense of peace now I go into stuff just like you do with how can I learn how can I learn from anyone about something and how can I come into it with a beginner's mind and be open-minded um you know I would never want my kids to experience what I experienced and I would have never want any kid to experience this um

[00:54:32] I don't think there's any good that comes from it I honestly don't think I had to find meaning from the traumatic experience I had to I got to find meeting so that I could have peace in my heart and I realized if I didn't create peace in my heart and Find meaning then it would have ruined me I probably would have gotten in more fights I would have been more reactive I would have blown up my life and that's what was starting to happen I was you know accomplishing more and more so I was becoming more well known and I had more to lose and if I didn't learn the tools of emotional regulation of healing of effective communication and it doesn't mean I'm perfect and I've got it all figured out but if I didn't learn how to use those tools then I probably would have done a lot more damage to myself and to people around me um because I would have been unwilling to process and so for me it was the the meaning behind it all that supported me and and having more compassion and empathy because I didn't have that before I discovered the meaning and um again I don't wish it upon anyone

[00:55:39] I don't wish trauma upon anyone this Jordan Peterson says we want to you know you don't want to protect your kids you want to create a safe environment where they feel loved by you and accepted but you want to allow them to be vulnerable because that's how they get stronger that's how they can develop courage when challenging things happen when U.S parents are not around and they can have the tools to take on the adversities of life it's like a balance and I'm sure you've got more wisdom than me of I I see myself with my kids it's wanting to give them so much love and acceptance uh but also putting them through the most adversity I can in safe containers uh to give them tools of overcoming and learning how to do it on their own yeah I think my wife and I kind of talk about it as you know we have three kids uh so five eight and fourteen um the the mental model I use is that of the immune system so um I think it's it's it's really well known at this point it was once speculated but I think it's generally completely accepted that if you took a child when they're born and put them in an environment where their immune system is never challenged so so for lack of a better word you just you put them in a bubble yes and you think well they're never going to get sick it's true they won't get sick but something worse is going to happen which is their immune system will turn on themselves and they will develop ravaging autoimmunity really absolutely so so uh an unchallenged immune system remember the immune system is

[00:57:14] I mean I'm probably biased because I you know studied Immunology but um the immune system is one of the most remarkable systems in the body this idea of SEC of selection negative and positive selection meaning how do we develop a system that is so good at recognizing self from non-self and you go through thymic selection with the T cells when you're an infant and all of these things but it's a potent system I mean it's a very potent system and it has remarkable killing capacity and um that's what keeps us safe I mean especially from viruses I mean viruses are you know we really don't have good drugs to combat viruses the way we do bacteria um but nevertheless when children are put in a position where they do not have enough exposure and we see this with food allergies all the time I mean there's it's not a coincidence that we're seeing nut allergies go through the roof as kids are having less and less exposure to nuts when they grow up so what the one end of the spectrum you have you put your kids in a you know in a bubble and they don't get sick but something worse happens which is their immune system attacks themselves so they end up with Ravis you know ravensing autoimmunity at the other end of the spectrum if you you know make them eat fecal matter all the time and you know you put them in an environment that is the most filthy also their immune system they can't do enough and they're just going to be so sick and in fact the reality is that's how we used to die I mean prior to the Advent of antibiotics and things like that and when we had no sterilization I mean you know mortality was you know our life expectancy was literally half what it is today largely on the back of infectious diseases right so there's this happy medium right where your immune system has to be honed to be strong enough to know what is Lewis and what is not Lewis so that it always attacks not Lewis and um but not so tuned that it's always having to be on and then you're overwhelmed by this and

[00:59:12] I you know that's kind of how we think about it with kids right which is like it's pretty good when they don't make a sports team once in a while it's pretty good when they finish last in a race and they're embarrassed about it because they didn't train that hard or it's pretty good when you know they don't they blow a test because they didn't really like these things are really good but at the other end of the spectrum I I for me and this is this really comes from discussions with Paul and a few others it's it's something that you said in your story that I think really resonated the thing that we really want to avoid is children having a feeling of complete helplessness

[00:59:49] I think I think if I if I were if I were trying to articulate it I suspect that perhaps the most traumatic thing about your experience as a child was the total helplessness and and I think the helplessness and the shame then kind of compound each other and I think that's the thing that that is the the root of all evil and it's not just sort of sexual abuse right it's I think children can experience that all the way I mean I don't know did you ever take the um adverse childhood event score the ace test no but I I should never heard of it yeah it's it's very interesting so so we have a lot of our patients take it if um if if it's something that we we think is interesting and relevant and potentially you know germane to their care so it's a it's a standardized test of 10 questions and uh it's simple yes or no right so for example have you been sexually abused uh did you grow up in a household where your parents were divorced did you grow up in a household where you know one of your parents physically assaulted the other did you grow up in a household where you were physical you just keep going going you know it's funny one of the things is not did you grow up in I don't think

[01:01:01] I think it's it did you grow up in a household where a parent went to prison which I think effectively would be true for you because an 11 year old sibling is effectively yeah 11 year older yeah yeah yeah he was 18 yeah I mean yeah so so if you go through the the the ace and we'll we'll link to this in the show notes for our podcast as well yeah so if you go through and fill out the adverse childhood event score um there's a there's a um basically a histogram that shows for people who have zero one two three four five six seven eight or nine ten ten out of ten what is the predictive value of this on both physical health and emotional health later in life geez and it's probably not surprising that the more you score on that the worse your emotional health meaning the greater the likelihood of anxiety depression suicidality and these things that that probably doesn't come across as a big surprise what I think comes across as a bit of a surprise admittedly there are confounders here is physical health meaning the higher your Ace the worse your physical health as you age um and again I suspect that there is there's a component to that that's probably confounded by socioeconomic factors that factor into this right we're going to see higher Ace scores in lower socioeconomic status and therefore that's going to also confound health status but I can't believe that that's it right like it has to be that at least in my experience looking at this in a in a small but relatively controlled environment that that people aren't able to take care of themselves which is a big part of Health if they have so much unresolved trauma that's what I was going to say I think it's like if you live with a higher score meaning you've experienced more dramatic you know moments as a kid I think and you haven't learned how to heal and navigate them in a healthy coping mechanism way processing the trauma healing and being on the Journey of consistent healing then I just feel like you know more than me you've been studying the immune system for a long time your immune system is so under attack if it's in fight or flight constantly reliving the past traumatic events that you haven't healed yet so if it feels like it's still a five-year-old eight-year-old 12 year old in these moments and you're stacking all of them on your body and your immune system at once connecting the thoughts like Paul

[01:03:28] Conte talks about to the immune system consistently you do that for a long period of time like your body probably just can never fully process they probably can't build the strength and and recover and get rid of the bad cells the way it needs to with that much trauma and when I feel like we learn to create the environment of peace and Harmony and alignment and our heart connect to our mind then the body will start to follow obviously we got to take the right actions and and do the right decisions of our nutrition and our you know our movement and things like that consistently but

[01:04:06] I just feel like there's a lot less pressure in my heart and I used to feel a lot of pain in my chest uh and it wasn't until a couple of years ago physical pain really physical like kind of like sharp chest pain right that would come and go and it wasn't related to working out you know it was related I remember the moment two years ago I I did a five month intensive therapy coaching experience so I did lots of different modalities over the last 10 years 10 years ago really helped me kind of process the sexual abuse and I and I practiced that for a few years and I really felt peace and free around that kind of experience in life I processed other stuff with my parents at different stages in the last 10 years um and I really felt like I did a lot of good work but I was still having this chest pain and this kind of like throat clenching almost kind of like someone was strangling me at different times not 24 7 but when there was a trigger an emotional response to something happening externally I'd feel like a clench like someone was strangling me or someone was like pressing a weight on my heart and it was kind of this chest pain it was like it's like I couldn't breathe fully and this was happening on and off because I still hadn't healed a lot of things in Intimate

[01:05:32] Relationships I was still afraid in intimacy with romantic Partners uh over the last 10 years and it wasn't until the last relationship I was in that again it was kind of like a a perfect storm of events happening over and over again where I start to finally recognize and have the courage that I was abandoning myself and I was repeating this pattern of abandoning who I was my values my vision my my identity my beliefs to please one person that I thought I loved and was in an intimate relationship with in order to make them happy and and keep the peace externally with that partner and partners in the past I would change who

[01:06:22] I was to make them happy and this was a pattern after multiple relationships that I realized oh I am at the center I'm the common denominator of all these previous relationships of why they're not working out I'm choosing uh based on a wound I'm staying based on a wounds and I'm abandoning myself on who I truly am based on wounds and so two years ago I said enough is enough like I don't feel stress or pain around the sexual abuse I don't feel stress or pain about being picked on as a kid in school anymore all this stuff like I felt like I was able to process that

[01:07:00] I still didn't have the courage to be a hundred percent who I was in intimacy and I'm so glad I found this uh therapist who she's more of a coach but she does therapy work too and for the last two years every two weeks I do a session with her and for the first five months I was going ever pretty much every week I was doing five six seven hour sessions on Saturdays uh individual sessions and joint sessions in the relationship that I was doing as well I was like this is either gonna work or we got to get out of this thing and um we got to figure out how to find

[01:07:35] Harmony together in the previous relationship and after five months of doing this there wasn't any Improvement we weren't aligned on our values it was so far me me and the previous relationship our values when we start going these sessions together in couples therapy and it got to the point where I just was finally like I can't live like this I can't be in a relationship with someone and change all my values and beliefs to make them happy it doesn't work for me anymore but that's how I was repeating that pattern in previous relationships and I was attracting people that didn't have the same shared values vision and lifestyle for whatever reason there was a wound that I was doing this from and I finally and why do you think that was I mean do you think that you were finding somebody that had a hole that you felt you could fill or 100 yeah 100 yes I felt like okay they need me right there's something I can do to support them and help them and feel needed in some way it wasn't even conscious but as

[01:08:37] I reflect back of it it's an unconscious thing that I was repeating and also there was there was a you know a pattern that I was following from the model of my parents relationship obviously that had to be in there as well and I was trying to fix my parents through the relationships I was in I was trying to find a way on my 5 8 10 16 year old self because they got divorced too on how could I make it work and they were never just aligned and Louis was there you know in this five month period even though that seemed like their relationship was not come to uh make amends was were you experiencing changes in you were you growing as a as a uh in response to this therapy well here's the interesting thing you know uh I feel like I have the opportunity to meet so many interesting people to interview on my show that I'm interviewing Paul Conte

[01:09:28] I'm interviewing uh Dr Romney uh on on narcissism I'm interviewing all these different therapists and experts on neuroscience and and I'm starting to I'm doing my own therapy I'm interviewing people about trauma relationships healing and all these things are starting to connect the dots after about five months and there was a moment

[01:09:51] I remember there's a moment where I went away for a weekend to go to this like kind of business Mastermind with probably some people that you know in the industry and I'm with Tony Robbins and a bunch of people uh you know at this kind of private Mastermind event in Florida and the person I was dating at the time she was supposed to come but like the day before she got mad at me for something and was like I'm not going and I remember going to this event and feeling so much love from people just feeling like accepted feeling loved feeling celebrated for the person that I was showing up as and yet I wasn't able to experience that you know at home and in this relationship and I was forcing it and trying to make it work and changing who I was to to to belong and fit in in the relationship and I remember texting the therapist at that time being like I I can't do this anymore I don't know what to do and she texted me back and said the veil you're starting to lift the veil you're starting to realize and see the things that aren't working right whereas before I was just trying to make them work and I was giving in and abandoning myself to please one person but I was abandoning who I was I wasn't pleasing myself in that in that and I was letting go of my authentic higher self and so over the next like month we go more and more deeper into therapy together individually and together and there was a a moment where I was doing it with the coach therapist and she was talking about my parents and

[01:11:23] I was like I just don't want to feel trapped I want to feel free it was kind of this whole thing was connecting the dots from like 38 years of life and my brother in prison and watching my parents be trapped in a relationship in a marriage and be unhappy and I was afraid of being trapped and all these different things and for whatever reason after five months of doing this she said to me Louis you're free you can walk away at any time you don't need to keep forcing things you are free and for whatever reason it just somehow connected in my heart where I actually understood the concept because I didn't understand the concept I didn't believe that I could be free internally even if things weren't working out externally and I thought I had to do whatever it took to make it work I thought I had to go all in even harder and sacrifice who

[01:12:15] I was to just please one person when we just weren't aligned on our values and vision and that's okay and I lacked the emotional courage to walk away and I like the emotional courage in every relationship before this to walk away when I knew we weren't Alliance and we weren't a right match and in that moment it's like this whole all the pain that was in my heart like I could feel the pain this whole time somehow like disintegrated I don't know how to explain this event other than there was a pain in my chest for on and off throughout my entire life and then it disintegrated and I haven't felt this pain in the last year and a half the pain it come with like a ball of energy like you kind of felt like there was I don't know disintegrating throughout all my body and it just I felt like I could breathe and I had peace internally for the first time and I believed it and I owned it and the fascinating thing that happened after this is I started showing up for myself and I didn't abandon myself again over the next I don't know a few weeks of the relationship then I got cleared I was just like no this is my value this is my boundary this is what I'm creating and it didn't she didn't like that she didn't like me not giving in and not giving her what she wanted all the time she wanted me to be the person I was being to give her what she wanted and I was like that doesn't work for me and here's my boundary and here's what I'm willing to do and I'm not willing to do this and it became so clear to me that it was time to walk away and I had so much peace even in the chaos of her not liking me and in the relationship I was never okay with hurting someone that I cared about before this and so I would just kind of give in and mold to try to make it work abandoning myself in the process and so it was such a beautiful thing you know getting to interview Paul

[01:14:11] Conte and so many other experts as I was living this moment and as I was experiencing this experience in this physically emotionally and connecting the dots mentally and tying it all back to the childhood stuff it was like Wow for the actual first time I feel pain-free in my body and it wasn't because of something I was doing physical it was psychological and emotional trauma and wounds that were still hurting me that I hadn't faced and fully addressed and as my coach and therapist says you know healing is a journey you know it doesn't always happen overnight there was a moment when the pain went away but it didn't mean there weren't Tremors and you know some

[01:14:53] PTSD feelings that I had to keep breathing through and practicing and integrating these lessons and uh you know other moments that I was like okay am I gonna go back into fear and how I used to be or am I going to lean into courage lean into owning who I am and not abandoning myself and every time I kept stepping into the emotional courage and speaking my truth being real to myself and to the people uh that were upset with me and just saying well I'm sorry you feel this way but this is my vision and we're just not a good match it gave me so much more confidence peace courage energy Freedom that I'd never fully experienced in Intimate

[01:15:33] Relationships and it has been a complete Game Changer in every area of my life since integrating these lessons and being consistent with it when I feel a sense of like oh okay I could go back into that old way of being but I'm just gonna show up know that it may be a little um disturbance but I'm going to be okay

[01:15:55] I'm safe I'm okay and I'm gonna be able to manage it it's it's been a beautiful Journey but it has taken a lot of emotional training and consistency I mean I did an eight hour therapy session one day on a Saturday to just say I'm all in I'm committed to Peace and Freedom and what I've realized that it's truly hard to live a fulfilling Rich abundant um joyful life peaceful life unless we are willing to face the wounds the fears the insecurities the shames the guilt all that stuff that has held us back and uh the more I interview these experts who study this much more than me and the more I experience it firsthand and see the actual results personally

[01:16:45] I'm just convinced that when we Face the emotional trauma psychological traumas of our past and we own it and we process it we will be free I mean I think one of the things I take away from this story that I I think is really important for for anybody listening to you is that um and you've stated this but I think it's worth reiterating these are not um digital switches right so digital it's either zero or one so it's not like in 2013 you went to this Workshop when your life was about to implode you um obviously had a very powerful experience there and you reveal perhaps the greatest of the t's in your bag of teas yes um but then you went to one and it was all good no it's actually it's much more analog right analog is like it dials and it dials up and it dials down and dials up and it dials down and um and I think the the reason I think that's important is it can be very discouraging I suspect when you make progress and then you take a step backwards right yeah I mean I thought I did a lot of the work and then I was like well why am I still repeating this pattern in Intimacy in relationships and I was like well I I healed this I healed this but why is this still coming up and I think you know life is interesting and funny in that way where every new season or every new chapter or every new stage of life you know I'm sure when I have kids I'm going to need to face things courageously that have that are from childhood still or from different wounds that I have that I'm gonna have to face and show up and have the courage and be able to sit in discomfort when my kids are crying or when my kids are kids are sick or when they're afraid I'm gonna have to learn how to become a better emotional leader and lean into these things that held me back in the past and have that emotional courage and I think uh you know as we build our business I'm gonna have to do things I've never done before and step into that emotional courage in relationship in children all that stuff as we age you know everything is going to have to have more and more courage you know it's funny you mentioned aging you're you're obviously young enough that you know I guess you're not at that point where you're thinking about mortality much or are you I mean how much do you think about that I think about it every day I think about it every day multiple times a day my father just passed away a year ago and when I was 20 21 he got into a car accident that caused a traumatic brain injury the car that he got hit by came on top of the windshield and the bumper of that car came through his windshield and hit him in the forehead splitting his head open he was on a trip to New Zealand with his then girlfriend at the time after my parents had been divorced years later and he was you know cut out of the car was cut open they had to airlift him to a hospital in New Zealand and he was in a coma for three months asleep and so this was another traumatic event that happened to someone close to me someone

[01:19:55] I cared about deeply a mentor of mine someone that was there for me in a lot of ways and for many years probably four or five years I was really angry and upset and afraid because he was in a lot of ways a big mentor and a teacher of mines and supported me to Chase my dreams he encouraged me in every way possible to go after my dreams he did a lot he gave me a lot of lessons when I was a kid you know we some things

[01:20:24] I didn't understand until later we never he never celebrated my birthday and when I was a kid it upset me and then when I was you know probably like 9 10 11. I was like Dad why don't we ever have a birthday for me there's all these other kids that have birthday parties but I never have a birthday party and he said I never want you to be limited by your age most people I see make an excuse that they're too young to try something or they're too old and it's too late and I never want you to have that excuse and so he gave me a lot of meaningful lessons and I was like well we can still have a cake dad you know we could still have a party and just not celebrate the age um and so when he went through his coma it was extremely traumatizing for our entire family it's kind of like my brother going to prison like a that type of experience where was this uncertainty this fear this loss he got out three months later came back to the USA he couldn't speak for almost a year so he could barely walk he couldn't speak and um it was so hard to see again another Hero

[01:21:28] Of Mine who didn't have the ability to live his full personality and his life and for many years he did you know different therapies physically psychologically all these different things he eventually was able to talk again he was eventually able to you know kind of write some uh and and function minimally but he could never work again he stayed in home pretty much 24 7. sometimes he could get out and walk a little bit but he had so many different broken bones and ammonia and collapsed lungs and the brain trauma was so intense that essentially he was physically alive but mentally and emotionally he had died and so that was another hard thing to witness my father who was a hero of mine and a big inspiration in a lot of ways not perfect and made a lot of mistakes but still a big inspiration unable to have a real conversation with him every time I'd see him it is hey son um where'd you go to school again didn't choose to play uh what sport did you use to play oh you try you played football um or sometimes get me confused with my other brother and call me Chris and it was the same conversation on repeat for 17 years until he just passed a year ago and again I don't wish that upon anyone I don't want anyone's father or loved one to go through a traumatic brain injury car accident and to have them physically alive but have to take care of them like you know a five-year-old change his diapers take care of him you know make sure he's not burning himself on the stove he couldn't drive he couldn't do any of these things so it was a such an emotional sadness to have that loss and see him physically unable to live the life that he once had when that happened

[01:23:35] I got so clear that I was going to do whatever it took if I had any dream inside of me I was doing it but there was no fear or failure it was just I'm doing it and if I fail I'm fine with it because I don't want to die regretting that I didn't do that at least go for it so shortly after that I went and went and tried out for professional football teams and made a pro football team because that was my dream then I got injured two years later

[01:24:06] I had this dream of playing the Olympics and I moved to New York City I figured out how to make money and move to New York City to play with the uh a handball team and learn the sport of handball and try to make the USA team I made the USA team a year after that I traveled the world with the USA team while I'm building a business and doing it digitally and virtually running webinars and things like that all over the world to pursue a dream that I'm not getting paid to do just because I knew this is something that I wanted to do and at least give it a shot playing in Spain and Israel and Luxembourg and Canada and

[01:24:39] Mexico and Uruguay and Argentina and Brazil all over the world paying for my own travel to represent my country where USA across my chest be able to sing the national anthem and play against Olympic teams on a pursuit of trying to make the Olympics we never qualified but it doesn't mean that my dream was just because the dream didn't come true doesn't mean it wasn't a dream come true the experiences the lessons the growth the adversity I faced the injuries I overcame all these things and my dad never was able to watch he was alive but he never came to a game he didn't really understand what life was anymore so for 17 years

[01:25:23] I went after everything in these last 17 years because I knew that this could happen to me at any moment I knew that my life is not guaranteed today tomorrow and it gave me a lot of courage to say yes I wrote a book before I was 25 and I almost flunked out of English in high school but I was just like I don't care if I'm embarrassed I'd rather be embarrassed and give it a shot than be regretting that I never tried this and I let the dream die inside of me and I really believe a lot of people I really believe self-doubt is the killer of dreams and people hold on to their insecurities and self-doubt so much that they really never launched the dream or even try for it and for me the the results are irrelevant because it's about the things I learn about myself the people I meet the connections the the moments that are meaningful along the way and I know you hear that all the time but for me it became so real when my father had this accident and

[01:26:28] I had to learn how to accept it you know after four or five years when it was just like kind of a suffering depression around my father hoping he'd recover hoping he'd get back to who he was I had to learn to accept it that he sometimes isn't going to remember who I am that he's going to have the same conversation on repeat that he's going to forget he lost a lot of his memory so he just forgot about childhood stuff that he would never call me again that he we would never have a meaningful really relationship and I had some great moments with him and some great conversations uh in the last few years before he passed but it was essentially a really sad time for 17 years and it was almost like I didn't get to grieve emotionally until last year um his death even though physically he was alive he was kind of immensely and emotionally gone and so I feel like these last two years of therapy the process of death uh my father going through this accident 17 years ago gave me so much Clarity that I've got to take care of my body I've got to take care of my mind I've got to take care of my emotions that it could all be gone at any moment and I want to be proud of the actions I'm taking and it doesn't mean

[01:27:44] I've always been perfect but I want to be proud knowing that I went after the dreams so I think about death daily I reflect on it I think about it and I appreciate my life every day you know just this morning I ordered one of those calendars that is a week calendar for your life I'm sure you've seen these calendars yeah I saw you having the guy on Bill Perkins who was talking yeah so Bill Perkins uh who's an amazing guy and and yeah we got talking about that on the podcast and I was like you know what like I'm such an analytical guy and I feel like I know this but there's no substitute for the reminder every single day and so so actually just this morning you know by coincidence I I ordered the calendar so it's uh you know I set my life expectancy at 88 years and I plugged my birth date in and it's already filled in the boxes that are you know because I'm basically 50 so it's filled in the first you know 50 times 12 boxes so I'm more than halfway there right more you know it's basically saying this is what 38 years more of life looks but to your point look it could be could be one month like I don't we don't know never know my yeah my dad went on this trip not thinking he was going in this accident you know yeah and it's funny because my friend Nas daily I don't know if you've ever seen this creator online

[01:29:03] Nas daily has worn one shirt for the last like seven years and it's a shirt that has like a battery and it says like 33 uh life and that's how much life he's lived and it shows you how much life he has every day he looks in the mirror he wears the same shirt as a reminder to live his full life today and is it a shirt that he changes every year and reduces the percent exactly every year it changes into a new shirt he's got like 20 of them you know for the year and he wears the same thing you just it's he doesn't wear anything else in every video it says the same thing yeah wow um Louis one one final thought just before we wrap up I know we've we don't uh we don't have you know all day as much as I'm sure we would enjoy that um you've made a very compelling case for how different modalities of therapy have changed your life what do you say to someone who's listening to us or watching us right now who says hmm I can really see how in Lewis's case that was necessary you know but I don't think it's necessary for me you know I I don't imagine I would ever need therapy

[01:30:16] I mean I never went through the horrific things that he went through um and yeah I mean my relationships aren't perfect um you know I can be a little reactive um um but but you know there can't be any upside in in talking about this because there's nothing to really talk about I'm sure you encountered this all the time how do you how do you make the case to somebody like that or what's the case that you make well I feel like I've tried a lot of stuff and I'm sure I could try a lot more uh you know from emotional intelligence workshops for years too

[01:30:55] I was you know I went to India and studied meditation to become a meditation instructor for many weeks um I you know I did I took a a bunch of guys to Ice uh to uh to Wim Hof in Poland and did like a private thing with him jumping in frozen rivers and doing the whole breathing and meditation and Ice training and mindset training uh

[01:31:16] I've done I've done you know seven day meditation Retreats with Joe dispenza I've tried lots of different things and I've done coaching I've had therapy I've done all these different things and here's what I say you know I try to think of in a practical sense as an athlete and studying the great athletes and interviewing a lot of world champions from Kobe Bryant to Nova Novak Djokovic to Olympic gold medalists um all the great athletes who get to the top have coaches they have coaches in their field of expertise to support them in winning their Sport and becoming the best when they win they don't say I've got it all figured out uh you know I'm at the top I've got it all figured out I don't need coaches anymore they actually go and hire more coaches that are specialized in different modalities to improve the nutrition and mobility and strength training and whatever it might be they hire more Elite coaches when they're at the top to continue to sustain that and get better they don't say I've got it figured out and for whatever reason in the matters of emotions love relationships and understanding our own emotions and how we interact with triggering events in the world

[01:32:34] I don't really remember being taught how to navigate that as a kid growing up sure I was taught as an athlete in a coaching environment how to overcome stressful situations and set goals and work with the team but when it came to love when it came to intimacy when it came to running a business these aren't things that I learned in school some of the things transferred over but it wasn't really there and coaches and therapy and workshops have supported me in developing more tools that helped me overcome my fears and insecurities and become a better more authentic version of myself that allowed me to have more peace and more abundance and I think there's a lot of people that live a really good life even if they have stresses and they're not you know not perfect but they live a good life but I think that holds people back from living an abundant joyful peaceful life and being willing to just try new stuff and it doesn't mean everything I've tried works for me and it doesn't have to work for you either you know there's a lot of people that talk about psychedelics and mushrooms and all these things and that doesn't speak to me you know it's not something that calls me in my life at this point maybe in the future it will so be willing to try stuff listen to your friends and family you know when when they're listening to you on your podcast you've got a lot of great recommendations for these things and and learn from the experts Paul Conte is another great every person learn from what he's doing and just try stuff maybe some of it works maybe someone doesn't but what I will say is do not wait until things get to the perfect storm in your life unfortunately that's what it takes for a lot of people to start doing the work in themselves but do your best to just be a constant learner and growing and developing in your emotional Journey one last thing you've used the word peaceful a lot I suspect that's not a coincidence or an accident I think that's probably quite deliberate why is that well I don't know if transformation is peaceful I think it can be very you know stressful and overwhelming and uh it can feel a lot when you're in the transformation of you know reflecting on a previous identity of who you are challenges pain it can feel overwhelming and feel the scary messy all those different things but I think uh inner peace is the greatest currency I think in a world that we've been going through the last couple years stress overwhelm you know covid isolation economic crisis that's happening now War all these different things mental health uh being talked about more than ever I believe inner peace is the highest currency that human beings can cultivate and can manifest and develop there's a lot of wealthy rich people financially who have very little inner peace and they suffer emotionally and the relationships are at risk and their health is at risk and a lot of wealthy people that die young because of the stresses and the traumas that they have yet to heal inner peace for me is the the greatest currency it's the thing that I think a lot of us want is the thing we seek we desire um but a lot of us just haven't been taught the tools and so for me

[01:35:54] I want to have inner peace so that I can take on the problems and the pain and the stresses that are that are outside of me with more Poise with more Grace with more mature leadership qualities as opposed to reactive frustrated stressed anxious overwhelmed qualities and the great coaches that I've had were able to face adversity challenges stress multiple personalities of teammates with poise with calm because they had inter calm and those are the people that I respected the most because they were able to navigate situations in life that were chaotic with Grace and I think that will support you in anything in your marriage your relationship your family your friends your community your business online your platform your career and really just navigating your own life so for me inner peace is the greatest currency and

[01:36:53] I think we should all be seeking to develop it well Lewis thanks so much um because we didn't really talk that much about your book Let's Tell folks the title of the book when it's out and anything else you want to you want to talk about yeah the greatest mindset I'm excited about it it's um this is 10 years in the making really for me this is a culmination of all the research from experts like yourself you know Paul

[01:37:18] Conte's in there a lot of different experts from neuroscientists to doctors to world-class athletes and kind of tying them all the same things together but set in different ways on how to get clear on your meaningful Mission so that your life has a lot of purpose and a richness and an excitement to it to heal the different things of the past that have hold you back and some of these things have actually helped you get to where you are but it's not helping you get to where you want to be in an abundant renewable energy way and so figure out how to do that in the process that I've learned over the last decade to really setting clear what I call greatness goals to help you make a bigger impact on the people around you and you know for me I always wanted to be successful but I realized that success was very selfish and me Centric and when I hit 30 I said how can I make everyone else win around me and greatness became the thing I wanted to achieve more because greatness is about me pursuing my dreams and impacting those around me in that

[01:38:24] Pursuit as well it wasn't about competition it was about collaboration that's why I made a show that was about lifting others up and shining the light on others and so this has been a 10 years of research of helping people get clear on what's holding them back on the main cause of their self-doubt and the supporting on the Frameworks on overcoming that and living a more

[01:38:45] Abundant Life well congratulations on on getting it to the goal line as a first-time author I I know it's very difficult you know the challenge yeah um and uh I'm sure folks will be really happy to pick this up and have sort of a a codified distilled version of a lot of the stuff we've talked about and more because there's more in there than obviously we haven't scratched the surface of really the book I think we've made the case for the book and now really the question is can you go there and find the resources so so thank you

[01:39:15] Lewis I appreciate it thanks so much
