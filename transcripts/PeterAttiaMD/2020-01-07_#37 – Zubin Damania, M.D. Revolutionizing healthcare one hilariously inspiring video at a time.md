[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic

[00:01:04] I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming

[00:01:23] I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our show's members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:28] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level it makes sense for you I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription my guest this week is Zubin Damania aka Z Dawg MD c1 and I have been friends for about 20 years and we talked about that actually at the outset so how we met and things like that we kind of lost touch for a few years but then reconnected at Ted med into and 13 when we both spoke this is a kind of interesting episode in the sense that

[00:04:31] I wanted to interview him but he wanted to interview me so when I got to his studio in Vegas which is where we did this and his crew is there we filmed it and actually ran it as a sort of a Facebook live and in the end it really I think comes across as a pretty equal balance of about a 50/50 of just two dudes sitting there talking about this stuff and it was really a mutual interview

[00:04:54] Zubin or as we call Z Dogg is kind of one of the most talented people I've ever met I mean not only is he talented as an amazing doc but he's just musically gifted he is comedic ly gifted and he has put those things to an amazing use in what he does so he has all the usual accolades he trained at Berkeley UCSF Stanford internal medicine and of course that's where we met and he went on to found something called turntable health in Las Vegas which was part of this broader ambition of the urban revitalization in Las Vegas that was spearheaded by Tony Shea who is the

[00:05:26] CEO of Zappos and that's the guy who recruited Zubin there this all started because you know Zubin was working as a hospitalist at stanford in internal medicine but he had this whole side gig of doing comedy and music and it was that which Tony saw that made him think hey man you got to do something a little bigger than just being a internist at

[00:05:45] Stanford his videos are amazing we're gonna link to a lot of them in particular ain't the way to die lose yourself in seven years or my three favorites but I've seen every one of them multiple times and I've been following this for a long time many these videos have gone viral and I think in aggregate he's got about half a billion views on Facebook and YouTube and these are educating patients educating providers and kind of mercilessly creating a satire of our entire dysfunctional healthcare system we do talk quite a bit about health care and Zhu Ben's given this much more thought than I have but it was just so interesting to get into this stuff and we get into some really deep philosophy stuff basically he just stumps me all day long with philosophical questions about consciousness and in the mind and other things like that I would say overall this is probably one of the most enjoyable discussions I've ever had with somebody in this sort of format I've talked a lot about how the discussion I had with Jocko a few years ago was one of my favorite

[00:06:40] I would put this up there as well and probably the top three discussions just in terms of overall enjoyment so the show notes will link to a bunch of really cool stuff but you can also go to his site Z dog and that's just to G's on the dog MD comm so I'm really excited to introduce all of you to Zubin Damania we are live what is up Z packets your Boise Dog MD I am live and direct out of Studio Z you are not gonna believe it but we're doing something absolutely different what's this big phallic symbol in my face it's called a microphone okay learn about it and I have it because I have a good friend that goes way back to my Stanford days he is a physician he's an engineer he's done crazy stuff work with the world's top performing individuals to try to teach us not just how to live longer but how to have a longer healthy life a health span he is one of my favorite people because he's guber smart hangs out with all kinds of hoity-toity people like you know Tim Ferriss and Sam

[00:07:39] Harris and all these smartypants intellectual dark web people but more important than that he's a bald off-white doctor welcome dr. Peter attea thank you so much for having me on this co-hosted event today that's right so what we're doing different now is we're co-hosting this you're in Vegas to give a talk right you have your own podcast called the drive which is a stunning deep dive into the nerdiest [ __ ] I've ever seen in my life I love it like you're talking about with I heard Seyfried doctor doctor say feel about how cancer may be a metabolic illness and how the mitochondria are abnormal and you're like in his face going well just because they're morphologically abnormal doesn't mean that the function have you actually fraction - what's your ideal trial and

[00:08:17] I'm just going no no no no yes but also you are even more than that you're talking about how to maximize human potential in a way that's uniquely human and that's what I love about you ever since our Stanford days well speaking of those let's retell that story so I'll do this from the lens of how I would introduce you to my listeners but I think your listeners will also be intrigued by this so I was one year behind you in medical school now you went to UCSF I went to Stanford is that correct that's right it's a gang war type of deal that's right this was back when the merger was trying to happen successfully that's right pure animosity between the two best programs on the west coast that's right you guys thought you were all that because you were rich and we work yet Oh as fudge but in the end of the day you come to Stanford to do your residency in internal medicine so you are now an intern in the internal medicine program

[00:09:06] I am a fourth-year medical student yeah and I had already decided I was going into surgery so I had done you know the heavy lifting to begin that application process so I'm doing internal medicine but there's no pressure because Stanford is pass/fail and it's like how can you fail the rotation you know it's not like

[00:09:25] I wasn't gonna show up but I didn't have to like be the smartest kid in the room I didn't have to like impress the hell out of the residents I was like hey I'm gonna be a surgeon I might as well learn whatever things in medicine apply to taking care of surgical patients so we show up on day one and you're the intern

[00:09:43] I don't remember who the second year was the third year I'm blanking on his name but you called him Darth Vader because his fantasy he said was to walk we can't name him now but now we can if you remember but he's described that his fantasy was to walk down the hall of the hospital with a cape because he was so smart and everyone would think he was

[00:10:05] Darth Vader I know exactly who you know oh my god I remember his name now malignity we're not we're not gonna say so I was kind of like this guy seems like a douchebag meaning the chief resident I mean that also is yeah yeah and the second year was a non personality was my recollection like yes didn't like they were sort of there but not there and you were the intern and it was out of control I could not imagine how much one could enjoy a rotation of internal medicine I don't even remember what we were will be the VA we're at the mothership we were at the mothers you know it's weird I'm getting like this weird emotional reaction because I remember you so well and the thing is looks a clip dude I've taken care of a lot of people I've been through a lot of teams there are very few people I remember and I remember [ __ ] Peter Athiya coming up a medical student fourth year cocky as hell because you were going into surgery did you already man no but you in your mind you knew to go into general search you new and so on a medicine team we've already written you off as someone who doesn't matter to ask you you're not going there's no point putting any energy into teaching me anything and then you sat down and did the entire monologue from Austin

[00:11:16] Powers dr. evil in the therapist like oh my life is I don't even remember it yeah and you were bald at the time or shaved head yeah I've had the finger here and did the whole thing and I'm an intern right the only way I can cope with this [ __ ] is through comedy through humor that's humor was my coping mechanism from beginning and this guy does this thing and you're a medical student first of all you have the balls to come up and do that thing which in the hierarchical system like that we're already I'm like this guy's my hero because I'm oppositional defiant and then you nailed it perfectly and I'm like who is this guy so there's an interesting backstory to that so my very very first rotation was

[00:11:50] Pediatrics because when I went to medical school I thought I was going to be a pediatric oncologist Wow so I figured I better figure this out quick and so I'm gonna do pediatrics first and this was the moment when I knew I couldn't be a pediatric oncologist was when I realized I couldn't be a pediatrician I'm not saying that to upset the pediatricians because maybe it was just I couldn't be a Stanford pediatrician but on about the fourth day of the rotation there was like this really chubby cute little baby in the nursery you know I forget what was wrong with you know dehydrated or something like that and we were taking care of it and I just decided at that moment it made sense to walk down the hall and pretend I was fat bastard and talk about wanting to eat the baby so I came out of the room and I was like baby and the whole rest of the night all I did was talk about the other other white meat and I mean literally not one of them not one of them even smiled they were mortified by my existence humorless bastards you forget about fat bastard you know what's so funny see this is why you and I get along you're an introvert I'm an extrovert you're incredibly science-minded diligent industrious I'm the opposite I'm lazy i procrastinate and I use smoke and mirrors to get any success I can and grasp on to it desperately but but the truth is we have a very similar disturbed sense of humor one time in hematology so Here I am like I'm a second year resident and the attending is a guy named Steve Cutrer really renowned guy and we're on everybody's stressed it's young people who are dying like all over the place and I had already built you know what happens in medicine you start building this brick wall around yourself so you don't feel what's going on because the minute you feel it you're in the stairwell crying back and forth and it's just morally distressing so to cope with that I'd built a wall but then I started using humor so Cutrer we had these really hard six service and there was this creepy puppet that one of the patients had donated to F ground which was our um floor and and it was this weird hobo like home had a little stick and these little things you put your hand into but and you make it do stuff and that's not that came out wrong it's

[00:13:59] I know what you mean you know what I'm saying they have a very large anus extremely loose sphincter tom yeah yeah and so and no curvature in the colon it's it's more of a mono like the GI tract basically goes the esophageal anal canal it's a straightened and shortened tract you know what that always bothered me that being said rounds are happening and Cutrer go soda Manya did you see him you know mr. pickle's in three and I go

[00:14:22] I didn't I'm sorry and he and you could see him just like you know this guy [ __ ] sucks and I go [Laughter]

[00:14:40] and Cutrer looks at me for a second and I'm thinking I'm done I'm fired and he breaks into laughter with tears rolling down his face and the whole team is laughing and I'm like you know what I found my path it is it is to try to bring some levity to situations that are disastrous and that gave me hope because it could easily have gone the other way

[00:15:01] I've been told things like hey you speak and then think you should just reverse that or better yet just think in attending told me that at ucsf so when you and I took USMLE to so the final exam to graduate from medical school we were about the last classes to do that before they switched to like live patient actor interactions is that right yeah or we were very close closer because these I had just asked and right that's right yeah as did I yeah but then they brought in they say you know Stanford's gonna be one of the test sites for you know doing this whole thing because USMLE 2 is moving towards half the test being written and half the test being clinical with actor patients you know we were basically just being asked to do this so they could figure out the you know the kinks in the system so for whatever reason it was just too long a day and I just wasn't really in the mood to deal with these actors and actresses who were annoying as hell to me you know you'd go in there and you sort of knew what was going on you'd ask all the right questions and then they'd give you this scathing feedback like they didn't even know what they were talking about and it just bugged me right but you can picture this right yeah I don't know if you guys can hear me breathing angrily but this is epic I had the exact same experience keep going so we had to do nine of these in a full day each encounter took 30 minutes 20 minutes to do the thing ten minutes to get the feedback I do a really honest - good job for the first eight I really

[00:16:25] I'm trying as hard as I can I'm doing the best I can I'm taking my beatings we're going into the last one and I just lose it I can't do it and so I recall the chart out of the medical thing and it says you're seeing mrs. Smith and mrs. Smith is here to talk about her daughter Susie who is wetting the bed at night that's all the information you have so you got to go in and now play the pediatrician or whatever so I walk in and I say hello mrs. Smith and she looks at me kind of funny and she says hi and I said my name is dr. evil I went to evil medical school and she's okay well Susie is some and she starts talking about Susie and I said I don't really want to hear about the details of Susie's life let me tell you about the details of my life and then I do the entire monologue from

[00:17:21] Austin Powers yeah quite inconsequential ending with a zoroastrian in Wilmer ritualistically shaved my testicles and as a Zoroastrian yeah you can appreciate this and I keep going and then all of a sudden the door like basically breaks down because they're videotaping this whole thing which you knew I knew and they get so pissed they run and they go this / this is absolutely done what it is totally inappropriate what you just said and I said I said testicles

[00:17:50] I said shorn testicles that that's a medical term that's completely legitimate did you tell them have you ever experienced Shawn testicles it's quite exhilarating I suggest you try it I suggest you try it so I got the boot it was a huge deal they basically dragged me out of there that is the most amazing thing I've ever heard in my life

[00:18:09] I'm so proud of you Peter attea as your superior officer in in school because I thought that those patient actor things were the stupidest [ __ ] and we're looking this is what they do this what they tell you you know what you need to have empathy you need to be able to read people you need to be able to see through lies and get to the heart of what's going on so what do they do they put you in a room with a professional liar and when you see through it when you see it for what it is which is zeros and ones ago this person's faking it I can't how can I show empathy is someone who's pretending you want me to pretend

[00:18:38] I can become a liar too and so I did the same thing I went in the room hands in my pockets like this the woman had fake bruises on her face she was supposed to pretend to be abused and my first reaction was how dare you pretend how dare you mock people who've actually been abused you're doing a shitty job of it you're not a great actress and and I'm being judged on how

[00:18:58] I pretend right like this is horrible give me a real patient so I'm so did you pass well it didn't matter because it was right it was just you're being used as a trial sight so the next day I get a page was back when we used to carry those alphanumerical not even the alphanumeric range it's just a straight a numeric pager right and it's the dean's office and I'm like you've got to be freaking kidding me it's like a month before graduation I'm like so I call and it's like hi this is Peter Teeter returning a page and they said Oh Dean so-and-so wants to speak with you wait a moment on the line and I'm like god damn it so I just get all defensive so he gets on the phone and he goes hi Peter and I'm like dr. so-and-so look before you say it I just want to say one thing this was totally ridiculous and I go off on like a four minute rant about how idiotic the whole process was and he goes goes we'll look I just want to say

[00:19:47] I watched it last night and I thought it was hilarious and I really think you should question whether or not you should be at least incorporating some of that into your career so I just wanted to call you to say good job you know and I was like that is fantastic that's like the highlight of my medical school is hope in the universe I had a similar experience at UCSF when I did a graduation speech that actually launched my whole career as a dog and because I later put it on YouTube it's in my 1999

[00:20:13] UCSF graduation speech it's there it's all captioned everything and it was I just went through it as I saw it it was all just like this is [ __ ] this is [ __ ] this is [ __ ] this is why this is [ __ ] it's about actually connecting with our patients isn't it and the majority of the faculty behind me were just like stone-faced for 90% of it and then finally start to crack and you see Michael Bishop who's like a nobel-prize when I finally he's like and afterwards they were like that was very well done but there was one guy who was like that kid shouldn't be allowed to graduate and actually was lobbying to have my graduation revoked for giving that speech I mean so this is the thing it's a hierarchy and I can tell you don't like hierarchies so much I probably have more respect for it than you actually being a surgeon yeah I don't I don't know I feel like I'm not as I don't bristle as much at it is probably some people I mean I would say for a surgical resident I respected it much less than the other residents and I definitely got into trouble on a few occasions as a result of it yeah yeah yeah I've met people who completely have absolutely disregard for any hierarchy and many of them going just do the most amazing things so I always felt like I wish I had less respect for it but well you know it's a complex thing because I think certain personality types don't like to be in the middle or bottom of hierarchies they either want to be on the top or they want to be off the hierarchy it's hard for them to feel like other people are controlling them or they're beholden to others in the higher hierarchy and they either have a tendency to dominate those underneath or to treat them as equals inappropriately in which case the lower down in the hierarchy don't have the competence and what they need is actually to be trained and lifted and supported and instead it's like why aren't you why aren't you at the level that I'm asking you to be and so it's interesting it becomes tough in the higher echelons of performance and stuff I think the problem I had in residency was I really loved hierarchy when I could respect the person I was reporting to so you know luckily I did my residency at a hospital where most of the residents were just exceptional so it for the most part was really easy to respect

[00:22:10] Araki but the problem was when I encountered somebody and I didn't think that they were good enough or smart enough or new enough I wouldn't hesitate to just steamroll them and that gets you into a lot of trouble I saw that in you when you were a medical student I remember it it was one of your characteristics that I actually respected a lot because again if you like you said you kind of described our team pretty well and the person at the top was fairly narcissistic the one in the middle was kind of a nonentity then there was me who was the class clown and then there was you and it speaks to our medical training in general that it really is about kissing the ring of the authority figure so one day you will be the ring that's kissed that's the majority of our training the first two years are were fed a bunch of information 50% of which is wrong but what they don't tell us which 50% of the residual will be outdated by the time you finish exactly so it's a hundred percent [ __ ] and yet we're expected to kind of suck it all in and regurgitate it with respect for this hierarchy and we don't ask questions we don't accept out of that and you're right you have to respect your authority theories which is important when you trust and respect them but when you're questioning things like why are we doing this why are we giving lasix to this person or why what's going on with this renal failure actually what about the root cause of that you start asking this question no no no no that's when I was told hey you speak then think you should reverse that they they don't want to hear that from a medical student and you know we had the short white coats and everything you guys had the long white coats it wasn't as high it's very unusual yeah I didn't realize how quote/unquote special that was until I saw that there were many programs where even the interns were still in short white coats and I didn't realize like what a big deal that was like how much obsessing went into the white coat thing

[00:23:51] I feel like an idiot even just voicing this right now because I've never thought about this for like 20 years but what a big deal that white coat is I feel bad maybe I should be more respectful of the white coat you know when I came from UCSF nobody wore a long white coat except for fellows and attendings so even the residents wore short white coats

[00:24:09] I think Hopkins was that way they're just starting to change it when I came to Stanford I saw you wearing a long white coat and my conditioned unconscious wanted to smack like I haven't earned it you haven't earned it I haven't earned the long white coat I'm wearing as a our 1 as an intern it's such an interesting process it's almost militaristic it's a very military hierarchy and the question is is that good do we need that I think some degree of organization hierarchy is important when people's lives are on the line same with in the military right yeah you're friends with Jaco we'll link and these guys I mean what would he say about this I don't know I'd hate to speak for anybody especially Jocko but the challenge comes when you have to make a decision that is probably not the best decision for the patient but it's the one that's coming down from the person just above you and I always found the stickiest situations were and I had an example and I want to be very careful

[00:25:02] I don't reveal too much because this was such a vivid example in my residency but there was a time in my residency when I was an intern and it was a small surgical service so it was me and a chief resident only so he didn't have all like the 17 layers so it was you know you basically had attending fellow chief resident intern so there was only only four people in the chain of command and there was a situation that was in my mind clearly a case of someone that needed to go to the operating room I don't think you even need it to be a physician to know that this person needs to go to the operating room I think if you walked into McDonald's and just pulled a hundred people there 97 would say yep that's a surgical case yeah and the third would be like I want extra the other three they might miss some finer detail so I called the chief resident and this was a weekend that I was on call and I said to him hey I got this case and you know blah blah blah blah blah needs to go to the o.r and he was like just deal with it yourself and I said look I know you're upset at me I've already called you twice today this was 8 p.m. and I had already called him twice on the Sunday and he had had to come in both times because of the injuries were so severe that I was calling him about that they had to be taken to the o.r so he'd already been to the o.r twice that day it's a Sunday he's pissed it's his day off so now I'm calling him at 8 a.m. or 8 p.m. to say this is a surgical case he's saying you fix it yourself I'm saying look I technically could address this in the ER but it's not the best thing to do and he was like stop being such a [ __ ] puss huh so this your attending no no this was the chief residency president yes yeah so again I don't to get into details of it because it could kind of give away the identity of any of the people involved in the end I did deal with it in the year and I dealt with it the best I could admitted the patient the next day everyone's rounding and they see the patient and they're like god damn how did this not go to the o.r so what I realized in that moment and I was very early in my internship I mean days into my internship actually what I realized was the mistake I made was I didn't call the attending directly though right above yeah again it was so obvious that this chief resident was wrong it's so obvious he was being a lazy sack of [ __ ] so I should have just called the attending now at the time that wouldn't even occur to me I mean that's like but you can't break the chain of command but

[00:27:36] I look back at that and I view that as probably certainly one of probably my five biggest failures in residency was the weakness the inability to break that chain of command and deal with the consequences of it because there would have been consequences of that even though it was the right thing to do and even though that patient would have gotten much better care I would have paid an enormous price for that through the duration of my residency at least in that era and I don't know I feel like in some ways I was just a coward you know or deer and headlights I just didn't know what to do so I thought okay I'll do the best I can you know what I want to dig into that because this story is at the center of what we're now calling burnout and I don't think it's burnout I think it's moral injury and Talbot and

[00:28:15] Dean and others have written about this in stat in other places you were in a position where all the system was arrayed to make it very difficult for you to do the right thing for the patient you knew it was the right thing you knew the patient needed to have this done and you knew that it would cause serious consequences to you to have it done and you erred on the side of okay well maybe the system is this way for a reason and it'll be okay in the morning and it may not have been and then you had to live with the shame and the guilt of not having done something that was self-destructive that was not in your best interest to help this other person and to this day I can sitting across the table from you that this bothers you deeply you're saying it's what fathers bothered me so much that for at least twelve fifteen years after I would contemplate asking one of my friends who was still at Hopkins you know by this point now a few of my friends who had finished were still attendings at Hopkins

[00:29:11] I had contemplated asking them to dig through the medical records to find out what happened to that patient because I couldn't remember the patient's name but I remembered the date so I was gonna say hey go back to this date and look at every one that came in the ER and that day and I will be able to figure out which this person I want to know what this person is doing today and I kid you not this is actually a really funny story I mean funny in this this one twist I know you're a huge fan of dr. oz right massive love him yeah so glad you were on his show by the right so I was on that show and a little embarrassed truthfully because I felt silly and I didn't think it made sense for me to be on but nevertheless I was on and I didn't know when it actually aired but when it aired I heard from the patient's mother who was also there and to make a very long story short it reconnected me with the patient who was doing exceptionally well and it was you know in a way maybe it's wrong that I could alleviate some of the guilt by knowing that the patient turned out okay but it was unbelievable because even this patient said they'd never watched this show before this dr. Oz Show they just happened to be in the waiting room I don't know getting their car fixed or something and they saw it on TV and they're like hey I know that dude that patient recognized you across the years yeah this would have been 15 year Delta and then connected with me through my blog or something like that really we have to let that sink in that at the heart of all of this and your you know listen you're an amazing scientist your podcast is unbelievable like I listen to it I'm enthralled by it because I'm also a huge nerd but the fact is that was a human connection that you made that also was a victim of a system that was so broken that it caused you moral distress that lasted for years and was only partially ameliorated by reconnecting with that human at the center of that now let's take that that you suffered and scale it by a thousand times every single day when we have to take care of patients we know full well what needs to be done we know where the [ __ ] ups are and where things have gone wrong and where our system has failed and we have powerless not only powerless if we do the right thing we will lose money we will lose time with our family will be charting all night and it still may not work for the patient now for my listeners who aren't as familiar with this stuff help me understand what that means so you trained in internal medicine when you finished at Stanford what was the first job you took as an attending so I'll be honest with you about your two of my residency I wanted to UGI because I was always intellectually interested your dad is a gastroenterologist is actually a primary care doc who also trained in pulmonary oh I just for some reason I always loved

[00:31:54] GI physiology loved hepatology I love the way that digestion works and the mind-body gut connection I thought was fascinating like I loved irritable bowel syndrome because I thought how interesting that the mind can influence what we sense in our in our gut when we get butterflies not coming so second year though I did the rotation had a terrible mentor it was just scoping routinely doing colonoscopies and eg

[00:32:18] Dee's and and it was horrible the idea that that could scale for a career was mind-numbing because when I hear someone saying I want to go into GI I assume they mean they want to be a you know they want to do scopes cuz that's the most lucrative part of GI right but you were more interested in like the medical part of

[00:32:33] GI I like the medical part of it and and even hepatology was a little too much but I wanted to scope that was cool that was video games in people's buttocks awesome great but I like talking to patients I like the relationship and I like the physiology of it talking to people about their issues cuz abdominal pain chronic abdominal pain constipation nausea vomiting a lot of times these are these are deeply connected to the mindset and so I that's what I loved but then when I saw the scoping part of it I was like I hate this I hate it and this is most of how I make a living it was repetitive mindless to me it didn't sit with me plus I was starting to get disillusioned in general with medicine because most of what we did seemed like [ __ ] most of what we did either harm people or just wasn't thought out you know it's half-baked and the thing is that cause the kind moral distress so I forget it I was burned out I was tired so by third year

[00:33:22] I remember my program director had to pull me in and he's like you're a bad influence on the interns it's one thing to be burned out and tired it's another thing to to model that for the younger and it changed me totally then I became this great teacher and got focused on that as a way to have self warned what were you doing to be a

[00:33:40] Tibetan sarcasm or like had the humor gone too far like what was it the humor got very dark it became more of a wall than a coping mechanism so it was more like how can I mentally victimize everyone around me by throwing blame to build a wall around myself the fact that I feel morally bereft doing this job so you know calling patients gomers you know this is slang they stand for again it stands for get out of my er Oh comes from the book house of God yes and so I would use every if I haven't heard that it likes the long time because it's a horrible thing residency yeah yeah but we heard it all the time I just had forgotten one not only do you hear it all the time I had conjugated every form of that verb so I was like that guy's gone doubt he's in status comb atticus you know this guy's preparing to go he's like proto gone he's got serious go mop a--they but every version of Gomer I could use and it came from this black hole in my in my Center where it was like I'm a bad person right I'm a worthless poor and that's burnout it's really moral injury so because of that I decided I was taking I told our program director Kelly SCAF he knows the story

[00:34:44] I've told publicly I said Kelly I can't no I'm not gonna match I'm not gonna do a fellowship and I'm not gonna practice medicine I'm gonna go into tech cuz I'm in the Silicon Valley I'm I work for a couple startups and see what happens and I did that for a year and in that year I learned a lot about myself I learned that without that stimulation of that deep relationship like money as a stimulus was never gonna cut it for me which I wanted it to Peter

[00:35:08] I wanted to be rich it couldn't happen I was doing well I was moving up in these companies and then I just felt empty so my buddy John offered said hey there's this hospitalist gig at Stanford you should take it saw your colleagues from residency we're doing this cool stuff it's great and I said I'll try it for a couple months I was there for nine years and that was the first real medical job

[00:35:28] I was moonlighting and I loved it but this was it and being able to spend time with patients when they're acutely sick in the worst day of their life in the hospital sitting with them spending time it was before the EHR the electronic health record kind of destroyed our ability to make eye contact and it was beautiful man I kept a diary because I was weird in those days I was like 30 and I was like this

[00:35:47] I'm blessed like who gets to do this like I found my perfect niche and it lasted probably four years before things started change so then what changed four years into that nine year stint I think what changes what's been changing in medicine across the board which is the creep of medicine is business medicine as assembly line medicine is process to be improved not medicine as deep human relationship that's a sacred calling so what ended up happening is an EHR goes live productivity we start to lose House residents support so we're more they're expecting us to just see a bunch of patients to generate revenue and it's not so much about teaching it's not so much about mentorship is not so much about a team what I love about the husband you go through you hey Bob how you doing social workers there case managers there we know everybody artis and they're all we're all supporting each other it's not hierarchical it's like whole arc achill everybody brings their thing that's started to disappear with the pressure of click-click-click then I was going home and charting at home and then I had my daughter my first daughter in 2007 and that was a tipping point where I was like I am treating my daughter like you know my burnout is expressing in how I'm treating my daughter and I can't spend time with her I can't read her stories at night I'm thinking about clicking these boxes in epic and I haven't finished this note and did I remember to check the potassium on that guy and I you know I'm the type of guy can't just sign it out I have to like I own it too much so it just got horrible and I started being nasty and like my relationships were suffering and you know what did your wife think at the time so she was a radiologist academic radiologist at Stanford so she found a path that was really perfect for her introvert very science minded loved the team dynamic of it she looked at me and was like you're in a bad did you guys meet at UCSF we met as stanford as interns the year that I met you she did all of Medicine and then came to an epiphany don't like medicine parents were really into medicine both were medical people she's like they didn't see radiology as a real doctor you know

[00:37:39] Chinese parents it's a lot of pressure so she's like you know what I'm not gonna specialize in pulmonary critical care I'm gonna go back and do chest radio and Zubin you're gonna support me by the way for four years of more residency and fellowship and I was like alright and so when that table turned and I was miserable and depressed she was the first to say you know because we had gotten this I mean that's another story we started making videos putting him online and Tony Hsieh the CEO of Zappos reached out but before that she's like what can we do for you do you want to just stop working

[00:38:08] I'll go up to full time she was 80% and you can just stop working we won't have a ton of money but we'll in the Bay Area you're poor no matter what you do and that now is I don't know I don't know how and this is how long after oh seven this would have been oh wait okay so your daughter's usual one yeah and then bio nine what it happened was I we went to visit so Tony Hsieh went to Harvard with my wife and Tony Shay's built Zappos and then sold it to Amazon for like a billion dollars and just wrote a book called delivering happiness became this national sort of thought leader in his space we went to visit him for Thanksgiving he's having a bunch of friends over so he does this thing that Tony does you know Tony as well we all kind of roll in the same circles and and he kind of looks at me he's like so are you happy doing what you're doing as a doctor it sounds really amazing and I looked at him and I'm like absolutely not absolutely not and to see you living this life where you're doing what you love and you're financially successful and you're affecting people's lives and people come up to him in restaurants going you changed my life with your book and it's not I'm like it was a mix of jealousy like deep jealousy like how can someone be so connected and me feel so isolated and self-hatred yeah cuz it wasn't the money you certainly saw money everywhere in the Silicon Valley I remember one of the things in Tony's book that I liked so much they paid you to quit after a period of time right was it three months in three months in and they gave you 2,500 bucks that just go away ditch walk away yeah I love that and if you walked away then you weren't really a good fit they were happy to pay the money that's the Zappos culture and time oh my god it's amazing really n't imagine if we did that in health care give somebody I'd have to be like a hundred thousand dollars okay quit now and if you're still with it it means that you're doing this because there's nothing else in the world you'd rather do and that's what I tell medical students you know like a well should I go into it I don't know like is there if there's anything else you'd rather do do it first if there isn't then this is your path because it is hard but it is a sacred calling and you'll feel it and you'll feel it so you had that discussion over

[00:40:02] Thanksgiving with Tony and then what I've never been so depressed in my life because I went back to Stanford it's winter you know winter is in medicine wards every single old person with pneumonia tries to die in the hospital it's gloomy the residents are stressed they're midway through I'm supervising an intern who is a young lady who I remember was such a wonderful human being but she was stressed and I was stressed and we're looking at each other like how do we help each other get through this because it was just she and

[00:40:29] I cuz they peeled back our support from a big team to just one intern one attending so I'm a goober mentor I'm resident attending second-year sub I everybody in one I would literally cry in the shower so that the wife wouldn't know that I was crying you know and it's funny because I talked about some of this in the TED talk where we met again so super burned out at but Tony had and this is why I think it's so important to have mentors that matter Tony told me so if you had one thing you could do that was in that visit what would you do and

[00:40:59] I'm like dude like I I did this speech for graduation I felt so connected to the audience I felt like I was revealing truth through humor that could help motivate people to change stuff I would do that for a living I would put these videos on YouTube which was a new thing and but I can't cuz I'll lose my job and it's dumb and no one will watch and he's like you're wrong look look at this guy

[00:41:22] Vaynerchuk he's like a wine salesman he made a whole living out of this look at look at this guy who co-founded Digg what's his name Kevin Rose Kevin Rose Kevin does this show and I watched the show and I'm like that's funny and awesome so part of my depression was why can't I just get through this inertia to do this thing and when I finally did when I put my first video on YouTube on my birthday basically in 2000 and which one was the first one the first one was : wars and it was a parody of me talking about GI through the lens of Luke Skywalker going down the trench so he's doing a colonoscopy and he's like stay on target

[00:41:55] I can't hold it stay on target you can't do any more what good back there wedge to pull up pull up about this whole thing and it caught a bunch of views and people were like that's nerdy as [ __ ] I like that and that's when the Depression started to lift and then just on the side as this character Z Dawg MD which I created decried make sure Stanford wouldn't fire me and the thing is they never even knew because I don't they weren't on YouTube and so it's more and more videos and more and then we did one called manhood in the mirror which was our first big music parody this is the first one I saw right and it's good because I'm grabbing my crotch repeatedly which is important for you to see and it was Michael

[00:42:32] Jackson's man in the mirror but it was about testicular self examine and it gets a bunch of views and people are playing it in these like student health clinics on repeat and they're saying how kids are catching early testicular tumors and I'm like [ __ ] am I responsible for over diagnosis now are people having their testicles removed that don't need to and all this self blame again but it woke me up so you were still at Stanford when you made that video full-time okay I didn't really I thought you had already left by them No so two years at Stanford while making these videos full-time until Tony saw the videos and was like okay here's a proposition unplugged from that matrix come to downtown Vegas we're doing startups here and I'm investing in some things do something that's going to transform medicine that's about you and about the community and that's when we imagine that conversation with my wife you told me to follow my dreams honey so my dream is we quit this beautiful Bay

[00:43:26] Area lifestyle and we moved to downtown Las Vegas which is currently a demilitarized zone for this pipe dream of starting a clinic and it's a little warmer than Palo Alto in the summer vaguely and very different and did she bristle Irish eat all in me I was the one you bristle I was like that's dumb I can't do that and she was like listen this is your chance you gave me a chance for four years to pursue what I cared about now's my chance to pay you back we'll go we'll give it a shot and if it doesn't work no problem we'll come back and who cares and if it does work then great so she was the one who pushed me I mean without being married to the right person I think so much the biggest decision you can make in your life is who you partner with I mean I agree completely and my decision to leave medicine that was a hard decision to make you know when your two years left in your two hundred year residency and I was like yeah I want to do this anymore but actually my wife helped me see that because she said you are so miserable why are you so misery and I gave her 12 reasons you know she sat on it for a few days and then she said I know you enough we hadn't been married that long maybe a year and she said but I know you enough to know that there's only two ways you're going to get better you either have to fix those 12 things on that list or you have to leave and I thought about that for a few days probably for a few months actually because this would have been the yeah

[00:44:52] August of that year so when did you guys get married we got married in oh four so this is now summer of oh five so I'm really thinking this isn't for me you know reasons x y&z like it would become I loved the operating part it was just there were too many things about the system I couldn't stand so then I came to that really hard decision but I thought her framework was the right framework which was it would be great to stay if I could fix all of these things but I can't so I probably need to go and so that was the decision to go now I didn't know what go meant I didn't know if it meant go into another specialty leave medicine altogether go into the lab full-time and because I had just come back from NIH where I had spent two years in the lab so all of these options were spinning through my mind which was look maybe I'll just get a PhD and just full-time to do research or go and do this or go into this I mean it's funny I found it recently

[00:45:46] I found the document that I made this is how nerdy I was I put a table together in Word and I had all of the things that I was considering doing with my life and the pros and the cons and the optionality triggers and if you do this it'll cut you out of this but if you do this you might be able to then pivot and do this like it was this whole thing Wow engineer mindset that's amazing see we're so different that way cuz I was like let me throw some feces and see where it sticks sticks there all right

[00:46:14] I'm gonna leave medicine so for you it was thought out but it was prompted by your wife in a way did you feel like you needed permission from your wife I think so because people often say to me when they find out I left before finishing at Hopkins they said you must have really hated Hopkins and the answer is not at all I freaking loved that place in many ways it was it's hard to say one of the best chapters of my life because I feel like I've been really lucky I think the only really shitty chapter in my life was college but medical school was an incredible chapter residency was an incredible chapter you know work post residency was all of these things have been very enjoyable so know the reality of it is like I had amazing friends there who I am still incredibly close to wonderful mentors obviously like all hospitals there are I think 20% of the surgeons at Hopkins you wouldn't let operate on your cat because they're absolute I mean assassins it's true everywhere yeah yeah it's true everywhere but you also were surrounded by some of the most skilled gifted remarkable surgeons and the residents above me meaning the people that I was trying to emulate these chief residents and senior residents and the fellows I mean oh my god I mean some of them were just gods to me and I still keep in touch with most of them right many of these people who were like you know my heroes are still my heroes in a way I actually just ran into one in the Von's like very recently she was my fellow on pediatric surgery when I was an intern and she's now you know an attending in pediatric surgery in San Diego and Wow

[00:47:40] I've been to each other so and she was yeah Vaughn's mole to give you a card cuz that's important you don't get a disc I just can never remember it so I mooch off my wife's phone number every time but I did yes in a way I think I needed permission I think my parents thought it was crazy your Egyptian yeah so do you have the classic immigrant parents or were they first-generation second yes no super classic my mom actually is completely supportive so whatever I do my mom is I literally could be a garbageman and she would be delighted but my father was very upset when I finished engineering turned down my scholarships to do the PhDs in engineering and then had to go back and do a postdoc here to go to medical school he was super upset about that right because you didn't that post back where you got all the prereqs for medical school what changed your mind from engineering it's a tough story to tell you guys hard me to get into that yeah super emotional in a future when we're both more woke yeah because it's tough there are things I won't talk about and it's because it's so personal and it's a thing that I'm still working through we're constantly in this evolving thing you know and again our identity as type-a kind of crazy driven people and you work with like some of the top performers around the world and you do such crazy [ __ ] like guys not from my fans who don't know Peter this guy does [ __ ] that will blow your mind like I don't do any [ __ ] I don't do anything like but do how many I have in the past but I don't do anything what's the longest swim you've ever done every 25 miles oh just 25 yeah but I mean if you if you dropped me five miles from shore today I would pretty much die yeah but you know but you cuz you're evolving to something every minute which we were talking even before this started just a little bit about our mutual admiration for sam harris and his idea of the self and how it's an evolving transient almost illusory thing but so is our identity with the story we tell about it yes absolutely so this story if I'm an engineer no I'm a doctor no I'm a consultant what's your story now

[00:49:35] I mean people who've listened my podcast sort of know this and I've gotten a little bit of grief for it if ever given the choice meaning if I'm at a party or if I'm somewhere where I'm asked what I do I only have two answers the first is I'm a shepherd and the second is I'm a race car driver and the reason is usually the former nobody really asks you any more questions right like I'm a shepherd what do you mean like is this a religious thing yeah yeah that's like no

[00:50:01] I mean it's just like you know I tend to sheep and they're like right there were a lot of sheep in San Diego yeah no no there's it depends you have to go inland but yeah and then that's just my way of like I don't want to talk about it and then with the race car thing at first they think it's sexy but then I explained that I'm on the formula 2000 like the Formula Renault circuit and I can just throw two or three sentences out and they already the eyes glaze over nobody was like if you're not doing

[00:50:22] NASCAR or Formula One it's not like they have a follow-up question so it usually just gets matter of having the talk that's amazing all I would be doing in that conversation and we haven't caught up in a long time last time I talked to you you were talking about installing a race car simulator in your house in fact I room it was at that long yeah

[00:50:38] I was actually driving back from the track that's right yeah yeah that's right and you were so I'd never heard the amount of passion in your voice you were like this thing is amazing all these buttons and like my wife is a little pissed but the thing is it's like amazing and you got it you gotta try this next time and uh who is this guy so now you're actually driving on these circuits yeah but more importantly it's just to me it's like I'm only interested in how well I drive versus myself like

[00:51:02] I'm not you know this is not like something that's going to occupy much space in my life beyond just my own obsess with it like all the other things I obsess over but the point is I don't have a narrative I struggle with all of that stuff you know even when my my kids are asking me now what I do like cuz my daughter's ten my son is four and a half of a younger son who mows it doesn't ask me anything but yeah I think they know

[00:51:25] I'm a doctor I think they know that that's my job but they don't have a clue what that means and I just say yeah it means you know you take care of people and my daughter then asks what kind of doctor are you and that's where I'm like yeah I don't I mean you know I just I usually change the subject yeah I'm with you on that you know for you I always see you as this kind of oscillating electron probability cloud wave that what you settle on at any minute can be on how you're observing yourself or what you what you're obsessed about at that moment and it's always changing so when people ask you tell me your story tell me your narrative it's almost like when they ask me that I get a little insulted

[00:52:07] I'm like he you can't reduce the cloud that simply it's more complex than that but I think that's true for everybody that's why I think maybe that's why I find that type of question difficult to answer and frustrating and I think it's why like even today I did it the uber driver who brought me I came from a hotel over here and not really nice guy

[00:52:29] I always loved taking Hoover in cities that I don't know because really the only two cities I spend you know a lot of time in a San Diego and New York and San Francisco so if I'm in a city like Vegas I'd love to like hey man were you from that you grow up here you know no he'd been here 14 years but Lulu so I'm asking him like 30 questions so I now know his life story and then he turns to me and he's like what about you where are you from and I'm like god dammit how do I get out of this so I'm like you know I'm from San Diego what are you doing in town business or work now the reality was I'm kind of here to give this talk but I was like I'm just here to see a buddy yeah oh you stick around for the weekend nope going home tomorrow it was like you know and I wasn't rude about it but I think he could tell what this guys are boring dude like there's nothing else to ask so

[00:53:11] I was like I got to dodge the whole the same thing cuz how do you you have to tell almost like it's a huge complicated unfolding and he didn't want that I mean like there is no sir it's like the other place where I will be equally dodgy is that like the parties of the parents at the school where you're with all the other doctors and all that stuff and this is my favorite thing to do is like I will spend an entire evening talking to a group of doctors and like learn everything about what they do and manage to not reveal one thing they will think the entire night this guy you know I'll be dressed like this and they're all dressed nice and you know they will think I'm a shepherd or racecar driver that is magical I actually want to hear about what they do and truthfully I think it's just selfish I mean if I'm gonna be brutally honest you know what it is I don't learn [ __ ] when I'm talking right now I'm not learning anything when the other person is talking I get to learn and I'm kind of selfish when it comes to desiring knowledge yeah so I think their real reason I enjoy being in that setting and hearing what is that doctor do and what does she do and what does he do is I'm soaking it up and I don't have to waste any of my time hearing myself say the same stupid thing and you and I both read this book which I have I just happen to have here the mind illuminated

[00:54:26] I was trying to understand myself better understand meditation better stop screwing around trying to meditate for five years and just being like I can't seem to get I actually think I read that on Sam's recommendation two or three years ago oh really yeah I discovered it just randomly on Amazon Reddit and was transformed in my practice because it was you remember the

[00:54:44] Greatest American Hero it was a show in the 80s with a guy this guy Ralph he's like an insurance broker or something and he these aliens come down find him give him this suit that's a Superman type suit and it gives him superpowers and they give him that I see actually do remember remember this believe it on walk in on air and they give him the instruction manual to the suit and they go here's how you use this [ __ ] and he's like cool and he reads it and these bad guys are coming so he learns how to shrink himself down he shrinks himself down with the suit and then he gets himself grown again forgets the [ __ ] manual and it's microscopic now it's gone so he has to figure out how to use this powerful suit all by himself for the rest of the season and that's where it's fun well that's what it felt like with me for meditation trying to understand myself and my own what is my narrative and Who am I and what's going on you lively scraping around trying a little of Harris's meditation and doing a little headspace and doing then I got this book and I'm like it's the goddamn manual for nerds and for Taipei's who want to process and part of what this thing talks about is this sub mind system this idea that our mind is really like a boardroom where you're projecting stuff on a screen and that's our conscious awareness and what's doing the projecting are these sub minds there's a auditory sub mind projecting sound of visual sub I'm predicting vision and then there's a narrating sub mind that ties these things together integrates them and projects them as this sort of integrated picture and that's what tells our story at any given second I am a race car driver and a shepherd or I am a former burned-out doc who's now trying to transform medicine which is the lie

[00:56:22] I'm currently telling myself and it's created like a beads on a string in these moments these slices the liberating thing about that is that at any moment your next slice could be something completely different it's influenced by the momentum of the previous slices but it is in itself an unknown and anything is possible so what got you curious to start exploring this you know what it was it was moving to

[00:56:47] Las Vegas from the Bay Area which was what yours in 2012 12 now I'm a type a materialistic high-strung I need a house in a car and keep up with the Joneses and my career and so on that's home conditioned and I come here where people like Tony share like are you happy like are you connected there's this thing called community in relationship I'm like these people are hippies they don't know where they go to Burning Man they have no [ __ ] idea what they're talking about and then I had an experience now look I've done psychedelics in college you know LSD psilocybin MDMA those kind of they are transformative drugs but when I was dabbling in them in those days I didn't have an intent to change myself something crazy happened I was up in

[00:57:32] Tony's place and he has a friend who will call the sorceress cuz that's what she called herself she is this former fashion designer and she's like hey we're all hanging out you want to smoke some weed and I was like I haven't done this in months and months and months because I'm a upstanding doctor and a father and my kids are taken care of right now everybody's in bed sure I ended up smoking a heroic dose like a Terence

[00:57:53] Mckenna level heroic dose of weed because again low tolerance is at our height and it turns out she is very adept as a guide and had known me for a few weeks now and broke she sat down with me so this is what I see in you I see a person who's this this and this and this and this and this now you're here and you do these videos but really you're trying to deny that that's an important part of who you are because your identity is a doctor she goes this whole thing basically breaks me down destroys my ego everything I thought I was dissolved and then she started making misses with marijuana this is just with weed so interesting I've never liked marijuana I actually can't stand it I can't stand the way it makes me feel so it's hard for me to imagine that that could happen because I don't view it as sort of one of those ego dissolving drugs I guess for me I just would always get paranoid especially if it was sativa I mean that would just make me beyond paranoid so this was the most potent sativa you could imagine and in my paranoia which I also get and I also don't love weed in my paranoia came this paradoxical disillusion of ego as a protective mechanism so so intro you you might have gone to a place I'd never been to that's what it was and I'd never been there and with this guide who you know she's a Bikram yoga instructor she you know something very spiritual about her but in a strange way I would have thought is woo woo and forget it crazy you know says some very unscientific things you know but as a guide for this triggered me to look at myself and go what a worthless piece of [ __ ] I am like what a lying fraud and impostor that I am and she starts noticing these things and and what happened is a protective mechanism to live with this thing I thought was myself was to dissolve that thing and realize that wasn't really me at all like the me is the awareness in which all this arises in moment to moment and I can be something totally different the next day and I should have gratitude for all these amazing connections and things that I have and the I tell you and I thought I told her at the time when I was super high I said

[00:59:53] I'm gonna forget all this in the morning but this is transference crying and all this [ __ ] well then the next morning I woke up and I remembered everything that transformation was still there and over the course of weeks I had this glow my wife was like what happened and I told her I'm like I've been changed and she actually went talked to this lady and was like yeah she's got something and we're both hardcore scientists skeptics right and that changed it decayed over time but and so the ego reasserts itself but I've never been the same and that combined with living in the desert of

[01:00:23] Vegas which is a blank slate and being told basically reinvent yourself or go out of business was a personal awakening for me and since then that got me interested then and I listened it sounds cheesy but I listened to Eckhart Tolle's power of now just listen to the audiobook and listen to his voice you know there's nothing but now and a consciousness is that and I'm like okay this is [ __ ] and then about you know 20 minutes into it I'm like ya know yeah this is amazing like he's got some truth here in all the whoo there's truth and then I started down this path I mean I have found this to be some of the most insightful difficult material to digest you know you and I were joking about this before a lot of things come easily to me in terms of understanding I feel very blessed and privileged that you know whatever subject I needed to learn in school like if I decided I wanted to learn something I could learn it kind of thing when it comes to understanding consciousness when it comes to understanding the nature of my mind I feel like a complete [ __ ] and you could argue well everybody struggles with that but it's like no no I feel like I'm three orders of magnitude below the average person in this regard it's very difficult and for me like the biggest breakthroughs have been catching the narrative catching the self-talk that's like that's a huge breakthrough for me I didn't realize how much I talked to myself that was a huge breakthrough and also recognizing the transient nature of emotions also just an incredible insight very powerful insight for someone who's so prone to volatile emotions as I am you know that's funny so I just took a personality test I scored off the charts and volatility and in withdrawal which is another aspect of neuroticism and I think and again I don't want to I can't put myself in your mind but kind of knowing you the way I do I the people who are very good at learning and are very good thinker have these sub minds that are very loud they're always pitching you ideas it's like being in an elevator with the most obnoxious [ __ ] startup guy in Santa's

[01:02:22] Silicon Valley okay there's the thing it's gonna be called dick Lee and it's about taking dick pics and really democratizing them like including vaginas and also balls because I think balls are important they're often missed and so anyways that's my valve ater pitch can have 20 million dollars any get 20 million dollars it's like constantly along with the self narrative so when you say I feel like a [ __ ] I understand exactly what you're saying because being able to see clearly through the turbulence on the top of the water to the dick at the bottom because that's really what it's a big dick with extra hairy balls that's very hard so meditation is one way psychedelics are a way to jumpstart it I know you and Tim talked about this on the show and I don't want to rehash all that but I want to say that I think you guys are on the exact all these paths converge and it seems like pretty smart people are all saying the same thing which is we need to restart psychedelic research we need meditation as a crucial tool I can't follow Tim's journey remotely I've never met him but he kind of takes a classic path that a striver type-a takes in meditation which is I'm first I'm gonna use this to help me perform better then I'm gonna use it to quiet the demons and I'm gonna and ultimately what it is you use it to actually understand and appreciate your mind and transform it so that your day to day actually all these defilements these little voices and the emotional reactivity are uprooted permanently and in this book he talks about it they're having that those insight experiences it sounds very assets I found that book very difficult to read which is not to say it's not well written I just I think it again speaks to the problem I mean look I had to read waking up by Sam

[01:03:51] Harris like four times I did too and I think I'm at the point where I understand the first third in the last third I still don't understand the middle third of the book Sam it's just too hard for me like I just I don't have the CPU I don't have the neurons there's something that I can't fully understand this is a huge problem and we talked about the ineffability the inability to describe these kind of experiences and it's a huge problem I found that the mind illuminated was the closest I got as a rationalist to understanding it and even then it's like shooting electrons off something and trying to reconstruct the image that this guy already ineffably feel so you know he knows it and it's taking me a lot of repetition I think the point is we can't give up

[01:04:33] I still don't entirely understand yeah you brought up swimming earlier so I learned to swim as an adult so I was about 31 Wow and I decided relatively early in my flailing that like I really want to do this thing I want to you know to swim these long marathons and like the amount that I had to put into doing that the amount of hours I had to swim to catch up from being you know what I called an adult-onset swimmer to being able to do this thing was a lot and I used to sometimes get frustrated like a swim practice because you know I couldn't swim as fast as like half the people there and you know you had to sort of remind yourself like they've been doing this since they were four you know these people have been unswept

[01:05:15] Eames in high school in you know college blah blah blah you know there's a song by the Smiths where there's this line where Morris he says you just haven't earned it yet baby and I just love that line is like that is my mantra like every time I find myself getting sort of frustrated that I'm not good enough at something I just say you just haven't earned it yet baby you know you just have like these people have swum 20 times the number of hours you have and similarly when I find myself getting a little frustrated at you know my ability to understand consciousness and I I always think about Sam because he's just such an amazing teacher I think well dude you just haven't earned it yet baby like Sam's been on this journey his whole life you know when Sam is probably in a similar boat to us in terms of he's a very hyper rationalist you know we use this metaphor that John height uses the psychologist elephant and writer so elephant is our limbic system emotions unconscious and then our writer is the cortex on top that's conscious and the thinker and the planner our writers are hypertrophied they're super big but they're still [ __ ] completely beholden to this totally dumb ass elephant that's like pissed off look up something online that backs me up it's like well according to my data this and so Sam had to get through that bye long retreats and what I find is I'm in a position in my life now where by straight necessity to alleviate personal suffering and that happened in 2012 where I just had this break where suddenly I see things differently sometimes it takes that a letting go or relax so something I hear and what you're describing concerns me in the sense that and again it's just for my own experience that it's the striving to treat this like a pursuit like swimming or anything that requires like you know racing that will hinder ultimately you'll reach a wall where you can't release until you relax into it and let it go and surrender to it and it sounds woowoo but I think there's something there so this morning I do an hour a day now using this and I know Tim was talking about like 10 20 minutes a day and that's great to start but what I find is there's a therapeutic threshold and I think it's around an hour and it's hard to pitch that to people but once you get into that mold first you have to set that intention when you sit down like this is what I'm doing in this sitting and the intention creates a momentum of those mind moments that then drives you into the meditation so you're not lost when you get lost and thought you remember the intention you come back but at about an hour you're in a state where the noise actually quiets and when noise appears you recognize it and you ignore and you're floating on the breath and the body feels like this pulsing wave of energy and you realize oh this is all just experience happening in the present moment and it's not even I can't describe it it's it's a insight that you have and then it vanishes about 20 minutes after you're done where you lose it you're back in the world but I'll tell you if you keep repeating that I suspect if we can maintain that even for five minutes a day it's such a relief in humans I think I think the benefits even greater than five minutes a day I mean I

[01:08:07] I think so going back to the example you used about the psychedelics there's a book that Sam recommended called altered states or altered Trade Center yeah yeah the point it makes now it's a book about meditation and it talks I think it does a great job explaining that like exercise the purpose of the hour you spent in the gym this morning was not because there's something particularly insightful about moving a dumbbell from here to here here to here here to here isolating this muscle and you know putting this thing on your back and moving it in this direction and in other words those are simply tools that we're using there's a state that we create in that hour of exercise but the goal is to give you traits that last for the other 23 hours I would suspect you're gay a hell of a lot more than you know twenty minutes or five minutes of benefit thereafter my guess is that kind of a meditative practice is infused into the other 23 hours of the day in how you react I mean cuz I don't even practice that long and I feel the difference like

[01:09:08] I feel infinitely less aggressive I feel infinitely more empathic I'm a little jealous actually and I really feel like I need to up my game and I know I'm not saying that in a competitive way but like realizing there's because I just had this discussion when Kevin Rose the other day yeah and he said the same thing which is you know he has just totally upped his game and he's going like 45 minutes a day and he also mentioned that there's a real threshold you're getting over in terms of the practice and the settling of the mind and this is the thing it is a threshold effect because something does happen people who talk to me they haven't talked to me in a long time or like what happened to you you're so much nicer there's something edge that's been taken off again you don't know you know one thing that he says in the mind eliminate is that if you practice meditation without somehow applying it in your daily life it's like a bucket with no bottom the stuff goes through it's like a sieve whereas if you're starting to collect some of that mindfulness and mindfulness is just simply a lack of reactivity being able to go that's happening okay instead of making a choice Tim said it best on your podcast he said you become response able so you're able to actually make a response instead of an autonomic knee-jerk elephant alright we just have to acknowledge we took a pee break we probably forgot what we were talking about beforehand and the last thing we were talking about was I was revisiting your dick pic joke that that's making me laugh so that's right I realized I didn't add taint into the mix because the taint is often neglected you know we had a joke actually when we were admitting patients when I was an attending at Stanford the team would come to me oh yeah the trynna surgeons are trying to admit this gall bladder to us even though we don't do operation they're saying it's non-surgical there's now I go you know this reminds me of when I worked on the taint transplant service and like what do you mean you've never worked on taint transplant where you're taking donor taints and you're flying in you know homeless guy dies on the street and you take excise detain you put it on eyes and you fly it off and and I would ask them I say listen is this person in the hospital for anything other than their taint if the answer is yes it doesn't belong on our service if this is for a taint issue and taint issue only and I mean I'm talking about taint the balls taint the ass the space between those two then it's ours it's a simple algorithm and by the way the graft-versus-host disease on a taint transplant it can be devastating because both your balls and your anus are affected and when they both go down what do you have yeah really can I pitch something to you because as we were talking about meditation I want to talk about what you do as a doctor and and I and you can ask me anything like it but

[01:11:33] I want to pitch you this theory of consciousness and reality and I want you to tell me as a smart person what you think all right dr. Donald Hoffman is a professor of cognitive science and computer science at University of California Irvine he was on our show he has posited this theory and it starts with this basic idea which is do we see the world as it is or are we seeing some fabrication that isn't even close to reality and he actually was able to look at this evolutionarily he studies visual perception and how people actually perceive stuff and what he determined through lots of different studies and also different approaches in different fields was that organisms that see reality as it actually is go extinct so if you see the matrix as zeros and ones you go extinct and the reason is it takes a lot of energy to actually see reality in all its complexity and so the second proposition is well then maybe we just see part of reality but it's still real it's just not all of reality and that's what most visual science has proposed what he proposes is based on on his cognitive models and his computer models and simulations is that organisms that see any aspect of reality as it is go extinct in just a few generations where as organisms that see reality as a fitness icon designed to help them reproduce thrive so in other words there is no bottle of water here as such there's no water there's no atoms there's no paper there's none of that this is a graphical user interface that

[01:13:06] I as a human have evolved to see to help me survive I see something wet that I know that if I drink it I will not die so we have this shorthand hack in how we see the world and over and over and over he gives examples of insects who will go extinct having sex with a beer bottle because it's perfectly hacked to their interface to look like a female insect and these male insects in Australia well these beetles will have sex with this bottle to the exclusion of beautiful females nearby because it is so perfect this has been hacked in advertising with humans to make things look hyper appealing any

[01:13:40] McDonald's ad where they're opening the burger and you see the juicy cheese and all that by the way the vegans hate us don't they all that that's designed to hack our interface and his theory is the interface theory of perception that every species sees reality through a series of evolved hacks that allow us to reproduce and so here's the punchline of that what is reality is there a reality and what he argues is yes there is there is an objective reality it's not we're all not just making this up our visual cortex isn't just constructing it it's not something we're and he's looked at you know the number of neurons and the visual cortex is way more than it takes to reconstruct an image but just enough to construct an image so we are constructing the world second a second in our minds everyday but the question is based on what and if you look he then digs into quantum mechanics and I read his manuscript the book that he hasn't released yet in quantum mechanics they've pretty clearly established that there is no such thing as local realism in other words something doesn't exist until it's interacting with a conscious observer it's a probability wave so the moon maybe doesn't exist until conscious entities interface with it but what is it that we're interfacing with and this is what when he described us in a TED talk and then I read his stuff and I had him on the show I was convinced it felt intuitively correct me I want to see how you feel you may say it's [ __ ] the world is actually nothing but consciousness subdivided into things he calls conscious agents which are little subdivisions of consciousness that sum up and break down kind of the way you can have a 1-bit conscious agent and all a conscious agent is is it's able to it's a simple mathematical function and he has the formulas to kind of show this how they interact with each other and how they sum the smallest one bit conscious agent is a Planck length thing the smallest thing you can imagine that can have three things it can perceive it can decide and it can act and the currency of reality is experience its conscious experience from the tiniest levels all the way down all the way to the largest structures that we have and so when we try to explain the consciousness that hard problem of consciousness how does the brain how does this three pounds of wet goo create the experience of me seeing Peter in his cool racing hat with his kind of sexy stubble which I wish I had yeah it's an icon but I like it I'm gonna call Mike on because I want it how does it create that experience the smell of of baking you know bread and the answer is we've been going about it wrong we have to invoke a miracle in our current understanding how do we go from atoms neurons to experience well at some point there's a jump that no one has been able to explain you can wave hands yeah what he's saying is how about you start with the miracle which is everything it is awareness and consciousness and matter and neurons are icons that we use in a species specific way to understand this vast network of social the social network of consciousness interacting with itself so when I see Peter I see a sexy dude but what is really there on your insight is this vast realm of experience and perception and awareness and thought and emotion that I don't see what I see is my species-specific hack that allows me to get through the world it allows me to reproduce allows me to stay alive and allows me to survive in a way because we don't have enough processing power to see what I really think is there which is this incredibly complex series of nested consciousness all interacting and when you talk about books like this way they talk about sub

[01:17:13] Minds and meditation what you're doing is you're taking your highest instantiation which is the kind of aggregate of all these sub minds and you're looking and listening at those inner nested consciousness is interacting with each other and you're also connecting to maybe the deeper connection between all of us as a higher consciousness sounds like whoo but in his formulas he actually shows how these things work mathematically and actually the formula reduces to the Heisenberg sort of formula for electron cloud so it's really quite fascinating can it be tested experimentally right so this is what he's working on now you can compute or model this stuff and the problem is it's as valid as any other model because it's hard to test so the question is how do you test that we're all awareness interacting with awareness yeah there's a famous actually don't remember which physicist it was I don't think it was fair me but a very famous physicist once said all models are wrong some are useful that's right and he himself says this is probably only partially correct because the idea is then well why would why would evolution even happen if conscious agents just exist and they're outside of time and space it's really just a it's an important piece of this so we're wondering about time and space and are they real are they an actual thing no they are a species specific data compression algorithm that allow us to make sense of this social network and allow us to survive so space and time are different for you and me well we're similar because we have the same species presumably although you're probably not more evolved than me but like a dog or a cat or a fruit fly are all awareness interacting with other awareness but the way they see the world in space and time is a totally different construct and so all of it is constructed which transforms in my mind let's say it's true and we'll talk about how we can test it cuz I think we should brainstorm ways to test it but I think it transforms how you think about mental illness so what is mental illness but in our reductionist materialist viewpoint which we're very good as doctors at thinking because we've been conditioned to think that and I think there's a lot of truth well the way we do medicine now is we are really good at moving the icons around on the desktop we know that a serotonin icon when put into a human icons bloodstream does something to a subjective description of experience from that human subject in terms of depression but what is really happening we're like monkeys moving these icons around but what's the transistors and the electrons that actually make it up if the serotonin molecule is really a conscious agent that's the sum of little conscious agents and it's interacting with our conscious agent that re-shift how we think about how these medicines work how the mind-body connection what if that's not correct what if the serotonin agent doesn't have the ability to perceive so if serotonin is actually electrons are materially real yeah what if serotonin is simply nothing more than atoms with all of its constituent elements right electrons protons neutrons so if that's true then it it negates the entire model because it says something is materially real this model says there is nothing real beyond awareness itself and it creates reality on icons that allow it to evolve and now this is difficult stuff to grasp as scientists which both of us are you are much more than me because it goes against everything we train which is Big Bang happen somehow matter organized into complex structures that through which consciousness emerged we're saying consciousness was and subdivided into into these smaller agents that combined into bigger agents and evolved over time into complex agents like ourselves that interact with other agents and social networks that probably form higher levels of consciousness so you could actually pause it what is god but all these conscious agents at its highest instantiation in a way that it knows more than almost anything because it's a sum of all these agents now how do you test it so if serotonin is a molecule then yes our reductionist approach is right and we should continue to hammer at it if it's wrong we should still hammer at the reductionist approach because we're moving icons so as Hoffman says he says just because the desktop trash icon on my computer desktop isn't literally a trash icon and I'm not dragging real documents into it that doesn't mean I drag my life's work into it and hit delete just because I don't take it literally doesn't mean I don't take it seriously so yeah we take our icons seriously we should know all about them but we're gonna hit a wall and I think we're getting there in our understanding because until we understand what is the fundamental nature of reality we're not gonna be able to manipulate it in a way that reduces suffering which i think is what we're trying to do right when you talk about healthspan you're talking about the longest possible life with the most enjoyment or happiness or fulfillment or whatever is their individual's goal is and to me that's like a lack of suffering no one wants to live to suffer unless you're a BDSM you know bondage person and even that's not suffering because it's actually pleasure for them so suffering is a mental construct pain is eternal suffering is optional because it's how we frame it what you think I don't know it's hard for me too to actually internalize that because I mean letting go of subatomic structures as sort of not being real that would just require a lot more understanding on my part let me say this subatomic structures are absolutely real as icons so in other words they mean something they're an image yeah I think trying to imagine that they have their own state of consciousness is you know it's not even for me to wonder it's not even that so okay let me let me thinking it out a little bit because this is something that I have to think about a lot that's a dualist belief so in other words the subatomic structure electron is an electron with some awareness that's a belief called dualism it means that there is matter and there's consciousness and they're related well what Hoffman's saying what I think

[01:22:55] I Intuit from this is and I'm could absolutely be wrong and people get violently disagreeable to this idea there's no electron at all electron is a conscious agent that we see as electron through our species-specific interface it's how we've evolved to see the world we see it as and we don't ever see electrons we use equipment to intuit them but then how would we explain physical experiments that have independently validated the same construct meaning so for example when

[01:23:28] Newton came along he was the first to define a set of physical laws and they held pretty well until the early part of the 20th century when at one layer below the Newtonian understanding there was a new layer of physical laws that had to be described many of these laws have been independently validated and I would think that if it was all a hack meaning if we were all creating our own construct our own icons it strikes me as improbable that we would be converging on the same descriptions the same experimental identifications this is a great way to think about it and here's how I would think about that we have our hack but it's based on reality and reality is these conscious agents exchanging experience with each other we see it as the laws of physics we see it as an electron binding to this and this chemical reaction happening and of course it will be validated because it's actually happening in the sense that these agents are behaving relationally to each other in predictable precise ways that we can measure and science can quantify but wait but why would the electrons the protons behave in a predictable way when you and I can't behave in a predictable ahh because we don't behave predictably

[01:24:44] Peter because we are complex instantiation of multiple conscious agents that that emerge a very high level of consciousness so part of the reason you have these voices that are telling you you're an [ __ ] and I have them is that we have that are unconscious to us agents that are making decisions in the background that are feeding it up to our higher instantiation is very unpredictable as complex system the simplest systems in other words one bit 2 bit 12 bit 100 bit conscious agents behave predictably because they have three actions perceive decide act it might be that the one bit conscious agent can only have two perceptions two actions and so it sums up scientifically and mathematically as absolute predictability wait a second if you collapse that to one and one you could have a reductionist world if you had no choice mmm-hmm if all of the sub particles had no choice right it would become a semantic game well if none of the particles had a choice meaning you were you always knew how they were going to behave right right right well then you have it's the same as being materialist it's saying they have no consciousness so that's right the definition of this is they have choice and here's something that's even more interesting which again I just can't so probabilistically that just strikes me as impossible yeah right because you couldn't have the order that we have in the universe if there was any choice to be made at that level again I'm saying this is a guy who's bullshitting because he's hearing about this for the first time but that's my initial reaction is I don't understand how you could preserve any order in the universe if there was any choice to be made in that regard yeah so what's interesting is when you look at actual quantum mechanics there is uncertainty at the quantum level there is uncertainty but there is a predictor yeah but it exactly it's defined by a probability function right but it collapses to something that's known once it's observed correct so what is observation but to conscious agents interacting and exchanging experience that then allows this particular conscious agent to settle into a particular choice so to me it's not exclusive of that having choice at the smallest level now again this is the simplest of choices yeah and one thing you said was interesting to me because

[01:26:50] I've struggled with this which was how can if we all see things differently as a hack how can there be reality how can I be objective predictable scientifically valid reality well look at it this way so he gives the example which I think is very powerful of synesthetes so people have synesthesia which is they experience the world very differently instead they smell colors or they hear sights and you see colors when you hear sounds and he gives examples of a guy who anytime he tastes mint in his hand he feels a basket of ivy and it turns out that guy is a synesthetes Oh his inner face is a mutation something has changed in the way how do you know that without functional MRI or is that the way that one except he's actually done some of that on these guys essentially in this parts of the brain that light up with touch light up when he's actually thinking about mint or some so you've basically just you've disalignment rip between the external and internal sensory you know the cortex has basically been remapped there's some remapping now I would argue that the cortex as an icon we use to actually conscious Ness interacting with itself but imagine that person now is a mutation of some kind that interfaces with the world differently because he can feel mint he turns out he's a glorious chef so he has a career as a professional chef because he's able to take flavors and tactile he feel them and it's and to him it's wow that's interest it's like a basket he's putting his hand in a basket Bobby when he tastes something else I forgot make a horrible surgeon imagine I mean it tastes all of the body parts to be able because you know you rely on your feelings like chin monkey brains dr.

[01:28:27] Jones it's true so a surgeon would go extinct having that skill but a chef would evolve now imagine evolution starts to put pressures on us where only the best chefs get laid and have sex and reproduce now it Adams the default but see to me that is totally explainable through Darwinian biology right that is completely understandable so Darwin is essential for this theory as well you have to in fact the core universal principles of Darwinism have nothing to do with DNA and molecules they have to do with is something heritable is their evolutionary pressure on it and those sort of things and that works just as well with conscious agents as it does with material stuff so conscious agents can evolve over time to have perceptions that actually allow them to succeed in this social network where they're competing but I mean and again forgive me for just not having a goddamn clue what you're talking about why is it that if that bottle is an icon you can't make it lift up off the table by thinking about it because in the social network of conscious agents that happen to be this way that is not a perceptual decision or an action that's why can't you override it well there are rules between how these things actually interact in other words it's not a free-for-all it's not magical thinking it's not like well just because everything's awareness I create like

[01:29:39] Deepak Chopra he'll say something like everything is consciousness and so you can secrete which is my way of using secret as a verb you can secrete success and happiness and all that well that's not true that's magical thinking what we're saying is no have you seen the Big Lebowski dude dude the dude abides there are rules dude okay this isn't [ __ ] Nam there are rules and the rules are these things behaviors just you know one of the worst parts about trying to be health-conscious is that you can't drink White Russians as liberally as the Big Lebowski who says so you say so I mean the Kahlua is just if you want a proper I mean now you could drink a Caucasian yes right yes half and half yeah which is a little cleaner but if you want to do it right you got to have the Kahlua in it and between the vodka the Kahlua and the cream it's alcohol but I've never craved a drink

[01:30:34] I enjoy alcohol but I've never craved it until the first time I saw the Big Lebowski which was got 25 years I mean the same but I was like I want to have one of those drinks and I need to grow a mustache because I need to be able to lick that off we should have white Russians and that gets me this thanks guys could you hit gives her anyway you could fire four white boys two White

[01:30:59] Russians throw a Black Russian into just like we want to be animal Caucasian and one caucasian we initially reconnected over your work on nutrition and diet and we had a patient in common and so on and so forth and you did a bunch of testing on me that really transformed how I think and know about myself for example danke - yeah I also dabbled in pacifism not a Nam I I dabbled in ketosis as well for probably eight months you were in it for three years with one day exception I understand it and I learned a lot because I learned that I make these very small dense lipid particles that didn't seem healthy and we end up going to

[01:31:38] Mediterranean I did a lot better but the idea that a White Russian would just I couldn't do it it was devastating to me so it wasn't sustainable how are you thinking about nutrition now because you have this patient panel you're you know you're a functional medicine doc which I want to talk about as well I see again I squirm yeah like I don't know what to know what functional medicine is I mean

[01:31:56] I know what the definition is but like I don't know what I do I don't know anything I mean I know what I know but I don't know how to put a label on it and I don't know what I'm all I'm interested in I can define my objective I can define the strategy and I can define the tactics but other than that like I can't actually take an existing description and apply it to it mm-hmm but the objective which is the easiest part to state is I want to figure out a way and

[01:32:20] I'll just use myself as an example but I obviously would apply this to every patient I want to figure out a way to live longer than I am otherwise on a trajectory to live which means I have to delay the onset of the things that will kill me yeah and I want to improve the quality of my life which I define rather simply as having three legs one leg being cognition the second leg being everything that has to do with the exoskeleton of my body so the maintenance of muscle mass the ability to move maintain mobility stability which I actually think is much more important than mobility but gets no attention I can explain in a moment freedom from pain sexual function all the things that people our age take for granted but you stop taking for granted when you are in your 80s in your 90s before we got started we were looking at pictures of our kids playing instruments and stuff like that I mean because we're gonna man like the drummer pretty awesome man well mine's a virtuoso violin it's how about you well you know but if you think about the way you were able to interact with your kids in your 40s and now imagine would you be able to reproduce that in your 80s and so a lot of stuff you took for granted right like could you lay down on the floor play blocks or dolls or whatever and stand up easily or is that like a debilitating activity if your grandkid or great grandkid came running towards you could you dip down into a goblet squat position and pick up a little 30 pound terror so that sort of all is encompassed in this physical part and then the third piece which I don't have a great name for it or anything but it's and it's by far the hardest to impact as a physician because I think the first two are a little bit more within the tools that we can apply the third piece is this ability to be happy as nebulous as that is and to have what I describe as borrowing from a friend of mine Paul

[01:34:09] Conte who's always explains what I know Paul yeah yeah is just to have the highest degree of distress tolerance possible and of course mindfulness and meditation becomes the single most important tool to impact that but there are other parts to that as well social support sense of purpose all these other things and as you alluded to earlier most people if you took those things away from them they wouldn't want to live one more minute and there are exceptions to that rule I mean you look at Stephen Hawking he had one of those three completely taken away yet for all indications lived a completely fulfilling life and I'm sure wanted every additional day of life he could have had but for many people they want all of those things especially if they at some point in time have had all of those things so I guess the only way I describe myself and this is why I generally like to be referred to as a shepherd or a fr mm race car driver is

[01:34:57] I'm a dog who's obsessed with that problem and I have to say having experienced what you do from both a clinician as a patient side seeing you with a patient and with me you have a gift for this this is something that very few people have seen in medicine do which is you look at the patient as a unique individual you educate them in a way that sometimes is hard to understand actually the same way when I'm talking about consciousness we're all struggling with it you know sometimes some of the concepts that you talk about are so intuitive to us but our patients look at us like we're crazy but even then this idea that you can optimize a particular red to the goals of that unique patient is the foundation of what we call health 3.0 which we tried in our clinic turntable mmmm and it is the same idea and if we had clinicians like you surrounded with a team could you do it all yourself ready of it oh no no I have a monstrosity of a team actually tell me about your team so I have two soon-to-be three people who are basically interacting with the patients on all of the logistics of what we do we have a dietician soon to be another probably we need two health coach dieticians what we're realizing is that the hard part is not I mean it is hard to figure out what is the optimal way for a person to eat but there is a finite number of iterations you can make until you start to converge on it so that's what we call the efficacy problem by far the harder problem is the effectiveness problem I'm a walking experiment of somebody who knows exactly what he functions best on problem is I don't want to do it so I'm one of those guys who actually did incredibly well on the ketogenic diet I mean everything couldn't have gone any better now whether I should have been on it and definitely or cycled it or whatever we don't know the answer that question the point is I just didn't want to be on the ketogenic diet I mean I missed too many things so now I take a totally different approach I have a different framework around nutrition entirely that you know starts at one end with the sad the standard American diet and at the other end ends with complete caloric restriction so water only which obviously you can't do in definitely you should cycle that and then in between there are three other steps and it's one thing to figure out how to optimize a person based on how they cycle between those layers but you know like I said the harder part is figuring out how to make that the default as opposed to something you have to work into you know

[01:37:12] I'm influenced a lot by dick Taylor's work and nudge which is the easier you can make something for someone the easier it's going to be to do and just figure out a way to make them opt out of good behaviors rather than opt in to good behaviors nudge is very similar to switch which is by the heath brothers based on this elephant rider motif from

[01:37:32] John height as well and it's the same thing you create a path for the elephant rider to walk that is default good you motivate the elephant by making them feel something like they want to change or they want to do this and then you gently direct the rider the rationalists on to make that change and you know when I talk publicly - I talk about this as a model of how we can do health 3.0 to influence change in our patient I remember what you were asking us to do was very hard you have to be motivated to want to do it we happen to be but let me ask question like are fat people fat because they just don't have the willpower that it's their fault that they're fat or is it that we just haven't cracked the hack for how to motivate people make the system by default better and find their optimal plan for them I mean it's such a complicated question there's something called the dunning-kruger effect I don't know if you're familiar with anti-vaxxers love this because they know a little oh yeah can we come back to vex absolutely oh can we yeah I actually lost a patient over this once lost not died lost left lost left yeah a patient of mine had some questions about not wanting to get his kids vaccinated and came to me assuming that I would agree with him that he should not have his kids vaccinated and I said nope I you absolutely should get your kids vaccinated and I said look here's the one deviation I made from the protocol we waited six months to do the first panel instead of doing them on the first day but yeah that was no rhyme or reason that was just my intuition said give the little bastards a break for six months but yeah I can't imagine any reason why you wouldn't want to vaccinate your children and he went Loco he was like I expected more from you

[01:39:12] I can't believe blob I mean he was pissed that was it like he left I mean he stopped he didn't want to ever see me again so as someone who dabbles in the anti-vaxxer the point where people are banging on this door shouting obscenities at me during the live show with Paul Offit I will say this what you triggered was that person's elephant so they're unconscious was triggered in a way where their entire conception of the world their ideas of Liberty versus justice versus care versus harmed as moral palette that John Hyde talks about which we can talk about more later but this idea that vaccines are a violation of the sanctity of the body so you're putting toxins in the body and the idea that he probably went to you thinking you were a little bit off the grid that you're looking at the unique person and therefore you're not gonna swallow the dogma right but the truth is what he didn't realize is no you while it works and the things that have been shown to work are in fact vaccines and not a whole lot of other stuff until you really look at it and you look at supplements you look at a lot of things

[01:40:08] Peter like stuff that would give standard American doctors or also Sadducee of the standard American diet and the Senator American doctor or sad The Hives because you have taken yourself self experimented with tons of supplements and you've drawn blood a million times don't you have a quantified person because you care about finding out truth for patients and also for yourself but this idea that you triggered that person in a way that they made a moral judgment about you that was so far off their moral compass that they couldn't tolerate stomach the idea of seeing you until we recognized how people work will never be able to connect with anti-vaxxers that way because we can't imagine why people would think that way and it's one thing to understand them it's another thing to condone delusional and dangerous thinking in public forums like running into a theater and yelling fire and that's what the hardcore professional anti-vaxxers do in our platform has a zero quarter for that now i just banned them i ridicule them i shame them i drop f-bombs on them i will never stop until these professional anti-vaxxers are stopped however the mother on the fence the person who's like been conditioned by this stuff on the internet that's where it's obligate on us to be patient but I think that's what happened with your patient well what's interesting is I'm not particularly equipped to delve into that so I remember this discussion because my next step was and it's been so long ago god I don't even I don't even remember this but I think I mean I don't remember all the details but I remember saying to him look there was this one paper that got made this an issue but you know it was retracted right like you know that it wasn't retracted because the calculations were wrong it was retracted because it was fraud great fry and do you realize that all of this sort of propaganda you're buying into emanated from something fraudulent which was I think a bit more of an intellectual approach I don't think I had the resourceful Nisour the insight at the time to take an emotional approach emotional might be the wrong word but less of a let me just beat you down with more facts and explain to you why this is right so my guess is he was pissed not only in the fact that I was obviously a not outside the box thinker but maybe on some level he was just pissed that you know I probably talked to him like an idiot I was dismissive of him right you really put your finger on something that we do in medicine a lot and I'm guilty of it and that is speaking all too right or trying to give them data when we haven't motivated elephant or understood elephant and unconscious motivation and this guy what

[01:42:31] I've started doing is sitting down and going yeah so why why do vaccines bother you let's just take Wakefield and his study out of the equation what is it about about them that really bothers you well they're forced on me I don't like this idea of toxins in my body or I don't trust the government I don't trust Big Pharma and I'm like you know what I don't either

[01:42:49] I wouldn't let government-run health care I don't want fully socialized medicine I think that's crazy but I do think that the government does a lot of things that are good and and things are much more complex but let's talk about ways that maybe we can come to it understand because we both want what's right for the kid it's very hard though because we get our own emotional I get so angry man I've gotten triggered apart

[01:43:09] I go on these expletive replaced rants on my show and you know what here's the thing Peter you know this as well as I it will get a [ __ ] ton of views when I lose my [ __ ] and I'm like [ __ ] these anti-vaxxers and everything they in there everything about them and it will go crazy because doctors will be like that's what I've been wanting to say forever because my elephant is conditioned a certain way which is care versus arm I want these children to live and not die of preventable disease when you see a case a measely see whooping cough in hospital it will devastate you you know we were showing each other pictures of our kids like imagine one of our kids getting measles and you didn't vaccinate them how am I gonna feel about you as a person as a doctor so that kind of thing it's easy and it's seductive it's I like to think of the emperor in his robes going yes and you would replace your father by my side and just beams of light dark force energy coming out but the truth is that that is not going to influence those people and I've had to struggle with this because my platform reached a lot of people and I get a lot of criticism on both sides of our you're being too much of a dick or you're not being enough of a dick and it's like the truth is nuanced and people hate nuance and you know they hate it and that's the thing about you I remember you used to get really pissed when people will be like so what are you eating now what's your diet like it changed it's not my diet isn't your diet and then that you would say the diet and then in the comments there'd be people like I thought you are about ketones man you're a fraud how dare you eat a molecule of carbohydrate and they're super triggered because for them this nutrition is a religion and I've experienced that we did a show about that documentary what the health have you heard about this thing yeah a bunch of docs they're spouting vegan propaganda cherry-picking studies and saying this is the only diet there's a thing I have no problem of you can diet the thing is it's not the only thing well that's you know that's the funny thing it's run you bring that up because that's the point I try to make is any diet that you do that's different from the sad if you compare it to the sad is amazing yeah you can't do worse than the sad the standard American diet I can't accept eating more of it so the only if you're if you're over here on the left side of my framework you're eating a standard American diet which is this incredibly perfectly engineered ratio of just the right amount of refined carbohydrates the right amount of sugars the right amount of fats it's like you couldn't come up with a better way to kill someone then that diet and I'm not really into the conspiracy theory that that's deliberate I mean I think the harm is absolutely not an intended consequence it's the palatability it's the shelf life it's the cost it's the all of these other things is the intended thing it's basically driven by profitability I mean let's just call a spade a spade as an unfortunate consequence the drug kills the user and that tends to be the case with good drugs you know eventually cigarettes are gonna kill you if you drink too much it's gonna kill you if you eat too much sad it's gonna kill you so you're starting out here in sad land and then most people only realize one box on the on the framework which is called dietary restriction which is when you restrict certain elements of what you can eat less sad well it's yeah but it's it's take something out of sad or reduce some element within sad so you don't restrict when you eat you don't restrict how much you eat you just restrict certain elements of it so it's an ad libitum diet that contains something or that is absent something in the sad God so a keto diet is a great example of dietary restriction as is a paleo diet as is a Mediterranean diet as is a vegan diet as is a vegetarian diet these are all exhausted they're talking about they're basically talking about one little cluster of the state space in nutrition which is dietary restriction no one's talked about it time restricted feeding hypocaloric feeding caloric restriction so all of these guys are trying to nuke each other saying but what they're forgetting is they're all comparing it to sad right which and guess what you're all right all of your diets are better than sad I mean that's like saying like my pancakes tastes better than that dog [ __ ] over there yeah I bet your pancakes will taste better than that dog [ __ ] - how dare you my pancakes taste vastly worse than dog [ __ ] by the way that's a bumper sticker my diets better than sad yes it is so they're all at this reference point that's dumb all of them contain price and it's relevant it's like there's too much focus on this whole thing and you know so when people say to me like do you think of paleo diets better than a vegan diet advice for us

[01:47:42] I'm like it's kind of like an irrelevant question to me truthfully like if the alternative if you're asking me my choice is you know I'm going vegan or I'm going back to my standard American diet I'm like you better stay vegan Yeah right yeah please don't ever deviate from this one thing if it's keeping you away from being on a standard American diet yeah well you know and for me going from ketosis into kind of Mediterranean with intermittent fasting to now feeding window of like once a day that's I finally found a sweet spot where it's not only good for me in other words I feel better my labs are good but I can do it and I enjoy that meal so much and it allows me to be with my family during the meal we eat together and I cheat on the weekend because I'm with my family so it worked for me personally this idea that I think obesity is something that it's going to take a multi-pronged approach and fat shaming I did a video where it was a short rant and it was called it's your fault your kid is obese and my take was this and I love your opinion on this uh I said listen yeah there are social determinants of health yeah food deserts exist yeah it's hard to afford good food but if your kid absent a medical cause is obese it is [ __ ] your fault it is entirely your fault as a parent because control what goes in that child's mouth

[01:48:54] I'm talking about young kids and they don't make decisions they'll say they'll throw a fit and stuff and yeah you can negotiate with them but if you're giving them a soda or big thing of orange juice oh my god understand you're just giving them a load of sugar they're drinking their calories and then they're obese that is on you you need to educate yourself you need to understand these simple things and a ton of people were like yeah it's finally some doctor says what we're thinking but then a lot of people push back in there like sometimes this is fully systemic and you're asking somebody who has poor education to do this stuff where you stand on that am I wrong am I crazy I mean truthfully I don't spend much time thinking about this problem at all anymore it has been probably three years since this was something that was in my crosshairs and as is often my want when I'm laser focused on something it is generally to the exclusion of almost everything else so while I think that what you're describing from an endpoint is imminently relevant I don't have the data to speak to it my intuition is that it is probably not as Extreme as you are stating it I think I have over the years become more and more empathic might be the wrong word but maybe it is the right word probably just a little you know I look at my family for example right so my father knows everything I've ever thought taught described my father will not for the life of him take one bit of advice from me medically or dietarily is it because he's not intelligent enough to know is it because he can't afford to eat the way I suggest he would eat no there's some other reason there and I don't know what it is but I also don't know that it's his fault you know I just

[01:50:38] I don't know how to think of it in those terms it's certainly vexing to me and it's probably one of the sort of few triggers that still I have to be very conscious of not getting upset in that setting but I just don't know so in the example you gave you know you take those parents that are giving their kids whatever I mean the kids still drink regular soda is that still or has that been generally curbed they still drink regular soda and not only that on the decline isn't it haha there are kids in this town that put the parents put dr. pepper fully sugared in a bottle and give it to the kid thinking it'll keep them quiet or it's healthy in some way so I mean I guess to me it's just hard for me to say that that parent is at fault because they're not playing with the same template that you or I are playing with so again if I were obsessed with this problem I would solely be interested in changing the environment so what is it that's making you put diet pepper in that bottle is because it's cheaper is it because it's there is it because I had better shelf life is it because it tastes better and it shuts the kid up like I want to understand why it's the diet pepper and I want to figure out how it is you can put something that's not diet pepper in there that would still check what I consider the sort of these four boxes of the default food environment that's a nanny state Peter people don't want you taxing sugar or preventing it from being and again I don't know that taxing is the right way to do it I mean I you know one of the things that I had thought a lot about was an experiment that never got off the ground so when I was still involved in this world I used to have these sort of thought experiments and occasionally some of them become interesting ideas for actual experiments

[01:52:10] I think this would have been one but it would have been prohibitively expensive and I think logistically quite challenging but it was to basically take to areas that were in reasonable proximity and similar to each other that we're both quote unquote food deserts and do an experiment so in the control group you would give them an amount of money that was going to allow them to sort of buy whatever they want but you wouldn't change the food environment or anything like that so you just poured more fuel on whatever fire was there and in the treatment group and you by the way have to do this as a cross over so it's not a random assignment you have to cross them over in the treatment group you would do a whole bunch of other stuff which is you teach them how to cook you give them the money and oh by the way then you go into this is the really hard part of the experiment you go into the stores where they will buy all of their food and you price switch everything position switch everything and see if you can create a new default so the cocoa puffs are no longer $2.99 they're like $12.99 but you know the eggs and the avocado and you know maybe the steel-cut oats like those are now super cheap and by the way there ones that are sitting in the front of the store with like the buy two for one right now but the cocoa puffs you can still buy them they're just four times more and that you got a freaking find them and you got to ask Sally where they are and Sally probably won't even remember where they are and they might not even be in stock so it's like you totally changed the food environment and the fantasy I had was you ran these one year in parallel and then you crossed him over and see this is why it's so [ __ ] hard to study nutrition because that's what you would have to do yeah and I had done the math on how much this was gonna cost I mean there was a day when I used to think about this stuff so often that I I sort of had what a budget for this would be and it was in the grand scheme of things not outrageous I mean it would be sort of one twentieth of the cost of developing a new drug but still you know in the tens of millions of dollars so we'll never do it because prevention proactivity looking at root causes not something we do in American medicine and you know when you were talking about giving people the tools education etc teaching them to cook that's what we did a turntable so we had a teaching kitchen in our facility we had health coaches that would teach you know winnie-the-pooh how to cook in a food desert on a budget without honey and it worked so these patients transformed their lives and they would say well I really like the health coach and I felt accountable to them and they felt like they cared about me and I didn't want to let either one of us down and so this motivation component the education component and then going to the supermarket with it what the coaches would you look at their shopping list and go yeah you're [ __ ] this up so here's it here's a simple thing I shop in the periphery of the supermarket

[01:54:47] Center all these little hacks so it got to the heart of this issue of first of all patients need to feel like we actually care and they're being held accountable to some degree because we function in that way if we're just left to our own devices like I'm not gonna listen to my son about this [ __ ] and that's how my dad is the same thing I can give him advising whatever there's a emotional component to but humans are humans and we're driven by these unconscious urges and processes and until we are able to understand them we can't hack them and since it's all consciousness anyways and I've it managed let me ask you a question though relating to this free will do you think it's a real thing do you think humans actually make these choices oh boy I mean I would say this if you asked me this question two years ago I would have said absolutely 100% on the freewill train all day long so people have freewill yeah whoo whoo free will all day I am now in a gray area where I'm I'm starting to begin to understand the counter-argument mmm what I love about the counter-argument is it's another great empathic in' that do you know how much easier it is to go through life when you stop being a pompous piece of [ __ ] who thinks you're so good because of your own free will you just nailed what I was gonna say which is empathic in which is an amazing word something that generates empathy when I came to the conclusion that free will was largely an illusion but I have some nuance to that but it was Sam Sam Harrison book freewill and this idea that these thoughts and impulses bubble up from dark spaces that we cannot nail down I made a decision I made the decision first of all the state of AI is a bit of an illusion but let's say there is an eye and a little guy behind our head pulling levers how did he come to that choice well it bubbled up from unconscious processes that we don't understand states and causes and conditions and so as a result when somebody does something dumb in a way they could never have acted otherwise the same person molecule for molecule could not have acted otherwise and that's a tremendous and passage in because it means instead of judging them and getting angry you can say let's see if we can perturb this neuronal storm to spin in a slightly more productive way for what their goals are in to clarify I think one thing that someone listening to this might get confused by is that's not to say that there aren't consequences for the choices that are made so if your absence of free will enabled you to decide you wanted to take a drink you know have a couple White

[01:57:10] Russians and drive home and in the process you hit somebody okay maybe that you know maybe you didn't choose to do that or choose to make all of the decisions the bad decisions that led you there but there will be consequences for those actions yes absolutely and this is what people who say you know you don't think they're free well then the whole criminal justice isn't exactly their sort of confusing and confounding to issue they are because you murder someone you made a choice to do it you made a choice well I wasn't free well that's my argument your honor sure you're going to jail forever why because we need to make sure that others who also don't have free will have their sub Minds condition that if you commit murder you go to jail forever or you

[01:57:47] I depending on what state you're in and whatever your beliefs are indefinitely and so as a result that deterrent reconditions the unconscious that then allows different decisions to be made so my feeling on on freewill is that it's actually much more nuanced these sub Minds actually have their own freewill and they feed it up and it's conditioned by our downward input so what comes out is a consensus decision and so in a way yes we are kind of in charge who we decide decide to be around if I hang out with Peter or T I'm gonna be better for it if I hang out with you know Charles

[01:58:15] Manson I'm probably gonna come up with some shitty stupid ideas if I fall into a Facebook hole where all I'm looking at is all left or all right or alt Center I'm gonna miss I'm gonna be conditioned in a way that maybe mal productive so those things matter there are consequences we should hold them cut so when I do the show about blaming I say it's your fault that your kid is obese my secret reason for doing that it's not that I actually think they're to blame it's that somebody will watch that and go I never wait what I've been giving dr. pepper and the thing like it's my fault what do you mean and they and they just something clicks and they go wait so that I'm not supposed to do that okay

[01:58:49] I'm gonna I'm gonna do something different so it's a way of influencing - now it may not work so blame may not work there's some data that it doesn't and in looking at Hospital errors just culture is one of these like blame free kind of scenarios there's some data that people will hide and they won't come out and admit errors if they fear retribution whereas in a environment where we're trying to make the system better it could change so again it's a gaming this bigger system totally unrelated in medicine did you guys do M&M all the time okay I was the presenting party in

[01:59:17] M&M at least once and that's morbidity and mortality so it's really funny I remember the first this is totally off topic but just what you said about the coming out one of the things I miss the most about being in an academic Medical Center is mm-hmm so the morbidity mortality conference so Moe's well just explained and I assume it's the same in surgery as it is in medicine what we would do is every Tuesday morning at 6 a.m. there was no exception to this rule like there was nothing that would get in the way of this conference all of the surgeons the residents the fellows the attendings everybody would meet in a room and all of the complications so the morbidities permit immortality the morbidities and then they all the deaths the mortalities would be presented and it was a very unemotional conference so I would stand up there and

[02:00:03] I would say mr. Smith was a 47 year old man who came to the emergency room on such and such a day presenting of left lower quadrant pain we suspected diverticulosis Bubble Bobble took him to the o.r did this that and then oh and by the way he had a pulmonary embolism and died six days later okay and so you just unemotionally present the facts and then comes the process okay let's start with the basics was the unsub cue heparin was he up walking did he have a hypercoagulable state did you do this did you do this did you do this and I've never been afraid of speaking in public with maybe one exception that was a very difficult conference to present at but by the time you were presenting ie by the time you were senior enough to be the one to stand up there and present you had seen the beauty of it and the benefit of it which is it hurts there's no denying it it's it mean it's it's a rectal exam without any lubrication yeah but there's benefit you see this and so

[02:01:01] I remember when I left medicine the first place I went to was to work at this consulting firm McKinsey and company which I loved you know another exceptional fun chapter of my life but I remember like naively asking at one point I'm like why don't these companies do M&M and everyone's like what do you mean they eat M&Ms all the time and I'm like oh no no sorry I mean morbidity mortality why is it that there isn't a post hoc analysis of everything that goes wrong in a totally unemotional way that just and and and the reason M&M works is it's completely closed there is no legal recourse so there's no hiding nobody who's not a part of surgery is allowed in that room yeah and that's sort of what enables it to be that way which I look if you're the you know if you're running a publicly traded company you don't have that luxury and I had the same experience with M&M it was this horrible painfully going up thing on this patient died because of a mistake that was made here and then having to go through that and everybody looking at you and being like so what you did this did you think about this I did but I decided this do you feel like that was a correct decision well obviously not but coming out just like okay first of all

[02:02:08] I'm glad that that that I was able to talk about this because you don't think I've been beating myself up about this like just a second-year resident like this is devastating to me like I went into this to help people my biggest fear is hurting people and I hurt someone and you come out so much stronger for it even though you've been put through this wringer and we you right we don't do that another eyes it's a blame culture like you get fired if you screw up in a lot of businesses in the hospital nurses often get fired if they make mistakes and the truth is it ought to be a no blame culture what was going on in that

[02:02:37] Pyxis dispensing system that allowed that medicine to be dispensed even though you erroneously typed it in wrong and it was a paralyzing agent instead of a sedative and the person died under torture and the CT scanner and you didn't check on them because there was no protocol saying they had to be monitored well we need to fix that was there malicious intent was a recklessness was there substance abuse on the part of the of the nurse of the doctor no all right well now we need to talk about how can we prevent this from happening and what is accountability what does it mean in the setting of maybe free will not being entirely a real thing but at the same time having us having to behave like it is or else people won't it won't condition people to do the right thing I love how we turn freewill into M&M I never get to talk about M&M this is why this is why you need to do a show that no one will listen to it's just you and me about stuff we care about you know having been through it all what do you care about

[02:03:24] Peter like what are you interested in these days what's driving you these days and how can my experience because what I've done is is so different as well and I can't categorize it when people ask me I want them to just to stop talking cuz I'm like I don't want to tell you this yeah you have a parter story I don't know that it's harder it's just it's just it's more complicated narrow I say

[02:03:42] I'm a professional clown cuz that's all my dad says so you'll become a professional clown huh at least you're putting some non on the table now what are you doing it just you know jacking off on this camera he doesn't even know what that means he just hears me say it needs like audio Jackie I'm like don't say that in mixed company it's not something you know so you know you're spending your time but you're you're between San Diego and New

[02:04:10] York you're doing all this cool stuff you're talking with like really smart people on your podcast what's driving you right now personally or professionally because there's a bit of a divide I want to go personally action okay let's go professional first I would say professionally I am really really obsessed with the question of what is the appropriate dose of caloric restriction and the frequency and of the molecules that mimic that so when you start to think about metformin rapamycin especially and complete caloric restriction so I've really lost interest in much of the junior stuff that gets close to there so I sort of view that as filler when you're not fasting okay let me interrupt for a second for my medical audience a lot of them are gonna have no [ __ ] clue what you just said so rapamycin metformin caloric restriction operating on the principle that a lot of studies in animals mammals show that some form of caloric restriction increases longevity through a series of mechanisms and there are molecules and receptors that might mimic or be at least partially responsible for the action of this caloric restriction in terms of promoting longevity rapamycin is one metformin might be another yes sorry I just want to make sure I understood because I am dumb about this stuff yeah yeah I know thank you for clarifying that so molecules like metformin which have a net effect of activating an enzyme called a MP kinase which is a nutrient sensing enzyme it mimics something that you see when you're being deprived of calories conversely rapamycin inhibits something called the mechanistic target of rapamycin they got very creative on the naming em tool tor would be a great superhero sounds like a he-man bad guy

[02:05:49] I'm Skeletor shoulda been an x-men it should have been so rapamycin inhibits that mTOR which is sort of the central nutrient sensor for amino acids so again when you inhibit mTOR you were mimicking deprivation of amino acids and then of course there's just the old-fashioned way to do it which is just don't have anything but water and that's that seems to work really well provided you do it in short enough periods of time I mean if you do it indefinitely you arrive at a state called malnutrition and you die but the problem is we don't have a clue what the optimal dose is so if you treat caloric restriction like a drug meaning don't eat for this long a period of time and then repeat that at this frequency we don't know the answer to that question furthermore we don't know like do you need to go all the way could you just eat 500 calories a day for a certain period of time and repeat that at a certain frequency so you pretty quickly realize that it becomes an infinite problem you have the number of calories you consume somewhere from zero to something not too big the composition of those calories if it's anything but zero the duration at which you're exposed to that and the frequency with which you repeat it and then by the way if you want to add a fourth variable since we talked in quantum physics add that whole three layer three space onto the what you consume when you're not doing that the problem becomes ridiculous and it's unsolvable that's an unsolvable problem so what do you do when you're an engineer and you have an unsolvable problem you take a guess at states that would be discrete enough that they're not too close to each other that they should overlap that much and you would test them so you would ask the question well if caloric restriction and/or rapamycin and/or metformin extend life what would be some of the readout states of that so my obsession professionally is understanding those readout states and basically collaborating with and facilitating the funding of research to answer those questions so there will be a says-- that need to be created to measure the readout states of that including things like a toffee g so at Hoffa G as the name suggests Otto Fei Jie self eating that is generally regarded as probably the most important though not the only mechanistic change that occurs under caloric restriction and administration of rapamycin undertaking this line of research as you said is very complex and what you're ultimately trying to figure out is really what it what is the best mix of variables because I have a fasting routine that I literally pulled out of my ass and you know I have patients that are doing slightly different ones or the same ones and I have patients that aren't fasting at all because you know it's still a bit scary and you know in the end I just sort of want to be able to give a dose response you know I want to be able to say to a patient look if you want to go all in this would be as reasonable or you know as aggressive a protocol as you might want to take but look you could get 50% of the benefit of that doing this and you could get 20% of the benefit doing this and if you stack this with this you can you know do XY and Z so I have spent years experimenting on myself with this stuff but the measurement tools that I have are too blunt to actually make any reasonable inference seen any a better study I need much better tools to measure what we care about so that's your passion now and you also treat patients trying to help them are you using these medications on patients metformin yes rapamycin no right because rapamycin is a transplant rejection drug yes now rapamycin gets a bit of a bad rap it's a much safer drug than people realize like I would be less afraid of a patient taking rapamycin than ciprofloxacin cool yeah exactly at the right dose yeah exactly and at the right frequency I mean I wouldn't want a patient taking rapamycin at the frequency that we gave it to a kidney transplant patient but we certainly know enough now based on all of the literature out there including literature in humans dogs etc that rapamycin given at certain doses at certain frequencies actually enhances the immune system and improves many metrics of physiology so if you talk about giving rapamycin at that dose versus giving you know cipro for a bad

[02:10:07] UTI I'll take Rapa all day long I mean given how small my interaction is with patients because I have so few of them the fact that I've already known to patients who in the course of their life have had tendon injuries during the course of fluoroquinolones I've become sort of paranoid about these antibiotics which might be an overreaction by the way I'm not sure it is man because we used to give him out like candy no it was a moxie cipro era when I was training and everybody with pneumonia got that because it covered all kinds of [ __ ] and then you know essentially we didn't see a lot of tendon stuff it might be it was seen as an outpatient it's I was just about to say the research I've looked into this is you have about a six month window of susceptibility to tendon injury following fluoroquinolone what we saw more often was a higher incidence of c diff c difficile in a bowel infection in fact III had a picture you've done any songs on C do yes it's called dawn of the DIF and I took a lot of rapamycin so

[02:11:00] I could bust a rap about yeah was it was really it was one of our early songs but it was all about how people will come asking with intent for a cold antibiotics and go away with a debilitating bowel infection that could be fatal and not a patient who died of it coded in the CT scanner and had a huge pair of colonic abscess from c-diff and I remember telling his son who was a marathon runner that his dad had died and where I was in ICU and it was one of the most

[02:11:28] I'll never forget it because the whole thing was iatrogenic mean it was caused by by one error after in one error after another and this is one thing I want to say because I think your listeners in particular they're not all you know doctors and medical people they may be scientists or people who care about this stuff you don't understand how [ __ ] up and terrible the hospital is as a place to be safe and taken care of it is a disasterous zone of chaos of infection of errors of poor system design of lack of coordination and of expense that doesn't need to be done and until we feel that emotionally in our elephant we're gonna continue to perpetuate a broken system we have to wake up and realize that even it may be we need AI to help coordinate our care maybe we need better technology maybe we need better processes but none of it's happening because our incentives are still fee-for-service which is we get paid to do things to people and in a hospital you can do a shit-ton to people and hospital gets paid nobody's incentivized to make it safer even though we all have a story of someone who we love where we took care of who died because of a medical error who got injured because of a medical error so to me this has become a recent passion so when I hear you talking about rapamycin I get excited because maybe we can keep people out of the hospital we do the Solano's I think the thing that rapamycin that's so exciting is it doesn't just increase lifespan I mean if that's all it did it wouldn't be that interesting because the US healthcare system is pretty good at increasing lifespan in the presence of deteriorating health we can torture you in the IC for years we can keep you alive for an extra year if your aorta ruptures if we're really willing to go all-in

[02:13:04] ECMO yeah yeah yeah but it's the increase in health span that comes with it or stated more accurately it's the reduction in the rate of health band decline that's because it's always going to decline you're never gonna be able to do it 91 you did it that's right that's right my intention is to sort of understand what the twenty requirements are to be a kick-ass hundred year old so consider like a new Olympic sport is the centenarian decathlon so you figure out what all those metrics are and then engineer your way back to what you need to be able to do at 40 50 60 70 80 to hit that target so that's the second professional problem I'm obsessed with so the first one is this whole thing around developing finer tools to probe the molecular places where we're gonna see readout States on caloric restriction rapamycin metformin other agents that are CR memetics meaning drugs that mimic caloric restriction and then the second completely independent obsession is codifying what does the perfect training routine look like that makes me at a hundred the thing I have in my mind in other words that's why I don't actually care if I can swim 25 miles today I don't care if I can ride my bike 200 miles I don't care if I can deadlift 500 pounds anymore like none of those things matter to me anymore not that they weren't interesting and valuable and beneficial at one point in my life but I don't think they matter enough to this centenarian Decathlon that makes a lot of sense and it kind of brings it back to what your what your goals are and how you're changing over time and we all are that's the thing people expect something static of human beings they expect us to be the same person we were here and here and here and here and here and I think for me that's very uncomfortable because I think we evolved over time and our interest evolved and I think medicine as a entity is a complex evolving organism we treat it like some easy system or something we can game or as not do you have any thoughts on what you would do if you had a magic wand how would you reform health care from a payment model they have you ever thought about that stuff I have actually but not in a very long time I think my answers are conceptually quite simple but practically almost impossible so I'll start with a story and I've actually given a talk on this once you know before we were shooting this breeze here

[02:15:18] I was explaining how much I hate giving talks yeah but one of the talks I gave was actually on this particular issue it's the only time I've ever spoken about it was like a hundred years ago but I started with this example so I had a friend who's an expat so he's an American but living in Saudi Arabia but he would always spend like June July

[02:15:34] August September back in DC because you know obviously it's pretty hot in Riyadh those at that time of the year and I remember him saying that I don't even know how this came up but just as like in the conversation that he left the air-conditioning on for those four months and he would just set it like in a matter of passing I was like whoa dude what do you mean you leave the air-conditioning on for four months he's like well like if you didn't leave the air-conditioning on when you come back in October like it's gonna be a hundred and twenty degrees in your apartment I was like yeah but you'll turn the a/c on and in like three hours it'll be 75 degrees he's like yeah but that would take like three hours of being like balls hot and I was like dude I I'm struggling to understand the logic here he goes oh you don't understand like we don't pay for our energy in Saudi Arabia

[02:16:22] I forget what the number was it cost like two dollars a month to keep my air conditioning on the whole summer so for me spending eight bucks or 19 bucks or whatever it was to keep my air conditioning on all summer is totally worthwhile and so we can listen to that in the United States and we can laugh our asses off at how ridiculous that is and oh those stupid government subsidizing their people and that's the root of all evil in the Middle East and blah blah blah blah blah and it's like hey dude get off your high horse and take a look at the US healthcare system it's a long story but I basically got a bunch of data to plot out what the PNL looked like of the US healthcare system we shouldn't have to be much harder than

[02:16:57] I expected this took all of my McKinsey ninja skills to get these data and if you plotted basically where the dollars come in and who makes the decisions on where the dollars get spent guess what we're in Saudi Arabia brother mmm-hmm the people who are driving the cost are not bearing the cost and so it's not that dissimilar from you going to the Lexus dealer and knowing that you only have to pay nine percent of the cost of whatever car you get do you really think that the parking lot that

[02:17:32] I'm looking at now would look as it does if people were only on the hook for nine percent of the car that they got no so fundamentally if you want to fix the cost issue you must be able to couple decision making to spend you can't have those uncoupled and they're currently uncoupled but the other thing that is worth mentioning and

[02:17:55] I'll get off my soapbox on healthcare is there are two other legs of healthcare that often get confused with the third so so you have cost you have access and you have quality and you don't get to move one without the others coming along so you can't fix one independently so the other thing that sort of frustrates me when people talk about healthcare which is why I never talk about it I view it like religion and politics I just I've decided I don't give a [ __ ] at all I don't care what anybody thinks I don't want anybody to know what I think although you've asked so now you're stuck hearing what I think but what bothers me is that when people talk about this they talk about those three things like they're independent variables whereas the moment you decide while Canada's got the best health care system in the world because of X Y & Z it's like no no that's actually not correct you have to understand what

[02:18:48] Canada has optimized for Canada has optimized for cost they've optimized for quality to some extent and they've optimized for access but not in the immediate sense so the difference is in Canada it's cheaper and you have XY and Z but like if you want to go and you know like things that you and I would take for granted like if you tore your

[02:19:09] ACL or suspected you tore your ACL you would have an MRI within 24 hours here that's not going to happen in Canada unless you have the money to cross the border and get it done in the United States you could easily wait six months for an MRI their access to physicians I mean the stories are horrible and I know this cuz my whole family's still there so it's not just like I'm sort of making this stuff up I mean I'm seeing what they're going through and yet there are still things that are amazing in Canada like when my father had an enormous operation there I was totally impressed with his care I mean it was as good as care he would have received at a great

[02:19:42] US Hospital and it didn't cost a penny and that blows my mind because you don't need these sort of nonsense internal accounting system that we have in US hospitals where like the cup that you collect your urine and is 78 bucks and you know like that bag of IV saline over there is a hundred bucks and all this kind of nonsense so the short answer is if I could wave a magic wand on this system as much as I hate to say it on some level you have to have at least a blanket called a singer single-payer system I do believe that if you truly try to individually privatize this thing you cannot get that silly D couple out the second thing and this is also very unpopular to say is I do think we as patients need more skin in the game now of course under the current pricing regime that would be impossible right you you couldn't allow patients to be exposed to more than the 9% that we're already exposed to and it's probably higher by now by the way those are all data you would probably know what the current exposure is but because the prices are so inflated and so nonsensical and as you probably know I mean you obviously know this but maybe the listeners don't I mean medical cost is the leading cause of personal bankruptcy so the answer is in patients need to spend more they just need to own a greater share of the cost which really means the total cost can't be a [ __ ] scam which is sort of what it is right now so as interesting and important as all of that stuff is I never think about it very complex problem and I don't think about it at all you know what's funny everything you just said I have been batting around this quite a bit because part of what I try to do I have a solution I'm gonna pitch you real quick I think it fulfills most of what you're saying because our plans again converge like many things it's strange when people think about these things independently and they converge we've never talked about this so my plan for fixing healthcare is this first of all you need to put patients can in the game the way you do that is to give them a personal health account up to about $2,500 if you're very poor that can be subsidized by the government what do you use that for you use that for primary care services or out-of-pocket expenses oh it's use it or lose it use it or well it's use it or maybe it grows maybe you keep it but it has to be used within healthcare so there's no incentive to not spend it you exactly want to use it in healthcare and the thing is you want to use it for primary care and the way you do primary care right is the way we did turntable health which is a flat membership fee for an unlimited all you can treat access a relationship-driven preventative minded team-based healthcare that's technology enabled but not enslaved that's evidence informed but not evidence to slave you can look at the unique patient you're not subject to metrics beyond the patient having outcomes that matter to them because otherwise they will take their money and they will they'll take their personal health account and they'll go somewhere else so it's people competing with each other based on what they're providing to the patient so you would be on that planet use the money to pay you instead of once they reach that twenty five hundred then it gets into a deductible space so at this point if you're a rich person that deductible may be seventy five hundred dollars or whatever it is for your family which it is now so it's like that now if you're poor it might be subsidized by either your employer or by the government to some degree but your skin is still somewhat in the game and so you're paying for that now once you reach the deductible that's where the catastrophic Medicare kicks in that is

[02:23:03] Medicare for all but not in a single-payer sense it doesn't pay for everything it's not like carte blanche fee-for-service you get whatever you want it's a catastrophic wraparound if you go to the hospital it will cover it after you paid your duct well after you use your personal health account and it's given out in the administered in the same way that medicare advantages in other words different entities compete to be the most efficient with that money so in other words if a hospital system can actually keep you out of the hospital it doesn't spend all the money it gets to keep the shared savings something like that so you have businesses competing you have the government covering everybody nobody falls through the cracks hospitals compete doctors compete but everybody gets to practice the way they want you get to choose your doctor and their skin in the game and it doesn't bankrupt the country because you need maybe another 6% tax and it's equitable but not completely unfair and I think that's how you do it but the center of it is prevention primary care is the engine that drives it and that also ameliorates burnout and then you focus on technology that actually enables that quality science that actually enables that and if you discover that you know there's a particular dosing of rapamycin and you have a clinic that does that you're gonna win the competition game and your science will disseminate and then other people steal it and it'll elevate the game so that that's my theory I mean it's very interesting obviously I think a lot of that makes sense the one thing that is very challenging in these systems which are because there's a portion of what you're describing is almost capitated yes right the challenge of these systems is and this is why as much as I would love to say this should all be done privately without the government I think the one advantage the government has going for it if it knows how to play its cards right which unfortunately it doesn't always is it owns the patient life forever and therefore it is truly incentivized to participate in a capitated way the challenge of privatizing this is the median tenure of a patient with a payor be it an insurance company or their employee employer is you know in the neighborhood of what four or five years yeah maybe less than that so so if you have prediabetes right now the cost to normal as you in fact if you are a newly diagnosed type two diabetic today or you have naphthyl d today and i know i only own your life for three or four more years

[02:25:23] I have zero incentive to spend one penny because the macro vascular and micro vascular diseases that are going to destroy your life in 20 years I'm gonna be so long gone I won't even know you I won't even remember your name and actually this is a central piece of this which is in this country we medicalize our social problems so diabetes to a large extent you know when these very high utilizers is a social problem it's poverty it's bad its lack of job security inability to exercise because of danger in the community these kinda things it's adverse childhood experiences so as a result if you start shunting money from healthcare into those social services like every other industrialized country does you can actually squeeze down the overall cost so that may ameliorate some is bad that has to be but that would have to be done centralized there is no way any entity but the government do that is there gree yeah I agree with you I think that's the role for government and people will disagree hardcore libertarians I'll disagree I don't care they can well here's the funny thing

[02:26:19] I consider myself again libertarian is such a broad term that it doesn't mean much because like you have such extremes on that but I actually found Michael Lewis's book the fifth risk to be quite interesting I'll check it out I knew about half of it quite well I actually knew a lot about what the do II and what the USDA does but I didn't have much of a sense of what the Department of Commerce does and his book is a very depressing book so I don't want to get into the politics of the book but absent all of the politics if nothing else whatever your political views are is simply an exercise in civics to understand what your government does because we have a lot of examples of what they do poorly I mean and I'm as guilty of that as anybody I get a rattle off a hundred things that they are mindlessly incompetent at I think Lewis does a great job explaining things that they are competent at and in fact so competent at that we don't realize how many close calls we have right and he does that through going through what AG does energy does Commerce does it's a very quick read I think I read it in a day and a half it was a hard time putting it down it was so good but day-and-a-half a busy work right yeah yeah I mean but this is why the center probably holds the truth for in most cases that's where I am too I think government has a role listen people say oh get government out of health care we can't have them in health it they're already 50% of helga Medicare Medicaid all this chip they are yeah at least 50 so think of VA yeah think about that so now you're like okay well how can we optimize them and don't let them break stuff that they have no business in but then have them do what they really do well and I think that some of that social support is I mean we do well we don't have the political on this country

[02:27:53] I think to come together on that but if we did we'd stop putting the moral distress on us as caregivers because we feel terrible we can't it's a hamster wheel you know when I go round at the county I did this week every single patient there doesn't need to be they're all preventable it's all social determinants it's it's substance abuse its adverse childhood experiences people who were abused sexually in otherwise and that manifests as adult crunches we know this so this is a thing I want to say one thing because I think my followers and yours will want to know how your not scalable as a doctor you do amazing things too how are people gonna find doctors like you that think so differently in our treating people in a in a way that is trying to maximize these outcomes that you talk about I mean I think there were already sort of organizations that organized around this through functional medicine and things like that I'm not being facetious I probably got 250 emails a day now obviously a number of those are directly work-related you know patients colleagues whatever but a very high number of those which unfortunately I just can't respond to for the most part are you know you know through the blog or through the podcast or something saying hey you know Peter I live in st.

[02:28:55] Louis and I've been listening to your podcast or reading this and I'm interested in the way you're thinking about metabolism or this or that or the other thing my doctor kind of rejects everything you're talking about as I have 12 minutes to see him and like it's basically refilling my blood pressure medication and that's it is there a doc in st. Louis that you know that you like and so the answer to these questions is inevitably and invariably always I don't I just you know I don't know once in a blue moon I get asked that question and the person is asking it from a place that I know and I'm like great I used to always tell people about you in Vegas until they couldn't come and see you so what we're actually doing is creating a doctor database on our site and we're making it a pain in the ass for the doctors to fill out because I want them to do some work right so it's like you got to come to the site you got to answer a lot of questions and really get into the weeds on like how much time do you spend each month learning about this subject or that subject or this subject what is your process of re-education what is your philosophy on medicine because I think in about 2,500 words or less and I maybe we allocated a thousand words or whatever I don't remember what it was but we gave quite a bit of room for people to basically explain how they think about medicine because even though

[02:30:09] I can't do it in 30 seconds if given three minutes I could probably provide a reasonable overview and then the goal is to basically figure out a way to get that to be a critical mass such that it now becomes just a sort of directory for patients so I come one can say if my zip code is this boom pull up all doctors within you know 20 miles and then they'll be able to go and then read about those people and obviously they're it's impossible for me to vet these physicians this is in no way shape or form means like in doors I'm putting an endorsement on this person you know

[02:30:39] Chris crecer has done a bit of that through his work through he can at least vouch for you know so-and-so has taken this course but my hope is that given the hurdle of how much work goes into that it's not just someone mindlessly saying I'm a doc I want another you know portal of referral if it streamlines the process for patients by 50% it's still valuable I think it could be more valuable in them how can my fans help with this these are all health your people activists patience if they should just go and sign up so if you go to Peter Atia MD comm I don't look at my website enough to know but I'm sure that somewhere on there it is physician network or something like that right it's not a porn site so you have no business on it that's my criteria usually we've touched on this briefly but I don't think we've done it justice which is your music videos are at once both incredibly funny and actually at times incredibly touching some of them are very moving and they're always entertaining so rather than me try to like describe you know six of your favorite videos we're just gonna link to all of them in our show notes so that people can see them but every time I've asked you about it either your modesty just downplays your process or you really are a savant but like I don't know how you actually do that so can you just pick one and explain how you go from there's a very popular song out there to I have an idea that I would like to parody to I write the lyrics to

[02:32:16] I make this video you talk about that as though like the same way I talk about making scrambled eggs yeah requires a little bit of work you know you don't want to get the shell in the bowl so you want to inside the doctor studio with CDs you want to get into how I do this yes exactly so much of it is it's like a creative process like for example when I see what you do and the way you dissect a paper the way you think about science it's inexplicable to me because my mind works very differently the way that I think about something let's use an example of there's a song I did called ain't the way to die yes which is one of the I would say three of yours that I actually find very touching because as funny as it is if you've been there and seen it it's it's a tearjerker and I'm sure we'll link to it so people can see it it the ideal was everything we do is try to try to be mission driven so the why of what we're doing and it sometimes that's unconscious we don't consciously go why are we doing this video it's more like what's the message we're trying to get now when I was working full time at

[02:33:15] Stanford one of the most painful things I saw was that people suffered and were tortured at the end of life because nobody had the balls to have a conversation and say what is it you want when this happens and be very specific like talk to your loved ones the loved ones would say he never talked about he said he didn't wanna be a vegetable or the loved ones three states away and and needs to come before any decisions are made but they won't come for weeks because they think it's not urgent but this person is on a ventilator paralyzed partially sedated probably suffering and didn't know that this was even a possibility so it starts from that emotional place what do we want to do with this thing then you start to think of I want to do a song about this what would be a fit for this and this is kind of a bit of science you're trying to fit this sort of peg in the right hole and figuring out what's a the right emotional valence what's the right lyrical structure and you're going through you're maybe going through

[02:34:06] Spotify flicking through and then you see and I saw Eminem oh my god like I'm an M I mean he's one of those guys that you can listen to you don't love it but it's so clever you just go that's clever I admire that but he needs it that piece with Rihanna about domestic abuse you know just gonna stand there and watch me burn and you're like that's that hits you right in the elephant right in the emotional unconscious okay we can motivate the elephant and then later we'll think about the writer how we direct them so that made me feel something it's about domestic abuse isn't domestic abuse the same as the institutional abuse that happens to our patients when we don't have this conversation and then I really felt it I was like I listen to the lyrics con it writes itself then I sit down and I go through the lyrics and I create a spreadsheet so this is a kind of a Peter yeah approach yeah I did not expect this yeah this is where my scientist inside me comes out and I go okay these two actually this little sometimes help me with lyrics they didn't help with this one but my friend Harry did he's up he didn't get me a White Russian either and

[02:35:06] I'm still a because they're little defects his pieces fade to black yup he faded me to black White Russian and said he got blacked-out which is another consequence of White Russians the document the nice thing about it like a Google spreadsheet is you have all the original lyrics here and so this is a problem with I get you know you get to all these emails I get your any emails and they're all like you do a parody of opp make it about ECG you didn't wave ECG yeah you know me I'm likely that's dumb it has no point and they often get the meter wrong so they're saying here my lyrics and the meter is totally off well we were talking earlier we were looking at awesome vids of your daughter's playing the violin are you musically trained haha so this is the funny thing when I was in high school we were talking about identity and self-hatred I wanted to fit in I was a short little kid with a funny last name who was kind of chubby so I always struggled with way too unhealthy relationship with food to this day but if somehow manage to do okay the way I got by was I would try to find these crutches to help me fit in socially in the Central Valley of

[02:36:08] California which is a all white or all Hispanic and Here I am this like zoroastrians and weird person which I had an afro at that time which I've seen photos you've seen photos brosef I used to pray and I'm not even religious I used to pray for my hair to fall out cuz I hated my hair so much and when it did

[02:36:24] I was like why God why I was kidding so awkward kids so I picked up guitar as a way to try to impress ladies because I was like you know what everybody you know you're more than words which I eventually did a parody up by that we called more than warts about HPV but the weird thing is I fell in love with the instrument cuz I always loved music in

[02:36:40] Weird Al was always like a weird cuz I was a nerd I loved Weird Al and so I was just in love with this concept of parody so I picked up a guitar I learned guitar then I went to UC Berkeley and had this delusion that I was gonna be a rock star so I felt like cuz Berkeley is I mean generally going to the best school in the state it's an obvious linear pathway to being a rock star it's a hundred-foot one-to-one correlation you're a scientist yeah why are you asking these questions yeah for me it was like no brainer I'll go to

[02:37:07] Berkeley just to please my parents because they want me to go to a real school and it's not Stanford so I don't have to spend all the tuition cuz my dad was like I dunno what butter clay is just as good and cheaper I'm like it's actually not that here's the secret it's really cushy okay he's really cushy so all that being said I minored in music and I majored in molecular biology because I was like pre-med with the hedge the rock star increasingly it became clear that I didn't have this thing called Talent I didn't have enough

[02:37:33] Drive and talent and ambition in that line of intelligence music to be famous there were so many kids that were so much better than me and I knew it and the thing is rather than beat myself up about it I'm like cool I'll be a doctor who plays guitar on the side and that's what ended up happening and so I actually majored I did ethnomusicology so was like studying like the music of Indonesia and all these different musical forms and it turned out that was a perfect conditioning of my sub minds these little conscious agents to later in my depths of burnout all this music came back out and the weird al' component came through so here I am as a professional Weird Al now I'm going okay here's my spreadsheet on the left I have the original lyrics to Eminem in their structure and the right I have a blank space I come up with the title and then

[02:38:13] I reach out to my friend Devin Moore who's our audio engineer who's just a genius he's like a professional musician and he just we met in Vegas and he's like this is how we do things I want to do your stuff cuz you suck at producing the songs because I was doing it on garage man so he creates the backing track and he did that in that case he sends me the track then I have the feel of it then I'll sit there with the original I'll listen to it and I'll just start coming up with lyrics in my mind I may have some notes I needed to hit this point in this point at this point and then I'll brainstorm and usually this happens my creative process is I get on a treadmill or a Stairmaster or I run and that silence is the monkey mind on top so that the unconscious which has been processing the stuff in the background starts to bubble up these ideas so these little clever phrases or little things that I remember from the

[02:38:55] ICU or a case that I remember bubbles up and then I start to put it into the structure so from open creativity to codified structure with parameters so the nice thing is there's a parameter there's a structure in the song already that I can't violate so that bit of constraint allows me actually to excel at what I do

[02:39:16] I need that constraint if it's just open I will [ __ ] it up because it's too much possibility and I'll mentally masturbate for hours and it won't come out so having that constraints helpful then I put it in the thing then I show it to friends then I go back and then this is the thing the rewriting process of lyrics is even more important than the initial writing so it's going back and that one word is just emotionally wrong or feels musically wrong and you tweak it a tweak it and tweak it and get it this sore so how do you go to rhyme zone and you find better rhymes and and then you hone it and when it's done then I go into that studio which is right there which we which I won't say the name of it because it uses the R word but it has

[02:39:53] TARDIS in it it looks like a TARDIS from Doctor Who but it's not okay - developmentally delayed TARDIS and I record it and then Devon mixes it and then we put so put some time on that for me from the moment you picked the Eminem song what was the length of time from the idea I want to do a song on this topic - choosing the song uh-huh aprox couple days okay often it is okay and then from the moment you pick the song to strip the lyrics out make the spreadsheet do the runs write the song is how long in this case it was about one or two weeks in the shortest case it's a day I do it right then and I have friends and they help me in the team here Tom and Logan if it in the longest it's been a month where I'm just pounding my head on the [ __ ] and there's no time frame do you ever in that process say I picked the wrong song I got to go back yes our history is littered with half completed projects where there's actually a track and it's just dumped for example we were gonna do Amy Winehouse rehab about skilled nursing homes Oh interesting try to make me go to rehab I won't go go go yes I fell bad but I got 12 cats at home home home the little old lady who won't go to sniff yeah that was dumb and

[02:41:08] I think the more we tried to make it work the less happy we were now then we may come back to it but yeah so sometimes we just fail but ain't the way to die it just kind of started over you know that's that's a and the more we realize we got the sense if you know that sense of moral elevation you get in your chest where you feel something hit and it raises you in this way where you feel it expand it sounds very woowoo but it's a real human since John Hyde and others have talked about the sense of moral elevation like I've done something here I've tapped into some ethos that will help people and recording a song like that is done in one day it depends so that one we did over a couple of days

[02:41:39] I went to Devon's studio actually and we just kept banging it out and he would coach me sit there in the engineer space and be like you know that's I'm not feeling anything with that try it maybe this way and then we'll do like 30 takes oh my god and then he'll be like that's it I got goosebumps that's it that's it right how does one do that like if you said to me can you repeat something six times like I wouldn't I would this is the thing that's always amazed me about acting hmm I don't think I've appreciated it as much about singing but you know if you've ever been on a set to actually watch a movie being made and there's like a list actors there which

[02:42:14] I've had the privilege of doing once or twice mm-hmm I'm amazed that first of all an entire day of shooting produces 60 to 90 seconds worth of a movie that's how many times things are being done over and over and over again and it's to watch the actors and actresses show up with the same level of emotion the same emphasis correcting maybe whatever the director says to correct I'm like well that's another great reason why I could never have done that for a living these are professionals that are really good at that now see I'm an untrained amateur

[02:42:46] I like to call myself a Pro Am because you know it's one of those things where I get paid a little bit here and there with ads and stuff but really I'm just you know it's for the love the game but the truth is it's a craft for me and the finished product matters so deeply to me that I cannot put out a stinky piece of [ __ ] I've done it and I've regretted it and sometimes I put up something I think is good in retrospect I think it's crap some other thing I something that's crap and it turns out being great but ain't away today I was one of the same so I can't [ __ ] this up so you do and 20 30 takes and you'll see is they're all sitting there in logic that's the program we use and you just take take take take take take take and what we'll do then is we'll comp sometimes we'll say let's take the best of this first verse your best of that and some people think that's cheating but that's how most people do it now I didn't realize that would be thought of as cheating so some of the purists in the old school musicians say well no you just got to go on and sing it live and that's how you do it but that's not how anybody does it now because you are trying to produce the best piece of art you can and what's fascinating actually Peter is again I'm not a trained musician I don't sing I don't rap something that I had to figure out I used to be really bad and Devon would tell me you really suck like it takes 30 takes just to get it to sound good have you thought about taking voice lessons and I'm like don't insult me dude what's up with it you can't train a voice that's [ __ ] you have to stupid and then I went got voice lessons just a few lessons and then these CDs that I kept doing and there's a thing man the voice like anything is a performance instruments a muscle and the vocal cords get stronger your control gets better your breath control gets better so the way you breathe for for singing is so different than the way you would normally talk or anything and that helps when you do speaking because you don't get hoarse you warm up right you project better so I'm a tiny little person who can project his damn voice yeah but you also as a ruffian you you come from the lineage of the greatest singer of all time exactly Freddie Mercury Oh Oh God oh and

[02:44:34] Zubin Mehta who was named after his conductor it's a musical lineage our people my people call it maize Peter at EIT remember that commercial he was an old Missoula commercial national it was they had a Native American guy in the headdress yeah and he's sitting in a boat and he's eating corn and he's like my people call it maize and it was like

[02:44:51] Mazola corn goodness anyway so I trained in my voice and so now I have to do less takes and I'm able to go live so even though we do this art where we're cutting it up in the studio when I have to perform it the way to die live which I do 50 times a year when I do my live show oh really yeah so I do that one are you seven years I could about 20 so so you're hitting on all the killers like seven years is I think the most touching of them all seven years my favorite and Tom

[02:45:16] Tom was the genius behind how to Tom and Logan back there genius of how to cinematography is that and the emotion of it we're sitting in the edit speaking of that so the Edit there it was those were your kids and those are my kids you're my clinic it's my family it's my wife it's my dad so it was a personal thing and we're sitting in the Edit on the apex where that you're pushing in on my daughter and it's like you know soon

[02:45:36] I'll be 60 years old and his whole emotional piece and we didn't feel it we didn't feel it we didn't feel it and then we're like to about this trim that one microsecond here all of us are crying we're like okay that's it hit Send that's the thing that's the process and it's the same with the musical piece so then once you do it you may craft this thing here but when you go and do a live it takes on a whole new persona because you have this input and you're doing it in one take and that's where I think the real artistry starts to try to have I'm calling it artistry is I'm a [ __ ] professional clown but it feels like that on safe because you're seeing the synchronization of the audience with the message people are crying you're feeling this energy and afterwards they'll tell you this is how you made me feel during that and I'm a 20 year veteran I'm a 30 year nurse or I'm a 40 year arty or whatever it is and that's what really gets you so all of that is for this that's the process then we'll put it out then we'll brainstorm the video then we'll go beg our Hospital to let us shoot extras are all real medical people nobody's paid we'll go and do it we'll rent equipment we'll get the crew and we'll do and then how long does taking shoot say those two videos there it's like a day yeah because we don't have we don't have a choice because we're operating in a real hospital with real patients running around so we have to go to a wing where maybe they're not on overflow right now so we can do it and they're kind enough to let us do and then maybe they'll kick us out because they have extended the invitation to me so many times to be in a video I just I got to take you up on one of these I'll be the guy that just like walks by and they won't even see me we're doing a parody of the Barenaked

[02:46:59] Ladies one week I don't know if I sent it to you you remember that song it's been one you don't realize this I went to high school with the Barenaked Ladies [ __ ] you yeah their dad was our guidance counselor they keep the Creegan brothers right and ER and Jim there's our guidance counselor my god yeah so I saw them in 1991 and Berkeley in a small little Club before they were famous and
