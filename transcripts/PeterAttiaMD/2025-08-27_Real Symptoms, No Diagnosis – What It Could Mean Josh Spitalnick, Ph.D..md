## Transcript

[00:00:00] Now, we've opened a Pandora's box, which is this individual who's feeling a little fatigued, can't figure out why something's wrong with them. They're fatigued. Maybe I maybe it's, you know, fill in the blank. I I don't know what it is. First doctor they see does traditional work up and says, "I I you know, your all your hormones look great.

[00:00:21] I don't you know everything that I can see looks right. But but you're going to find that person within the first three depending on which door you open who's going to come up with a with an explanation and they're typically going to have a solution for you that's pretty off the beaten path. If you go to a car mechanic and say your car is squeaking in the engine, they're going to have a wonderful solution for your engine even if it's not required. If you go to a psychiatrist and say I think I need meds, guess what? They're going to give you medication. And if you go to enough doctors, they're going to they're going to find some problem and recommend some intervention, whether it's homeopathic, whether it's diagnostic, you know, whether it's a prescription, something.

[00:00:56] They'll give you something because they want you to feel better. >> Yeah. I think part of it is the when you're a hammer, everything is a nail syndrome. But I I I think that and that would be the most charitable explanation for what I think is going on, which is truly there are just a lot of real charlatans out there um that are, >> you know, just not not practicing any form of reasonable medicine, not even evidence informed, right? Like evidence-based I get has its limitations and I will fully acknowledge the limitations of evidence-based medicine. >> Agree. But but but there is at least still a threshold of evidence-informed medicine. But when you start saying that the answer to your slightly elevated seesium level, which by the way, no lab has ever documented what the upper limit of that should be anyway, but let's just assume that my arbitrary level is too high and you're slightly above it. So that's clearly the explanation of everything that's going wrong with you.

[00:01:51] And I'm going to hand you some supplement that, by the way, I happen to also sell. >> Happened to sell. >> I just happen to sell. How lucky are you? >> Look, it's it's your lucky day. It's right here too, by the way. It's in the office. >> You found the guy that knows how to cure elevated seesium levels. Um, >> that that's the challenge I suppose I have, right? Which is it's the challenge

[00:02:11] I have. You we're in the same boat where you're asking me to as a non-medical person to make sure that someone is getting, you know, uh, advocated for, spoken for, and referred to by providers. they're going to go to find anyone and I'm I'm it's above my pay grade to know whether that doctor knows what they're doing, whether they're recommending medications or off label things that are uh and how am I going to argue against that? So, most anxiety specialists like myself who work in the space of a lot of health and medical and

[00:02:36] I have a career where we haven't talked about where I've done lots of medical training, medical work in my career. um um I'm informed. I'm knowledgeable. I also have medical people in my family. I can ask the right things, but I'm trusting um the medical people around me. So, I'm on faculty at a university in Atlanta. Um I'm adjunct faculty there. I got colleagues there. I got medical people around me. I surround myself with people that I think are sharp psychiatrists, physicians, oncologists just in case. And still, my patients are going to go to other doctors because they're just looking for the answer. To me, that's sort of within that health anxiety spectrum. If every doctor you've gone to that I trust has given you the best medicine possible or the best assessment possible and you're getting no answer and you go to the next person, you don't need the DSM to go, maybe this is more than just a medical issue. I'm still going to advocate for the medical needs. I'm still going to support them and join them and I'm still going to help them see that your physical symptoms are real. Physical symptoms are real. That doesn't mean they're indicative of or prognosticate a medical condition. Half the battle I'm doing is education around that topic.

[00:03:40] Yeah, I think it's worth stating that again, right? So, if a person says, "I'm experiencing this pain," >> that's real >> 100%. >> You're just saying, don't assume necessarily that that means that there is an underlying medical reason for that or even something that you would find on the total best case scenario diagnostic.

[00:04:03] More often than not, there's not a great medical diagnosis or category that fits into the things that someone like I I mean, I see. I mean, I don't specialize that much in FND or um sort of that that functional neurological space of pseudo seizures or or tingling arms or body parts that can go numb. That's a that's a whole another space of conversion disorders. But I'm talking about people that have chronic headaches. >> Yep. tummy issues, leg cramps, bones that feel sore, and they've had every workup you could imagine that would be considerate for someone who has bones that are sore. And there's about three or four conditions most of us are going to jump to and you say, "Your bones are sore." And when that's all been ruled out, and they try and convince you, but my my my thigh, like I I can feel the bone. I can feel the marrow feels like it's it's tearing itself up. And we were talking about pain conditions. We're talking about, you know, neuropathic kind of conditions. At some point, the intervention, which is them doctor shopping, becomes worse than the pain itself. At some point, someone will prescribe you something, and hopefully we're not dealing with opiates at that point, but someone will prescribe you something thinking that they have the magical cure to fix your distress, your pain. Um, and that scares me. And my job is to sit with them and say the pain is real, the sensation is real, the symptom is real, but it not may not really be indicative of the thing that you think it could be. And by the way, going on

[00:05:26] WebMD or Google or because a social media influencer said, "If you have this, this is probably what it is," does not diagnose you. And so there's really this wonderful space of social media, wearable devices, which I'm a big believer of. Um, and the access that we all have to our medical records scares the hell out of me because we are now patients being our own advocates and showing up to doctors saying, "This is what I found out online and I think I have this or this is what this person said and I think I have this or my I'm looking at my watch here. My heart my heart rate's been up all week. Doesn't that mean something?" Yeah, it means your heart rate's up. Period. That doesn't have to mean anything else except your heart rate is up. And so most people would assume that means you're, you know, at risk for a heart attack or a stroke. Or it means if you stare at your watch long enough, you don't have hair on your head like I do, but if we talk about lice, guess what's going to happen in a few seconds? We're both going to be doing this because that's what happens. And if I mention your left pinky toe, Peter, have you thought about your left pinky toe this entire time we've been together? Cuz you are. Now, how's the toe next to it doing? And by the way, now, how's the right pinky toe going? Now, we get to think about that stuff. You think about that long enough, you're going to feel your left pinky toe. It's going to be tactile and sticky and maybe sensory. It was there the whole time. Your brain didn't have to think about it. How's your breathing right now? We don't think about breathing. And I treat people who get fixated on swallowing breathing.

[00:06:44] There's got to be something in here. I have thyroid cancer. I have esophageal cancer because I feel something in there. You probably do feel something in there. And by the way, if you do this all day long and you create some some bruising, you're going to feel a whole bunch of more stuff in there. You know that better than I do. But to convince someone that there may not be something in there because they've been scoped and tested and blood checked and there's no signs of anything that's anatomical or physical in their throat, but they can feel it. It's not my job to say it's fake. It's my job to say you're just you're struggling with something and what are we going to do about that? >> But is the is the message there >> do you go one step further and say like you're creating this or are you saying no, I don't need to go that far. I just need to get them to understand there's another explanation for this. >> There's no need to do that because if I take that stance, I'm now the next person who's the naysayer. I'm the next one who's invalidating them. And almost no therapist that I know would ever basically weaponize that or blame them for that kind of thing. What I can say is you may not have created it and they you probably didn't create it. Like leg pain is not being created, but if you sit there and focus on your left pinky toe or if we talk about lice long enough, it's going to create head sensations of itch. That's how it works.

[00:07:55] When you focus on something long enough, you pay attention to it. And if you pay attention to it, you're more aware of it. And if you're more aware of it and your brain actually works, it'll feel it. Phantom limb syndrome research has demonstrated that. People putting a dummy arm and a fake arm in a mirror and whacking an arm, we can feel that in our nerve endings because our brain's processing information. So, do we have a dead arm that's not connected to that's actually causing pain? No. Do we have a a pain reception or an information processing thing going on? probably that's fascinating research. The point is is I don't have to tell them that it's your fault or that you're creating it. But I can tell them that the thing you're doing is keeping it active. It's keeping it prominent in your in your focus. And as long as you focus on that, you're not focusing on anything else.

[00:08:41] And if you're not focusing anything else, we have a whole another disease. Disease one, there's something wrong with your thigh. Maybe not medical. Disease two, you're fixated on it. You won't leave the house. You're demanding opiates. You're complaining to people. Your husband doesn't want to hear anymore. Your doctors have cut you off.

[00:08:58] And I've worked with patients I'm in Atlanta that have been blacklisted from two or the three major hospital medical systems because they've done so much doctor shopping and so much fighting with their doctors that it's a stress on the system. But they have the wearables and the social media and the online and access to their patient portal that proves that something's wrong. And just as an example, what types of things would they actually be doctor shopping for? What is this? What's a symptom?

[00:09:22] That's a real world example. >> Uh the ones I usually see the most are memory loss or memory slip-ups, which some people would actually put into the functional neurological disorder spectrum. Um a lot of chest pain that has had every EKG in medical workup you can imagine. Um or sensations like ants crawling or physical pain, neuropathic pain for which it has no explanation.

[00:09:42] Those are the most common ones which is >> and let's just take each of those if in as much as you know details. and what would be triggering events. I'm Peter Atia.
