This clip is from episode #352 ‒ Female fertility: optimizing reproductive health, diagnosing and treating infertility and PCOS, and understanding the IVF process | Paula Amato, M.D.

In this clip, they discuss:

- PCOS Affects 6–8% of Reproductive-Age Women – Polycystic ovary syndrome is one of the most common endocrine disorders among women aged 15 to 30
- Treatment Depends on Pregnancy Intentions – The approach varies significantly depending on whether or not the patient is trying to conceive
- Oral Contraceptives Reduce Androgens – Birth control pills are effective in lowering testosterone, easing acne, and restoring menstrual regularity
- GLP-1 Agonists Must Be Discontinued Before Pregnancy – These weight-loss medications are effective, but must be stopped at least 2 months before trying to conceive
- Ovulation Can Often Be Induced Without IVF – Letrozole is a highly effective, underused option for inducing ovulation in PCOS patients

## Transcript

[00:00:00] Let's talk about polycystic um ovarian syndrome. So uh what's the prevalence of it in in let's say women aged call it 15 to 30. Yeah super common about 6 to 8% of women will have polycystic ovary syndrome. Most common symptoms are irregular periods. Um also evidence of high androgen levels and that could usually present with acne or excess hair growth. We call that heretism. Um obesity or being overweight. That's also part of the syndrome. Not everybody who has And the androgens are specifically testo. Could it be just testosterone?

[00:00:35] Just DHEA, DHT, all of the above. Yeah, both. But typically elevated testosterone from the ovaries. Yeah. Okay. So, is that the cause or the effect? We don't know. We don't know. But it's definitely seen in almost all women with PCOS that they have higher androgen levels. And why is PCOS uh seemingly also highly associated with insulin resistance?

[00:01:02] Again, we don't know exactly, but we think the androgens um play a role. We think there might be some genetic factors that play a role. I don't know that we understand why, but we certainly have recognized in the last several decades that most women with PCOS also happen to be insulin resistant. So then the question is what do we need what do we need to do to treat PCOS right so depends on the goal of the patient right so if they're trying to get pregnant there's one set of treatments if they're not trying to get pregnant but they have PCOS then we usually focus on their cycles because it's generally not a good idea to go too long in between cycles because what can happen is the lining of the uterus can overgrow if If it overgrows too much, it can become what we call hyperlastic, worst case scenario, cancer. So, you definitely don't want that. So, it's important to be shedding that lining or to be on hormonal suppression so that that doesn't happen. Um, if the goal is to treat the hyperendrogenic symptoms like the acne and the heretism, again, hormonal treatments usually effective for that. When you say hormonal treatments, you mean like spironolactone and things like that? We usually start with birth control pills. birth control pills very effective for for most symptoms of PCOS. It'll regulate the cycles, decrease androgen levels, help with heretism and acne, etc. Okay, so woman with

[00:02:32] PCOS doesn't want to get pregnant, right? Just wants to reduce the androgen impact and protect her uterus. A constant o oral contraceptive is a great strategy. It's a great strategy. Yeah, there are others. You know, it could be a progesterine IUD. That's a hormonally active IUD. Um, so there are a number of different ones or just taking progesterone every few months that usually will help protect the lining but probably won't decrease the androgen levels. So now let's talk about the woman with PCOS but who is also trying to conceive, right? What is your playbook? So we always counsel these patients as well. I should mention whether they're trying to get pregnant or not, especially if they're overweight or obese. weight loss helps you know with all the symptoms of PCOS. So healthy diet, lifestyle etc. And how much of a role are GLP1 agonists playing in this now? How much more success are you having with treating PCOS that way?

[00:03:27] Yeah, increasingly and and they're very successful as you know for weight loss and there have been some studies on PCOS patients specifically very effective. What? Yeah. Do you know any of those data? I'm not familiar with them. Yeah. Yeah. They work really well just like they work in people with diabetes or people who with obesity without diabetes. Problem is you can't get pregnant while you're taking them. And the current recommendation is to stop for at least pardon my ignorance. Why?

[00:03:52] Because we don't have any data on whether they're safe. So FDA is saying when FDA I I forget the FDA's classification for this. There's like AB CX or something like that for every drug. Yes. And I haven't looked for that one specifically, but I'm sure it's like X because we have no data. Okay. So, that's an important message for anybody listening. If you're trying to get pregnant, you should not be on a GLP1 agonist because we don't understand the impact of that, right? You can be on it pre-reg. Just the recommendation is to stop for at least 2 months. Okay. Now, having said that, there have been lots of you may have read about ampic babies like people getting pregnant on GOP1. So there is a registry and so far to my knowledge there haven't been um reported birth defects and that type of thing but obviously we're talking about small number of patient. Yeah that's an interesting point. I I now that you mentioned that I I now recall hearing about that. So so presumably these are women who have taken either you know semiglutide tepatide and presumably they get pregnant either intentionally or not. Right.

[00:04:57] Um, okay. So, that's a very interesting interesting registry to follow. Right. Right. Now, of course, once they find out they're pregnant, usually they're usually counled to stop by. Yeah. So, we don't know what would happen if you continue. I don't think anybody wants to do that study at the moment. Yeah. It doesn't make sense. We certainly don't want women who are pregnant to not want to eat. Understanding that a woman who's got PCOS is going to be first counseledled to make these changes that effectively help her lose weight and increase her metabolic health. um let's say she is somewhat successful but still unable to address the concern right so luckily there are very good ovulation inducing medications available so what we would typically recommend for someone with PCOS to help them ovulate more regularly is a medication called let the brand name is just a medication you take for 5 days in your cycle and then we can usually assess ovulation with ultrasound and what does it

[00:05:56] Uh it basically it's a category of medication called aromatase inhibitors which blocks the conversion of testosterone to right androgens to estrogen that lower estrogen somehow triggers the pituitary to increase secretion of FSH and LH and that stimulates the ovary to again get one of those follicles. So so you give the full dose of endometrial progesterone for 5 days. The second you take it off, it's the withdrawal of progesterone that causes the lining to shed. Right. And then we call that day one. And then you said on day five, we go ahead and start ripening the follicle. Right. Ripen the follicle with the aromatase inhibitor.

[00:06:36] Three to seven. Yeah. Five days. Yeah. Okay. Wow. Yeah. Very cool. Yeah. And then we usually do an ultrasound around day 12ish. And you could see one of those follicles starting to grow. Usually not not all patients will respond. So sometimes we have to increase the dose or sometimes we have to try a different medication, but most patients with PCOS will respond to that medication. So would you say that every single woman out there with PCOS who wants to get pregnant has access to a doctor that understands what you just described and can do that for her? Or do you worry that too many women are being shunted to IVF too soon without an attempt at something like this? I I definitely think there probably not enough people who totally understand management of PCOS especially in the context of fertility treatment uh for sure and even in the context of some non-infertility treatment often what I hear from patients is they had irregular periods somebody told them to start go on the birth control pill they never told them why they didn't even know they had PCOS right happens to be the correct treatment so great but you know they've gone years now not understanding that they have PCOS and the implications of that which as we talked about there are metabolic implications etc. Uh so that's a problem. But once they want to become pregnant, very few general gynecologists are set up to be able to treat patients with either Clomid or let some of them do, but it's not like a fertility clinic with reproductive endocrinologists because we're set up to do monitoring seven days a week and that type of things, but not everybody has access to a fertility specialist. Kind of very dependent on where you live. a little bit better now with teleaalth, but um still access is you have to do the sonogram when you're doing this. You don't have to, but you you want to know whether the woman's responding, meaning that she's actually ovulating. There are other ways to assess that. If she gets a period at the right time, then she probably ovulated or if she gets pregnant, of course. Um or you can check a progesterone level in the ludal phase, the second half of the cycle, and if it's elevated, she probably ovulated.

[00:08:49] Yeah, we just happen to use ultrasounds just easier. And and so you kind of alluded to it, but I'm guessing you're saying, look, we would give this three tries. Would that be a fair assessment? So, so we'd go through three consecutive cycles of this and it's interesting. So, so, so there's two ways that this treatment could fail, right? The first is um each time we did the ultrasound, we just didn't see an egg. So, right, not responding. not responding to the follical stimulation.

[00:09:20] Um, let's talk about what the implication is there. Alternatively, you could say, God, three out of 3 months we actually got ovulation. Uh, but we didn't get fertilization, right? If you were 3 months of that, I assume in parallel you're doing the male workup because nothing would be a greater crime than going to all that trouble and then you didn't you figured out the sperm was the problem. But let's assume you have that box checked. Would you be more inclined to continue that treatment for another 3 to 6 months?

[00:09:50] Yeah. Yeah. And someone who hasn't been ovulating, they haven't tried for a year even. They haven't even met the criteria. Exactly. So there's nothing magic about 3 months, but that's, you know, at least a check-in point where we say, "Hey, do we continue doing this or do we move on to something else?" So, if it's a young person and this is like the first time they're ovulating in their life, then yeah, we give them more time on a less invasive treatment, less expensive treatment. Okay? If they're like 38, 40, uh, you know, we probably move on to something else.
