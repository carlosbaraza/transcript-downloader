Alton Barron is an orthopedic surgeon specializing in the shoulder, elbow, and hand. In this episode, Alton breaks down the anatomy of the upper extremities and discusses the most common injuries associated with this area of the body. He explains in detail how he examines the shoulder, elbow, and hand to find the source of the pain and lays out the non-surgical and surgical treatment options as well as the factors that determine whether surgery is appropriate. Additionally, Alton describes the surgical procedures that, when done appropriately, can lead to tremendous reduction of pain and improvement in function.

## Transcript

[00:00:01] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter attia

[00:00:10] Alton so great to finally be sitting down with you we we talked about this even before you operated on me which is at the time of this recording I think we're coming up on seven months um but this is a topic that I just I can't tell you how many times I get asked about this by my patients and I don't know in some ways medicine is so siled you know you think well well I did

[00:00:32] General Surgery surely I know something about Orthopedics but the reality of it is outside of trauma um and even in the most basic sense I know very little about Orthopedics and I think that's probably true for a lot of doctors primary care and otherwise and then how much more is that true for patients so it's um it's it's a pretty it's a pretty um Broad and specialized field at the same time huh yeah I think that's a great point I mean I always have told people who've asked about medical school well don't you know all these things and you know we only do a subset of rotations so I know nothing about

[00:01:06] Urology I don't know nothing about uh brain surgery right and it just depends on kind of the luck of the draw on what you get exposed to and so I wholeheartedly agree and then we do we just narrow ourselves down like a funnel in terms of knowledge because there's been such a knowledge explosion for the last really the last two decades in terms of research in terms of new science a lot of which you've talked about and do talk about routinely and know a lot more about than me but as it applies to Orthopedics even there are subsets of Orthopedics and then there are subsets of shoulder surgery that involves just research versus just clinical practice and all of that is just an explosion of information and you know my well-informed patients often ask me about things and I know hopefully a lot of it but I don't know all of it and they know is sometimes fine because they're very good now at looking at true scientific articles and they approach it and approach me with new articles so I'm learning every week from my patients actually about shoulder surgery now when you went to med school did you think you wanted to be an orthopedic surgeon

[00:02:14] I didn't know I barely went to medical school I only went uh I just had a very circuitous path but I was an engineer at UT here in Austin and I don't think I'm an engineer as well I don't think I knew that what kind of engineer were you I did mechanical and biomedical okay yeah and so I didn't know anything about it my dad was an engineer and and so I just

[00:02:34] I just went that way and but as at the end I was I was a little edgy about going into industry and so uh on a last whim because I had two uncles that were dentists I went to dental school for a year and I actually didn't like that at all but I loved the science what was going on with the biomaterials they Dentistry has been at the Forefront of biomaterials right and so I left after a year but I was exposed to the entire anatomical body because the anatomy instructor for head and neck was actually an MD PhD and she said when I I confided in her that I was leaving she said you know you ought to try medical school and so then I went back came back to Austin painted houses for a year and then then applied to medical school and went and still didn't know and so you go there you you don't know what you're going to do not even if you're going to do surgery or medicine right right and uh I liked it all I loved invasive

[00:03:33] Cardiology right so I mean just just all the aspects of the the physiology and the electricity really going on in our bodies and um but then I was exposed to Orthopedics fortunately and it was like I knew all this stuff I didn't know at all but it felt so natural putting things together piecing them back together the jigsaw puzzles and it's so it just it felt all in perfect line with my engineering background in in the time when you went through

[00:04:03] Orthopedics was it common for people to also do a fellowship after the five years of residency it was I think in our time we had a big I went to Tulane and there at that time they had eight this is pre-katrina they had eight residents per year so it was a big program and at that time about four were going to general practice so fellowships were not ubiquitous now they are almost mandatory really just just because you need to have a I wouldn't call it a gimmick but you need to have a special interest because the groups that you'd be applying to work for or the hospitals uh kind of want you to have some sub-specialty yeah I mean I think that's that's the case in medicine right it's yeah really even if you did something like general surgery and didn't do a fellowship after like vascular Plastics cardiac Etc you'd be hard-pressed to go even into the community and kind of do everything right probably tend to focus on one part of the body exactly um so what where did you do your fellowship obviously upper extremity yeah so I did my shoulder fellowship at Columbia and

[00:05:07] New York and then I did my hand Fellowship in New York at Roosevelt Hospital it's oh two separate fellowships two separate scholarships yeah and um and most people didn't do that at the time but I just really liked uh both very much and so um and I just evolved into that I dabbled with spine during residency um and

[00:05:31] I think the reason I evolved into wanting to do upper extremity is because there's nothing cookie cutter about it and I don't I'm not by any means demeaning any part of Orthopedics but for me there there were no there were very few jigs cutting jigs very few linear things that you had to just there's so much variability in the Upper Limb both anatomy And also the specific pathology that you just have to be all over the place and it was more creative for me frankly what would have been some of the sort of big steps forward let's go back to so what year did you finish your training in 95 96 I started practicing 96. okay so at that time what was the state of the art in terms of what was being done so when what for example there was a day when if you look at the surgery I had that would have been done with a big open incision right when did minimally invasive orthopedic surgery take over the joint space how it's it's crazy it's such a cool question I'm glad you asked it because you don't get to speak about it very much but there was knee arthroscopy was the first big arthroscopic realm to develop and and a fellow that most of my younger residents don't even know now dick kaspberry was was hugely Innovative in that space And

[00:06:57] So It shoulder arthroscopy by the time I was in residency was primitive we had the basic equipment to get into the shoulder but we couldn't do much right so the for by the time I graduated all we were doing arthroscopically by the time I did even finish my shoulder Fellowship we were doing open shoulder arthroplasty and I was at one of the meccas of shoulder surgery so everything at Advance was being done there at the level that it could be done but it was open shoulder arthroplasty which is still open but smaller incisions it was open and stability repairs Open Labor repairs but we didn't even appreciate what for instance the slap tear we knew they existed but we didn't know the impact and what we started seeing there was and there was certainly no arthroscopic repairs of of of the labrum except these early early devices where you'd kind of get in there see it and you just mail it in drill a little hole and mallet in this big broad tack that was just now so primitive and they would fall out they had a high failure rate and it was just that was the state of the art at that time so and was any of this being done in clinical trials or was it kind of like patients are saying look we have the tried and true way that we do this the downside is you're going to have a big scar and we're gonna have to tear a bunch of muscle and your recovery is going to be longer but once we get in there we know what to do versus we've got this minimally invasive way that you know has all these advantages but the drawback is high failure rate right so that was exactly discussions and there were there was not a lot of there's a little bit of FDA going on approval at that time but but not a lot in terms of using these sort of humanitarian devices and so forth where you could go ahead and try it and the patients had to sign a release and it was all fine they were trusted surgeons that were doing it so the I wouldn't say there were clinical trials there were a lot of retrospective analyzes going on oh yeah we did this in 107 patients and 47 failed yeah and so in my early years of that we were actually just still doing mostly open and then kind of waiting for the devices for the science for the for the industry to catch up with some better devices and some of my colleagues and occasionally me uh were were adding little bitty Innovative aspects of these whether they're application devices or the style of implants so we've gone from today we've gone from we went from purely metal to now often purely um braided polyester as an actual anchor device which is super cool because there's no metal in your body and then we but in the transition through that was plastic and that plastic could be either hard plastic which stays in your body but it's still benign or um or a bioabsorbable tax which I have my own issues with um because it does create an inflammatory response in the body and creates a little cavity in the bone and so forth so those are that's kind of the spectrum so now we are using tiny drills tiny suture anchors and you can put many in and that's what's nice about if you have to do a revision of some failed repair you've got plenty of real estate to work with and it's nice but one other aspect which I think shows so much how we've changed and I was right at that inflection point not by choice just by happenstance was the slap tears were not appreciated as a clinically relevant entity but a slapped here meaning um so we'll have to tell people what the labrum is in a second what a slap is meaning it was they just were viewed as just another type of laboral Terror yes but one that was benign that doesn't matter I see and people were coming in a lot of overhead athletes were coming in with secondary problems as a result of that and the secondary problems were being treated without without treating the underlying and they were having recurrent pain so this is probably a good pivot for us to back up and make sure people understand the anatomy you know sometimes when I'm explaining to my patients um which exposes my own naivete I sort of say look I don't know a lot about

[00:11:33] Orthopedics but to understand and appreciate the complexity of the upper extremity you have to appreciate what we did during Evolution right and when we stood up you know that became an enormous Force multiplier you know if you think about this through the lens of like Warfare you know people talk about you know having night vision is a force multiplier in war right well for us to be able to stand and walk with amazing efficiency on two legs was a force multiplier and then also to have these incredible upper extremities yeah but you got to pay a price for it right so the price the way I describe it and feel free to correct me or make this more nuanced the price was stability right we paid an enormous price in these joints so they're not you know not as strong not as stable right would you agree with that is that is that a fair assessment 100 and you you're spot on on that and and frankly that shows you do know something about Orthopedics uh but the fact is that yeah it when we went from the ball and socket joints or the very stable simple hinge joints to these these cup and saucer type joints right specifically the shoulder which is intrinsically very unstable and just and also our opposable thumb our opposable thumb is the base of it the basal joint is terribly unstable it's just a it's we call it a biconcave saddle but it's barely that there's really no intrinsic bony stability and similar to the shoulder I mean we use an analogy that's slightly off but a golf ball on a tee it's the t is a little bigger a little bigger but that's what it is it's very flat and shallow and so we can talk about the anatomy so let's do that in in whatever way you think makes the most sense well let's assume the audience doesn't know the names of any of the bones let alone what they look like doesn't know the vasculature the musculature the innervation what would be a reasonable way and we I know you and I spoke we were going to do this with models in the end you thought you could probably do an easier job sketching for folks yeah so maybe let's have you okay explain slash sketch'd be great and we're we're prepared for that we have some diagrams in it so I'm going to take it off the visual yeah and draw some quick pictures and this is what I do frankly for all my patients um I don't like the models because well they're just they're just models so

[00:13:59] I'm not saying I'm a great artist but if we just look at just the glenoid that's the socket that's the golf tee if you will and then you add a humeral head to it and that is the humeral head this portion to the right of the dotted line is is what's covered by cartilage so that's the nice smooth Teflon cartilage and this space so just to orient folks what you're looking at is head on to a person if you're looking straight at them this is the right humeral head and that little space we're going to talk about the glenoid fossa is that flat end of part of the scapula yes which is a real complex looking triangular bone with a big Ridge on it and it the collarbone attaches to it and all that crazy stuff yeah but the the the the the the high level Point here is in the hip you have the acetabulum which creates a true socket for a big ball and um here the the heavy lifting really is done by soft tissue not bones right you've got a joint that's completely contained like that in the hip joint versus a shallow one that just can slip and slide all over the place so you you've uh pointed out it's a great it's the best way to describe the shoulder joint being a delicate balance of of mobility and stability and it's very easy to get out of whack because it is biomechanically so complicated so I'm going to add a few more things here but this space that we see between here is not a space it's the it's the space radiographically when you're looking that's occupied by the cartilage so you have a thick nice layer of cartilage on both sides I've left a little Gap just to be able to see it but it's the articular cartilage effectively there so there's a layer of nice thick cartilage there that and when we have arthritis of course that gets worn down chipped away and begins to um to fissure and and then actually develop full thickness loss to the point where then at some point it's not really functioning very well and it's very painful so if we have this basic bony cartilage structure here it's just it would just fall off if it were just left there let's say you had a um well if you had no ligaments no uh what we're going to call the labrum which is some additional structure stabilizing structures or if we had um if we have the muscle tendon units that supply that that support it so I'm going to draw in a few more of that of those and while you're doing that we'll just remind people that ligaments and tendons are not the same uh tendons are the connective tissue that connects muscle to Bone ligaments are connective tissue that connect bone to bone is labrum considered a a ligament or is it kind of considered its own entity it's kind of its own entity yeah it's a it's a it's it has a transition zone between fibrous tissue to osseous bone tissue so it's a fiberosseous structure and I liken it to um to calamari that's the best and it's rubbery just like that and it and that's the best analogy that people seem to get so I I've drawn on two of the four rotator cuff muscles here this is the one up above and this is the one in front and this is the big muscle that allows us to reach behind our back and pull our hand away from our back and this is also the one that helps us along with the pectoralis in front to pull things together like doing flies and so forth the supraspinatus is the primary muscle that initiates elevation of the shoulders so it's very very important it also so what we see here is this Zone in from here and about through here is where the muscle transitions into tendon yeah and then it becomes pure tendon and it just so happens that this tendon the supraspinatus tendon which is so commonly torn is actually there's some physiologic downsides to its location where it can be rung out it doesn't have a great blood supply the key is it gets let me put here where those two arrows are is essentially where the tendon tears most of the time and those two and that is the the part that's attaches to the Bone it gets blood supply from that bone it gets blood supply gets nutrients it gets growth factors so our goal and this is jumping ahead a little bit our goal is to get that reattached to that bone so it can get all of those growth factors and that new healing back and it absolutely can heal back but there are certain limitations to that so so let's there's two other muscles right so we've got the supraspinatus and the subscapularis there there's two other muscles that make up the rotator cuff I think everyone's heard of the rotator cuff yes and yet it's probably not obvious to people that it's it's really for muscle right that are doing this what are the other two so the other two are the infraspinatus and the teres minor and if you you can kind of superimpose them over the subscapularis but they're on the back side of the joint and they are very important they are the external rotators that it's they give us our backhand in tennis they give us a lot of stability far the shoulder itself and especially whether you're playing golf or lifting weights they're a dynamic stabilizer they're very important doing bench press push-ups all sorts of activities like that archery archery yes very important um so so when a person quote unquote tears their rotator cuff that can be a very heterogeneous diagnosis I mean technically that diagnosis would apply to a tear in any of those four muscles which could be in the muscle could be at the junction between the muscle and the tendon and could it also be just a complete separation of the tendon from the osseous structure of the bone yes so um and that's that's critical to identify what that is and you can somewhat predict it based on the age of the person and their physiology um and the mechanism of of of the trauma so we have and we do broadly classify these into degenerative tears and traumatic tears so younger people it's rare to see a young person really under the age of 40 to uh to tear the rotator cuff it's pretty proportionally rare but it happens and it happens traumatically one of the um I had a a young fellow who worked as a Merchant Marine years ago and he was doing something with the anchor and the massive chain and his glove got caught in that and it basically just it it almost ripped his arm off right but he was he was okay except that he had torn traumatically as a as a young 20 I think he was 26 or so it ripped off three of his four muscles and it just you know they had to be repaired but he was okay but it's it's that rare dramatic uh circumstance that leads to traumatic tears in young people and someone that young where's the weak link does it tear at the muscle itself or does it tear more at the tendon that's a great question that's a great question because the younger you are the stronger that linkage of the tendon to the Bone so you often pull off some bone and so um in the case of you know a skier's thumb just a common injury in the hand from skiers the younger you are the more likely it is to pull off with a piece of bone and and that's actually great because bone heels to Bone itself much better than to Bone if you can get away with that there are fractures that occur that involve this area there's and I'll draw a picture here draw a squiggly line to represent a fracture and I'll show it coming off and that's a that's a common fracture so right here what I've drawn is this chunk of bone coming off right here that's the greater tuberosity it's a prominence of the bone that the two the biggest portion of the rotator cuff attaches the supraspinatus and the infraspinase that you referenced that pulls off and so I would rather have that than a big I would rather pull that off and have a good quality repair of that then have my the two tenants and tell me the type of athlete or person that presents with the the fracture that you've done so these are generally that isolated greater tuberosity is generally a fractured dislocation so you have a pretty violent injury you're rock climbing you fall off you maybe you hit it directly your arm is wrenched back or you have let's say a football player who who has a traumatic dislocation they're hidden just the right way and mechanically and it shears that off and then so it's it's often most often associated with the dislocation as well the dislocation goes back but the but the two dislocation meaning a subluxation of the shoulder yeah yeah and and let's explain to folks what that is how that happens I I didn't realize that we could use the word dislocation and subluxation interchangeably well technically we don't oh technically a subluxation is an incomplete dislocation it's the shoulder coming out but it pops back in easily got it so dislocation is usually it comes out and it needs to be put back in most often unless it's recurrent the more dislocations one has uh or subluxations the more stretchy and compliant the tissues become sort of like mine yes and so then it can kind of slip and slide back in and out uh with with regularity let me draw a different picture yeah what I've done here is taken the the human head away so we're just looking at the socket and we're looking at it on Foss okay so if you're looking at me you took my humerus away and now you are looking directly at the socket of this glenohumeral yes uh faucet yep perfect so yes and so this the central the front of the person is to the front that's back of the Interior if we speak about that and posteriors to the back yeah Superior is up above inferior is down below so the classic oh and so importantly around the outside that second circle is the the outline of the labrum so from here to here is the labrum and that's a rubbery calamari-like structure I love that I love that experience I mean it it sort of you get some bad calamari that's really chewy that's kind of what I haven't chewed on labor myself but it's what it I imagine it would be yeah behaving and it's very strong it's very strong and what it does it has an amazing you were talking about the evolution when we became bipeds it's super cool because it effectively developed as a way to decrease the depth of the socket not by very much but it truly works like a suction cup if you take a non-arthritic cadaver specimen and dissect away all of the muscle all the ligaments and you stick it on the humeral head on the labrum it'll sit there it's true yeah it's crazy it's fascinating but just like a thermometer on a window if you lift get your feet lift it up and break it seal it falls away yeah well that's what happens here so we get a lot of static stability in our shoulder from this this Superior inferior anterior and posterior labor and just to be clear

[00:26:42] Alton in a non-pathologic state when you have that you know that young person who has yet to be you know experiencing any trauma of the shoulder um is that a is that a contained space of fluid that is between those two cartilaginous surfaces of the glenoid fossa the humeral head fully contained because usually to have a suction you want yes there has to be a fluid that sort of contains it or air that's incompressible which is technically fluid but I assume there is an aqueous fluid that's normally absolutely yeah you have a nice viscous joint fluid in all of our joints like that that's a great question and yes you couldn't have that suction as soon as you poke a hole in that you lose that's that so when a person has a subluxation um it doesn't necessarily uh tear the labrum does it correct and that's another huge point that will it factors into our treatment recommendations and mechanisms of injury if you are a young woman playing soccer generally younger young women have looser joints women in general have looser joints which is part of physi difference in physiology but and actually because of the weird nature of the shoulders there are men as well who have super loose shoulders at

[00:27:56] Baseline born that way but in general if you think of someone who whether male or female who has super loose joints then they can sublux out in and out without tearing anything they just ride up over that because it's just loosey-goosey so the tighter the shoulder is the more you have to lose what happens to the fluid when they sublux nothing because they have just a more it stays okay it's the ligaments the ligaments are stretchy and they are and they're bigger it's more like a balloon that you've keep blowing up repeatedly so but if you have someone who has a basically a pretty stable joint not loosey-goosey and then they sublux the only way you can do that is either tearing the ligaments but usually you're also tear of the labrum and what I mean by tearing the labrum is you separate the labrum the inner Arc from its hard bony cartilaginous uh perfectly fused attachment very strong it takes a massive Force to to dislocate the shoulder it actually does or perfect mechanics and so if you if you have the classic um you're reaching up to get a a rebound and someone grabs your arm and jerks it backwards that's a leverage an unnatural leverage that makes the head tend to go out this direction anteriorly inferiorly like this so the head is going to go down this way yeah it just it just leverages it out and that's also a vulnerability based on where the muscles attach right yes yes very much so and we'll get to that as the dynamic stabilizers but man this this labrum is tough but it tears off this is the classic location where you tear the labrum there okay and it takes either a small tear that then is repetitively increased in size just from aggressive but repetitive use or it takes a one-time significant dislocation the attachments of the four rotator cuffs are basically behind above like it's it's basically like you got a big one there kind of at nine o'clock right that's a great question you ask perfect questions that I forget to cover

[00:30:27] so these are kind of the Cross sections and the muscles that are just outside so these Encompass and in and enshroud the the joint and this is the cross-sectional muscle bellies and this is where they and then as they as you'd come further out toward the head which is out here they taper down and form the tendons yeah yeah and that's so important because no shoulder can be stable alone just by these static stabilizers the labrum and the ligaments and the ligaments kind of lie in between the labrum and the rotator cuff in here so the when you're referring to a SLAP tear you know obviously slap stands for

[00:31:05] Superior labral anterior posterior yes exactly and that is up here that is the superior and that's a an odd injury that we um um the first person that really taught this well to us was a fellow named Steve Snyder in in Northern California and he really kind of categorized these and started identifying these as really actually clinically relevant entities not for everybody but certainly for younger very athletic people uh overhead athletes weight lifters people doing

[00:31:39] CrossFit people doing um all manner of um more aggressive Sports and so unlike an if you have a tear here and you're active you're going to keep redislocating at least subluxating that was me correct I was kind of all the way around but big anterior uh inferior right so I don't know what your first injury was I mean maybe so we've you've talked about this I believe it was a subluxation in boxing when I was probably 17. um it's so there's two injuries I remember having in high school I can't remember which one was first you might have a sense one was doing absurdly heavy military press okay I think that was the second one truthfully I think the first subluxation was boxing yeah and just bad timing Hard Punch Throne guy gets out of the way probably smacked my arm on the way and out it came and I believe that would have been followed up six months later I'm doing very heavy weight for me overhead and I just remember boom it just popped out and down yeah and then from that point on it was a vicious cycle of never-ending subluxations with each couple of years having a really bad one another really bad one I had was in a open water swim race I was you know we're swimming

[00:33:05] Freestyle right so I'm in the reach phase with right arm in front and the swimmer in front of me kicked down on that arm which is not I mean that's a bit of force yeah but not absurd but just the down kick of that arm took me out yeah um so it's so funny I mean you are describing so many great I'm sorry you had suffered from them all but but so many great and differing types of mechanisms that happen I agree with you that it probably was the boxing I've seen a lot of those The Recoil and especially if you don't hit something your body is anticipating and it's tightened up and it is ready for contact and it doesn't have the content it's no different than you know you there's an extra step in front of you that you don't know about and you step and you go whoa and then you feel like it shutters your whole body it's the same concept your body unconsciously knows what it needs to do and so you probably did have a posterior subluxation I mean I will say and you know this and this was why it was so important for you is you had a tear going all the way from posterior all the way around to there so you had about a 200 and you know 40 degree tear and that's you don't get that from one injury it's almost impossible um so it basically became looser and looser over time and then it just now had too much laxity it could basically move in any direction exactly and you were you were compensating well for most of the time because you're you're very fit you're doing all the right upper body specifically shoulder strengthening exercises so you are using your Dynamic stabilizers to compensate for this loss of the static stability and that's a critical critical problem and it fits too with your weight lifting so yeah you had you had to tear you weight lift and you were fine but what happens is if you're going kind of maxing out and you're doing it repetitively the the dynamic stabilizers fatigue and I see this the one of the most common scenarios is the young more often female than male but both swimmers right so they're competing and they have a little bit of show they need the stability especially they're doing uh fly and and backstroke they really need that and they acquire all this laxity in their shoulder and they're so strong dynamically that they're they're fine and it gives them that extra pull that extra inch or two but when they fatigue but they start out fine on a Friday if they have a you know a weekend long match and they have eight events in three days um the first two days they're fine maybe they have a little pain at the end of the second day by the third day they're fatigued and so then they start sublocksing and then they get all this secondary inflammation and pain and that's when the the damage occurs and they have to sit out and then we have to re-strengthen rehab sometimes even tighten up the capsule when they get so loose now one of the things I I we're gonna you know talk about here is of course the physical exam on this because the other thing we haven't talked about on this diagram is that little pesky biceps head yes and and that tendon um boy if anybody who's experienced tendinosis there uh I mean that's that can be incredibly painful and I think to an average person it's not entirely clear where that pain is coming from if they feel pain here right right that's a great point and so yes the biceps which is a weird structure and it's absolutely part of that weird Evolution that we have the biceps is one muscle in our arm but but it's two tendons at the at the origin which in the shoulder one of the tendons so it starts down here single single point of attachment in the forearm actually crosses the joint as one muscle and then kind of splits into two bellies with exactly and it has the long head which is the one that so often gets inflamed and you're absolutely right it can be quite painful I mean and it can just affect everyday life with that and the second tendon peels off over here and it goes outside the joint and attaches to a bony prominence in that weird scapula that you talked about which is such a weird looking bone um and it attaches there that never tears it literally never tears so but people often do tear the the other this biceps and it can be from wear and tear it can be acute traumatically but it leads to a classic Popeye muscle kind of half their muscle is is balled up and that looks weird it's not really that much of a functional consequence usually it stops hurting when it ruptures and if

[00:37:52] I'm not mistaken I mean this has been in the orthopedic sort of uh anecdotes for a long time was um the great quarterback um from Denver um John Elway John Elway he was having shoulder pain and was even thinking about retiring as far as I know his ruptured pain went away and then he won another Super Bowl with two Super Bowls after that so yeah so it's not it's a it's a structure that's not necessary but it's but and there's a lot of argument in Orthopedics and I don't need to go into it about how important it really is but the fact is it is anchored right up here at the superior labrum so when you tear that super labrum that biceps does funky things it becomes unstable and it and it gets more inflamed often and then that you get all that secondary pain so some people I'm not one of them some people who fix a lot of these will automatically just snip that biceps and and reattach it in the front so it's not no longer a pain generator so that's the tendoniesis yes that's the tinnitesis but I don't do I do that only when I see tearing splitting something structurally wrong with the biceps I know that I can get a good repair as any any good surgeon can a good repair of the superior label once that's stable the biceps is fine again it's not it's no longer symptomatic and

[00:39:11] I'm not going wood but I haven't had to go back and to introduce anyone who I had just repaired and left it intact as long as I got a good um Superior labral repair so because we've got the beautiful Anatomy here let's go a little deeper into this because I feel like the torn labrum is to the MRI with the disc herniation there is to the shoulder what the disc herniation is to the back right yes you know we tell our patients I almost wish when I give you an MRI for another reason I could ask the radiologist not to show me your spine in other words you take somebody who's not having no spine issues and you stick them in the spanner yeah there's nothing that bugs me more than having to sit there and go through all of these asymptomatic herniations which mean nothing and and I suspect the shoulder with its labor old hair has to be the same yes you're absolutely spot on and it is such a point of frustration the

[00:40:06] Radiologists are doing their job of course the problem is that most of us walking around have especially for at my age have plenty of positive findings but there are some automatic I mean I've never had a spine or originated you know symptom and so that's your it's a very double-edged sword to get those MRIs same thing in the labrum the labrum will naturally degenerate just by using it so will the cartilage and look every we know there's a genetic predisposition to arthritis and by arthritis I mean not just inflammation of the joint but a a true loss of the cartilage integrity and that's kind of those two terms are used interchangeably by different people in different sub-specialties but for our purposes as an orthopedic surgeon it's when the joint is degenerating and the cartilage surfaces are no longer pristine just like you're chipping the paint on your car and does that occur uh preferentially on the humeral head or in the glenoid fossa or is it basically one of those things where the second you get one chip it's going to start happening on both sides yeah that's a great question too you know it's we don't have a good natural history of that we know that I mean I've operated on done total shoulders on people who had no cartilage left on their humeral head it was perfectly round and smooth there was no cartilage it was just a bony just pure soft I mean pure hard

[00:41:39] Ivory type bone with no cartilage on it whereas the glenoid still had cartilage on it now that's a case where to your point the loss on the humerus was smooth enough and gradual enough to where it didn't dig in and and sort of eat away at the GL the socket it doesn't matter you still have to um to um replace the socket but we do for our younger athletic people who have a humeral head that's been damaged and they have a big chunk maybe a quarter size maybe a 50 cent piece size of cartilage full cartilage loss that's not great because that man that just keeps sloughing off cartilage they keep getting inflamed they're on the young side you don't want to do a shoulder replacement on them so we will do just a humeral head resurfacing they have a get a nice new smooth uh metal head but we leave the car the the glenoid intact and and they have good cartilage there so it's it's metal on natural cartilage yeah what kind of metal is that by the way that's it's

[00:42:42] Cobalt chromium Alloys so it's just like the hips yeah yeah and and the nice thing about those is if you can get five years I have some people that have been had those in 10 years and they're fine and they're they're keep they're act they can be much more aggressive with their activities and if it ever if it ever does wear down the glenoid side then you just go back in and revise it and put a plastic cup for the glenoid yeah so let's now talk about when you look at the MRI finding and what you're looking for in the MRI and then how you're looking to contrast that with what you see on the physical exam and in a moment I'll have you examine me so you can and we'll do this for all of the pathology we talk about so that we can get a sense of this because I remember the very first time I saw you um after having sent many patients to you it was probably a year before I had my surgery I said look you know Alton I know I've got this labrum it's been torn to shreds for years um I really don't want to have surgery unless I need to you examined me and said yeah you're not ready yet um so yeah walk through how you start to test the surrounding structures to elicit sort of feedback on the labrum right so I will preface that by saying

[00:44:00] I'm so glad you brought that up because we one should never make their clinical especially surgical decision making on just an MRI and and I I've written a couple of book chapters on that included a a very complete examination of the shoulder the basic exam the provocative Maneuvers and so forth and one of the things I've always stated I've never done this study I've always wanted to but I believe that a good history and that involves the mechanics of injury in the mechanics of use whether you're you're shooting a bow and arrow whether you're driving a race car whether you're playing basketball whether you're just lifting weights a combination of the mechanism but also their symptoms when they have them and then their examination and I think if you do those compulsively and well you will be 95 accurate

[00:44:55] I remember one of the things that had changed because for me remember archery never the day before I'm having surgery I'm out there taking 100 shots that was never the issue but in the months leading up to surgery I couldn't serve a volleyball with my daughter yeah I couldn't shoot one basket like you know could I could not do that right and then

[00:45:15] I could pull a 75 pound bow back yeah doesn't make sense it doesn't and it's just the mechanics of each individual and that's where the MRI does come in I use MRIs more to corroborate I would say and I don't think I'm I'm maybe I'm a little more into sort of the the concept of making an accurate diagnosis before the MRI because the old school yeah yeah to kind of prove a point but um but I I always use it to corroborate because there are things that can be there and especially even just the difference between a partial thickness rotator cuff tear and a full thickness or a full thickness small and a full thickness large and and those are variable based again on the patient's activities some we know from good studies done with ultrasound MRI that walking down the street the um half the people age 60 have rotator cuff tears people over 60. have an asymptomatic torn rotator cuff yeah I may not be big but it can be I've seen I mean I don't doubt it just based on what we see of herniations in the c-spine and the L spine um and that and that's where to your point it comes in it's so important that yes we don't want something we don't want to ignore something that can get much worse and make their treatment or recovery much more difficult but at the same time we need to be more circumspect about who we're operating and who we're not operating on are there ever situations where

[00:46:48] I'll give you an example right so I mean I'm asking I'm going to ask this question obviously on the shoulder but um if a patient came in and had a totally asymptomatic aortic aneurysm of six centimeters everybody agrees you would operate because the mortality of a rupture is enormous and frankly you don't want to wait till somebody's symptomatic that can be lethal so there are certainly indications where we operate on asymptomatic things are there any such indications in the shoulder oh that's a that's a great um great question I would say in general no unless you have obviously a tumor yeah not including oncology just a standard Garn variety um structural injuries that can occur there are very few except if you've had someone who had well I'll give you a good example that's very personal to me my dad who he passed away at 95 we were swimming in Lake Travis when he was 94 and a half it was really vigorous mentally fit physically fit and but he did end up having pancreatic cancer and that's what killed him at 95 great life no no complaints with anybody but at 86 being com a guy who could still do pull-ups who was still swimming in the lake this guy's my hero all his own yard work everything and he was running to get out of the way the sprinkler did a banana peel that had a dislocation of his shoulder ripped off two and a half of his four tenants and remember one of them never tears so almost his complete functional rotator cuff he was planning to come up to New York to visit and we did a little uh face time and he he couldn't lift his arm it was like this and I and he's 86. but healthy never took a medication so forth so I said um Dad you need to come up early um we're gonna need to fix this so we'll get an MRI come up here and um so my partner and I fixed him and Regional anesthesia he they didn't even give me much sedation he was like talking to us during the surgery got a good six anchor repair he had great tissue to the point that you've you've just helped so many of us understand but got a good solid repair at 95 and 94. you couldn't tell he ever had a tear he healed it back he was he went back to doing and what would have been the Natural History because I think a lot of doctors might have left him alone what would how would he have evolved thank you that's that was the point if I he would have been miserable for the next nine years of his life because he couldn't lift his arm it might not even have been that painful but he wouldn't been able to do everything he wanted to do that kept him so far so in other words pain is not a pain shouldn't be the only symptom we look for we have to look for function no and and so what I would tell someone who came in let's say someone had a bad traumatic a motor vehicle accident and they tore their rotator cuff at a badly and there were 60 65. uh would I tell them you absolutely have to have it repaired no but I would also tell them look if you don't repair this those muscles have lost their muscle tendon connection so they're going to atrophy and later if you I know you're not painful now but if you want to still do the things you're doing and the way you do them before this accident they need to have them repaired so this is effectively the discussion you had with one of the patients I sent you six months ago who tore a rotator cuff playing tennis many years ago and basically once this patient stopped playing tennis they had no more pain so today they do yoga and pilates with no pain but they can never pick up a racket again I sent the person to you and that's basically what you said was you don't have to have this fixed but you will see a continued diminution of your function as you age right exactly and the second caveat which I'll tell them is is you know you may start having symptoms in six months even doing those other things and if you do come back don't don't ignore them if you start having symptoms when you've been asymptomatic something has changed anatomically physiologically or something let's reassess it's not a you know it's not a know it's a dynamic State over a long period of time and so you know you need to be flexible on that and as a clinician so when a patient typically comes in basically you know they're just saying doc my shoulder hurts so um again on the exam absent even an MRI we're going to show people how you can just based on what where I'm weak or strong and what hurts you probably have a pretty good sense of this person has an intact cuff versus they don't yes this person has a labral instability versus they don't this may actually just be bicep tendon injury versus not what else is on your differential diagnosis in the exam you don't have the MRI yet the guys just says he's got shoulder pain it's great

[00:51:40] I'm gonna draw another picture okay so I've drawn the shoulder again I've added on I've added on a couple of things I've added on the clavicle the collarbone and I've and and I've added on this other structure up here which is the Bony structure if you tap on the top of your shoulder that's the Bony roof of the shoulder that's the acromion and yet another part of that super weird scapula okay so the The Joint that when you hear about someone separating their shoulder it's this joint right here which is the acromioclavicular joint and that is just a it it only rotates about 20 degrees it's just a the way I liken this especially being in Texas you can talk about it because there's a lot of car lovers and you know about it as a major car lover driver is it effectively is a McPherson strut on uh on a car so it's a stabilizer bar if you don't have those and there are people that are born without um without that collarbones or without collarbones they can bring their shoulders completely together right here in the center just like this it's kind of super cool but it holds those out so that's why you know it's the one most commonly injured in cyclists who who wipe out because they fracture here because they land on the outside of their shoulder but the AC joint the acromioclavicular joint is what happens when people separate their shoulders which is awesome from a dislocation different from dislocation that's usually from a force coming down from the top so we're pitched forward we land on the point of our shoulder and it jams it down and we can talk about that later it's super interesting but this acromion again is the Bony roof and under that roof is where the rotator cuff Glides and let me draw this foreign arrows back and forth the arrows here so as the head rotates back and forth around the rotator cuff is attached here and it goes back and forth here so it's rubbing or moving underneath this any place in our body that there's two structures and a uh anatomically in the limbs that move differentially like with one another there's usually a bursa that forms in between and so that Bursa is here I'll draw it in green that Bursa lives right in there and so it's just the thin filmy structure that can thicken up and become very inflamed and become bursitis and that's very painful so that's a common cause otherwise the purpose of that is to allow these things to Glide past each other frictionless yes perfect yes exactly and then some of us are born with an extra kind of downsloping of that acromion or a bone spur or we acquire it from repetitive athletic use there are multiple reasons if you have a big though bird beak coming down and pointing into that you can imagine if this is running back and forth there it's irritating the Bursa creating bursitis and it's also frictionally rubbing against the rotator cuff tendon and you can get bursal sided upper part rotator cuff tears from that alone I know because I had wow I had a big spur like that in my shoulder so to be clear the spur occurred because you were genetically predisposed to it based on the shape of the Bursa yes that's really great that you said that you know he should have been an orthopedic surgeon so you can have a type 1 a type 2 or a

[00:55:16] Type 3 acromion Type 1 is totally flat that's the majority of people type 2 the second most common in type three is about I don't remember the exact numbers but certainly it's not rare like 30 percent of people and that's the one that really predisposed you if but only if you're an overhead athlete or lifting weights overhead or doing all sorts of you know aggressive things if you're sedentary actuary who doesn't exercise then um you'll never have a problem because you're just not repetitively loading it enough to wear down or cause a tear this is so so interesting because you know you'll often hear people talk about um you know well I can do so and so and

[00:56:01] I've never had an issue therefore it's okay right so if you're if you have the top acromion there you can probably get away with a lot more overhead activity and you might look at somebody who's in category three every time they do excessive overhead activity gets injured and you might be saying well look there's something wrong with you the round of it is it would be interesting if we sort of knew these things in advance and we could maybe modify and temper our activity around our genetics effectively absolutely it's a super cool concept I've always thought about that that that stuff the predisposition and

[00:56:31] I'm not talking about a genetic predisposition to arthritis you're talking about this is anatomics yeah mechanics and anatomy and you're absolutely right it's so important I'll give you another example of it I know just from having MRIs for other reasons I have a very congenitally narrow c-spine so I just don't have any wiggle room as a result of that I take my sort of Technic protocol very seriously yes you know I also know that I already have two small herniations now luckily they aren't doing anything to me but

[00:57:11] I know that nobody's going to go in and remove one without doing the other which means they'd fuse me out of the gate right so you know I think knowing that is very helpful because what it tells me to do is you're going to do a lot of sort of rehabilitative exercises even before having the injury yes and you know

[00:57:31] I actually think it's very fortunate that I'm no longer a surgeon yeah because I think a lot of my colleagues from surgery have ended up having neck surgery oh yes because you're in this position my gosh all the time yes um so yeah I do I think this is a very interesting idea I'd never thought about it in the orthopedic context in the joint context that is yeah and and um you know the other thing I thought of when you said that is that when you have a but this has been studied in the spine a little bit right so if you have a congenally narrow a stenotic spine and you're playing football you're way more at risk for catastrophic spinal cord yeah so if you've had that's why when we were I was team doctor for almost 15 years at a college up in in New York and you know you everybody doesn't screen these guys but if you have your first Stinger then you need to be need to be uh screened and see if you are and if you are then you have a very serious discussion about what you're subjecting your neck to there are a lot of a lot of sports to play and you don't necessarily have to be you know butting heads at High

[00:58:38] Velocity you know so um so that's exactly true there but you're right it hasn't been done in the shoulder and yeah it'd be a simple easy screen and say oh you know I mean well especially I think when you take about when you talk about kids who have lots of athletic potential and they're 11 years old and you know maybe there is a decision to be made are you gonna be a pitcher are you going to be a tennis player are you going to be a basketball player you're going to play lacrosse you're going to swim if you knew you'd have a longer shelf life in one over the other would that at least weigh into the decision-making process that's fascinating I love the way your mind works because yes there are plenty of multi-sport athletes who have ability and and and you could do an assessment for instance if you are yeah if you're a if you have super loose joints then you're going to need to pick the ones that um you can keep dynamically stabilized but are not going to be subjected directly to unnecessary necessary forces yes great concept so I'm guessing Alton you drew this to expand our understanding of the anatomy to then appreciate the shoulder pain that somebody shows up with yes so all these things that I've drawn on here can be pain generators and another one which is exactly to the point we're talking about is this this right here the AC joint almost everybody through wear and tear middle age and

[01:00:00] Beyond has arthritis in the AC joint yeah and like we were talking about in the neck it's almost always asymptomatic but it can be symptomatic if it's sorry just to be clear the little red structure you've drawn on there that ligament that is connecting the clavicle to the acromion um there's no fluid within that space or tiny amount any place there's cartilage there's a tiny amount of fluid but there's very little but it can expand and it can and so if it's arthritic you can get more fluid if you have uh you know Young weight lifters like you were um can I'll draw it here can develop in the end of the clavicle from that repetitive butt doing heavy bench and other types of activities can develop distal clavicle osteolysis that repetitive jamming or bruising of the bone and cartilage causes a cartilage to disintegrate and the bone to lose its integrity and it starts to kind of get very soft and it gets very inflamed as soon as you start breaking up cartilage the all the macrophages from a body come in there and you get a big inflammatory response you get a lot of extra fluid and a lot of pain so from a chronic perspective are you going to see that more in somebody doing bench press or military press or which direction both but you'll also get it I don't do these

[01:01:17] I don't recommend them my patients do them but the the people that raises heavy lat raises that just jams up it's just so much leverage on that that joint and if you are to do it I recall you you're sort of more in favor of if you're going to do it thumbs are up yeah not down yeah yeah and not directly lateral yeah in the natural plane exactly exactly that minimizes stresses the other thing about it is that joint you can imagine it's like you under your understanding the biomechanical as you lie directly on your the point of your shoulder and it jams out against so they have a lot of pain there that pain comes right down the front kind of follows the bicep so you have to differentiate that between the two then you look at an x-ray without an MRI or anything and you see these spurs that are down there well those Spurs aren't ever going to tear the rotator cuff because that's that tendon is out there it never gets that far but it rubs you we see it as an indentation in the muscle so you know every time you're working out you know you hypertrophy your muscles and so if you have that constantly rubbing there and then you hypertrophy around it it's a truth so that's an athlete who complains that when they're lifting it hurts more exactly exactly and that's a crystal clear when they're when they're relaxed they haven't been exercising they have

[01:02:35] Rock Solid strength if you get them after if you get them up into positions or if they've been working out you test them they'll actually be weak not because they're truly weak but because their brain is saying no I'm not going to give you that it's going to hurt me it's going to hurt my body so I'm not going to give you enough electrical current to give you a full strength there wow you know this reminds me when

[01:02:54] I was in medical school once I decided I was going to go into surgery I read a book and I wish I could remember the name of it but it was a book written by a general surgeon who had long since passed away but the entire book was based on diagnosing appendicitis and yes you know this was cope yes that's right early diagnosis of appendicitis and I thought this was the most fascinating thing in the world because you had this old school Old School general surgeon who said you know this before and it was using a CT but he was like this is 100 a clinical diagnosis and you wouldn't nobody today training would ever dream you could waste an entire book to diagnose something that by the way incredibly prevalent the single most prevalent condition in general surgery when you just shove everybody in the scanner and get the answer today but the reality of it is this this makes me think of Coke's appendicitis hey this is more complicated and two I don't think there'll ever be a substitute for the

[01:03:52] Nuance of the exam and this the history both the history of the injury and the history of what causes pain yeah yeah it's fascinating I love that and we're in a couple Barons you know well the the guy that that was my cope uh was our uh professor of Cardiology at Tulane he was super old when he was teaching us he was in his 80s at that time that's not super old but back then yes um and he had had he had had um uh he had had thyroid cancer so he he spoke in a very hushed tone his name was sea Thorpe Ray and he was a cardiologist he could diagnose he could tell you exactly what was wrong with which valve just by listening to with his testicope with his hands sometimes he just put his ear up there and exactly he could tell by the nature of these subtle variations in the heart murmurs what the dinos what I just yeah this is a little off topic but I do sort of lament the fact that that's a dying art yes um and look you know the reality of it is I'm sure that today with Echo and stuff we're better and he was probably such an outlier that most people could never rise to that level just like most people could have never attained the clinical Acumen of code but it is a little bit sad to think that you know we can't have both right it would be you have to think it would be great to have both um so it's interesting to think that in

[01:05:24] Orthopedics it might be one of those Specialties where this judgment of the exam is still really really relevant right that's right I mean obviously you get pinpoint diagnoses with the various tests um in their Orthopedics there's plenty of things you find that aren't symptomatic but still thinking back to

[01:05:46] I do lament that as well about the loss of the clinical Acumen that that comes with all the Advanced Imaging and but I think that if you knew if you have both um it we don't and I don't say this self-servingly in the sense of I want to keep doing what I do as long as I can because I love it but we our patients need us to be able to still diagnose listen to them hear what they're saying because I mean I don't know anything about general surgery but there's got to be things that come up positive that you don't necessarily have to have surgery on right absolutely and so you want to still be hearing and perhaps examining but certainly hearing the patient's story and knowing what's really going on to determine whether they need surgical or non-surgical care or what kind of care they need I I feel like that was something that was if you were paying attention in residency I think that was a very important message I think when you start residency you're just so preoccupied with mastering the technical side of things I mean there's so much to learn it's it's like learning to master an instrument and learn a new language at the same time and you've only got five years to do it but I definitely remember the wisdom that was sort of spoken down to us which is the single most important thing that you will learn is when to operate and when not to operate that's true that's true and and you know I don't know how long that takes yeah um my guess is it's well after you finish your residency but unfortunately and I don't I don't want to go down this Rabbit Hole too much but unfortunately there's and there's some people who don't learn that some people don't learn it or ignore it yeah and there are plenty of people who will operate on any MRI uh whether it's Orthopedics or probably general surgery [Music] um

[01:07:38] I don't know whether it's we had one surgeon who uh the joke was if you uh rubbed Betadine on the wall he would operate on the wall just just don't don't let beta die near the wall right because he'll start cutting it yeah yeah that's true and that's that's a perfect way to say it without being too pejorative um and yeah and there are economic incentives there are even and these are a version of economic Center but there's even incentives in big institutions where it's an RV

[01:08:09] RBA yeah rbu concept where you're going to do more because that's how you get your promotion and so forth and it makes it I have to just suppress that information because it makes me too cynical and sad but it's actually happens and I'm sure you did um when you were doing surgery and I certainly do now I see patients that walk in with their MRI all the time and say I'm scheduled for this uh surgery in my shoulder or my elbow and um I'm scheduled for this by just my friend said I should just come get one more opinion and I say look

[01:08:46] I'm looking at you I examine them I do everything I go through and I say look I wasn't there at the time of your examination so I can't speak for what that person saw and what their their statement is but today based on your MRI your history and your physical exam which I've done I will not operate on you and and if your friend said you should come to me because I have a decent operative skills that's I'm sorry but I I won't I can't in good conscious operate on you maybe someday but not now and I feel like I've sent you patients where that's been the patients that have come from out of the country and it's been hey

[01:09:23] I know that this surgeon is saying so I just want Alton to have a second look yeah and you know it and that's I've never met a patient who didn't appreciate that by the way I mean sometimes it creates more confusion right but and I say that I say look I'm sorry if this confuses you I'm sorry if this is complicating your your trajectory of what you you're planning for but that's just the truth and yeah the thing you always have to remember as a patient um and I I think of this myself is once you commit to doing something it's the inertia to do it is huge right and you can always just say look there's an asymmetry in this decision to not have surgery doesn't remove any options you get to have surgery again later if it was the right thing to do yes once you have surgery it's not that you can't have surgery again but the operative field never looks the same a second time that's a very good and so you want to keep in mind the asymmetry of a pause yeah that's very true very true all right so let's go back to our shoulder pain patient I think one thing we've established so far is a patient that has shoulder pain can have so many things going on their AC joint can be the problem they could have bursitis they could have a rotator cuff injury they could have a labral injury they could have bicep tendon inflammation and let's just leave it at that they could have arthritis we've got all of these things that are going now arthritis would usually be accompanied by one of these other things that predisposed it okay so we're going to go through an exam and you're going to basically run me through these are the things you do and this is what you look to see on the MRI to basically correlate your findings and give you a set of confidence as you go into the operating room you named the bulk of them I want to add two things to this before we do our exam and one of them I've drawn just kind of a red Arc down there and what I'm showing there is the capsule that's the best place to see the capsule when you're looking at an MRI because it's thicker there and it's more distinct there's not other structures obscuring it normally if you have a super loose joint you can have a very capacious capsule like that that allows it to flop down and even sub locks are dislocated when it's very high and tight and thick there that can be representative of something called adhesive capsulitis and the reason I say that is because that's so imp so common one and two it can conflate all sorts of diagnoses and the frozen shoulder at is that there's the layman term for adhesive capsulitis we don't know why this happens we it's super common I see probably two or three new cases every week in one office it's that common but it's multifactorial it's worse like many things are if you have diabetes but it's but you don't get it with more frequency if you have diabetes but it is and it's a full spectrum and there's a lot of misinformation about it because the original old literature said that oh all of these just get better with time well they don't all we know they don't all and in some even a subset of them in my practice is about only one out of five actually ever need surgery and we never do that at the at the beginning and it's just a simple little 30 minute release of the capsule and and reduction in the inflammation and then they they're so happy um but that's that's the exception the most eighty percent do not need any surgery they need some way to control the inflammation they need really good physical therapy and a home program and some teams for mostly Mobility yes for

[01:13:21] Mobility that's why I'm saying that is because you can get a stiff shoulder if you have impingement if you have a big bone spur because your brain says I'm not going to let you leasure it there and then it just gradually stiffens up that's a secondary stiffness or adhesive capsulitis it's not the weird primary adhesive capsulatis that could happen to you or me just suddenly and it just happens it's a spontaneous intense inflammation in the lining inner lining if you take a little camera and stick it in there and just look you see it's beat red normally everything when you're an arthroscopy everything's kind of off-white yeah and but in the case of it's just beet red and it's crazy and we and people have done all sorts of of laboratory tests biopsies evaluations have happened over a long period of time I mentioned to you there's a colleague of Mine in Northern

[01:14:17] California that wants to talk to you because you're so smart in this about frozen shoulder because that maybe he thinks some of the things you've said um might overlap with that biochemically yeah so I was going to say what are the I mean do these respond to NSAIDs or is this a part of the body that doesn't have enough of a vascular Supply in the capsule that you don't get enough penetration it has a rich vascular

[01:14:41] Supply but I think in this case I I give NSAIDs when people want them and they're afraid of an injection but I think you because it's that inner lining and it's so robust I mean if you look at it microscopically it's just these angry red fronds and and I think it's just not strong enough so I like to put a small dose of cortisone into the joint where are you in one time I I always inject from the back okay for two reasons one this part is more richly supplied by the brachial plexus so it's more sensitive and two people kind of see you coming at them with the needle so I always go in the back okay and I never use an ultrasound that's a whole nother thing that a lot of clinicians use the ultrasound just to see but you can feel where are you going you just get it in there and what's super cool about this is people come in with a lot of stiffness and a lot of pain and then you inject them and put local anesthetic as well in there they're free in 10 seconds oh my gosh they walk out they're saying oh my gosh it's amazing they man they still probably need Physical Therapy but the fact that they got such dramatic relief was some just simple treatment is is so do you recommend that a patient with frozen shoulder air on the side of earlier intervention with a cortisone shot to to then allow them to do more rehab sooner or do you say I don't want to do a cortisone shot until you've done three months of rehab it's it's purely based again on their exam well and they're examining their history how long they've had it and how acutely symptomatically is when I'm examining them if I can stretch them and they start kind of saying oh that hurts a little bit at the end but they've got decent motion they're tight then go back and do the reason go to good PT who will really stretch you out you don't need anything you don't even need insets but if you if I can't get them to move and they're just they're just screaming you're not they're not going to get anywhere in PT because it's going to hurt so much to do it so I'll inject them then send them to PT and I always see them back in about six weeks most of them are dramatically better but not all of them very rarely they need a second shot and then um and then some of them are just recalcitrant and they just stay stiff and then then I'll do the little procedure on them so there was one other thing you wanted to mention yeah what was that um oh yes a big source of neck pain which you and I have discussed uh multiple times is referred pain from the spine from the neck and so we'll include that in our exam because it's so important because you at least have to rule that out well especially because someone comes in with shoulder pain and I see that you know I take care of a lot of professional musicians and their their necks are doing all sorts of crazy things from all the violinists and the Philharmonic or

[01:17:23] Etc just all types of uh musical instruments that cause that lead to having to maintain these certain postures that sometimes are very counterproductive to their overall musculoskeletal health but they'll come in with shoulder pain going down their arm maybe even down to their hand and they'll have already gotten a shoulder

[01:17:44] MRI and they're 55 and they have four findings on their MRI but it's not coming from their shoulder it's coming from their neck and so we have to make sure and differentiate that and because the worst thing I could do the worst thing I could do to them is have them take time off for music to fix what doesn't need to be fixed in their shoulder and then it's and they still have them returned and they still have the pain and in that situation is there something you see on exam that makes you think we better go look at your neck first with the MRI because the symptoms fit as something I'm expecting to see and then you look and you see well I do see that so now that's yes exactly so that it's so important so intrinsic shoulder pathology whether it's a rotator cuff whether it's impingement whether it's arthritis almost never does the pain radiate down below the elbow whereas neck origin whether it's a pinched nerves that you know any the lower cervical spine where it's more common to have pathology almost always goes down below the elbow and into the hand now a low the one Oddball is C7 and I learned this not that long ago from some really great cervical spine surgeons um is that if you have a deep posterior pain under your scapula yes that can be

[01:19:06] C7 uh and that's right where it goes and so I've had two musicians whom you know recently uh both with that diagnosis yeah it's funny the only time I've ever had a complaint of a neck issue what turned out to be a neck issue was not didn't present as neck pain so I and this was several years ago now again in the back of my mind I've always known

[01:19:30] I'm susceptible I'm susceptible I'm susceptible and I woke up one morning and my left trap felt like it was in spasm interesting and I kind of ignored it I was like oh I slept over time you know whatever this is super uncomfortable you know the next day it was still in spasm I just sort of ignored it I might have taken some you know NSAIDs and cup this went on for like two weeks and maybe not two weeks might have gone on week at that point and at this point

[01:20:02] I'm thinking I've never had a muscle that's this tense for this long um and at about that time very abruptly I started to notice a loss of tricep strength wow and yes you know I noticed it in the gym because and it was subtle at first because I was doing you know Skull Crushers where you have two dumbbells so now the right arm can't compensate for the left because using two dumbbells and all of a sudden I couldn't move the weight with this arm so I am that's weird I can move it this way so I and then it got to the and then it progressed so rapidly that within about two days I couldn't pull my bow back because this arm wow couldn't support extend it here yeah so at that point I was kind of freaking out I'm now down to you know only being able to do a couple pounds so I know hey once you have those Motors but here's the thing zero pain yeah not a lick of pain nope nope no numbness tingling no paresthesias anywhere nothing my neck doesn't feel a thing I just have this trap on fire make a long story shirt you know I see a person uh who says look you know we could operate on you but unfortunately this is a surgeon who shares your ethos and she said look um uh let's rehab the heck out of this I think if you want we could do an injection I wasn't excited about it because it was an anterior injection and

[01:21:23] I said no way I'd rather do prednisone yeah and traction yes and so we did prednisone traction and sure enough within three months the strength was back it's never returned but that was a real wake-up call to me that I had a cervical symptom that didn't present with any neck pain yeah that's great that's a great story it's so instructive and you're absolutely spot on I mean and and yeah I mean I see when I see especially the musicians as long as you don't have now you did have some so you were you were absolutely right getting more deeply studied to make sure because you had triceps but if you have no weakness but it maybe you do have a little tingling or something but I know

[01:22:02] I just know it's coming from the neck I won't Lurch in and get um MRIs the neck X-rays and MRIs in the neck I'll often just give them a one very low dose of prednisone and it usually goes away I mean it's it's and then they don't have to worry about it and they don't get go down the rabbit hole of worry and and anxiety about that so as we were talking about a minute ago about uh the shoulder I think that with a good history interactive history and certain questions and a good physical exam I can be about 95 accurate in making a diagnosis without an MRI without a CT scan without even X-rays and so I think that conserves resources and also it just gets the information because those little tidbits are what are critical including to knowing what's going to make you the best whether it's going to be an injection PT surgery maybe Etc so the first thing I look at is you know it's nice that you're fit so

[01:23:01] I can see any true abnormalities I can look for atrophy I can look for asymmetry somebody who's had a shoulder separated shoulder will have a big bump on one side yours are equal I can look at the pecs and see you know some of the nerve problems we talked about the parsonage Turner for instance the mixed brachial plexopathy I'll see someone with a very indented pectoralis at a patient the other day who's a rock and roll guitarist and he was lifting weights and and ruptured his pectoralis tendon and so I could look and see right away he had bruising down the arm not the chest wall that means he tore the tendon from the bone here instead of the muscle tendon unit here which a lot of weight lifters which will tear but I could also see gross asymmetry so those are the kind of things you're looking for and I also even care about the sloping of the shoulders because that can potentially be posturally if it's an issue with posture and so forth okay so looking at your shoulder I see nothing asymmetric I I just then so I'm looking at the asymmetry I haven't checked motion yet I'm just going to palpate so

[01:24:11] I can palpate the AC joint and see that those are tender or non-tender I can palpate the front of the shoulder now this area is always tender it's where the brachial plexus of passing through so this is one of the most tender areas in the shoulder so I don't press too hard and I'm kind of looking for asymmetry not pressing hard I want to look at the pecs I want to look at the folds of the pecs and see if there's any asymmetry there I want to look at the

[01:24:35] Contour of the deltoid and then I want to palpate back here your acromium the roof the Bony roof of the shoulder and I want to palpate that and see if there's any tenderness along that perimeter because a whole deltoid originates all around there so you can tear especially weight lifters especially very active athletes can tear a little portion of that origin ends up healing but it can be very much of a nuisance for six or eight weeks and then I look at the upper trapezius right I want to see if there's any asymmetry if you've had neck surgery and had an injury to that nerve then you can get atrophy there and it'll be very asymmetric and then I want to look in the back I want to look and palpate people who are working out a lot or or texting a lot and have bad posture or bad ergonomics and get a lot of strain here in the rhomboid minor the rhomboid major and the levator up here and so those are the things I'm looking at so I don't see any abnormalities here but if I did that would help with the diagnosis then we want to look at range of motion so I'm going to ask you just lift your arms straight up in the air so you have great motion and I'm looking for any subtle asymmetry sometimes an arm will be maybe just that far that last bit that I push it up you go oh that hurts that means your shoulder is a little stiff why is it well we'll get to that but that's your forward elevation yours is nice and fluid and equal then we look at external rotation here beautiful external rotation that's about 75 degrees everybody varies I only go out about 50 degrees it's fine now if you're a thrower you're going to have let's say you're a left-handed thrower you're going to acquire external rotation to get more of that Vlog we talked about that angular velocity so this arm would come out externally more in a thrower and a left-handed thrower whereas if I come up here and measure internal rotation that would be decreased that's that's you've acquired that from a lifetime time of throwing so that's what we look for and that's normal variation based on your activity pattern okay so we we've done that then I look we've done external rotation we've done a modification of internal rotation which is here in full abduction seeing how far you internally rotate locking that up trying not to rotate the scapula too much because that's a we know that a lot of people with stiff shoulders can compensate you were talking about that before with all that scapular thoracic motion okay the other way to measure that is just having you reach behind your back but that's often more painful and it's easy to deduce if you have a frozen shoulder uh let's say you're you have a frozen stroller on this side it's going to look completely normal to look at you have pain you have stiffness you can't do all the things you want to do and I look here and I see that this one's 70 now look here and it goes only goes to 30 and it starts to hurt when I do that well that's that adhesive capsulitis in there that's blocking motion abduction which is this movement here so we always test abduction and I see this mistake made you can abduct way up but that's all secondary to not all but a lot of it's from your scapular thoracic so I hold your scapula down I know it's there and then I see how far your glenohumeral your shoulder joint proper can come up you come up perfectly to 90 degrees so that's a really important distinction if you have frozen shoulder it's going to be stuff if you have a chronic rotator cuff it's going to be stiff and so those are the kind of things that we start to put together so we've tested range of motion now let's test strength so we're isolating the rotator cuff and then we can also check the deltoid so there's two components to shoulder motion primarily that's the deltoid which gives us so much flexion extension and abduction but we also have the rotator cuff which we had talked about before so here in neutral with your elbows at your side push out to the outside super strong now someone who has a big rotator cuff tear that's going to go oh it's just going to give way and then we know that something significant is going on now we do internal rotation pushing in now that you can see how your pecs fired internal notation is a composite of both the PEC pulling across very strong and compensating for maybe a rotator cuff problem the subscapularis in the front so we can't really test the subscapularis that way so we had to it a different way put your hands on your abdomen this way push your elbow out against me and that is all subscap that is all subscaps so if you have a little even partial tear that's going to hurt if you have a complete subscap off this elbow will when you do that maneuver will fall by it'll just fall away you literally can't maintain that position so that's a nice good way okay we did AB we did extra orientation we did internal rotation now we isolate the supraspinatus that that elevator of the shoulder that's so important and so here we push straight apart and you're Rock Solid and that isolates the supraspinatus then but your deltoid is a little part of that so that's how we can then check okay let's check the anterior deltoid push against me here and I'm just resisting so I can stabilize it okay then push back against me so that you've got a great posterior deltoid anterior deltoid and now the lateral deltoid pushed straight out that's a composite of the deltoid we can see that firing but also the supraspinatus because that initiates abduction so so we've got good we've checked now the the for the shoulder we've checked the strength range of motion and palpation and look for any asymmetry now we're going to do some provocation we have to do provocative Maneuvers to get to more pinpoint diagnoses so in the case of a rotator cuff tear we can check strength there it's not really a provocation but if you if I abject U here and then externally rotate from there that's all rotator cuff and if that's weak as it is then you likely have a rotator cuff tear it can be the super smith it can also be the infraspinatus and so that's one then if

[01:30:37] I'm up in this position and I just wrote just relax and I rotate you down and I hear crepitus in there that would indicate bursitis if I cause pain there that's the impingement sign and that would imply that you're bringing the head up and rotating it and irritating that inflamed Bursa that's impingement where you might have a Spur that's that now A variation on that theme is when we come straight ahead elbows fully up like this keeping yeah up high and then push up against me that is your biceps that isolates the long head of the biceps that we talked about because the short head never comes into play it never tears and never gets irritated so that tests the long head of the biceps up there now we will cross over in one way we'll cross over into the elbow is by checking your other biceps which is the distal biceps and we we kind of we know that that can be if you have a normal distal biceps and a very inflamed long head in your shoulder this will hurt this is the speeds where you're turning your palm up go ahead supinate you see that really fires your biceps there good strong and

[01:31:46] I can I you're you're being kind I can I cannot break you and you can break me so we test that that would hurt and you'd give way if you had and you but you'd say it doesn't hurt here it hurts here so it's tugging on that bicep so that's a good good indicator for that then we want to look at your labrum that's a commentary thing that that entity that can manifest so the superior labrum we have a good provocative maneuver for that it's called the active compression test and we call it the slap test which stands for Superior labrum anterior posterior we so funky weird position you're across the body it's thumb way down and then you push up against that and that is Rock Solid now if you had a super Superior labral tear one that maneuver would just hurt but then it would just give way it would just fall away and you know firsthand about that um okay so that's the superior labrum now if we're looking for the anterior posterior labrum we won't do that because we don't have a I would normally lie you down and then shuck your shoulder back and forth but I can get approximate with that if you were sitting I can stabilize your shoulder and scapula by grabbing that and then I can push enter a posterior someone who's very loose I can move them excessively posterior anterior and then I can even pull down on your arm and feel that head go if you have that big capacious capsule where it's inferiorly translatable then

[01:33:17] I can easily feel that from this position and I'll feel it just open up and go down so so those are really the core parts of the the straight the the almost full shoulder exam and you can that's going to be about 95 percent corroborative and accurate based on what you've been telling me in terms of your history and why you have shoulder pain all right Alton so so now we have a sense of how complicated and nuanced the exam is so now let's assume we have the diagnosis okay so let's walk through some of the surgical treatments here okay um so um again let's start with the operation I had so a labral repair and um is the approach significantly different whether it's a slap versus a complete tear like mine I assume it's just a number of ports or how does it yeah it's it's um it's just a little more uh technically right to do and you need a few more little and we do most of these now as I was talking about the technology earlier that we can do these percutaneously so we don't need five big big I mean these are only a centimeter and a half the biggest ones are only about a centimeter a centimeter and a half but the others they can be percutaneous tiny little holes that we use little cannulas through and then put the drill through and so forth so so that's um that's right it's it's more just adding a little time you know it takes 10 minutes to do each anchor sort of thing and so you just add on you needed a bunch but it's also seems like the first thing if I recall that exam under anesthesia is crucial right yes oh I'm glad you mentioned that yes so even with a good exam remember that a dynamic exam you've got your your brain has been dealing with this problem for a long time you're naturally well not naturally you work but but you're muscular you have good muscle tone so if I'm examining you I probably can't sublux your shoulder I mean you have to kind of I have to kind of jump up on top of it to do it um the rare case is somebody who's had such long-standing instability that their body is no longer responding to it wow and usually I can get one or two subluxations but then they they tense up but I can usually get one or two so that's one uh subset but so yeah so the great thing about an examiner anesthesia is once you're in your position where you're going to have the surgery you've got a regional block where your arm is super numb and you're sedated so that you're relaxed and you can't control anything and then I can just it's as if your muscles aren't really there I mean they have a little effect on it but mainly I'm testing the static stabilizers in your case I could take it pretty far out back and weigh I could completely dislocate your shoulder out front so and that wasn't still hurts for me to watch that video yeah right it's interesting it's super cool um and so then you know then that tells me okay I need to be careful when I'm looking on the inside I need to assess not just the labrum which I know is torn

[01:36:13] I need to in the case of the anterior you've been like the balloon you're blowing up repeatedly you've been also stretching out your capsule you're still compensating well less well and less well with the muscles but you are compensating so if that is stretched down the front I need to know that in addition to just repairing the labrum itself I need to gather up some of the this capsule which has become too capacious and and do what we call a capsularity which is to gather and tighten that up too and that's kind of a judgment call when you've done a lot of them you kind of know how much to gather you don't want to gather too much because then it tightens them up too much um to that point and this is a caveat about an not well yeah unnecessary surgery had a lovely violinist professional violinist who had treated her whole family they're all violinist and she had been up in Vermont farther enough away to where when she had a frozen shoulder or shoulder pain she got an MRI saw a sports Doctor Who

[01:37:22] Saw and again she's 60 at that time 62 63 and had some degenerative labral tearing well he said she needed to have a repair of that which that she presented with what pain just pain is a little stiffness okay so just read the MRI it said labral tearing didn't really have anything else so said you need a repair of your labrum did a repair of the labrum she came to me about six months later in tears had not been playing for six months had these stiffest shoulder I think I've ever seen basically didn't move so he tightened the hell out of the capsule right and did a labral repair that in a 62 year old who's not an athlete would never be necessary it's just you know sort of UNIF universally true and um so I had to go in and scope her it was really hard because it was so tight had to just bit by bit release everything that had been done and release the capsule that was all you know crunched up and and tightened up even had to take some of the sutures out um to free up her shoulder do you have a sense of what her initial injury was even caused by I mean do you think it was just capsular I think she just had a classic frozen shoulder so someone that should have had

[01:38:39] PT plus or minus at most a single injection to reduce the inflammation as the exact opposite they get a complete tightening of the capsule yes and and there's a school of thought in Orthopedics that says we just don't like repairing labrums and doing capsule repairs in older people yes because it you that's the outcome you get yes and that's completely valid I mean it's completely valid people don't people I remember some people that I spoke with who said wow you know at your age Peter you're basically 50 you're having a labral repair are you crazy um now of course in in my case I think I don't I haven't lost any Mobility which is not kind of remarkable no no and in fact you know you and I discussed that some right yeah that was one of my biggest fears yeah and uh so one has to pay extra attention to that for me um in if we want to be specific about your case as just a case example

[01:39:32] I don't think we had a choice because you your subluxation you're so active your subluxation with all the different activities we you already had some arthritis you're already wearing down some cartilage I mean it's it's going to be it's either that or the inevitability of having a shoulder replacement in another 10 years right yeah I mean I think when I saw the a little bit of arthritis there I kind of wished I'd done it sooner um knowing what I know today I almost wish I had more pain yeah you know sooner because I I really had a ton of pain 10 or 15 years ago but with a lot of good tissue work and a lot of training I kind of got out of it yeah and I made some modifications like there were certain things I just decided I couldn't do um but yeah but but I think that's interesting so and okay so another component of that is especially now people are so much younger mainly because they're all rucking now no um but um they're uh people are so much younger physiologically in better condition and we know that from whether it's cancer treatments and everything else and the advancements of science that a 50 year old now that would have applied to that data that we have you know years ago is just misleading yeah so I base it on I mean you're you're over kind of an outlier yeah you base it on biological age chronological age and even look there are some people that have I'll I'll scope them they'll I'll say look I don't have any other way than looking and seeing what's there and in some cases they have better cartilage than what the MRI is indicating or the and then I can go ahead and do a repair and some of them are

[01:41:12] I've done a couple I mean maybe I shouldn't say this on air I've done a couple of like 58 year olds 60 year olds but their joint was pristine I mean it looked as good as a 25 year old they just had a discreet yeah labor care no to me look this is what I this is to me an extension of what I think of as

[01:41:28] Precision medicine which is we use evidence-based medicine which is incredibly heterogeneous to make population based assertions and general broad recommendations But ultimately the only patient that really matters for most doctors is the one right in front of them exactly and therefore you have to be able to make evidence informed decisions based on the appropriate physiology that you see and it's also a conversation it's a conversation with that patient not a unilateral decision it's it's okay what do you want to do what do you know about this here's what I know about this here's what I'm seeing with you and we need to say here are the possibilities and what do you want to do so how often when you go in for and let's just I guess just explain to people so the biggest Port puts the camera and do you have how many and then you have like a few working ports obviously yeah so typically typically since more of the pathology is superior and anterior although you had someone in the back you if you're working in the Superior in the front you go in through the back back the camera so you just have a good panoramic view of everything we have two different kinds of angled lenses so we see around corners if we need to usually don't need them from most things but then I can see the superior labor markets you know in general surgery we insufflate with carbon dioxide right so you're shooting carbon dioxide to blow everything up I assume you're using saline to do the same thing so you're just making that capsule bigger and that's a good point so I don't use I mean I've done a lot of these I don't use high pressure some people use around 50 millimeters Mercury pressure I use 35. and that means less post-operative pain it's less it's less yes less distension distention of the whole shoulder and so forth so um that's what I do um and and you can still put in little um retractors kind of pull tissue out of the way and so forth so that's just a technique I actually that's more of an extension of what I do in the elbow because there's a lot more Peril uh because of the nerves yeah but um but in so then usually you need two working portals in the front which are just cannulas that are just basically canals to get in with instruments that are long enough to fit through the uh through the and and do the work and then in the case of for instance a superior labrum we use a percutaneous right through the top just underneath the kind of right here actually where that Arrow red arrow is going and that just gets you to the superior late room so that's a little percutaneous you make a tiny little hole in the rotator cuff kind of muscle tendon Junction it just spreads the fibers apart so it doesn't do any damage to that and then you've got a perfect bird's eye uh direction for the drilling and putting in those few anchors in the top and then that's that's really it and explain how that works so you drill a little hole in the glenoid fossa uh what's the diameter of that hole Yeah so it depends on what kind of anchor you're doing usually roughly not more than three millimeters and now we're down to 1.8 okay even three same is Big Three seems big but you that's what you fit the the plastic or the um absorbable anchor in that you just kind of tap in with them out all of them you tap in with the Mallet and you're drilling into the bone you're drilling around here kind of this angle here and you have to get the angle right it's a very three-dimensional but you put them in so that you're drilling into hard bone and then the anchor inserts through that and so they're not circumferential no they're just straight in correct we used if we did them open we used to do them even with like a suture drill holes and a suit you're going through circumference so what holds the anchor in is it just the pressure you're putting an anchor in that is bigger than the hole and so it's like a nail yes exactly and or a tense not a screw it they're not a screw um there were historically some that we screw in but not anymore and now the the ones that are purely uh basically braided polyester those go in as a as just a the suture goes in and then as you carefully pull it back out the way they're designed they ball up and it creates a I mean they're super strong you can lift the shoulder off the table so it's super cool to use those wow that's so interesting so you have a lot of confidence in the Integrity of that repair yes yes

[01:45:55] I know that if I tug on it multiple times it's not going to come out and [Music] um I mean it would take a fully traumatic Force to do that yeah so before you do this I assume you do an exam of the cuff while you're in there absolutely so you go through and do a survey at the Joint you look at the cartilage surfaces from the nooks and crannies cartilage surface you look at the rotator cuff inserting on the bone from inside out and you can see that's being smooth if it's frayed if it's notably frayed you can probe it and you can see oh that you know actually has a also a nice guys let me see that because they're athletes a small almost full thickness tear then I may put a stitch or two in that to fix that you look at the biceps you can pull the kind of the biceps into the joint and see a pretty good segment of it and see if it's inflamed torn something abnormal there and you can see the tendon of the bicep really well oh yes to see obviously is it frayed yes yeah so how much damage do you need to see to do the tendoniesis foreign not not a lot I if I see a combination of of a modest amount of fraying and a lot of inflammation around it and when I pull it in the joint that extends further out then I'll turn it easy it's interesting I think for people to understand how much your eyes are helpful here right as you said yes when you look at these images and we'll we'll link to some images in the show notes of what these pictures look like in fact well we can include my pictures and just other pictures we'll find online it is just a very plain you know banal sort of gray white normal thing and to think that inflammation just shows up as like wow that's really red yeah yeah exactly and for me some people don't like to waste the time but I get a little electrical Lottery wand and I paint the internal and get rid of all that pink because it's inflammatory it hurts and that's part of one of the big pain generators so I just do that automatically now theoretically if you fix everything that's going to go away anyway but it helps them I think early post-op a recent patient I had I did um a pretty significant repair on and he after five days said I haven't had any pain what's going on it just did you do anything to my shoulder so I said yeah I did repair it but uh yeah but I think part of it is just getting rid of that inflammation and so forth okay so now contrast that with the pure rotator cuff repair right so um let's do two examples let's talk about a patient who um what is the most common athlete's tear which one is it going did we say it's going to be uh subscapularis or supraspinatus well so it it depends it depends on if it was if they're an overhead is there an overhead athlete then it's going to be supraspinatus almost always okay and sometimes it can be the infraspinatus all right so if a guy just has a straight up supraspinatus tear you don't even need to enter the capsule necessarily depending on how close it is no you do because you want to first of all you want to see everything you want to make sure that you're not missing anything which is common in the athletes there's a couple of interesting variations I'm going to draw some pictures okay so um here I've drawn three sequential axillary views which are a bird's eye views looking straight down on the top of your shoulder if I were sitting on top looking straight down so we've got the glenoid the socket here toward the head and we've got the ball out here toward the outside where the deltoid lives and then you I've drawn the this is the supraspinatus I've drawn in here on the top in the back as we talked about before that's the infraspinatus and then in the front is the subscapularis so these are the things and those are the three the teres minor which is the fourth muscle the rotator cuff it's not really a relevant player in the pathology very true yeah it almost never tears okay um this is actually really a cool way to look at it it's not normal that we usually look at them from front and back but the bird's eye view is what allows you to see how the subscapularis and the infraspinatus are stabilizing the front and the back while the supraspinatus is coming in over the top yes yes is the supraspinatus that wide relatively speaking yeah it's pretty wide wow so maybe maybe more about here here it is uh let I drew it a little wide there okay but that's interesting again in an anatomic diagrams because you're looking at it from the front it looks like a tiny little muscle yes but it's broad it has three dimensionality and that's about three roughly three three and a half centimeters of width going to back wow okay great and so um there's three different views the most common one is the middle one and that's because that's anterior the biceps is here that's an anterior

[01:50:35] Superior tear that's the one that the overhead athletes get a lot non-throwing athletes but tennis players um volleyball players um and weight lifters and that is is one of the critical zones where it can get rung out and not have good blood supply and that's where they tear that's where I had my little tears um on both shoulders but that's the garden variety one that's also the one that can be caused by the the the spur pushing down on it and and I've drawn a little a little Arc because that's kind of the tear off and then they'll form a little Arc of smooth tissue and you you freshen that up freshen up the bone and then put the sutures in that Leading

[01:51:16] Edge of the tendon and put it back just like you'd put a tarp with a tent stick back in and that's how you repair it you get it back to the good bony bed and you get that good biologic healing and that's a small tear that I've drawn there and they can be bigger and bigger if you can imagine and more chronic now the one down below shows the subscapularis in the front and that is the one that can tear in young people or older people based on mechanism so if you have a linebacker who has he's going forward at full velocity to make and then somebody is knocked into him and shoots him across he's got his arms out there ready to go and he gets eccentrically loaded into external rotation like that that's how you can tear the subscapularis the other way is people falling down stairs and grabbing the banister and wrenching back that way that's the common it's commonly torn with easy stretch got it an abnormal weird stretch where they're Contracting and then it's just torqued on it now this upper one is very interesting because we were talking about throwing athletes so when you the throwing athletes baseball player players and football players they externally rotate dramatically that's how they get their extra angular velocity to really get that that zip on the ball so they they acquire external rotation starting at a young age they so their arms are very asymmetric their shoulders one side will externally rotate to 90. the other one will go back another 45 degrees and that's how they get that whip one of the consequences of that in a subset of them is that as this rotates and follows this area around that area of the rotator cuff which is at the junction of the infraspinatus and the suprasmineus a butts up against the hard bony rim of the glenoid and they get an internal impingement ultimately get small partial thickness or even full thickness tears there so we have to be super cautious with those we have to repair those but you have to be really careful because if they lose 10 or 15 degrees of external rotation they lose they lose so where does the Tommy John fit into this yeah so that's the elbow that's the elbow but it does no it's maybe that was just intuitive since you are a good orthopedic surgeon is actually it fits in because a lot of people add torque on their elbow because they have shoulder pathology

[01:53:46] I see so they transfer they gain the external yeah yeah so that's why they end up if they have a little weakness or something going on their shoulder they will overthrow with their forearm and their flexor pronator Mass they'll overthrow with the torque and then they'll tear their medial counter ligament of their elbow it's crazy but true and vice versa if they have a week if they have a parsley torn uh medial collateral ligament that hasn't yet been identified they can overthrow with their shoulder to compensate to get more angular velocity on that because they can't uh muster it through the elbow and so so uh how many years ago would it have been the case that a torn rotator cuff was the end of a pitcher's career or a quarterback's career at the professional level great question I would say easily uh not more than 20 years ago probably even not uh 15 years ago probably 15. and today that's not the case no no no what has been the advance that has changed because I can't think of anything that could be possibly more stressful I mean to me throwing a baseball seems even more stressful than throwing a football because you do it more times in a game right so what has changed that has made what's changed this earlier diagnosis if people now and certainly at the at the the division one call Collegiate level and the professional level there's any pain is evaluate kind of over evaluated but that can be good for them I mean it's you know it uses a lot of resources but it it identifies these very early so that's one way so you get to them earlier so in other words quarterback pitcher says uh you know what it's starting to hurt a little bit you see a very small tear in the cuff you're saying it's better to go in and repair that than let it become a bigger

[01:55:38] Terror yes and no it depends you you'd certainly watch it carefully right and you correlate the symptoms with and that's why you know you should sometimes it's not the tear it's just some inflammation that's related to it if you can cool that down the tear is not biomechanically significant yet so but there are I've said this to many people

[01:55:57] I have full thickness tears in people that are minimally symptomatic and partial thickness tears that are very symptomatic it kind of depends on what you're doing and I think one thing that's kind of missing from this picture in the um subscapularis in the infrasmine this is how long they are so we're looking at the top but these muscles cover the scapula totally So when you say a full thickness tear you know I want to make sure people understand the size of the tear yes so when I say full thickness I mean like when we were looking on that other view let me draw that again oh actually I can just go back to the previous so when I've drawn the supraspinatus 10 and that perpendicular distance through there is the thickness the full thickness and it's it varies depending on the size of the the patient but um but it could be across the entire four centimeters it could be a whole four centimeters by half a centimeter yes so you could have but when we talk typically about when we speak typically about full thickness we mean the the depth of it this way so that you can have a partial thickness tear that's maybe half the tendon there or full thickness now if you have half the tendon torn you've lost enough biomechanics that if you're a high level throwing athlete no way yep no way um so whereas a partial thicknessed hair off the tendon yes could easily be ignored correct exactly so um so then when we talk about this that yes those muscle bellies are huge now the reason I you jog my my thinking about that is you can have if you especially if you have these guys are so strong like the football players and so forth sometimes they have that wrenching injury they don't rip the tendon off the bone but they interstitially tear at the muscular tendonitis Junction and they have that and they have a tremendous amount of

[01:58:02] Edema weakness pain but that will heal that will heal without any intervention just some tincture of time and some anti-inflammatory and just time to heal what role do stem cells or PRP play in any of this certainly anecdotally there are a lot of people saying look um you know stem cells aren't going to replace a labrum they're not you know they're not going to work there but you have a tear in the muscle stem cells can be valuable now I I'm not really aware of rcts that have looked at this but I also haven't scoured the literature on the rotator cuff data are there people running clinical trials on um on on stem cells in that indication so I think so I don't know that literature as well as maybe I should but it's I tend to you know go to all the meetings and I I stay fairly abreast there was obviously a lot of activity going on but there's a lot of terribly designed studies all around that are being used to justify using whether PRP or stem cells so one has to be careful to to extrapolate it to your individual practice and there's a lot of money involved in it too I mean I have patients routinely that fly to various places including Germany including and I'm not pillaring I'm not by any means because that they exist everywhere I just happen to know a couple that just got back and they pay a lot of money to get stem cells injected

[01:59:30] Farm things that we've been talking about and there's no data I'm not talking about the muscular tenderness that's different I want to talk about that but I mean let's say just a garden variety small rotator cuff tear there is no data ever there are some a few anecdotal reports where people say look there was a tear there on that MRI I injected PRP and it's healed it's gone

[01:59:52] I don't know what to make of those they're just one-offs well also do we know what the natural history of that injury would have been without the PRP of course do we know no they don't so we don't have enough of a series to say if you took a thousand people that had that tear and you did nothing and came back and surveyed them two years later this many you wouldn't see the terror again could we not know that we don't know that okay and and I have um one of my best scientific things that I can relate that it goes down to the Elbow but I think it's important for this part of the conversation is I was speaking right before covid at the AOSS SM the American

[02:00:29] Association of sports medicine these are non-surgical general medicine doctors who do sports medicine and they're great they're really knowledgeable to do tons of studies and I was speaking uh I was waiting to speak and the two papers presented before me were back to back really well done large numbers over a thousand patients double-blind randomized studies comparing for tennis elbow okay tennis elbow lateral epicondylitis comparing cortisone PRP and um placebo and the placebo and the PRP were the same and the cortisone was much more effective these were back-to-back studies different institutions and and it was informative for me because I've

[02:01:17] I've read literature our literature is replete with studies that say oh well you know it you know PRP really helps and I see patients all the time that have had PRP injections based on my current knowledge of the literature for rotator cuff repairs for um um for tenant ruptures for lateral epicondylitis certainly for you know

[02:01:42] Tommy Johns and medial epicondyle medial tendon ruptures there is I have a PRP machine in my office in Manhattan and I use it twice a year for what for when someone begs me to do it so yeah I mean I guess again not to be skeptical but I I suppose a doctor can make more charging for PRP than cortisone I mean cortisone is pretty cheap cortisone well one is covered by insurance and two yets it's you know a couple hundred dollars for a shot right yeah uh typically the um I mean in my office uh it's that's one of the reasons

[02:02:18] I don't use it is a thousand dollars and it's not necessarily covered and people charge a lot more some people charge twenty five hundred dollars for a PRP injection so until look I'm not saying that it doesn't someday PRP the concept is great as you know it has growth factors it's it's our own yep bodily you know fluids and so it's perfectly reasonable but it hasn't yet borne out to be a game changer now if you take someone who's the highest level athlete and they have bursitis sure Jackson PRP in there some stem cells whatever maybe it'll be better who knows there's not really good data on it but there's no downside to doing it the only downside sometimes I see many more flare reactions from PRP injected in the tennis elbow where people are really painful for a couple of weeks and they end up coming to me for either service or cortisone yeah they say I don't want another one of those I don't want another one of those and that's just anecdotal for me I don't have a I don't have a comparative study yeah I I I I and I probably need to spend more time in the literature but I really the few times I've kind of looked with some interest usually on uh that the request of a patient who's kind of going through this um I just haven't found data that are convincing enough even though again mechanistically there's a high plausibility and um but I think the problem is we don't have that Natural History right this is this is the problem is there's lots of anecdotes that say this injury was present stem cells were injected the injury is gone radiographically yes the problem is we don't have the contrapositive case we don't uh the best natural history study we have on and this has nothing to do with treatment this is asymptomatic rotator cuff tears is came out of a washu one of my best friends in

[02:04:10] Orthopedics kenyamaguchi was a lead on that article they looked at ultrasounds which was great because they're non-invasive non-cosely and very effective if you have a good ultrasound photographer yeah and they looked at the natural history of these asymmatic asymptomatic tears and they found that they obviously documented the percentage of of asymptomatic tears in the general population but they looked at them longitudinally and they never repaired on their own they at very best a subset of them stayed the same the larger the terror the more likely it was to become even larger with time and become symptomatic and become symptomatic a subset of those became symptomatic yes so and that's it was really well done it got a lot of pressure so none got better spontaneous correct okay so that so that would suggest that if people are saying hey here's my MRI pre and post stem cells and it got better that that would at least suggest that in that individual it might have worked if you had enough and they were done with the same as you know

[02:05:08] MRIs vary significantly from from machine to machine so they would have to be very well controlled yeah you showed if you showed me even 20 patients done by someone that I know is legitimate and they did that and showed comparative MRIs that even 10 out of 20. showed healing reconstitution and I'd be in yeah well I hope that study is being done I I suspect that there were a number of obstacles to it if it's not being done again it's always possible it's being done I'm just unaware of it um but one of them would be you'd have to standardize the process of generating the stem cell absolutely one of the challenges of doing a clinical trial is everybody has to get the same drug yes and if the drug differs it becomes problematic do you know how standardized the procedure is for capturing and processing stem cells yes none it is yeah so that's part of the difference between the different companies that bring the machines in it differs between the individual clinicians and so forth so yes that's one of the things that my colleagues and I discussed quite a lot is they they're it's not it can be apples and oranges um a couple other injuries I want to talk about in the shoulder before we move to the Elbow so the AC separation uh when does it require a repair when does it just get left alone and you're stuck looking with a little bit of deformation yeah that's great uh that's a great question because they're so common the injuries so let me draw a picture okay so we have here a just we've removed the glenohumeral joint and we just have the AC joint this is the clavicle coming across these are the two stabilizers of the clavicle one is that's the coracoid process and these are the coracoclavicular ligament and we're just looking at that end which is why it looks like a little nub in circle but of course it runs yeah it's a thumb that sticks out from that yet another weird part of that scapula it's got to be the weirdest looking room in the body right yeah and so and then we secondarily we have the acromioclavicular joint that we were talking about and those are the ligaments that are circumferential around the chromica vector joint so if you fall hard off your bike um and you sprain your AC joint we call that a type 1. he's spraying your AC joint you stretch a little bit and injure these ligaments and maybe even stretch those a tiny bit but it's not displaced but it doesn't look any different on x-ray and that is a great one those can hurt and those can damage the cartilage a little bit and you can get a great one that persists in being painful but generally they don't they go away um I did this recently on some slime out in Dripping Springs riding a bike out there and just a low water crossing just went out like like it was on ice and um and it that's exactly what I had and it hurt for six weeks and it was gone it's completely normal um but it was sorry that diagnosis by the way was just pressing right on it that's how you know it well I know it because by pressing right on it it hurt like heck but it didn't blot it didn't move up and down and I could lift my shoulder and I wouldn't I could feel it not moving okay so one of the things that we that that are biomechanically interesting we talked to the residents it's about when we're teaching is it's not that the clavicle pulls up it's that the shoulder Falls away these is the primary suspension one of the primary suspenders of the shoulder are these two ligamentous structures I see so if you tear them the shoulder kind of Falls away so that's why we treat it by wearing a sling and get that weight of that heavy weight of the arm off now down here we have I have a shadow drawn here's the ace here's the clavicle we have one acromion which it's sitting up about 30 or so that's where you've clearly torn the AC ligaments and you've partially torn or maybe completely torn but it just didn't distort it too much where you have you know you have a complete tear but it's only up about 30 percent that's a grade two grade two and that though almost all those can be treated non-operably occasionally those will again like the ones they can hurt persist and you might have to do something later but they're basically stable and when you treat it non-operatively is the treatment that it will return to its position with elevation sometimes but usually not usually it stays a little elevated a little proud but people don't really care it's very barely asymmetric okay then you get here where you have a complete it's completely up and we measure that by the distance between the coracoid and the the clavicle I've drawn it here to just Express that that difference there in the height and that is that coracocavicular distance if it's here if it's up to 30 percent widening increase in that space and that's the the great two if it's a hundred percent or more then that's a great three if it gets up to a hundred percent yep even those there was a good study done a long time uh probably 20 years ago for NFL athletes who'd sustained these and the prevailing wisdom for the doctors who were treating the NFL teams was that um most of the type threes did not need treatment surgical treatment but a subset of them did go on to needing it later now in reality when they're up that high and people want to get back sooner we have met better reconstructive techniques now and so you can kind of get back on the bike and you know if you're a professional cyclist if you fix them and get back on the bike in three or four weeks sort of thing so so it's a there there's a gray Zone but the type threes are that transition now if they are the other four is more than 100 cap yes and and then sometimes it could be trapped behind the scapula all sorts of other things but the the threes are The

[02:11:16] Sweet Spot the vast majority of the operative ones are in the three category and I saw a guy the other day and I kind of presented both options to him he's a he's a a athlete he's a weight lifter but he's but he's he was I think late 40s and I just gave him the options I said look one of the things you might consider and this applies to a lot I want to do is I said look yeah we can fix this we can fix it tomorrow or next week but you could also wait and see how you feel in three or four weeks I can do the same repair in three or four weeks yeah you don't lose anything you don't lose anything by waiting in that in that realm now you do if you wait three months or six months because you don't have the same biology going on um and so and he ended up not wanting it because he felt great um and so how far out was he from the industry he was four weeks when he started and the pain was already gone almost already gone he saw the trajectory being so good that he decided that he wanted to wait and the only issue that he's going to struggle with now is the the asymmetry aesthetic the asymmetry and yes it won't have a functional impairment generally not except if you're doing certain types like if you're heavy fly's heavy bench even people who rest you know do the um I don't do squats squatted but you know yeah yeah yeah but but a high neck high back squat yeah back squat and and and those could I presume that could irritate them and and be problematic so so there are some and so the repair here is done how yeah so this is where I differ from some a lot of people just get in and get out quickly and they will draw it here so if you have it fairly fresh and you have good ligamentous tissue in here then we do what's called a dog bone which is basically two titanium grommets and this is heavy polyester suture we drill through everything drill through the clavicle drill through the the coracoid and then pass it's just kind of using some little tricks past the suture up through pull everything down have your assistant pull it down you tie that over and it is Rock

[02:13:18] Solid Rock Solid and it and they really do well interesting so in other words you you sort of you don't do it by going back to the acromion process right yeah right yeah you go you get the in that you get the you line up the anatom ligaments to be in continuity again and then they can heal and is that a biodegradable polymer no so that'll stay forever and um so yeah and it's super strong and so you can really I mean you don't you don't let somebody go in a week but but you can depending on what their sport is you can let them get back at maybe three or four weeks certainly six weeks six weeks this thing is pretty strong where you can do most things before we leave the clavicle I only asked about this because I just had a patient that went through it um when the clavicle and the mediastinum separate I assume that's not as common no it is not it's way less common but it's it can be very problematic I'm gonna draw a great picture please because you know while you're drawing that I'll explain the situation this was a patient who um

[02:14:22] God I'm trying to remember what the what caused the injury I I wonder if it was a fall a high fall um it might have even been off a horse or something it's possible um but what surprised me was the patient who was in New York basically called that morning to say look I just saw two surgeons at HSS and they said I need to have surgery right away [Music] um and you know I guess it's interesting right there are some things in orthopedic surgery that are um are are a need for an emergent case uh and this very turned out to be one is possible yes yeah this is a a lordotic view basically of the manubrium sternum which is our breastplate there and our where our we can follow our clavicle across to that and we can feel the little Nubs right there at the base we can feel those sternum clavicular joints yeah exactly so it you can see it's even worse than the shoulder it's a very shallow joint so if you take a hard blow laterally hockey players get slammed up against the glass it's a common more common injury in that the football players the quarterbacks that get tackled by these 300 Pounders and their shoulders are wedged together like that and it just so happens that that's what the injury not to this extent but the injury that Quinn youers the quarterback for UT supper was knocked out in the

[02:16:03] Alabama game he's now back so he obviously didn't have this full dislocation but that's what can happen in weird circum stances and you that's what you were talking about the mechanics can be that and it happens a little more commonly in kids but it can if the the fall is just right and the mechanics just right it will open this up tear everything and then displace it behind the manubrium and that's where the the major you know carotid artery the vein lives and that can be a huge huge life-threatening not not life well it could be life-threatening for sure yeah so we have to be careful with those um but this one where it subluxes out the front those are also a problem you can see that they they there's nothing there's no way it's going to fall back into place there so either they stay out they stabilize and people just don't do that much to irritate them or they have to be reconstructed and I've had to go in and reconstruct these where I take a a tendon from the form and make a figure of eight across the front and basically rebuild those ligaments to hold it back and why do you do that as opposed to doing an anchor or something like that it's just stronger you need you need some extra collagen there so what is it about the insult laterally that will determine a separation here versus here these are two weak points at each end of the clavicle much more frequently you're right much more frequently here well much more frequently there but that's usually a top down that's usually pitching forward and landing and having it be that way the but what happens more commonly than the SC joint the sternum clavicular joint is just a clavicle fracture which are ubiquitous and that just fractures somewhere you know over there and then we fix them some and we don't fix others but and those heal uh but the joint that a weird little joint is very important it's not common but it's not rare so let's talk briefly about a total shoulder replacement I think a lot of people are pretty familiar with the total knee replacement and total hip replacement um to me the hip replacement has been one of the Modern Marvels of orthopedic surgery in the last 30 years when I think back to when I was in medical school that was a brutal procedure and today these patients getting total hip replacements I mean they're laughing at everybody else they do them outpatient yeah I mean it is outpatient procedure I still don't I have to save that for another discussion I don't understand how that procedure was so easy today yeah um first off what is the indication for the total shoulder replacement uh and then secondly let's talk briefly about you know what is actually being replaced and um what that recovery is like and what limitations exist after the fact that's great um it is a um also an outpatient procedure unless you have comorbidities I do most of these occupation and I can even use a smaller picture now because the types of implants we're using now have evolved significantly okay all right so when you've worn down the cartilage completely either on one or both of the surfaces then that's incompatible with with good function usually because of pain and you ask what is the primary indication it's pain I don't care I see patients all the time who come in who have the ugliest x-rays you've ever seen two or your point about the cervical spine which is so important they have no pain and they can do whatever they want to do as you know the the scapula scapular thoracic motion can give us a lot of functions so they're fine and I just occasionally they'll say Hey you know

[02:19:55] I'm going on a trip where I want to be able to play golf for three weeks or two weeks with my you know family maybe could you give me an injection sure give them a cortisone shot and they rock on they get three months four months of relief and then they keep going so it's only the very active people who need to be able to do separate certain things and age is not a factor right oldest patient who I I did shoulder

[02:20:19] Replacements on quite a long time ago was the um she was 97. and she was spry and healthy walked the streets of Manhattan up and down she actually still worked at 97 I won't say where because I might give it away she was the oldest and longest standing employee of of a famous prostitution and she um and after I did that I did them back to back and I'd see her on the street walking down 57th Street and she'd say hey Doc I'm doing great and she was 97 98 99 I lost unbelievable wow so and it totally changed her life because she couldn't use her arms because they were hurting so much so age is not a factor to your and just to be clear was her arthritis the result of likely a labral repair that never like what caused so much degeneration some people just get it it's no different than you oh so it's not constant subluxations necessarily that are not at all okay these you know some people just have I one of my attendings when I was in either med school residence he said yeah it's like a paint job you can have a paint job that's a Mercedes or you have a paint job that's a fort pinto and I'm not saying anything derogatory to pintos uh but you know the the quality of the paint job can what you're born with yeah and um so that's the main thing and that's the main source of garden variety osteoarthritis of the shoulder and then there are the athletes who are separate categories based on what you're wear and tear yeah okay so and the youngest you've ever done this on the youngest

[02:21:55] I've ever done a replacement a full replacement almost 55. okay yeah I don't I I usually we'll do a workaround I saw a guy um about 15 years ago who came to me he had he had pretty you could see it visually but it wasn't terrible and he said he was been booked for a replacement I said look you're a little young and he was he was about 48 and I said you're too young for me I I wouldn't I think we should at least give something else a shot I said what I would probably do even though the data is not great it's one of the few things

[02:22:27] I do that I know but I tell him at the outset that you have about a 50 chance of getting better and that's just a scope clean out we know they have arthritis they don't have instability and just try to clean them out and buy them some more time kick this can as far down the road as possible about 15 years later he came back to me showing me shoulder motion was fine he had his

[02:22:50] X-rays had in advance and he came for something else well so that was an example of what I you know try to do but he can't always affect that but that was just an anecdotal and it's worth doing it's such a minimal operation right no recovery so um and oftentimes if people have bilateral osteoarthritis they um they don't they don't need both sides done they're happy with one side that have a good one that they can reach out or something like that but an example of sort of a very active to our point about physiology and biologic age and so forth a really wonderful athletic woman who was an avid sailing she's sailing regatta's raced still at the age of about 75 she was still going racing all the time pulling lanyards Etc and she said I can't do this anymore I just can't do it and I want to keep doing it can I keep doing that and I said sure So if I replace both of her shoulders and how much do you separate those two operations by she was about four months apart yeah it was kind of more she said I'm gonna give up a year of the sailing if I want to get back to it so um you could do them a little closer together if you want um and she uh she's still sailing she's still so so let's go over the anatomy here of the replacement obviously there's two pieces to it right there's the the humeral side and the glenoid side yeah so um what uh well you know what let me I'm going to draw another picture real fast that will show what a arthritic shoulder looks like and then that'll help yeah under it small so in the little picture to the left

[02:24:31] I've drawn an arthritic shoulder not well but I've drawn it to make a point so it kind of the head kind of flattens out you have no space in there at all you get a bone spur down here you get some spurring around the perimeter of the glenoid and all of that conspires to greatly diminish the motion of the shoulder and and cause pain so they get two there's two reasons they come dysfunction because they can't do what they desperately want to do whether it's recreational or work sometimes and number two pain either one of those is a solid indication for it when the radiographic findings are there and if we do that then what we do is is go in and now we do these through incision that big you know uh wow it's just a very small anterior incision anterior incision and take down part or all or part or most of the subscapularis the 10 in the front we have to have a window in now we can work through the interval the space between the super space and the subscapularis but only if it's a more limited replacement and but anyway you take some of that off you have a window there you have retractors in and you use an oscillating saw and just take that arthritic head off of there like that and all the bone spurs then with that space that that creates you use another retractor push the head the shaft and what's left of the show what's left of the shaft away and then you get in and work on the glenoid and you ream that down to where it's all smooth get the bone spurs out of the perimeter and then put in this little high density polyethylene this is that ultra high molecular weight polyethylene exactly very durable I mean do you wear so it's the same thing that's the tibial Plateau exactly exactly the same it's great and then these have little pegs you drill holes you maybe usually cement those in just a little bit uh some are press fit but usually cement it in a little bit just that part and it just it's a perfect nice new Teflon surface for then this Cobalt chromium or whatever alloy it is uh for the head and you the you know the bone has a central core and you clean that out get it fixed and this is press fit we don't cement these anymore unless people have really bad bone or real Vision just press fitted into that kinsellus bone and uh and it's super solid the rotator cuff is kept intact the rotator cuff is still intact on top you're working around that reattach the subscapularis and so give if you're going to transect the subscapularis what is the least traumatic place to do it it completely within the muscle I'm assuming yeah no no actually on the tendon where it inserts oh you have to because you're reattaching yeah yeah yeah that makes sense and uh we leave a sleeve so we can suture tendon to tendon yeah but then we also put this heavy suture into bone so you get bone reinforcement and you've got 10 and the 10 in healing you also by doing that you maintain the normal length so yeah so the only thing I mean this is oversimplification but the biggest thing this person is missing is a labrum yes yeah and they don't really need it so what stabilizes this joint the fact that it's arthritic it's already stabilized itself unless it's a weird dislocating joint which is a different entity and you have to address that differently for the garden variety one they've already kind of stiffened up all the tissues even the so what does their capsule look like when you go in typically thick it's super thick super thick we resect some of it even it's so thick okay it's kind of space occupying almost and what is this person's in in a good case yeah what is the limitation on this person a year out from surgery yeah really nothing except heavy weights like

[02:28:11] I don't want people doing bench press I don't want them doing the you know Iron Cross type things and they're usually not I had one patient can they throw a ball yeah yeah I think through a ball no they can play catch I'm sorry catch with their grandkids and play catch with their grandkids for sure uh they can play tennis they can play tennis and play tennis and play golf they shoot a basketball yeah can they swim yes oh yeah oh yeah that's one of the big the big ones people love swimming you know later in life it's such a good General fantastic and they can swim until they're 100 and um and you can absolutely oh yeah you can swim till the cows come over here yeah so this is just another one of those game changing operations right yeah but it's a it's different than the hips and the knees the hips and the knees allow people to live in the world again these are Game Changer quality of life thanks yeah and I won't do them if

[02:29:06] I know I can manage them and kick the can down the road and just inject them once a year with cortisone I want to I want them to be dragging that arm in I want them to be saying you got to do it now I'm not getting enough relief from the Cortisone and do it yeah all right well let's let's pivot now to talk about another piece of anatomy down the arm which is the elbow um so let's take a moment and just go back to the anatomy do you want to draw a little sketch of how the humerus lines up with the ulnar and the radius very much so all right so the big diagram is looking straight at the antecubital fossa and then obviously the side diagram is is showing the arm flexed so walk people through what these these three bones are and then the sort of overlaying muscles so this is uh as you said the and that the front of the elbows here the humerus bone which is the arm bone is coming down you see it's a super weird undulating structure there which makes it intrinsically quite stable so much because there's more to dig into exactly there's all these fun little you know almost jigsaw puzzle pieces that stick together we have the radial head which is the rotating bone of the forearm and then we have the ulna which is the fixed straight bone of the forearm and then we have um what's what's cool about the elbow is the tendons that go down to the forearm into the hand originate above the joint more or less right a close juxto articular close to join but above it and then the ones that go from from the shoulder and arm down attach below the joint and this is the biceps tendon here the big biceps muscle here the biceps tendon attaching to the radius and we'll talk about that this is the lateral side the outside of your elbow and the the blue is the muscle tendon units that are attached there anchored to this little circle or oval and then the red part is where tearing typically occurs in tennis elbow on the inside of the elbow where our

[02:31:15] Funny Bone nerve is the funny bone nerve is the ulnar nerve and that's that's the green structure and cross section and then overlying that as the muscles the flexor pronator muscles that that help bend the elbow and and pronate the forearm and those can tear around in this region and that's actually where we get golfer's elbow and what it's known as golfer's elbow which is medial epicondylitis medial and then the lateral side which is the tennis elbow is lateral epicondylitis and those are the most these three the biceps tendon and these two are the most common tendon injuries by far the fourth Which is less common is shown in the lateral which is the triceps coming down and attaching to the tip of our elbow we talked about the Bursa before and there is a bursa right here that lives over the tip of our elbow and we can get the big golf ball size of filling of fluid and that's the olecranon bursa and so um I think it's beyond what we're talking about today to go into the fractures but any parts of these can be broken and the elbow is a very finicky joint you can see because of the stable because of those undulating surfaces but because they're undulating there's less wiggle room there's less and and there they if you don't get those things perfect when you fix them they can quickly lead to arthritis and some of the even the subtle fracture patterns that happen and aren't seen or appreciated can lead to Rapid destruction of the joint so it's a finicky joint it is also oh I've drawn this blue structure here which is a very thick ligament on the inside of the elbow that is the Tommy John ligament it's not really Tommy John and even well

[02:33:09] I'll clarify that in a minute but that's the medial collateral ligament or the ulnar collateral ligament and that's the one that's torn and throwing athletes and that's can be a career ending except now because of the reconstructive surgery it's generally not um so let's talk just briefly about why the um lateral epicondyle if there's inflammation in that tendon we sort of think of that as the the injury a tennis player gets whereas inflammation in the medial tendon is more attributed to what a golfer gets of course people who have never played tennis or golf often get these things but it could be illustrative just to explain the the movement pattern it's great so those are not dissimilar from the supraspinatus tendon where they have a little ringing out and they they kind of can become degenerative and partially tear just like we talked about rotator cuffs there are tons of people walking down the streets with partial tears and those tendons and they're asymptomatic use patterns are significant for that the reason the lateral was historically

[02:34:13] Associated and called tennis elbow is because of one-handed backhands it's a much less mechanically sound and it's we have less strength with our external rotators than we have with our pectoralis and our subscapularis for forehand shots so it's under more stress and and you can get them at any age but

[02:34:36] The Sweet Spot of seeing treating This is 40 to 60. 40 to 60. now that that is creeping up to the 70s and so forth because again people are so active so that's why it's been associated with tennis elbow ironically now I'm seeing just as much in tennis players and competitive tennis players I'm seeing just as much medial epicondylitis which is traditionally golfer's elbow and the reason is because everybody is trying to hit massive Top Spin and and they are hit using their pronator so much more than they used to when we were when I was a kid and and playing I I try to hit topspin now and um and so that's a reason why it's stimulated more why does the golfer get it I don't play golf so historically historically even though golfers were getting it I don't know why because you're not supposed to be it's over hitting with your your trailing arm most people play right-handed and they were getting it on their right medial epicondylitis because they were overheating hitting stumps hitting rocks you know duffing and it was that Joel again The Eccentric load on these tendons which our tenants don't like but um

[02:35:51] I'm seeing now because people are hitting so much harder they're hitting bigger clubs especially drivers and such they're getting more left leading arm lateral epicondylitis in golfers on the leading arm I'm the leading arms because and that that's more logical actually yeah but they're just trying to hit harder and farther and you know once these you know big hitters are on there they're trying to mimic them and so forth so is the first line treatment for that rest followed by you know breast and

[02:36:22] NSAIDs presumably followed by Cortisone and things of that nature right um so the first time treatment is always is rest good stretching just like you stretch your hamstrings to keep from tearing them as frequently or injuring them as frequently and uh and usually just hands incense by mouth if they're on uh rarely do I use physical therapy for these formally because it's just not much to do but um if the if they're just too painful to even some people wake up in the morning they can't even straighten their elbow out they're so painful they're so spongy and really inflamed so those I still don't splint them but I have them stretch but more often because they can't use their arm I will go ahead and give them kind of a half dose of cortisone just to cool everything down yeah you injected me right four or five years ago when I was sort of in the transition of really learning how to control my scapula and had sort of overcooked too many pull-ups yeah and all this pull-up pain was translating into tennis elbow yeah um I was surprised and it was stubborn I mean I this thing I I came to you after six months in pain um but that one injection cooled it off that never hurt again yeah because basically I had already fixed the underlying movement pattern I just needed to cool the fire off is that a common scenario it really is it really is I and again I don't operate on I mean

[02:37:49] I because it's so common I end up doing a lot of these procedures but I don't operate on I'd say one out of five at the most 20 at the most most people get better and so operating on the lateral versus the medial side what are the indications yeah um the indications are the same failing conservative treatment a lot of stretching a lot of strengthening a lot of people get these in your case it was mechanics overdoing but a lot of people get these because they're they're getting back into something that they haven't been doing in a long time and they overdo it and it can be just weights and weightlifting but honestly it's something as mundane I'll see these after people have gone traveling for two weeks just lifting their luggage to look dragging their luggage around you know so it's all comers but the the the the theme is that conditioning if they've had it chronically not in your case of course but a lot of people come in and they're already kind of weak they don't have strong grip strength they don't have good tone and so strengthening is a critical component if I can get if they can squeeze my you know I have one of my devices they can squeeze that without just a little pain then I just have them do that first stretching and strengthening yep okay and and and sometimes that'll cure it and often it'll cure it then it but if they can't squeeze it without undo pain I give them a little dose of cortisone if it's chronic like yours was then it there's not that much to do you're fit you're you've got great tone and you've got full motion so it's only yeah give it a little booster dose just to knock it out we think sometimes we haven't ever done the study to prove it but we think sometimes just sticking the needle in a few times kind of stimulates a healing yeah I've certainly seen a lot of anecdotal stuff around dry needling just getting the dry needle in there I believe in that yeah and just uh increasing the influx of inflammatory uh cells and cleaning up getting macrophages to come and clean it up yeah so outside of fractures how often are you seeing acute injuries to the Elbow that ultimately are surgical cases so one of the common ones is the um middle age but very active fit person who maybe had a little antecedent elbow pain or forearm pain they didn't quite know what it was but they did workarounds and then they ruptured their distal biceps and so they get to Popeye muscle it's all weird and even quivering and they come in they go oh my God you've got to do something and um the cool thing about the bicep we think of the biceps as as being you know we do biceps correct it's an elbow flexor but it and it is a secondary elbow flexor but it's the primary supinator of the form so people come in and they lose when they when they tear their biceps they don't lose that much flexion strength but they lose most of their supination strengths so if they are used to Turning screwdrivers wrenches um even surgical instruments maybe depending on what they do um then it can be really disabling so that factors into the physical exam then doesn't it oh yeah yeah and it's funny they'll come in they won't be painful they'll say I think it's better and yeah I've got this but I can live with the deformity which I don't care about the deformity either and then I will pronate them to wrap that tendon kind of around the radius and then I have them pull up like they're doing a pronated curl and they scream and it's just you get it just isolated and that's a very good point about that and then you test their supination they didn't know that they didn't have any supination strength then you'd test their other side they can lift you off the table and then this side they can't even do it so so when you surgically repair that are you reattaching the tendon yeah same same place so it's like a tendoniesis yeah yeah it's it's it's great it's great operation so that's a good outcome operation oh yeah I had a guy on the other day it just looks just like you you know good good strong arms and everything and he's doing this all the time and he ruptured his and um he came back in for actually with his son and he said he said man if you need anybody to he said my arm is stronger than it's been in a long time and that's

[02:42:07] I'll speak to that but he said he said yeah if you need somebody to to call anybody to talk to him about how great this operation is just let me know but he was he said he was a lot of them saying you know I feel almost like I'm stronger than I was before well you're only putting it back where it came from but they probably had a partial tear for a long time they were working around there were little deconditioning their biceps they were compensating for the with their brachialis the big muscle underneath that and um so that and then they get even stronger because they have a good tendon again wow yeah we talked you want to just briefly talk about the

[02:42:44] Tommy John which again has kind of revolutionized Major League Baseball so when this tears um and this tears the uh on the medial side you look all of and in fact it's super physiologic torques that ligament is subjected to Super physiologic in throwers in high level throwers who are throwing 90 plus miles per hour it is subjected to such such forces traction forces that it will rupture and the way they keep from rupturing in general is by Fitness by Steady long-term Fitness and that's flexor pronator Fitness that's shoulder strictness shoulder strengthening and biceps triceps and so forth by strengthening everything around it you can protect that ligament and if you don't then it can rupture because it's being subjected repetitively over and over and over again year after year to suprophysiologic loads and um so when it ruptures it's easy instantaneously they lose they can throw but they lose 10 miles per hour on their fastball they just it just immediately downgrades their ability to throw that's so interesting because most of us wouldn't I mean like I don't think I could throw a ball 50 miles an hour so to think like does that mean I would go from 50 to 40. no or it just means I could never get

[02:44:07] I wouldn't notice it is that the difference you wouldn't notice it yeah so we don't that's the that's the common fallacy I have people come in all the time and they all of us playing tennis uh playing uh certainly golf throwing balls as if we're playing catch we don't need it we don't need the ligament so that is literally an operation that is only designed for the most elite throwers yes period awesome and that's a common misconception of course one of the uh so are there some shady people sorry to interrupt you are there some shady people out there that are doing that operation on non-athletes sure sure but more importantly and I say this

[02:44:45] I'm sure they have love in their heart but there's some shady parents too who will bring their kids in who say you know we know our kid has this great potential can you do because stories about Tommy John's surgery which this is not Tommy John's surgery anymore what was done on Tommy John was not the same operation it was the same ligament but it's totally different now but it's good to refer to it as that it's nothing the guy who invented it was brilliant um but um parents will come in and say you know my kid needs five miles per hour on the festival and because so many people like the biceps have had partial tears they've finally torn had a reconstruction in the game six or seven miles faster than they've thrown as an adult it's it's because they had a partial tear and never could get that

[02:45:37] Final Extra velocity and then once they have a reconstruction they can and so that travels through the chat rooms and lore and then parents come in and say hey can and their kid has no problem and they say can can we do it uh Tommy John so that we can get more velocity and you have to explain to them that there's nothing wrong with their kid's elbow there's just something that the kid is not destined to be uh you know Nolan

[02:46:05] Ryan yeah interesting so and it's it's with best of intentions but you know things get distorted um what about the uh tricep tendon does that ever uh what what type of injury will will uh injure that tendon to the point where it's coming off the electron but you already know it's what you you talk about all the time it's The Eccentric loading uh so it's they almost always tear falling skiing where they're trying to stop themselves from smashing their face yeah yeah oh wow yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah they rip off like that I see them every winter and how clean a break is it it varies some people if they've had chronic conditional have little bone spurs in there and it'll pull off kind of part of the bone spur and everything usually it pulls off the bone or leaves a little stub there and uh it's pretty clean usually but man it it's a the triceps is a huge muscle bigger than biceps yeah yeah huge muscle and so it's really disabling people can't even push up out of chairs you have to fix those yep I mean you have to I mean there's they're not ruptured in sedentary non-low functioning people they rupture an active people you've got to fix them okay so maybe now we could just kind of have you examine my elbow and go through all of these planes of motion because obviously you want to know how I'm flexing how I'm extending supinating and pronating and um my strength eccentrically and concentrically I guess yeah that's right and in the elbow it's it's very distinct there are very specific stresses you can put on the elbow that will guide you guide us directly to what is hurting and again it goes back to a lot of middle-aged athletic people have some changes in the lateral epicondylot candle muscles the medial epicondyle muscles some even in the triceps in the distal biceps you have to isolate those and make sure they're symptomatic

[02:48:07] okay so as we're discussing the elbow is a super weird complicated joint and there's a lot of things going on there so let's cover that a little bit and see what's what's going on so one of the cool things about as we talked about is that carrying angle and I'm going to look and see do you have symmetry do you have any swelling do you have any um things that look atypical well I can tell you one that's super easy to just to see if you rupture your distal biceps as many people who are doing CrossFit being pushed by people that are half their age in the gym and being pushed too much they rupture the distal biceps here and then your biceps Contour she shifts up so if we come right here and we look you have a nice distal distal muscle belly that's way way down which is what you want that level you're about two finger breasts will go up for finger breasts and it just it's disconnected and what's weird about that is it's not so if I test you in supination like that whether you have a good biceps or not you're going to be super strong and it's not going to hurt because that's mostly brachialis that underlying broad strong muscle that gives us our basic curling capability the biceps is cool because and we can watch your biceps because it's well defined as we go from pronation supination with a little resistance I'll just resist a little bit you go there you can see it ball up a little bit so it's Contracting and pulling up that biceps is the primary supinator so I'm testing that now if I have used supinate and it hurts or it's weak then we know something's going on right there secondarily if I have you do a pronated curl in that position that will hurt like crazy if you have even a partial tear of the distal biceps and that pain people say well it's not my biceps it's down in here but that's where it attaches it's way down in here it attaches to the radius and rotates the radius so that a super cool super great easy way to chest now if we look at the lateral epicondyle we talked about tennis elbow lateral epicondylitis that's down here very pinpoint you know people say how did you know where it was well it's not hard because that's where everything happens and it's right there the ecrb tendon lies deep right next to the Bone and it will often be swollen spongy very tender so we palpate that we can see it we sponge it and sometimes I can feel if it's a medium-sized partial thickness tear I can feel the defect in there just with my thumb and people don't like that you don't keep torturing them then with the elbow straight I have you pull up against me and like that and that will hurt badly now for some reason when we Flex this way and pull up again it hurts a little less we I don't even know why that is I've never been able to figure that out but both of those will hurt with tennis elbow and that's a pretty simple straightforward diagnosis now on the inside I'll use this elbow the medial epicondyle which is golfer's elbow is it tends to be even more tender and I think that's because the ulnar nerve lies so close to it and it's very spongy very swollen very tender right there it's a little bit different anatomically in terms of the way the tendon inserts so these need surgery much less but man when they're on fire they really hurt people can't even press you know it's this movement here that's what really causes that to hurt there now in your case and we're going to talk about the nerves I think later but you have I want to feel your nerve and I can you can see that I can roll your ulnar nerve the funny bone nerve up over that medial epicondyle bone so you have a very mobile ulnar nerve and we'll talk about that a little more but but that's that's a normal variant and that's just what it is and that's fine um okay let's see now very importantly in the elbow we want to look at range of motion it's very common for athletes long time weight lifters football players you know all sorts of people to have a contracture of the elbow so you have nice full mild hyperextension not dramatic if you have genetic laxity sometimes that'll go back 45 degrees you don't it's just nice full Easy Motion minus I would call it minus 10 degrees at the most and then I look at your reflection which is normally up around 150 degrees and so forth again from that zero position very important to look at that we need we need we know a functional Arc is about a hundred degree Arc we can function well but we have to get up to about 130 to be able to get to our hair and face and and mouth and so that's a common result of minor fractures in the elbow inflammation in the elbow and uh so forth professional pitchers almost all of them have about a 15 to 20 degree elbow contracture from all the loads that have been put on the elbow and they're functional they're fine um we're going to talk about the nerves later so that's really the oh the triceps so the triceps attaches here on the olecranon and you've got a big well-developed triceps here and we've got we've got your your triceps inserting there now we can watch that and people who are doing a lot of weight lifting especially if they've been out of it for a long time or they're doing a lot of push-ups things that's where they'll get the triceps tendonitis or a partial rupture you talked about The

[02:53:27] Eccentric loading if if you land hard and you have that eccentric load you can tear off part are all the triceps that's a miserable always surgical diagnosis because you just can't do anything you can't even push up out of a chair you need that big triceps so we look at that now if you just have tendonitis what I'll do is

[02:53:48] I'll hyperflex and then have you push against me like this push hard that hurts like crazy if you have any inflammation there because there's such a biomechanical disadvantage when it's trying to extend from a very flexed position um you know better than me and so what do you think is the ideal since you do a lot of this and talk to a lot of your patients about it what do you think is the I don't know the answer to this the ideal position for doing triceps workouts I mean I think the the literature actually suggests that you you want to be in a an extended position of the humerus okay it reflects positions right you want a humeral flexed so that to stretch the stretches the tricep to be under a stretch so it's better than doing them down here correct interesting okay so basically if you're on your back doing like a skull crusher or if you're using a pulley you're doing it kind of overhead okay that's that's informative assumes your shoulders can tolerate it so for example when I was recovering from my surgery I the only thing I could do down here I'm having a towel between my arms yeah yeah I'm doing this way yeah I'm doing this way okay all right so it's really just a function okay that's that's great I did not know that and I had I hadn't even uh really thought about that before that's good to know okay um so that's that's pretty much all of the the muscle tendon units that are commonly injured around the elbow all right so we've got the shoulder and the elbow behind us yeah that leaves us with the the hand and the wrist which is effectively how we mediate contact with the outside world and our extremities yeah um I I would say this to me is like a black box like you know I didn't actually do a rotation in Orthopedics or plastic so uh no exposure to that now in general surgery you do you cross cover plastic sometimes so you know new enough to know what not to do when someone came in with hand trauma right but it's obviously a highly specialized field uh you've done a fellowship just in hand right right it basically seems anybody who wants to operate on the hand has to not only complete the Orthopedics program or Plastics program but then go completely do that dedicated program that's right yeah I mean it's it's I suppose you could pick it up but to be able to do that in a certainly a a big city or a dense metropolitan area you would need to have Fellowship training and it's just there's so much as you as we've talked about before just like in the shoulder just like in biologics just like in everything you do there's such an explosion of information and it's hard to keep track of everything what before we get into the hand what do we know today about the hand in terms of repair or injury that you didn't know when you finished residency or what and I don't mean you personally but I just mean wasn't known then that is known today you know that's that's a fascinating topic because before well before I started starting in the 50s and 60s they had developed microvascular techniques and that's really the that was the Holy Grail of so much in the hand you could have a a laceration or a war injury or something and there really wasn't much to do for many of those injuries especially nerve and blood vessel related so you would do a lot of amputations you do it just were not reconstructable and so the the war experience actually did develop that and one of my forebearers J William littler who was one of the most famous if not the most famous living hand surgeon for for a few decades in the world was exposed to that at Valley Forge and elsewhere during the war and that's how they that he and other really luminaries in the field develop these techniques said that brought us where we are today

[02:57:31] I'd say the most significant advancement since I graduated and went into private practice has been the hand transplantation the complete hand transplantation which is a very very as you know it involves general surgeons it involves hand surgeons that involves so many a huge team to be able to do that and to achieve that and and the results are mixed but how many have been done I don't even know now but it what as recently as five years ago only a few had been done so it's all been in these last several years that that these teams have been built up at the larger institutions to be able to handle that but even there it's fraught with Peril in that uh you have to have a perfect patient physiologically speaking and you know comorbidities greatly decrease the likelihood of success there and and it requires a huge investment for the patients themselves and so even a single hand amputation is not nearly as reasonable of an indication as a bilateral hand amputee those are the ones that generally can qualify and they have to meet all the physiologic parameters and so forth so it's it's you know I don't even know that much about it when my partners has been on one of those teams and he knows much more about it Lou Catalano and where is the where is the are they joined at the generally midpoint of the wrist right is that the distance I'm sorry for distal forearm right where you can get that you're beyond that transition zone and you can link up tendon to tendon usually and then of course the the nerves can be linked as well and so it's yeah it's fascinating so that's the biggest and it's the same immunologic process you have to HLA match these things because they're all categoric exactly exactly and that's as you well know and you know way more about that than I do because of the general surgical background but obviously the immuno immunological suppression to allow these things to not be graph versus host uh disease and it's it's it's a wild wild time really and and we will get better I think the other thing the only other thing that's changed a lot is that relates so much to the hand as you mentioned it's how we interact with the world is the you know spinal implants and the various types of full muscle transfers that can that can restore function in the hand for someone who previously had no ability to control even a prosthesis these Electro electrical prosthesis now that are linked to the brain and so it's it's cool and so what type of injuries does someone have in the forearm that are are there injuries where they will take a muscle from the leg or something like a

[03:00:18] Sartorius and attach it there absolutely yeah yeah and it's really intended to just give some primitive function back to be able to flex the elbow for instance or extend the elbow or Flex the wrist and so it's really more the elbow more than anything because most of these injuries that people patients can still control the shoulder can position the arm somewhere but as you know I mean if you just even forget about a very devastating injury but if you just have an elbow uh extension contracture where you cannot Flex better than 90 degrees you can't get your hand to your mouth to your hair to your face you can't do a lot yeah there's many many limitations to that so um and that's just to get through an average day not anything specialized such as playing an instrument or throwing a football or something so when we talked about the shoulder and the elbow um do you have a sense of what fraction of those injuries that require surgical intervention are the result of an acute trauma versus uh chronic injury wear and tear now obviously a lot of The Chronic stuff is on top of an acute event like a subluxation that happened you know that over and over and over again leads to for example my injury but um do you have a sense of like what that division is yes and the division I do but it it also varies depending on where you are in my practice now I took trauma call for a couple of decades but I no longer take so I see cold trauma that still needs plenty of surgery but it's not that um it's not acute it's sub-acute and it needs to be fixed in a delayed fashion so if you are in a practice such as a county hospital where there's trauma coming in from the hot the the whether it's Hunters whether it's highways and

[03:02:06] Etc then and you're doing a lot you're a much higher percentage of your day and your week is spent repairing acute traumatic often poly trauma injuries and I've been there and done that but the um in someone who has a a mature Metropolitan type practice that's it's more in the area 50 50. uh there's plenty of of arthritic conditions of wear and tear conditions of of uh whether it's from you know any sort of gem work or you know getting back into various forms of exercise or the weekend warrior phenomenon and those are sometimes injuries but they're not dramatic uh traumatic injuries and then there are the people that are falling off the scooters and the and water skiing dislocating their shoulders also all that Spectrum but the actual the the actual acute uh any and something as mundane as as cutting avocados I see tons of nerve injuries and tendon injuries in the

[03:03:09] Palms the Sunday morning Bagel injury and so so but but it's usually spread pretty evenly between uh arthritic and sort of sports related ruptures and injuries and then fractures and dislocations and ruptures due to traumatic events well if the Bony anatomy of the shoulder is a little more straightforward it starts to get a little more complicated in the elbow and it gets a little more rigid I mean the hand is really complex so how do you how do you even go about beginning to explain the anatomy of the hand which has how many bones does the hand have well you know that that even varies but if you think about it you have you have five fingers and you have in those each finger has three bones except for the thumb which has two so you there you've got the twelve plus two is Fourteen and then you have the the next layer which are the metacarpals and that's of course five of those and then the carpal bones which are all these small bones we we had a resident that used to make fun of hand surgeons who would say uh never operate on a bone you can swallow and uh so he was just in a fun way pillaring the the fine sort of smaller caliber things that we're dealing with in the hand and wrist region and and the wrist has the bones that are held tightly together and there are there are multiple bones there some there are often what are called coalitions where they're fused together so that's why I mean that it varies but the uh the wrist owns the one bone that is the hardest to heal in the body and that's the scaphoid bone because it's it's like a carob coated cashew it's almost all in encompassed by cartilage so there's only a couple of little areas where tiny blood vessels can get into that bone and unlike almost all the other if not all the other bones in our body the we don't have what we call anti-grade flow into that bone it leaving the heart going down through the arteries and the capillaries and going into the bone from a point A distally to point B it goes in retrograde so if you if you crack that bone in the middle at

[03:05:26] Baseline it has very little blood supply then you crack it and you probably disrupt the Bloods exactly and so there's a high risk of non-union it takes the average bone in the body in an adult takes um six weeks to heal and these generally take 10 12 weeks to heal the skateboard and what's the common injury that breaks

[03:05:46] Escape way yeah there's there it's mainly a hard fall with the just the right position of the wrist where it's leveraging on that and it's that scaphoid spans the two rows of bones in the wrist that we call the the distal row and the proximal row of these arcs of Bones and um and it spans that so it gets leveraged on in a certain way with certain positions and then a directed

[03:06:10] Force usually it's a wrist extension Force and does that patient typically present with a lot of pain or that's a great question so no often they know they injured their wrist and they'll get some swelling there but it's not that bad and there's nothing there's no great Distortion of the wrist so that's not when you when you fracture your distal radius and it swells up like it swells up and it looks like a dinner fork and you know something's wrong and you you know you you sometimes people get lightheaded and pass out and they just look at their wrist yeah this doesn't happen with the scaphoid and and it's often young athletes right so they don't they are you taking off they Shake It

[03:06:46] Off they're used to pain and then they come in often they'll come in at six weeks they can't lift weights they can't do a clean and jerk they can't shuck somebody you know on the offensive line and then that then they get evaluated and and we find the skateboard fracture and we've already lost six weeks there and if am I remembering correctly is the scaphoid fracture the one that's really easy to miss on an X-ray you kind of need the MRI to see it yeah yeah or is it a CT which one is the Mr modality

[03:07:14] MRIs is where we detect occult hidden um fractures of the scaphoid and and why is that by the way because normally CT is the Imaging of choice for bone great question it's just that you don't have enough but it's not big enough yeah and so we can see so you're looking for the signal yeah yeah you're looking for the fat signal yeah um yeah that that's and I and I've I've seen a number of people who have had that issue missed and a lot of times they don't even necessarily tie it back to the fall right right it's been long enough so so what is the treatment plan for that patient so it's evolved a little historically we treated all of these non-operatively and then there was a period uh when uh actually an

[03:07:58] Australian fellow named Herbert came up with a really ingenious screw that was had two sets of threads on it and they were different pitch so when you'd screw it down the middle of the bone and turn it and when it engaged both bones it would actually compress them together because they were different pitch and that was called the

[03:08:19] Herbert's crew and that was a game changer for us to be able to treat especially athletes and show folks where this bone is and where you access it operatively right so the um there are different schools of thought on that when I was coming out of training uh everybody made an incision down here to fix these in a full incision to expose everything and you had jigs that you can put those screws down I do almost all of mine percutaneously through it I mean literally an incision this big and I'll go either retrograde often or anti-grade it's just a it's it's really a 3D effort to just get in the right position get a central core guide wire down and then and then you use a little um a little drill hand drilled to drill out that and then put the screw down over the wire and it's really great because patients already hardly feel that they've had any surgery they heal very quickly faster and you can even start movement earlier so that when it is healed you already have your movement back so you're not stiff and then having to do a lot of physical therapy on top of that so what are there scenarios when you would not operate on a scaphoid fracture there are many if they're non-displaced then we can expect them to heal would you put a cast on or would you put at least a splint we know that you can just basically as long as you immobilize the wrist even if you leave the thumb thumb and fingers free that these will heal then you look at comorbidities and you look at life um life needs so the athletes often get a screw because they just can get back faster even with protection the um surgeons often want to have them fixed I fixed a number because they just want to get back to be able to operate which they can do and what the time course to recovery if you let's just say you're in that lucky camp where the day it falls you're smart enough to to you know know that it's the scaffold and you go and get the MRI confirm it you have surgery the next day how long until you're um catching a ball again yeah catching a ball generally about six weeks operating if you're a surgeon a week oh wow yeah it's really fast as long as it's not contact you're doing it within a week right and that's the nice that's the that's the game changer really that we have now um you I'm going to go alluded to something that is one of the few things

[03:10:38] I do remember from residency which was the position to make this blend what is it about having the wrist in this position that you know for US general surgeons would be basically let's just let the hand guys look at this tomorrow morning we don't have to call them at two o'clock in the morning if this is a non-operative or non-urgent issue but let's at least put them in this safe position what is it about that position let's say so the essentially neutral position which looks like actually as you've shown some wrist extension but it's really neutral in terms of the carpus what that does is that um one of the important things it does is when we are in too much flexion and we see this occasionally where people just aren't thinking about it they just slap a splint on and don't really know that what you're talking about is uh too much flexion or too much extension then that increases the pressure on the median nerve and the carpal tunnel so people can get especially with some extra swelling from the injury they can get actually a acute carpal tunnel syndrome that can be quite substantial in those more extreme positions so a neutral position is great for that it's also best for function in terms of just if you're in a split but at least trying to get some finger movement maybe typing at a keyboard or something then that's a good neutral position I will on occasion if I have to mobilize someone I will uh and they have a unique a musician for example I will immobilize them in the position they need for instance to be able to at least play their electric bass I just had a patient the other day who plays both upright bass and electric bass and so he asked me I said well how are you just playing

[03:12:17] Electro bass he said fine I said then show me the position of your hand I'll put you in that split in that position so so he's able to keep playing and even doing gigs that way so um you know it's everybody's different um but it's an important consideration all right so what do we need to understand about the anatomy of the radial bone the ulnar bone and these two big nerves I'm guessing the median nerve if I recall runs there in the ulnar nerve runs yes on the pinky side correct that's right and we'll we'll go we'll see that in our exam shortly but yes and then the third nerve which is completes the hand is the radial nerve and that's purely sensory along here but it is important and provides sensory on the back side of the hand and the thumb and most of the back side of the hand but the owner nerve um you're right and both of those are at risk for lacerations um for um and they're at risk even when you distort the anatomy with through a fracture and so those are the two big ones I I kind of remember the median nerve being bigger than I expected what's the approximate size of the median nerve yeah so it's it's a it's an oval shape and cross-section and it it varies obviously like it's about three or four millimeters wide two millimeters deep right even even bigger that would be you know a smaller petite person would have about that size and I've seen them as large as almost a centimeter wide and four or five millimeters thick in a large hand oh yeah I mean just insane which I guess speaks to the innervation right of this unbelievable part of our body that occupies so much of our homunculus right yes yeah so I've always said this because uh you and I've talked about this that I've in terms of using meaningful hand use is so important for cognitive development and well-being and sick over 60 percent of our higher cortical neurons are devoted just to our hand through the homunculus and you know you've seen that homunculus

[03:14:17] I know you and I've seen it many times but it's yeah we'll link to a picture of that big ears um and you know big eyes but huge hands and then a tiny torso you know a little shriveled up tiny torso and so that's what's super cool so yes I mean we we need to keep using our hands to keep our minds vital in whatever form we're doing and actually some great Studies have been done on that to show what's the effect of just typing at a keyboard and it doesn't stimulate our our cortex very much at all uh typing nor does texting handwriting which is an art form even though it doesn't feel like it for for many of us but handwriting still does stimulate our brain they did a study a long time ago at University of uh I believe it's in

[03:15:07] Virginia I think or maybe Indiana and they looked at kids who were asked to handwrite versus type the answers to essay questions and the kids who were handwriting used longer sentences bigger words more ideas and and produce it faster than the kids who were typing and there and they were measuring their cortical activity in their Court activity was way more with the handwriting that's digression but it's important to your point that that there's so many nerve endings concentrated in our hands that we really need to to keep them functioning and get them back to function as quickly as possible so you mentioned already the carpal tunnel let's talk about what this carpal tunnel syndrome is it's come up a couple of times and obviously there's there's technically what's carpal tunnel syndrome and then there's the symptoms of it which can be produced by compression or injury elsewhere but what creates the tunnel per se yeah so it's great it's super cool when you look in cross-section if you if you took a cross-section through the hand right here the the carpal tunnel is created by a Roman arch of Bones just like the

[03:16:17] Roman arches where that Central core I can't remember the name of the bone Keystone maybe uh it wedges in and keeps that Arch intact and that's exactly what we have in the reverse then we have a tie bar across the top which is a very thick transverse carpal ligament and it holds that together and that creates a a just a U-shaped parabolic inverted

[03:16:40] Parabola tunnel through which the nine flexor tendons and the median nerve pass in a k occasionally a medium-sized artery now explain why there are nine flexor tendons right so there's two to each finger lesser finger and then there's only one to the thumb and uh and those are it's it's fascinating to to look into that and see it just so happens that uh um position wise if we look at our hip Palm up the median nerve is running down almost the center of the wrist and it is the most superficial so that if we then Flex our wrist down those flexor tendons are trying to bow string down they will press that median nerve up against that rigid transverse carpal ligament if we have swelling edema inflammatory tissue such as in rheumatoid arthritis where that builds up that becomes a space occupying lesion in a fixed confined cross-sectional area and then it compresses that nerve the nerve the tendons aren't really vulnerable in that way but the nerve is very vulnerable to compression that's why it's such a ubiquitous problem and so from a motor standpoint the median nerve controls which function versus the ulnar nerve that's great so important of a question and and by the way there is some confusion people very often come to me and say I think I have median nerve I mean I think I have uh carpal carpal tunnel syndrome and and the thing they don't you know just because it's such a ubiquitous Band-Aid about term but you must have numbness and tingling in the median nerve distribution which is the Palm side of the thumb index middle and usually half of the ring finger if you don't have numbness and tingling there you you're very unlikely to have carpal tunnel syndrome however if you have an arthritic process you can without having as much numbness and tingling you can have isolated atrophy of the muscles the thenar the thumb muscles here that give us our opposable thumb you can have atrophy that looks like an indentation right there and some people can have that quietly it can be just a very gradual just from the encroachment on that nerve of the bone spurs that grow through the arthritic process so that's the exception where sometimes you can have isolated motor and very rarely in a younger person I will see where they have an odd motor brand which is the nerve that comes off the median nerve that goes to those muscles they'll have a weird compression of just that so a younger person who doesn't have any numbness and tingling and then has isolated uh atrophy so that needs to be addressed surgically as well but the the thing that fits with the carpal tunnel is that if you're pregnant there's a lot often in the third trimester when women are dealing this is just because of swelling just because of swelling the fluid imbalances that are going on there that's a possibility people who use Jack hammers or people who are cyclists and they're always pressing down and putting extra pressure on that area can get carpal tunnel syndrome only when they're cycling so it's a dynamic situation weight lifters can get it depending on what the style of what they're doing but the stereotype is people who are typing a lot isn't it yeah that is um is that a true carpal tunnel syndrome so generally speaking most people don't get carpal tunnel just from typing there was a massive class action lawsuit against IBM hundred years ago I don't know how long and they lost because they couldn't prove I mean IBM didn't lose yeah they lost the case because they couldn't prove that it was caused there was no data to suggest that it was caused by uh just using a keyboard however if you already have it absolutely that activity will exacerbate it and and er that's why ergonomics are so important you know sitting there how you're sitting I mean during covet everybody went back home and and worked from home and worked at a sometimes random the kitchen table or their bed with their laptop and their spot angle so a lot more of these both wrist tendonitis and carpal tunnel syndrome after that which you don't that doesn't affect the ulnar nerve which is the other nerve that we're talking about the ulnar nerve is so important because while our opposable thumb is critically important that's governed mostly by the by the median nerve the ulnar nerve supplies almost all the rest of the muscles small muscles of the hand and those we call the intrinsic muscles of the hand which are basically what allow us to spread our fingers apart pull our fingers together do these weird funky positions that we do like the intrinsic plus position there that that position being able to do that with your hand is almost all ulnar nerve and if you cut the ulnar nerve right here at the wrist your hand will do just that and you will not be able to do anything but but a little bit of that you can't so the so the flexors of each finger are all ulnar well the the intrinsic flexors or ulnar the extra intrinsics are split between the median more approximately in the form or split between the median but lifting a finger this way is intrinsic yeah lifting yes this way at the sort of the this knuckle level isn't all intrinsic and we don't have extenders extensors we or we do we do but not intrinsically we have well and not for the these level the MP joints that's extrinsic extension but what I mean the the I'd love to draw a picture of the finger mechanism I I it's made so it's just I I just find it so cool it's so much more complicated than biomechanically than the flexors the flexors are pretty simple and what's fascinating about the hand is despite you know being able to play Rachmaninoff or um a violent concerto or be able to do so many um build a watch yeah [Music] um the hand is actually more primitive of a strike it's it's still it's pretty much unchanged except for the opposable thumb it's a pretty primitive structure in the sense of evolutionarily speaking our foot is a is a fantastically um adapted and modified over Evolution to walk we were talking about that before when we started walking on all fours our I mean when we stood up and became bipeds our foot completely changed right so the is I mean I know we joke about it but is the opposable thumb the primary difference between us and a primate yes well it depends on high we're we're part of the higher Prime yeah yeah between the lower the lower primates exactly that's really and that's why you know we're not or once we were no longer arboreal where our thumb was in the plane of the palm and we would hang from you know tree limbs yeah then when we came around we could start making tools and developing our I mean and that's that's the thing our brains grew when we started using our hands and making tools that's when our brains our heads enlarged so I mean it's just so cool yeah so I I mean I can sit here and talk about the hand all day especially given how little I I understand it um so what are some of the other injuries that are pretty common um either again the the the injury you'll see more commonly in the 60 70 year old versus in the athlete the the kind of the wear and tear injuries uh what are the most common fractures yeah so yeah I think we would break it up into the acute traumatic events which are most often fractures but can be also dislocations and then we then we would say the wear and tear type injuries which are usually start in middle age and go on into older age and then the um and then the actual um well what was the third that we were talking about um we said that for oh oh and then and then the um the absolute degenerative arthritic types of problems that are inevitable for many of us and they vary among individuals based on genetics and lifestyle and so forth and so the fractures uh the most common by far is the distal radius fracture that's just the big bone of the radius now the radius the form is super cool because we already talked about the elbow we looked at that really complex weird undulating structure there the ulna that we talked about is the the elbow bone that we feel the prominence of our elbow and that's a straight bone and that goes down and forms the the bump here that we see on the back of our wrist and that's the ulna the radius is is is a curved arcing bone that is curved so it can get around the radius as we pronate and supinate so the radius is flared and provides the biggest structure at the wrist level and but it's much smaller at at the elbow level and so it rotates around through a fixed ulna the ulna never moves uh it I mean it moves this way but it doesn't move rotation relatively and and the radius just rotates back and forth so any disruption of that can dramatically alter our ability to hold a a bowl of soup or to to pronate and type and write and so and that can be disrupted in many ways the fractures the radius is is super common uh to fall and have a bending moment on that and it and it fractures and displaces and but then you can often you know something Falls hard on you you fall I mean we see them commonly and kids who are falling off the jungle gyms they'll have a both bone forearm fracture in the mid forearm and that's just another bending moment those bones break in half or sometimes they Bend one of them breaks one of them bends if they're the kids are young enough and so that very can very much disrupt the function there and so at any different point along the form depending on the mechanism these bones can break and when they do if they're displaced we have to often fix them except in very young kids that reminds me by the way I don't know what it is I I vaguely remember this from from medical school and I never saw them in residency although I told it was very common but I guess I just didn't do enough to to see it where a parent grabs a kid by the arm the yank him across the road and what what is that injury that's supposed to be pretty common that's nursemaid's elbow and that is a subluxation of that yeah that round radial head at the elbow and I had the um I guess interesting and informative experience to create one in my own daughter she would like to be my first first daughter I would spin her around you know like you see people yeah yeah and I remember spinning her around she was giggling and so forth and then I felt just the tiniest little weird movement in her elbow it kind of threw her hand and I saw her face start to scrunch up I set her down her face and then I I just had this Vision I knew what it was I quickly did the reduction maneuver so fast that she hadn't even started crying and then it just immediately stopped hurting and she wanted I could tell she was getting ready to start crying but then she had no reason to because it didn't hurt so it was kind of we were in that and remind me what that reduction is again so what's happening so the radius which is on this side the outer side exactly when you pronate and you pull and kind of give a a various moment it will cause that radial head just to slip out this way a little bit Yeah so the easy maneuver because the stable position is just you supinate and you put a little pressure on that you soup in it and then Flex the elbow up so this is the most stable position of that bone it'll pop right back in yeah every time now if you if there's stay out and then you go sit in an emergency room for eight hours harder and harder to get back in you often have to do it under anesthesia to this day I am still paranoid anytime I have to grab one of my boys yeah but I'm gonna do it and I'm always like trying to figure out if you're ready you're ready now I'm ready to produce it if I ever screw it up um so yeah I've seen I've seen a lot of radial fractures in in friends and kids and um it doesn't it really seems like one of those awful luck things sometimes like if you fall out of a tree you fall out of a tree and if you're if you slip on Ice That You Don't See and you're totally not ready for that fall it can happen to the best yeah there's there's yeah and then the older we get of course if we have a little osteoporosis osteopenia on x-ray and osteoporosis then it takes less and less Force to fracture those bones and yeah what breaks the ulnar bone does it ever break on its own so there's the most common one is a direct blow via it can be in football it can be a weight falling it can be um a door smashing into you is a what's called a night stick fracture and it's named for that because especially the the billy clubs in in the UK where you know that that would you know strike you when your hand was up and it cracks the ulna along there that's the most common and but it can often be fractured also in association with the distal radius the styloid part can come off it's attached to a ligament or that just they can just both snap at the same time and that complicates the treatment but it's so those are the most common ones and then the other one which is really more of an elbow fracture but it's the ulna is the olecranon yeah and that's a common common fracture and that's really simple I see those in very that's when you're you fall in your exactly you fall on your elbow the only other way you can kind of pull that bone off is if you fall really hard say snow skiing you're falling hard and eccentric load the triceps pulls it right off and um yeah I mean you're the expert on e-centric loading and I love the fact that you educate so many people about that because it's way more um injurious in a way what about the chronic sort of injuries of the hand and wrist that ultimately require surgical care yeah so there's there's you can break them down into sort of overuse patterns which are more tendonitis and if you have a long enough standing tendonitis you can start to it the tendonitis is antinosynovitis so those are subtle differences a tendonitis is just inflammation in the tendon and if it's beginning to wear and tear and degenerate you'll get some longitudinal fissuring in those those collagen fibers and then it fills in with some inflammatory tissue and then that can envelop the tendon and so you're getting kind of er constant rubbing and further degeneration of that you get chronic pain you can inject it with cortisone but then ultimately they can rupture and and depending on how much and how much force they're being subjected to and for how long it's been there so that's one then the tinosynovitis is a subset of that where we have these effectively water type tubes specifically in our flexor tendons and those tendons are gliding beautifully in there there's a little bit of fluid our body produces to keep them gliding smoothly and a little bit of what we call Tina synovium which is just a filmy structure that gives them some lubricating tefloni feel if that gets inflamed from overuse whether you're a violinist or a heavy weight lifter doing all sorts of things over and over again you can develop inflammation there and then that becomes trapped in there and it really hurts it can eliminate mobility and it can even cause them sometimes to lock down and those are super common and we can often cure them with just cortisone shots or rest or both but then ultimately a subset of them because they're so ubiquitous requires surgery which is very minor but it's important because the hand function if you have one finger that's really stiff whether you dislocated it or even just sprained it the other fingers they're all linked so indelibly together that actually it will make your whole hand feel stiff yeah so it's funny you say that so as you know

[03:32:56] I'm really obsessed with grip strength and all sorts of crazy Shenanigans and um um uh maybe about a year ago I started experimenting kind of like training sort of the way that rock climbers do where you're using think only finger strength and um what blew me away was how much weaker I felt all the way through my lats when

[03:33:22] I would restrict the amount of fingers I could use to pull up wow yeah so if if you just said do pull-ups yeah right you can use your whole hand do pull-ups no problem yeah you just barely notice that I feel like you know I'm perfectly connected from the bar to my last yes and now you say Okay Peter you're not going to get to use your whole hand or your thumb just use your four fingers yeah actually that gets a little harder it took me a while to work up to 10 finger forefinger pull-ups well that's impressive that you can do that because yeah I know exactly where it took a long time I mean it took it took a couple months yeah then I moved to three finger Pull-Ups

[03:34:00] I mean it's an order of magnitude harder it's crazy right and I don't think I've been able to I don't know I don't know that I even got to try two finger because I was still really nowhere near getting to ten three finger pull-ups and and so why is that because is I'm no less strong in my lats in my biceps and all these other muscles why is it that simply take and by the way it was the pinky that I was removing of all fingers right you'd think it does nothing why when I can only have these three fingers does all of my strength Fade Away I've never been asked that directly but I have a couple of theories on that one is and it applies to sort of the weakness I feel and detect asymmetrically in um let's say a rotator cuff if you have a small partial thickness rotator cuff tear well that's tiny it's not mechanically not relevant yeah and yet you can be quite weak your brain is the smart is so smart it knows it doesn't want to over stress that area so I my instinct is that the first reaction especially when you've never done that before is for your brain to say whoa that's putting way too much tension on the other one so I'm going to relax everything I'm not going to give you what you need because they may rupture interesting right I think that's probably the biggest explanation for that but specifically when you're talking about grip strength what's ironic is that the the owner nerve which is only these two fingers is much more important for grip strength than these interesting so if you have these if you have let's say you have an ulnar nerve that's completely in and a median nerve that's out you're going to be pretty strong still whereas if you have a ulnar nerve out and a median nerve that's still in you're going to be much weaker wow so just for people listening to us which hopefully nobody's just listening to this podcast because it's hard to but you're saying pinky and ring finger matter more to grid to grip than middle finger four finger thumb yes which is under the median distribution um

[03:36:08] I don't I I agree with I mean that that even just feel I feel like I can engage my forearms much more yeah with my pinky and ring finger oh yeah for sure absolutely why is that I mean it's Evolution I guess that's insane yeah yeah you know what it makes me wonder I should be doing these three fingers that's what I think that's why because I was doing yeah yeah oh that's I'm gonna try that today good report back to me

[03:36:35] I'll let you just learn that rather than me having to learn it that is amazing I I just you know I'm endlessly fascinated by what our hands are capable of and I think of it as such a um well such a force multiplier for our species right right right it's it's an unbelievable asset and our ability to carry things oh yeah is you know Michael

[03:36:58] Easter has has written about this at length in his book The Comfort crisis which of course is what has introduced us all to rucking um but you know other animals can carry a lot if they're domesticated and you put it on their back but in terms of like you know we can carry our body weight and our hands it's crazy I know that that is mind-boggling and and it speaks to kind of remarkable engineering and to think that a lot of that is is made possible by this opposable thumb as well is is pretty is pretty cool and even going back to the Elbow anatomically when you look at the Vitruvian man and and when you look at the the the standard anatomic position of of uh in medicine the elbow has a carrying angle built into it to get what to get it away away from our body yeah so we can carry more so we have a 12 to 15 degree natural built-in what's called valgus or away from our bodies to give us more area to carry heavy things with it's super cool so let's talk about the final category of these which are the arthritics and um here you have really two you have this rheumatoid or autoimmune form of arthritis which you know I think anybody who's seen patients with that recognize it is is just looks like an awful Affliction yes um where it's it's not only functionally uh impeding but also physically deforming of of the fingers and the joints yes versus the much more common

[03:38:20] Osteo arthritic which I assume is is more a wear and tear than just a you know it doesn't have that autoimmune component so first of all what's the distribution and breakdown of those and which one of those ultimately can can require surgical interventions so historically and just in my Orthopedic lifetime

[03:38:38] I see very few now rheumatoid arthritic and what we would call the the um an RA negative where the testing we know they have the the visible yeah the phenotype they don't necessarily have all the lab stories to uh lab uh um abnormalities to back them up but I see way more now less than I ever saw before because because the medical therapy it's just some biologics are so amazing they've been absolute game changers and keep people normal for such a long time so that's one thing but in general I mean when I started practice I would see

[03:39:17] I would have to operate as often in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis and those deformities that happen and you're trying to beat them beat the body to addressing the deformities so they don't get bad enough to where they really require joint Replacements and much more complicated recoveries and so forth so it's always it was always a battle and kind of like you racing a car you know you're just trying to get get just a little bit ahead and just do whatever you can do to to win that and now I mean

[03:39:49] I would say I probably see maybe one a month okay that needs surgery and it's pretty rare So and the surgery is because of such a significant functional limitation yes yeah it's always uh in in the case I mean it can be in the elbow can be in the shoulder but usually in the hand and it's a tendon subluxation joint deviation that then weakens their hand and decreases their ability to remain independent the goal obviously and to the point of what our hands do for us if we maintain reasonably good hand function we can remain independent as soon as we leave our hand lose our hand function we become dependent on others period and so that's what our whole goal is to maintain that that

[03:40:37] Fierce Independence so yeah that's that but then on the other hand then we have uh the uh the wear and tear osteoarthritis concept and and that varies among individuals some people have really good hands till the till the very end um and they have I liken it to a paint job you know on a car a cheap one we talked about that before and versus a very nice thick paint job that that holds up but there is a big genetic component I see patients come in that'll maybe be you know only 50 very young they'll come in and they'll already have a lot of the visible alterations not terrible functionally but they're getting the knobbiness they're getting a little bit of inflammation in the the joints out here maybe down at the thumb base and they'll say hey so what can you do my hands look exactly like my moms did or my my dads did and there's there's so there's real evidence to support that some people are more predisposed than others now the one exception is the ubiquitous about 50 of all of us will develop arthritis at the base of our thumb and that's that opposable thumb and that's the problem with that is it's all about biomechanics it has to do too much there's six degrees of freedom it's just this biconcave saddle joint that in order to come back and forth this way radial and ulnar deviation then straight up Palmer abduction that way and then rotating around and pronating in order to oppose the thumb tip to the fingertips it's doing three different directional movements and and this joint is doing this and this and this and it just wears out and so it's just subjected to so many odd stresses and it's unstable like the shoulder by definition

[03:42:38] Mobility yeah and so so what do we so 50 percent of people in their lifetime if I'm hearing it correctly will experience osteoarthritis of that joint yes in what fraction of those people will it pose a functional limitation that is you know not something that's just treatable with some Aleve here and there so we we know that obviously we don't know what percentage of the population that all of us as a group are treating but we do know uh what we do know is that we don't know the exact subset we know there's many people walking around with basal arthritis that never have pain they have some stiffness some deformity and they don't hurt we know that we don't know that exact number however what we do know that and we've published papers on this is that of the people that present with some pain about 25 of those which would be I guess 12 and a half percent of the overall population potentially are are going to need surgery on that at some point so that's four remember one-fourth of the people that present with pain and the thumb are going to need surgery and what is the surgical procedure it varies depending on what stage they present at and we've done staging systems and so forth but it's some form of reconstruction unlike the hips and knees that are so ubiquitous and so wonderful they've kept people back to their fully active lives by by doing them we don't have those kind of great implants for this that just does they don't work there's very high failure rates if a if a hip replacement or knee replacement has a five percent failure rate at five or ten years the thumbs are 70 failure rate of all the previous uh so what we do and was invented by my forebearers and we've modified them over time but it's basically doing a reconstruction using your own tissue and that's what's super cool which we didn't mention is because of the way our limbs evolved we have so much protective redundancy we have so many tendons like all of the flexor tendons that Flex the fingers also Flex the wrist and give us strength just like you were talking about with the pull-ups well you have wrist flexors that only attach right here that also give you that flexion and we and those all are housed in the forearm and then you have the extensors that do that and then you have some that are just we have multiple tendons that pull the thumb out they do subtle differences but we can use those and we do use those to transfer and to use them as tendon grafts now a cool thing that goes back to the evolution is if you look at your hand hold your hands out and and Pull and flex your wrist a little bit and let me see

[03:45:23] I can't tell from yours you can see here you can look on yourself you can see here I have this big tendon that comes up when I yes yeah so on this side I don't have one it's just missing oh I have huge ones on both sides yeah okay so evolutionarily that's the PO that's the palmaris longus right those are hugely developed in quadrupeds and horses and so forth a big important muscle well don't do anything in us don't do anything so we use that as a tendon graft all the time we just take it I mean just it's attached a little whipped

[03:45:55] I'm closer to horses closer I I knew that about me and uh so mine we're evolving away 15 of people don't yeah so does that mean you're not actually addressing the surface of the saddle joint which is arthritic in this procedure Point you're not recreating some artificial joint what we're creating is a pseudoarthrosis we stabilize it get it stabilized back on top in my case I take a little bit of the bone off to create a space and then

[03:46:23] I roll up the rest of tendon and put it in there and that relieves the pain and restores function yes so there's a high success operation very high success yeah very high I don't know how I didn't realize you could make a case that roughly five to ten percent of the population will require this at some point in their life yeah if their active obviously a subset are a very sedentary and don't do much and they're not going to need it and they'll wear a splint for the rest of their days yeah but wow but if they're presenting with the pain that's the point we don't know what the in is but other than being the general population as a whole but people who present with pain are active so would you say this is the single most common non-traumatic surgical repair of the hand um non-traumatic other than a well and even a trigger finger you could attribute to um so of the major surgery done in the hand yes by far okay by far so you mentioned trigger finger what's that well trigger finger is what we were talking about before where the inflammation of the sheath uh and then right in the middle here there's a series of pulleys and these are super cool I'm going to draw a picture if I may yeah okay so we're looking at the side of the hand yeah so we're looking at and let's just say this is the middle finger um it's the longest and this is the metacarpal this is the first of the three bones of the finger proper and what I've drawn here this black line coming underneath is the flexor tendon and that's the one that does curls all our curl allows you to do all your pull-ups and so there's four bones there just so people can see it I don't want them to miss the one this one is kind of hidden within the hand because that's through here yeah and so then there's the three successive and so if you just if you had a muscle attached to this and you pulled on it and didn't have those blue structures then this would bow string just like a fishing pole if you don't have if you don't put your the fishing line through the eyelets then it just stays way away yeah and it's actually stronger that way but you lose all the mobility so you you lose the capacity to really curl your fingers tightly so that's what they're gliding through and those are fibrosseous tunnels um and just fibrous tissue very strong and which you were mentioned rock climbing they can rupture because you're putting so much force on those in such funky positions and isolating two fingers one finger and so forth so I see that a lot in rock climbers but the the point here is that as you're rubbing constantly going back and forth whether you're playing a concerto or you're rock climbing you can get inflamed along that sheath this particular pulley here is down in the palm and that's the most common sight to have inflammation to where you can even get some nodular swelling in the tendon and that thickening up of that pulley and then it just actually catches and we call it a trigger finger because it's like a pulling a trigger on a gun it it it has that feeling so so that's and we frequently have to inject those with

[03:49:32] Cortisone and frequently have to operate on their ubiquitous and about half of them recover with just a cortisone injection yeah I always say actually more in the order depending on how if we get to them if you take someone who presents within say six weeks of onset there's about a 75 cure rate with one or two injections okay so the longer you wait the more likely potential damage you cause and the more chronic inflammation that ensues correct but we don't and this applies kind of a general consensus

[03:50:03] I think we talked about this before when we were talking about cortisone shots is in these types of soft tissue procedures we don't keep injecting cortisone cortisone cortisone because it can lead to soft tissue degradation and ultimately even tendon ruptures I've never seen one in my practice but we know they can exist and what do you use as a rule of thumb for how many times you'll put three three at three in the lifetime of the joint three in the lifetime of that tendon sheath unless it's very very broad usually you don't see someone back 10 years later who needs another injection but if I did I'd be willing to do that again because everything has normalized physiologically at that point now the other cool thing that I was talking about before when we were talking about the you ask about the extensors versus the flexors so if we look at the red but this is the extrinsic extensor tendon that will straighten up the knuckles but then we look further out and we see well that only stops that tendon stops at the middle knuckle but what allows what pulls the whole finger straight and it's actually this intrinsic muscle here that's tapering down and has a very thin tendon it turns into a lateral band and it travels from the Palm side up above the middle knuckle above that axis of rotation and then it goes all the way and attaches to the tip and so it's a super cool mechanism that through a series of mechanical placements it's able to extend the finger even though by

[03:51:35] Contracting Yeah by Contracting it's crazy I mean most people wouldn't immediately get that you have great biomechanical sense because yes by Contracting it's straightening up the finger it's super cool yeah and so but but it doesn't take much like if you take a a direct blow to that knuckle right there and that tendon just slips because you've disrupted some soft tissue it can slip below the axis of rotation then it becomes a flexor and you get a boot near deformity which looks like that you cannot straighten your finger up because those those lateral bands that are used to extending the finger have slipped down now they become a flexor just like you said yeah so it's super cool and and just so into intricate and I vaguely remember one sort of surgical emergency in the hand where where that sheath would become infected yes very good yes it's one of the few um really Orthopedic emergencies in the hand which is uh yes Tina synovitis and then it becomes separative or infected and pus in there and those people I mean there's so many nerves in our hand anyway when you get even a few drops of purulent pus in the finger sheath it hurts like crazy and you your posture is down like this you can't straighten your finger up at all and it's exquisitely tender and it looks swollen just along that sheath and yeah it's an operative urgency or emergency and how does how does a person get that infection it usually an open injury or yeah sometimes just a little it can even be a pin prick um it's sometimes an insect bite uh you know with a stinger um and often just a tiny little you know you can be like a um a graph if you're using sports equipment you get a little graphite tiny stiff graphite puncture how often how many times a year do you see one of those I don't see them as much

[03:53:27] ER but they they're ubiquitous I mean they're coming all the time well year round okay so we do an exam of the hand and rest now let's do it let's do it great

[03:53:42] okay so now um you know we've we've been talking a lot about the kind of the forearm wrist and hand and so we can go through some of the common diagnoses of those um again inspection is so important we look for swelling if you have what's called de quervanes tendocinovitis you'll see swelling here if you have basal drone arthritis you'll see bulging here if you have a a torn or radio collateral ligament then you'll see a resting deviation of the thumb and and it's very prominent um if you have some arthritis or tenosynovitis of the big extensor tendon through here on the owner's side that'll be prominent a ganglion cyst of course sticks out like a big you know well goose egg there on top usually most commonly right here um we look for atrophy very important we were talking about that before so if I look at your hand there's three places that look for atrophy I look over here and I see that that's plump and not flattened out and what it'll do is it'll look like a gaunt um you know face and then over here I look here this also can develop a an atrophy there I had a young woman a long time ago had never been reported who had traumatically very active athletic person had dramatically torn off that first dorsaloneurosseous muscle so she didn't have a nerve problem she tore the insertion right off of there which is what gives you that strength there and so she had just already atrophy this was at four weeks it was already atrophy so I reattached it and it came back it's fine then and very importantly looking at the thenar muscles we want to see a nice plump convex surface if it starts to flatten or even just be soft when you palpate it then we worry about the nerve not enough nerve signal going to that and developing the early atrophy so we look at that we look at the rotation so again we've been we've inspected I'm not going to test strength yet I'm going to look at rotation I mean a wrist and finger motion so we look at the full pronation full supination very subtly between individuals but more or less we're looking for 90 90 of pronation supination and then we look at the wrist and we want to see that you have roughly that can vary a lot but somewhere between 70 and 90 of extension and 70 and 90 of flexion we want to know if that hurts or if we feel crepitus that crunchy feeling that can indicate inflammation in the joint similarly when we're pronating supinating we're feeling for inflammation there if you walk in and you have a very prominent distal ulna especially asymmetrically that's important to me because and especially if you had a traumatic accident these are commonly missed there's a some thick ligaments here the druj ligaments and those can allow the ulna to rise and the radius to fall away from that and it's it's very disabling especially for athletes and so I see it in hockey players who take the slam and so I'm checking that and looking for that stability there as I as I rotate and watch it um then so we we've we've looked at uh range of motion now that for the thumb this joint right here the mCP joint uh where you have a skiers thumb for the ulnar collateral ligament and a radio collateral ligament tear though that's the most variable joint in the body in terms of varying among individuals so you have a minus 30 passively and you

[03:57:15] Flex nicely down to about 70 we look at my thumb I hyper extend a lot more but I only Flex down to about 40. and that's just everybody's different so we want to compare the 2 and c and especially on laxity even side to side if I'm testing this and you have a tear it'll go way over sometimes to 60 degrees 70 degrees either direction we know that's asymmetric and that's not going to withstand and need to be repaired fingers you know we we want to just simply see if you make a tight fist which you can you can really nicely curl those fingers down if you've had various injuries that's going to be altered when you straighten them back up if one of them stays stuck down then you probably have a locked trigger finger and I have to pry that open and then I feel and palpate I feel a nodule I feel the swelling and the tendon the tenderness and then we know that's what you have it's very easy now next we we need to remember that for a lot of overuse strain whether you're a professional musician or working out in a in a gym regularly or irregularly more commonly there's two sites where you can get the most common injury and you know this in Spades is the musculotendinous junction you talked about The Eccentric loading and as there's two spots for that there's one right here and there's one right here there's these short tendons that attach to the bones up here and you can get the muscle tendonjunction injured there and you can get where the tendons become the long tendons and the muscle that that um that transition zone and those are the two places so we're going to test those a lot of patients come in and say

[03:58:46] I'm having pain here every time I try to work out or play tennis or whatever or here and so that's what we're feeling for now I can test this you pull up against me hard as rock solid pull down against me down this way heart and that's great we have your thumb pull up this way as super strong have you spread your fingers out real stiff that's beaut very strong now that is overlaying into the nerve exam that we look for and that those are the intrinsic muscles that's the ulnar nerve if you have a bad ulnar nerve from here to here it's going to give way and just fall away and they'll be weak similarly I want to look at your thenar strength and have you come bring your thumb right up out of the Palm like you're a good higher primate and then push against me and that's Rock Solid and that's we see this bulb bulge up there and so that tells us that your thenar muscle and your median nerve are working fine um let's see what other common things you know something is simple we we didn't talk about this too much but so common and ubiquitous are just sprained fingers people Jam their fingers baseball softball working out whatever and what's crazy is you sprain these these joints and we can palpate those those and we can test them some people tear them but we test them they feel fine they're strong but they're swollen they're bulbous they tender and that can take months and months to go away so you just have to counsel people your patients my patients to just be patient with it keep using them there's no harm in using them the cool thing about ligaments is they heal with motion so we don't want to immobilize them too long that's a common Mis perception I see patients who have had bad sprains even dislocations and they they they're put into a splint they come see me three weeks later they're already stiff I would move those immediately maybe one to two days to rest them a little bit and then get them moving Okay so we've done we've done and and remember and well you know this and not remember but we were talking about the fact that we have the extrinsic tendons both the extensors and the flexors and those are muscles through here and then tendons through here all the way out to the fingertips so we we can isolate and find let's say you have a little you're cutting an avocado and you poke right in there you have maybe numbness along here we know you cut the digital nerve there and this finger when you make a fist this one just stays up like that and that that tells me that there's something wrong with the tendon then I I try to isolate that say what can you bend the tip and you say oh yeah I can bend the tip but then I say and that isolates the long flexor but then I do this and you and you can't bend it then that says okay you cut the superficial one of the two tendons there so it's really easy anatomically to figure these things out um and um I think that's about it if you have it we talked about the dinner Fork to form if you have a distal radius fracture across here it comes up here and goes this way I mean there's a true notable deformity and so we're you know the the population with your help is becoming younger and younger and so we are more and more aggressive because there are 70 80 90 year olds who are working out who are playing sports and we want to keep them going as long as possible because I'm getting close to that and so uh you know so we we fix those we get them back my mom was 80 82 and she broke her wrist put a titanium plate on there and she was she right you didn't even know that she had it and she was using it the you know two weeks later so okay so the final thing you wanted to talk about was kind of all of the nerve pains that can presumably not just wreak havoc down here from a pain and you know suffering standpoint but also from a diagnostic standpoint yes yes so so many people present with numbness tingling weakness or pain in the Upper

[04:02:45] Limb and it can be it can start from the neck where the the nerve Roots exit and travel under our collarbone through the brachial plexus in between the scalene muscles and then travels through our armpit and then comes down in through the arm and into the hand the and they it can be confounding a a perfect example of how confounding it can be is a is a now more commonly known although it's I wouldn't call it rare but it's uncommon um is parsonage Turner syndrome it's a fascinating study in that whole process from the neck down and the other term for it is a brachial neuritis as in brachial plexus neuritis and it's an inflammation of those nerves we think it's probably viral related because there's usually a viral prodrome

[04:03:42] Associated it doesn't have to be but it's an acute dramatic onset of pain all through here and then some what we call mixed plexopathy some mixed bag of palsy weakness numbness and it can be in multiple different nerves it can even lead to and one of the most common presenting ways is long thoracic nerve which is part of the brachial plexus and you get scapular winging so you you lift your arm up and it just falls down because your scapula cannot support the shoulder and arm weight because the muscle of the the um of the shoulder girdle cannot support that and it's super cool and and it and it presents as a mix so it affects multiple nerves because those nerves are more common up here and then they diverge into the different um nerves which I still you know you remember in med school trying to learn the brachial plexus and it was it was brutal because it's really complicated

[04:04:46] Okay so so these are people who show up and they you you certainly couldn't attribute what they're experiencing to any one thing that's the point like you it's not like they have one or two discs that could be bulging and causing that symptom it's not like they could have even transected their long thoracic nerve like a woman who has a mastectomy you're always looking out for that post-mastectomy it's like they would have to have six lesions simultaneously exactly and it just doesn't happen except with that so that's a that's a great lead into what the majority by the way is that just a self-limited thing or do you give these people steroids steroids yeah and uh the neurologists now they make the diagnosis if you send them to them and we give steroids and most of them recover completely a few have some residual deficits for Forever at least long term um okay so then that takes us to people presenting I have a ton of patients who present with shoulder pain and they may have a little something on their MRI that they may have brought in with them but that shoulder pain is actually coming from their neck from and so then I'll have someone who will present with carpal tunnel syndrome but it's there's a little extra stuff going on maybe some ulnar nerve in the little finger maybe some shoulder pain maybe some arm pain and the cool thing about diagnostically speaking is an intrinsic shoulder problem such as a rotator cuff tear or inflammation bursitis Etc usually travels down underneath the the pain underneath the delt the big deltoid muscle but almost never goes below the elbow so if I see pain that's in the shoulder going below the elbow I'm thinking maybe neck or maybe something else then um secondarily if someone complains of let's say they come in and they say yeah I've got numbness here but I've also got some numbness on the back of the hand the radial nerve is rarely involved in in association with carpal tunnel or cubital tunnel some and oh yeah my neck's been really stiff just subtle little cues that you can get by speaking with them well they could have something that I know you know about and that can be called double Crush and that is where you get pinching of the nerve in the neck maybe through a disc maybe through a foraminal osteophyte that narrows that little

[04:07:14] Canal it passes through and then because the axoplasmic flow or the the nerve tube the communication of it is disrupted or compressed it renders them more uh susceptible to milder compression down at the carpal tunnel or the cubital tunnel at the elbow so they're getting a double Crush now for those I don't treat necks other than treating them you know initially with some PT and maybe steroids or something and I refer those out but many patients will then see a neck surgeon who will say well you don't really need surgery yes I think you do have double Crush but you can go ahead and treat I can go ahead and treat let's say they have moderate carpal tunnel I can do a carpal tunnel release and they'll still get better they won't may not get all the way better though most of their car all their carpal tunnel would go away but they'll still have some of the upper you know nerve pain so the double Crush phenomena is real and true and that's another category of patient then there's the weird lower cervical um that I just learned not that long ago from a really smart uh Nur a neck surgeon is is pretty consistent at the lower level the C7 nerve root level if they have compression down there then that that goes deep under the scapula and gives them that deep scapular plane and and the problem there and what's been so great for me to learn this later in my career is I often would see patients will develop scapular thoracic bursitis and you can clearly get that from lifting weights especially if you've been out of the weight room for a long time you go back into it you can get a lot of upper trapezius periscapular rhomboid type pain from overuse and those so those overlap so you really have to do the diagnostic work and talk to the patients and listen to patients to to differentiate that and then of course in our exam we can we can see that too um and I think that's more or less what I would want to say the one patient that I would I think illustrates this how how complicated it can be with someone who had a bad shoulder fracture is treated in the emergency department put into a sling but then also may be told to do pendulum exercises well it was an unstable fracture very unstable and so the weight of our arm I mean I'm sure you've did that in general surgery way more than me the weight of the arm is enormous if you have to amputate an arm for a tumor or something and all that weight pulling on an unstable fracture well that put tremendous traction on the nerves ended up killing his ulnar and median nerve ulnar and median over out he came in his hand was like that he couldn't he couldn't uh oppose his thumb he couldn't do anything and I all I had left to work with was the radial nerve innervated which are the wrist extensors and the the supinators and I was able to transfer some things and give him back some pretty good function um and but it was all just due to track what was what was that length of time it took for the for those nerves to under traction die yeah it was fast super fast probably within uh I saw him eight weeks post-op so he was fully there but he started saying he started losing hand function at about three weeks within three weeks of the fracture and no one picked up on this no yeah it was it was pretty tragic yeah well do you want to do an exam and kind of go over some of those things as well before we wrap up okay great let's do that okay

[04:10:57] okay so we talked about kind of the nerve compressive neuropathies nerve injuries that can happen and so this is very brief but just to kind of go through the route of the nerves for your viewers and so if we look at your neck we want to say maybe you have some neck stiffness maybe not but we look and see and we say this side it goes oh it's I'm going to take it less let's say it only goes to 30 degrees horizontal rotation whereas this side goes farther than we say oh maybe there's some asymmetry there any tightness and asymmetry in the neck can actually cause pinching of those nerves come out of your neck and give a lot of neck pain but also pain down there you can go ahead and extend your neck that way that's great and then chin to your chest so I want to just basically look at that the last one of that is just horizontal rotation that way in that way and that gives me a sense of maybe there's a component of that then you know we send patients to neurologists to to look at the nerves the function they do two kinds of testings and electromyography and then they do nerve conduct action but we can do a poor man's test quite well Poor

[04:12:01] Man's neurologic exam just like this so we know the nerves come out of the neck they go through between the anterior and middle scalene muscles these these secondary respiratory muscles that are up here and they pass us through there and if I roll through there and you have a disc you will say oh that's sending that's going down to my left arm my right arm both arms so it's a real easy palpation of those irritated nerves then we look at that they're coming under the collarbone they're coming down through deep to your pectoralis here and then coming in through the axilla the next place I can get access to those nerves is here medially we know the ulnar and median nerve and well the radial nerve comes over here but the owner of median nerves right here so I'll palpate right up against your bone and see and that too oh yeah that's definitely giving me stuff here if if you tell me that is giving you numbness and tingling to there or to your thumb then when I get down here I know that it's not just carpal tunnel or cubital tunnel I know it's got to be some component coming from your neck it's a very simple easy way anything above the elbow is irritated from up here anything below it could be both um the and we almost never from your neck we almost never just see a pure ulnar neuropathy just coming from your neck easily there's something else like a little radial nerve a little medial nerve something else so then we come down to your ulnar nerve let's use this elbow because it's better so I want to

[04:13:26] I've already checked your motion and then I feel your nerve in the groove there the funny bone nerve and yours is as we said pretty mobile I can kind of pull it up over the edge but it's not bad now I would tap on that lightly and see does that cause electrical shocks and does that give you oh I don't like that now a lot of us can have a little irritation so we want to compare and see what you have secondly I want to flex up and see what that nerve does now you have a very well developed triceps I have seen people who are super Avid and that have huge triceps and throwing athletes as well where they are pressing their triceps is overdeveloped here and it's pressing up against the nerve so it's a different form of cubital tunnel syndrome it's not really in the cubital tunnel but I've seen that a lot in athletes this ulnar nerve I want to test and see what it's doing if you're a throwing athlete and your nerve slips back and forth you can get snapping nerve and it's really irritable you can no longer feel the seams of your on your on your slider or your fastball and so that is often needs surgery and even the weakness of grip now we come down here and then I can press on that I can Flex it up and hold it and if if that starts to cause numbness and tingling in your hand then that's a secondary you will have already probably told me yeah you know I get this I wake up with my hand on a nerve quite numb and that's we all tend to start out this way end up this way and the only problem there is that it that can happen to any of us but if it's regular and frequent and lingering or if we get it when we're typing or playing a piccolo or a cello then um then that's a then that's a different issue when you look further lastly coming down the form there's there's two more uh nerves that we can look at the ulnar nerve rarely is involved down here it's almost always 98 of time at the at the elbow the radial nerve comes out from under here it's just the sensory terminal branch of the radial nerve that does so much good work for extending our wrist and our triceps and everything and it goes goes down to here and provides sensation in this part of the hand and we can tap on that and and come down and then it will give electrical shocks down here it can be very nerve-wracking I've seen a lot of musicians with that you have a loose wristband on now some people wear heavy watches heavy bracelets and you can get that or if you've been arrested and they put the handcuffs too tight you haven't been arrested recently not recently okay and so um and so that will cause a lot of numbness they're really aggravating so we look for that and then the last one is the median nerve which is here this is the carpal tunnel now the most sensitive and specific test for carpal tunnel syndrome is just to put thumb pressure directly over that transverse carpal ligament I'm effectively doing what you're doing when you're driving or maybe riding a cycling

[04:16:14] I'm putting extra pressure and you're going to tell me if that causes numbness tingling pain sometimes but mainly numbness and tingling in the median nerve distribution that thumb index middle and half the ring finger and if it does then that's golden we know you have carpal tunnel syndrome that's that's and then the others that we look for are these tenal signs I'll go along here and tap and the nerve if you have bad carpal tunnel that median nerve can be irritable as it's lying in between these muscle muscle bellies and so we can tap along there and you get a to nail sign it goes oh and it and it sends electrical shocks that's the second way we can test it the Third Way is just to have you mimic what you would do and you the valence test where you hold them down like that and that recruit produces as well the most one is the most sensitive and specific is the one I already did but those are other and that's pretty much it for the for the oh this one other component is we always want to look if you have winging of the scapula you can do a push up against the wall we can see if one side sticks out and that's that that upper cervical nerve root the long thoracic nerve and that's really about it so so well the last thing I want to talk about uh and we've been talking for quite a while so I really appreciate you making the time is I want to talk about the musician treatment Foundation which you founded almost six years ago um in fact

[04:17:38] I feel like it's indirectly how we met because one of the doctors who introduced me to you in New York City got to know you I think indirectly through your involvement with taking care of some of the best musicians in the world and that led to us you know meeting and such and such and obviously I've been to some of the concerts you've held so um I mean just tell folks a little bit about what is it about music that has been such a passion it seems to be as much a passion for you as orthopedic surgery yeah it is and thank you for bringing it up thank you everyone wanting to talk a little bit about it

[04:18:15] I'm always happy to talk about it um the um I I was lucky enough you know we historically as orthopedic surgeons treat a lot of athletes and but I was fortunate enough to start my practice in New York City I was lucky enough to sort of inherit the caring of the New York Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Opera orchestras which are

[04:18:35] Mainstays of that of that classical music um Echelon really and then that and that spilled over into Broadway the musicians who are all manner of genres because there's so many diverse shows there and then the Jazz musicians in rock and roll and so forth so yes I've always had a passion for music and love it and to be able to take care of these is both very stressful initially and also incredibly rewarding right and they are they're like musicians and I mean they're like uh athletes and that they're doing this day in and day out it's their livelihood and if it's disrupted their their way of being and then their and their both their mental health and their Financial

[04:19:18] Health is greatly jeopardized and like athletes who give us so much entertainment in the world musicians speak the universal language of medicine which which obviously bypasses some of the horrible political infighting that goes on and it's just beautiful and the music of music and they give it back to us and so but if you're not in the

[04:19:41] Philharmonic or not in the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra or uh in a long-running show on Broadway you're a freelance and you're a freelance who doesn't know when your next gig is going to happen and you can't afford insurance and it's so I've for my whole career I've been taking care of freelance musicians and some of them maybe have uh spouses or significant others who have insurance so some of them have but many of them don't most of them don't frankly and so I was always discounting my my cost uh sometimes down to nothing depending on you know who it was and um or I'd take a a chicken or a signed CD or something that they would bring to me some some home baked cookies and um but the costs are absolutely exorbitant for health care right because you can't waiving your cost is one thing you can't waive the anesthesia's cost you can't wave the surges on our costs thank you that's exactly right and the average cost for a rotator cuff repair um is about currently just to if you pay out of pocket about the best you can do through a surgery center Which is less cost less Hospital there's about twenty five thousand dollars well the average income for a fully professional but freelance musician and Austin pre-covered with sixteen thousand dollars a year one six one six so they can't even think about it so this was what was going on for years and it was always in my mind always upsetting me and we that as a culture we don't support the Arts more and I don't need to get political about that it's not political it's just cultural and um so then I had my cousin Thor who's a

[04:21:22] Mainstay of the Austin music scene cut his digital nerve his finger he's a percussionist of course because his name is Thor and uh and he couldn't play because it was so he had such a neuroma that it formed and he didn't have insurance and he called me weeks after he just had a simple closure he said I can't feel my finger and I can't play and I said well you have you have miles and he said yeah I've got plenty of miles to that tour and I said we'll flop to New York and we'll fix it so I since

[04:21:49] I um know the surgery center and know the anesthesiologist I said look this is my cousin Thor I need to you know I need you to throw him a bone so they didn't charge him and of course I didn't either and so fixed it he was fine he was my patient zero if you will and that was kind of your aha moment that was the aha moment and then I'm lucky enough as you said to treat a lot of other musicians and know a lot of other musicians so one day Elvis Costello and Diana Krall were in and and I just kind of said hey look

[04:22:17] I'm thinking about doing this us officially would you guys help me in some way anyway I didn't care just put your name on a website or something they said sure what do you have in mind I said well you could just be an advisor or if I could just use your name you're so well loved and beloved and they said well let us be full you know full board members he said my only stipulation is I have to do all the voting because Diana's the busiest woman in show business so um uh so I said yes and in 2017 we got uh IRS uh and then Elvis said I'm going to do the first concert I love the Paramount

[04:22:53] Theater in Austin let's do it in Austin I'll do a two-hour solo show and we raised about a quarter of a million dollars with that and that was our seed money and people came pouring in here in Austin ham is a big organization that does so much for as for so long but it's the you know it's the Health Alliance for Austin musicians but they don't provide the actual care and they were struggling to get

[04:23:16] Specialists to actually discount their care or provide the care and orthopedically speaking having not having your Upper Limb your shoulder elbow or hand you can't make music yeah so just give us a brief sentence because I know you and I have talked about this so much because I'm so fascinated by this topic help people understand the physical demand of you know playing a violin or playing the drum I mean drums

[04:23:39] I know you see my daughter plays the drums get some sense of that but um a it's a very asymmetric activity but what are the types of injuries that you're seeing the high level musicians that are a threat to their livelihood well one of the things I say uh I've lectured on this quite a bit is I say you know musician are people too so they do all the stupid things that we all do to enter ourselves that's a separate category and those are injuries and they need to be treated though the the unique aspect of that is that they can't necessarily take the same rest when they've injured something and they have to be 100 because if if you're a violinist in the Philharmonic and you are there are 15 other highest level musicians waiting in the ranks waiting for you to screw up once a little shot and Freud there they don't think ill of you but they would love to have the opportunity to just sit in your seat your chair on the on the stage so there's all that tension all that stress of having worked so hard and then having it and you have to be 100 you can't be you can't like I can do surgery with probably three fingers but you know if you can't Flex down your index finger or whatever uh on the on the on the Fret then you can't make the music so that's one aspect of it and the other aspect is that by comparison they're not trying to jump higher hit the ball farther drive the car faster all the different ways that athletes like you are trying to maximize your output they are sub-maximal athletes but they but they have to be there repetitious yeah I mean you think about how many I think what there's in a in a standard NFL game they're about 30 passes 35 passes well in a typical one

[04:25:27] Mozart Violin Concerto it's 20 000 bow Strokes in one playing of a of a violin concerto and they do that repeatedly over and over and over again and to your point yeah it's a lot of these are very natural position and we think about violinists we think oh they're indeed their hands well their shoulders they are adducted they are externally rotated their other one is up in the impingement Zone which will see from our exam they're living eight hours a day doing this that is terrible for the shoulders and then you think of the drummers high hats in every which way they're going and every and going massively for three hours straight it's just uncanny that they even survive in my opinion and um so so it's very very different I mean I don't even know how many passes Tom

[04:26:22] Brady has done in his career but it's not that huge of a number right relative to this right yeah and so so anyway so it it we we were flooded with patients initially there was this backlog of patients who hadn't played for six months nine months and they were just fallow they were trying to get odd jobs they weren't getting any gigs they couldn't take gigs I had one patient the very first patient who we've talked about so I can mention her name Jennifer

[04:26:50] Jackson she's a great singer-songwriter in Austin and tours around did she play last year at the uh concert he did oh no no I'm sorry she did not okay she was on our our kind of our our movie about it okay and um she had bilateral full thickness rotator cuff tears bilateral and she came in she had already gone to try to see somebody it was going to cost her ten thousand dollars or more she had some very minimal insurance and

[04:27:18] I said look you need we need to fix these let's do it get you back and she goes well how much is it going to cost me I said it's not going to cost you anything and she just start crying I said no it's not gonna cost you anything so we've in in the five years almost now coming up well yeah uh five plus years we've provided over two million in dollars in free care to under an uninsured professional and how many how many musicians have had surgery oh we've had probably I've done um four dozen probably four dozen around around 50 musicians and that doesn't include the ones that I've been discounting these are the ones that we've actually funneled through but we've got hundreds of non-operative because a non-operative is just as bad I mean right so if you can get a cortisone shot in there and get them totally better yeah so we have hundreds more of that and um you know it's it's it's been mind-boggling and the cool thing we have an upcoming concert in December with

[04:28:16] Elvis with Rosanne Cash John Leventhal Jason Isbell a bunch of great people um the um the cool thing about our our our situation is that I've now been able to recruit over 60 colleagues who I know I trust they have the same ethic they want to give back who are shoulder elbow and hand surgeons at the best places around the country we're going to have we're launching that in December it's called the p4m the

[04:28:46] Physicians for musicians Network they're going to be doing so far I've provided all the Care and now they're going to be helping provide care so now really we just need more dollars coming in to help cover the other costs because so basically you're always getting the Physicians to waive their fee you now need to be able to basically use the non-profit resources to fund the surgicenters and anesthesia fees and actually uh and I'm sure you're getting some anesthesiologists who are musicians as well we've been unsuccessful in that it's ironic and a little embittering for me but I know we will be able to once

[04:29:20] I'm hoping that people listening to this who are anesthesiologists someone's going to be like wait a minute I need to find fellow anesthesiologists and we can start to pair those Services um and and nice thing is that most surgeons includes myself have some either participation or partial ownership of a surgery center so I happen to have built one here in Austin and we provide that at one I think it's one tenth of Medicare so it's basically nothing it's the our biggest cost by far is the anesthesia yeah what's your vision for how big this can get and what what has to what has to get there I mean so you have the big fundraiser every year which is a huge concert Gala amazing each year it seems to be getting more and more incredible yeah um what what type of fundraising goes on outside of that per year it's actually been I'm kind of a one-man fundraising machine because of all my generous patients especially in New York and in Austin too and I tell everybody I can't I scream it from the mountaintops but we're starting to get some uh some

[04:30:21] Grant some grants we're applying for Grants which is great but uh anybody who knows any organizations that provide Community you know grants and so forth we are right in the thick of communities because it keeps holds communities together it develops uh relationships that weren't there before and it's all ages right it's just so this is a huge deal this year Alton is that you've now recruited other doctors because the scalability of this was limited when you were the only surgeon exactly um but now that you've got how many more surgeons we'll have over we have over 60 find on now amazing yeah yeah so that's going to be a game that's an amazing success and my idea and they all have their own PODS of I mean I treat more musicians and maybe anybody but in in what I do but they all treat some and they can access those they can access donors in the different towns we have Seattle we have

[04:31:13] La we have Nashville we have New York of course Chicago New Orleans the list goes on and on and and so yeah we we can access that uh we it will build the support I think significantly well Alton I could sit here and talk for about another two hours but I know you have a flight to catch to New York it's probably apparent to people listening to this but you practice bicoastly yes so you you or Not by ghostly rather but you practice in Two Cities so you're you're

[04:31:42] Monday Friday you see clinic and uh you see patients in clinic and operate in Austin and then Tuesday Wednesday Thursday you're in New York City and you do this over and over and over again I do I've had the privilege of seeing you in both cities I've had the privilege of sending patience to you in both cities I don't know how you do it I used to do that and I can't do it anymore but I'm so grateful for this discussion I think a lot of people are going to help from it and obviously I'm just so grateful for you personally for the help in in my life and obviously that are my patients so thank you yeah the Gratitude is likewise actually I just want to give you a shout out you at some point uh in one of our many meetings you uh said you know uh you mentioned rucking and I I you know I didn't really know that much about it but you uh gave me the link I bought it I'm only carrying 35 pounds that's awesome but um I've been actually run rucking because I love running I've always run it has changed my body in in

[04:32:35] I've I've only been doing it about three months and I only get to do it two or three times a week it's changed my body I I feel so much lighter so much stronger and better and although I'm pretty old I feel great and it I commend you and I thank you because it's been a game changer for me yeah I'm the rocking evangelist for that so well thank you very much all and this was fantastic great thanks [Music]
