[00:00:00] lowend one in 20 highend one in 10 people adults adults yes most people at some point in their lives are going to have an issue with insomnia whether people have difficulty falling asleep in the beginning of the night waking up in the middle of the night waking up too early in the morning the people who can't fall asleep at the beginning of the night their mind's just racing earlier than yours yours is just waking you up okay this is really important to you this is something you're doing all the time all day guess what what do we do with things that are really important to us make time we schedule them exactly

[00:00:31] I always tell patients if you don't deal with what's causing you stress or anxiety during the day it's going to demand to be dealt with in the middle of the night let's talk about sleep supplements right melatonin is like the guy at the start of the race right he's the guy with the gun he fires the gun he doesn't have a car in the race he's not like helping you stay asleep he's telling you when to start the thing so for a lot of adults taking melatonin is really messing them up I think the the time in bed is pretty interesting I don't even do time and bed restriction that first week because for some people setting awake time solves the issue H let's go back to sleep hygiene for a second caffeine withdrawal is not something I want to deal with in my clinic and I don't think it's necessary so I tell people do not change how much coffee you're drinking put it all before 11: when does the treatment fail the treatment fails when people don't do it hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter AA hey Ashley thank you so much for uh for coming to Austin to talk about a lot of interesting things um let's let's start with with the one that I think everybody listening can probably relate to at least once which is insomnia so uh where did your interest in insomnia arise well I've been interested in sleep for a long time I was fortunate to go to the University of

[00:01:58] Arizona for my doctoral work and when I was there uh the late dick botson was also there and he's one of the co-inventors of cognitive behavioral therapy from insomnia and I think I found it particularly interesting because it works so well we have so many different psychological treatments and they all have varying degrees of efficacy and Effectiveness and um the thing about cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is that it's kind of like a recipe if you do it works and this was always just so interesting to me because it was so different than so many other psychotherapies out there that had just so much more unpredictable outcomes and I would say that I became much more interested in it after my post-doctoral work when I'd gotten to UCSF and um I was a postdoc at

[00:02:58] UCSF but I started my assistant professorship at UCSF and there was this gaping hole in treatment availabilities for people with insomnia and I thought oh you know like this might be a a good way for me to get back into some clinical work I was doing just research at the time and I fell back in love with it because there's almost nothing as rewarding as being able to see a patient seven times and that seventh time have them say something to you along the lines of

[00:03:30] I have my life back I'm going to go get my driver's license back I'm not afraid to drive with my kids in the car anymore I'm going to go back to work I have my life back I mean not much better than that and so I grew the clinic that I do cbti in and now I just I love it so much that I do it on top of my job like I do it at night with patience um after hours because it's it's the most rewarding thing and you can have such a big impact and people need it so before we dive into what cbti is and how it works and how profound it can be let's maybe help folks understand a little bit about insomnia and maybe go through some of the definitions around the different types of insomnia um and uh maybe some of the different causes for it and and maybe even what some of the other treatments are pharmacologic and otherwise yeah so broadly speaking most people at some point in their lives are going to have an issue with insomnia

[00:04:35] I think some 90% of adults at some point are going to struggle with insomnia and and point estimates I think at any given moment might be between five and 10% the interesting thing about insomnia is that it's a very clinical diagnosis right um there's no blood test for insomnia there's no we can't put you in a sleep lab overnight and do a test to see if you have insomnia and we don't diagnose insomnia based on one night of bad sleep if someone says oh I didn't sleep at all last night or I haven't slept even for just the last week that's not going to get you a diagnosis of insomnia so um and there's a whole whole Suite of different snas that we could talk about but I think the point that is the most Salient is just that when you have a problem sleeping and when it's been going on for a long time at least like three-ish months and when you really feel it's a problem that's when it's time to get help um because there's plenty of people who don't sleep a whole lot but it's not distressing to them it's not causing any problems in their life they're not going to meet you know a definition of insomnia per se um it's the folks who will tell you that I can't sleep I haven't been sleeping for months it's interfering with my life it's really upsetting and they've started they've probably already started trying a whole bunch of things to try and help themselves to fix it and this is where things get interesting and just to be clear Ashley when you say that a point estimate of 5 to 10% of the population would have insomnia at any point in time you mean according to that definition where it's been going on for months it's causing distress and it's impacting life yeah broadly speaking wow that's so that's one in lowend one in 20 high-end one in 10 people adults adults yes yes by the way I do not do pediatrics so please assume everything we're talking about today is adults insomnia and children is a totally different thing so that's a higher estimate than I would have guessed yeah

[00:06:43] I mean given your definition if the definition was three nights of bad sleep I would say yeah that makes sense so that's pretty startling any given point in time and insomnia is for most people probably quite episodic mhm it's not necessarily a permanent state um people go in and out of it and the question is how quickly do people go out of it when they go in it and that's what cbti is so beautiful for it's helping people get out of it quickly there's going to be things in your life that are going to just happen and they're going to put you over the threshold for insomnia so maybe we can talk for a minute about how insomnia begins and then how it's perpetuated because these things are actually quite different yeah so you and I and everybody have a certain level of predisposing factors that are going to put us at risk for having sleeping problems in particular insomnia right and then we may experience what's called a precipitating factor that could be a major life event like losing your job getting a divorce getting in a car accident some major unexpected unhappy life event that might throw you into a bout of insomnia right and that that event will end though that event ends the car accident ends it resolves the job loss ends you get a new job or you don't the divorce ends you move on right but in the meantime when you're dealing with that event you develop behaviors to cope with it and so you might for example pop a benad dril to help you sleep or an ambian something stronger you might start taking naps the next day after a bad night of sleep to try and cope with it right you might start reading in bed a lot or flipping through your smartphone in bed doing all these different types of behaviors to try and help yourself calm down and actually get to sleep which in the short term make a lot of sense right you're trying to help yourself in the acute moment but in the long term these kinds of behaviors aren't actually doing you any favors and over time that precipitating factor is going to go away but all of these behaviors that you've started doing to respond to the precipitating event they're what stick around and those are what are going to perpetuate insomnia symptoms and problems can you say more about the predisposing factors yeah are those genetic um or you know yeah yeah so there's of course genetic predisposing factors right I've had patients come and say I'm a really light sleeper can you fix that that's going to be pretty tough to fix right I'm going to recommend something like earplugs an eye mask a white noise machine what what have you but yes there are going to be predisposing factors so if you are higher on the on General psychological reactivity right you're going to probably get pushed over the threshold more easily than someone else right some people might get in a car accident a fender bender and they're over it by the next day the car is in the shop whatever other people might feel antsy about driving for a while after that they might feel more anxious as a result of that event and that's going to differ from person to person you can argue that that's genetic you can AR argue that that's based on Early

[00:09:56] Childhood or other experiences m MH but nature and nurture probably both contribute to that predisposition and there's not a whole lot that we can do about that but this is the beauty of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia when people come in for treatment they're often pretty focused on what caused their insomnia and I actually don't ask people what caused their insomnia until the end of my first session with them I'm asking them all these other kinds of questions about their behaviors now and at the end

[00:10:30] I ask okay so when did this start what do you think might have caused this and get their attribution for what's going on because at the end of the day the intervention is the same and that's what's beautiful about this and might differ a lot from the practice of medicine I'm not I'm not an MD I'm a PhD right so in in I think in a lot of disease States we often look at what what caused what's going on I'm not really concerned I'm more concerned about what you're doing now that's prep uating the problem and that's where I intervene and that's why this particular treatment is so effective for so many different presentations of insomnia and causes of insomnia whether people have difficulty falling asleep in the beginning of the night waking up in the middle of the night waking up too early in the morning right you might think on their face these people all need wildly different treatment but that's not actually the case yeah that makes a lot of sense so the focus is much more on the cop strategy and the behavior that came out of the predisposing factor or the precipitating event actually is really that you Ed to respond to the precipitating fact ex exactly okay yes um can we talk a little bit about you know is there a difference for example between the individual who can't fall asleep you know this initiation of sleep in insomnia versus the person um that I hear much more about and frankly I experience more which is H it's not that hard for me to fall asleep but boy I will jolt up at 1 in the morning with some thought or anxiety that I can't get out of my mind and my mind starts running and I can't go back to sleep or

[00:12:13] I get up because I got to pee but when I come back I erroneously just do something with my mind where I get thinking about the day's problem or whatever whatever whatever um so do you think of those as differ or they just same side of a different coin different side same coin I guess great question great question so um those people need the same stuff and the people who can't fall asleep at the beginning of the night their mind's just racing earlier than yours yours is just waking you up and there's a whole Suite of interventions that are part of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia and there are a lot of ways that I could approach an answer to this question so I think starting by addressing the racing mind issue I always tell patients if you don't deal with what's causing you stress or anxiety during the day it's going to demand to be dealt with in the middle of the night it's going to say oh

[00:13:13] Peter I noticed you're you know laying there peacefully not doing any work or tasks and you don't have anything you need to do right now so you're going to pay attention to me and it's going to demand your attention at that time other people that happens right when their head hits the pill at the beginning of the night oh you're relaxing now okay here's your 10 things to worry about right so one of my favorite interventions that's actually born of anxiety treatment but that I've co-opted and I've moved into cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia because it fits with the theoretical framework is something called scheduled worry time this sounds a little bit pedantic and silly but hear me out if a patient came to me and said

[00:13:54] Ashley like I worry all day I have I'm worried about all of these things and this my my life is just a constant ball of worry and I said okay I've got a solution for you and it's two words ready stop it yeah that wouldn't work right doesn't work so I take the opposite approach okay this is really important to you this is something you're doing all the time all day guess what what do we do with things that are really important to us make time for them we schedule them exactly so I have my patient literally get we used to back in the day of paper calendars this was like this felt like a exercise now people get out their phones but I have them get out their phone or whatever and say all right we're going to schedule worry time and it's going to be an hour a day for the next seven days it is non-negotiable I may or may not schedule an email to go out to you at that at the end of that time and you have to go and reply to it and tell me what you did right um and what we find is that when people work with this during the day it does two things the first is let's say it's 9:00 a.m. and you you are trying to do something in your life and instead a worry pops up you can actually think oh okay I don't have to deal with this now

[00:15:07] I'm going to write this down because at 4 o' I've got scheduled time to deal with this right so that way you're uncluttering the rest of your day by moving all of the worry into that scheduled time so this could be a valuable technique even absent insomnia totally yeah I would I'd say that probably between a third and half of my patients who come in with insomnia they've got some some bad sleep stuff for sure but for some of those people it's it's a primary anxiety disorder and sleep is suffering also whereas other folks it's primary insomnia and that's driving them anxious right but to rewind back to your earlier question about the middle of the night versus the beginning of the night so the other thing that scheduling worry time does besides uncluttering your whole day is it helps you get it done during the day so that when your head hits the pillow it's not there oh I already worked on this and also the knowledge oh

[00:16:04] I have time set aside tomorrow to work on this or to think about this so I don't have to do that now and cognitively this all makes sense and you would maybe think you can think your way out of this but you can't you actually have to try it and I've done this with a lot of people I've done this with doctors police people all people from all walks of life can really find this valuable the other thing when it comes to falling asleep at the beginning of the night versus the middle of the night is that there's sometimes loow hanging fruit that we can think about you mentioned getting up to go to the bathroom I found that for a lot of men who are 45 and up who still have a prostate just not drinking very much fluid with dinner and after dinner is huge and also throwing an electrolyte tab in there can really help granted it's got to be the right osmolarity and everything else but there are ways to find this don't slam Gatorade at night that's not what I'm suggesting but just throw a noon tab or whatever element whatever electrolyte replacement and

[00:17:17] I've had some male patients go from waking up three times in the night to pee to one time and the fewer times you wake up in the night the fewer times you risk not falling back asleep so little things like that can actually make a difference for waking up in the middle of the night the other one I have about the middle of the night is a little more out there but hear me out if I had five cents for every time I took away a down comforter from someone and their sleep got better I'd have like $8 I mean this is huge and this is because everybody's heard of circadian rhythm right but it's missing a word it's Cadian temperature Rhythm right your body is supposed to be its coolest at night and its warmest during the day and my favorite people to talk with about this are actually anesthesiologists they know more about body temperature than anyone it's remarkable um but what I've had the great Good Fortune of learning is that your body temperature it's supposed to be the warst during the day and the coolest during the night and when we do things like trap heat with down comforters quilted nonsense um even cotton replacement duvet if the word duvet is in it comforter is in it wo like I I'm like that's it's a no for me and I give people a hand out I'm like here's the definition of a cotton blanket here are links to examples of what cotton blankets are if you are cold buy two buy three use these and I'm telling you it's made a huge difference for a lot of women in particular with night sweats and people wake up less sometimes because they're not giving their body this message that it should that it's time to wake up because they're not as warm people complain about their feet and their hands and I say that's fine you can put your down comforter over the foot of your bed um you can wear some socks right but I take body temperature regulation very seriously and sometimes it's a quick fix and we don't need a whole lot of M and us now you've probably tried to this is a very long way to answer your question but I'll

[00:19:33] I'll finish after this the people at the start of the night um it's worth asking people the start of the night if they're cold if their hands and their feet are cold have you ever tried to fall asleep when your hands and your feet are cold yeah I mean I uh I try to be I try to be uncomfortably cold when I get into bed right but your hands and your feet no generally not I mean it's just my body right but again I'm using a device to cool me as well slightly different yeah yeah but spoiler alert it's pretty hard to fall asleep when you have cold hands and feet and what we have data on from some interesting research in a totally different realm is that people with extremity circulation disorders like who have really cold hands like right yeah they will have more early what we call

[00:20:16] Early insomnia which is difficulty falling asleep at the beginning of the night yeah and when they get successful treatment or when you warm their hands and their feet much easier to fall asleep the whole warm foot bath before bed thing that's an actual thing so warming your extrem your extremities help you dump heat right so when you actually warm your hands and your feet you can actually help dump heat from your core because your vas are dilating and when you fall asleep you want to be dumping heat from your core hard to do that when you're vasoconstricted in your hands and your feet so for folks who have trouble falling asleep at the start of the night we want to make sure their hands Fe and feet are warm enough right and that they've dealt with the thoughts and the worries during the day and that they're not trying to go go to sleep at 9:00 when their body doesn't want to go to sleep until 11: a lot of people just think I need to have this much time in bed each night and they get into bed and they struggle for two hours before their body actually wants to go to sleep so a major part of cbti is aligning when your body can produce sleep with when you're in your bed I want to kind of go into more many more of these because I know this is this is the exciting stuff that people are interested to hear about but

[00:21:23] I I do want to take one step back and just make sure we kind of understand how what what constitutes cognitive behavioral therapy before we even get into cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia so we've we've had a podcast where we talked about dialectical behavioral therapy DBT but we haven't covered CBT okay can you give us a little bit of the tapestry of what defines it and why it of course then has this um additional subset of of treatment for insomnia yeah I I should have done that first that's a great great question so um cognitive behavioral therapy my favorite way to think about this is in a triangle we have thoughts we have feelings and we have behaviors and you can think about this triangle as having these three pieces that are all connected and cognitive and behavioral therapies or cognitive behavioral therapies generally will focus on one intervening on this process between thoughts feelings and behavior thoughts feelings and behavior on one of these the sides of the triangle right so let me just spell out a quick example process right so let's say we have a patient with type 2 diabetes who has the thought I'm never going to be able to get my blood sugar under control I'm I'm never going to be able to manage this

[00:22:43] I'm not going to be able to do this when a person has those thoughts how do they feel crummy feel bad about themselves when people feel bad about themselves what do they do eat some chocolate cake eat some chocolate cake what does that do that reinforces the thought I'm never going to be able to do this right so we've got this pattern of thoughts feelings Behavior right on repeat right and cognitive behavioral therapies will choose where to intervene on a process in that triangle so we might intervene cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia for example is really focused on the area between thoughts and feelings in many ways because people will have a lot of thoughts I I can't sleep I'm I'm I'm never going to be a good sleeper if I don't sleep eight hours tonight I'm going to lose my job whatever and then the big emotions that follow from that we work on questioning a lot of those thoughts to then recalibrate the feelings that follow like oh if I don't sleep eight hours tonight I won't feel great tomorrow but I'll probably be okay at work right the feeling is much smaller than if I don't sleep eight hours tonight I'm going to lose my job tomorrow right they're noticeably different um in terms of depression an example that I like might be someone saying oh you know I'm really depressed now but when I feel better I'm going to take my grandkids to the movies that's what I'm going to do I'm G to take my grandkids to the movies I'm going to take them to the zoo I'm going to do all these things so as a therapist what I might do is i' have the patient write all of this this huge long list of stuff they're going to do when they feel better and then you know what I'm going to do I'm going to get out their calendar with them and I'm going to say all right I don't care how you feel we're scheduling all of these things so we're intervening on that behavior to thoughts line right so we're going to make them take the kid to the zoo we're going to make them take the kids to the movies and then the kids are going to have a great time and the patient's going to come back and say oh you know what I'm a pretty Kick-Ass Grandma kids had a great time like this was this was pretty great so we're intervening on the behavior to change the thoughts about the self right like oh I'm going to do these things when I'm better right so a major feature of cognitive behavioral therapies is intervening on Behavior to change thoughts but also intervening on thoughts to change feelings and there's just many many applications for this cognitive behavioral therapy has been adapted for a whole host of disorders for eating disorders for insomnia specifically for anxiety that's going to be more in the thoughts and feelings realm too um and it's is that kind of running the triangle in the other direction so you change Behavior to change thought you change thought to change feeling yeah so you can you can change thought to change feeling you can change you can work on

[00:25:31] Behavior to change thought you can operate on any any way of those um with different techniques that have been just repackaged into different therapies and tell me a little bit about the history of cbti specifically when did the when when did the um idea come to you know uh existence in a way that's that it's been packaged uh more or less the way it is today yeah so C behavioral therapy for insomnia is actually old news I mean we can go back to the 1970s

[00:26:04] I remember when I was learning cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia one of the most fun um studies to read about was this study of I believe it was college aged men who were not doing well academically and the intervention that they did with them was one of the two pillars of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia which is called stimulus control and what they did with these young men is they told them all right you're going to be assigned a Carol in the library and in this carol is the only place you can study you can't study in your dorm you can't study outside can't study anywhere else just this carol right and only this amount of time can you study each day even if if you're on a roll we don't care you have to stop if you're miserable we don't care you just have to keep on like doing whatever portion of the studying over and over again that you're stuck on right so they trained PE these young men to just study in that one place and it succeeded in helping these men and these men were struggling with anxiety or actual insomnia academically they were this is this is just stimulus control where we learn to associate a place with a behavior right and fast forward a little bit one of it was actually it was called the booten method at one point for dick booten but um one of the Hallmarks of cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia is your bed is only for sleep there are two things you're allowed to do in bed I always tell my patients you're two things that you can do a bed are sex and sleep if you're not sure if something counts message me and I'll I'll clarify it for you real quick whether it counts in one of those two buckets but we really want to just associate the bed with sleep and this dates even f further back and to be clear uh just going back to this study was was was there a belief or were some of these guys studying in bed they were studying in their dorms in their beds and everywhere else I mean everywhere um so this wasn't specifically a a study focused on sleep per se it was just studied it was just focused on this associative pattern that became the Bedrock of this treatment and we can go back even further and we can look at pavlovian conditioning right the dog and the bell and the food and we don't need to go over what that whole thing was again right now but the point just is that the dog came to associate the bell with getting food right and a lot of times when people are struggling with sleep you know what they're doing in their bed they're reading they're scrolling they're watching TV they're listening to podcasts they're they're doing like everything a lot of people by the time they get to me they're camping out in their bed just in case they're able to sleep oh I'm going to go have a snack in bed because if I'm sleepy enough I'll roll over and take a nap and get some extra zase right so people have moved so much of their lives into their beds that it's completely dissociated from sleep so that's a major that's one of the the bedrocks right and then another

[00:29:12] Bedrock is what we now call time and bed restriction this used to be called Sleep restriction but I think I don't know where along the way in the last number of years it went from being called sleep restriction to time and bed restriction but whoever made the change I'm still not sure who made that change I'm thankful to them for it because the other key component of cbti is that we restrict the amount of time that a patient is in bed to match how much time their body can actually produce of sleeping a lot of times people with insomnia will say okay

[00:29:49] I need to be in bed for at least 12 hours if I want to get seven hours of sleep right I know it's hard to believe but it's true um and we just obliterate that notion and this is another core and very old part of CBT that dates back what 7 1970s 80s but um when you take those two parts then you start to add in some of the cognitive components that have been around also for decades the cognitive therapies part the Aaron Beck stuff with cognitive restructuring which is where we take a thought have you ever heard that phrase don't believe everything you think MH yeah so you take a thought and on the classic classic thought record tool you'll have patients write down the thought write down how they feel rate their feelings from say 0 to 90% And then we have them write down what's the evidence for this thought like if you had to go to court right now and there was a judge and a jury and what have you and you had to present evidence for your thought what would you be able to present evidence for a thought is not another thought it's not a belief it's evidence last time I slept 6 hours I got a worse grade on a test or something right that would be evidence you got worst SC test but then we we look at all the evidence for a thought we look at all the evidence against a thought like oh last time you didn't sleep so well you didn't get fired you still did fine in school whatever the thing and then we create a balanced thought which is okay even though I'm not going to be as well rested I'll still still get through this day right then we have people rate their emotions rate how much they believe this new thought this whole song and dance right this is the cognitive component and that's kind of the Bedrock of so much of cognitive therapy and so of course people have so many negative thoughts about sleep and and dysfunctional thoughts about sleep that aren't true or that are catastrophizing and whatnot that that is also Blended in to the treatment um and then we have relaxation techniques which are things like progressive muscle relaxation that came along as well and those are part of the treatment and that progressive muscle relaxation will be like where you squeeze your hands and let it go and squeeze your hands and let it go and then squeeze your arms and let them go and kind of move through your whole body to get out of your head and into your body and I don't know what or what order those actually were packaged into cbti um but I can tell you the first two the stimulus control and and the time and bed restriction those among the earliest earliest parts of cbti and what we know from dismantling studies is when you take either of those out of the treatment no dice yeah I I want to talk about both of those a little bit more um so I and I want to bracket sleep hygiene and come back to it because I think again the temperature and all that light stuff we we shouldn't we shouldn't gloss over that even though it's easy to take for granted and I I know that many people listening to this podcast will have heard other content where we talk about it but I'd love to have it all in one place sure um I think the the time in bed restriction is pretty interesting and and and in talking with sleep

[00:33:06] Physicians who also implement this it seems quite Draconian at the outset uh it can be remarkably difficult uh like you know they're giving people 5 hours in bed Max and and they're really trying to force sleep pressure right so how do you um uh how do you navigate that and how do you decide how to squeeze the the tube of toothpaste let me draw a line in the sand between what cbti says broadly as a treatment and then how I've actually implemented it in my clinich MH so what cbti will have you do is they will have you as a and I say you as the Royal you your patient they will have you f something called a sleep diary and this is a paper diary that covers seven days we have it love it because if I asked you how well you slept four nights ago you'd be like yeah yeah you have it's like a food frequency questioner in epidemiology totally total waste of time total so you have to do it every morning okay and of course I'm not obsessed with it being exact because I'm much more interested in the picture the pattern of it right if you asked someone to fill it out for just one day and then worked with that you'd have a totally distorted picture you wouldn't know what you're working with but what classic cbti does is they'll take that 7-Day sleep diary and then they will actually use it the time you got in bed time you fell asleep how many times you woke up um how long you you were awake what time you woke up it does a bunch of it has all of these different uh questions in it and you can use that to calculate how much time a person was sleeping on average over the course of the week and what cbti does is it says you patient why don't you pick what time you want to get up every day and then you you would off sensibly pick a time and then the cbti clinician would let's say your your sleep log said you were naturally s sleeping 6 hours a night right the clinician would add 30 minutes to that and make it 6 and 1 half hours and then work backwards from your chosen wake time so let's say you chose a wake time of I don't know 7 a.m. I would work back 6 and 1 half hours to get to a bedtime for you of 12:30 a.m. and of course that's the Bedtime of your childhood dreams right imagine going to a sleepover and your friend's mom saying all right kids you can't go to bed until after 12:30 a.m. right kids love it adults think this is this is torture right because it is so that's what classic cbti would do six hours being the number six and and right you get that half hour of Grace right and as far as I know in cbti almost nobody's restricting less than five and a half hours five and a half seems to be the floor okay so I've not seen people restricting to five um there there are a subset of people and I don't know the data on this cuz I don't even know if the data exists on this who are what we call genetically short sleepers Y and these people know who they are they have always been like this they've they've it's not and it's not upsetting and distressing and causing them grief right those are we're not talking about those people okay so that's what cbti will do and just to be clear let's say five and a half is the floor six is typically what you would do so six and a half in bed so well no if if your body is produced ing six hours of sleep I add 30 and I get six and a half y if your body is producing only five and a half I add 30 and you get six so I do this computationally for each person I see so when I bring my sleep log to you and you've seen that for the past week I've been spending 12 hours in bed but by my recollection cuz I'm looking at the clock when I'm not sleeping I'm only getting 6 and 1/2 hours of sleep in the 10 or 12 hours I'm laying there you're going to say oh okay that's your sleep time take that add 30 that's your time in bed working back I got it yes and here's where um what I do is slightly different but also keeps the the the the whole theoretical underpinning is not

[00:37:12] Disturbed At All by the way that I do this so how many times have you had a patient come to you and say oh you know I really want to be that person who wakes up at 5:00 a.m. gets a go on my day I want to get my exercise in I want to get get my meal prep in do all this stuff and you're like oh okay cool cool so you want to be a five in prison what time you get up now oh like 11:00 and I'm like oh okay all right okay so this whole part in cbti where people choose their a wake time that's not a thing for me in my clinic we play a game called democracy within a dictatorship and what that just means is that instead of just letting patients cart blanch choose their wake time I actually look at their sleep diary and I let them think they're choosing their wake time and if if I agree with it they will have chosen if I don't the dictator comes in and I look at their diary and if they are getting up at 7 a.m. 6: a.m. 7 a.m. 7 a.m. 6: a.m. 6 a.m. 6: a.m. and they say to me oh I want to wake up at 8:30 I will say well we have no evidence that you can sleep until 8:30 that's not realistic but we have evidence that you can sleep until 6 because four of the last seven days you may until 6 so 6:00 is your wake time and this is not anywhere in cbti I've spoken with a lot of my colleagues who do cbti and ask them how do you choose a wake time and there is no standardized method but by using this method I'm definitely making sure that I'm at least gating the patient's sleep at a reasonable time because if I let that patient just choose 8:30 a.m. as their aake time and they were only producing six and a half hours of sleep they're going to bed at 1: in the morning they're going to bed at 2 in the morning and they're getting up at 8:30 cuz they chose their wake time is 8:30 but really they're going to wake up at like 6:00 or 700 and they're not even going to cash in on the full 6 and a half hours that they should be getting a bed so I've added in this o this component of my own of setting their wake time to be a much more reasonable time and then what I do before giving them a bedtime I give them a week at that wake time and I see how much sleep is your body producing with this new wake time now um let's say doing the Sleep log and they're spending you know 8 hours in bed getting 4 hours of sleep uh let's say they're getting 5 hours of sleep eight hours in bed and then they're taking an hour nap a day so they're removing all their sleep pressure during the day by taking that nap but they kind of need to take the nap because they're not getting enough sleep so they're in this vicious cycle so do you add the hour of nap time back to sleep and say actually you're getting six hours of sleep let's do the exercise based on 5 plus 1 plus a half 6.5 no no no no no no we want to extinguish that sleeping during the day thing so there's a difference between a person without insomnia healthfully using naps and there's a p and then there's a person with insomnia who's napping to compensate for what's not happening at night so I think that to best explain this I should just finish this example of the Wake time thing so if people because this directly ties in if I'm setting their wake time and then I'm seeing how much time they're actually producing sleep that first week when I give them the Wake time I don't give them a bedtime I don't even do time and bed restriction that first week because for some people setting a wake time solves the issue which is kind of nuts but one or two of every eight patients who I see because I see patients in groups of eight will have a huge improvement from just having a consistent wake time because their body actually recalibrates and they start getting sleepy at a more consistent time each night because they're not doing that and I do say in that first week I take away the Naps I say I don't care how you slept last night you need to just stay awake until you're ready to go to sleep no naps for now now when I have patients um probably older patients like 80 and up I'll be okay with a nap but I'll often at this at this stage I'll say look nap you have an opportunity of 25 minutes and a 25 minute opportunity means you set the alarm for 25 minutes you get in bed and it's going to go off 25 minutes later and that's when you get up I don't care how long you actually slept during that time because I don't want you going into phase three or phase four slow wave deep sleep during the day y because that's what's going to really mess you up at night right a stage a stage two sleep nap is not really an issue during the day as much it's not going to be so bad but at this stage of the person with insomia that we're talking about I don't want them taking a 1 hour nap in the day and they come back that second week having done the Wake time that I said and I then recompute how much time in bed they're spending and then I still use that wake time and I then calculate their bedtime and then the true time and bed restriction begins week two okay but just to be clear if you have someone who is using a nap to compensate for their insomnia yeah step one is just kill the nap kill the nap and then let the cards settle where they may for a week recalculate actual sleep time and then go through the ex descried um I've I've made this point on a podcast before I think but just want to get your blessing um when when we're on uh bow hunting trips you are going to bed insanely late and waking up insanely early it's just the nature of when you get back to camp and eating and then you got to be up super early so you can't it's not I've never been on a one of these trips where I could actually be in bed for more than five and a half or six hours in a night so the strategy is to get that sleep but then I always try to get a 90 minute nap at around 1 in the afternoon and the reason I pick 90 is to get a full sleep cycle okay and I tend to function incredibly well under those circumstances better than I would because remember you're also very

[00:43:14] Physically Active like this is demanding time so um would you argue that there's any would I be better off not doing that nap midday oh that's a bow hunting trip and you don't have insomnia that's not a problem okay all right got it yeah totally different monster and I tell people too when cuz a lot of the last few years people have been had serious illnesses they've had covid they've had whatever you know when when you're sick all bets are off and what I tell people is if you need a nap when you're sick you need a nap when you're sick but we maintain stimulus control you don't nap on the couch we're only napping in bed and if you're awake and feeling sick then you can be on the couch not in bed while we're on that topic what what do you say to the legions of people watching who um fall asleep watching TV on the couch oh the worst right so a lot of people fall asleep on the couch because they're just so over tired that they've the ship has sailed like their body's ready to go to bed and they're just like letting it and they're not getting up and doing the thing I tell people look if you want to prioritize your sleep pay attention to your body when you're watching TV do you notice that you're starting to knot off do you notice your eyelids feeling heavy are your hands feeling warm are you starting to Sag a little bit like okay these are indicators that it's probably time to get off the couch and go to bed and for people who can't figure that out

[00:44:41] I say okay you want to watch TV at night sit in a stool you're going to figure it out real fast and what about just the social Dynamic of it which is when you have a couple and uh not that I'm saying this from experience at all and one one part of that couple uh they want to be together and watch TV but one member of that team falls asleep immediately while the other does not and the one that does not tries to tell the one that is to go to bed but the but that couple says but

[00:45:13] I but that one wants to be with the other like I don't know if you can ever imagine a scenario like that yeah I'm just making it up okay good I'm glad you're making that one up no I have a lot of these couple level issues that come up in Sleep Clinic this is not uncommon because what's more intimate than being completely unconscious next to another person if you think about it like evolutionarily that's probably the riskiest thing you can do right so there is this desire for closeness in lots of couples and it becomes a challenge when one of the members of the couple has a sleep problem and the first step is remembering like that this is not necessarily permanent we need to go about fixing this now and then we can find a new winning solution so in the interum I'm assuming you've already tried you know maybe watching something different on TV that might be more exciting to the second partner Etc um and it's not about the boringness of the show per se doesn't appear to be okay good so if that's the issue then I would say hey like if this is a priority what are we going to do we're going to schedule it we're going to schedule time to be on the couch together at a time when I can definitely be awake and be spending meaningful time with you problem is sometimes other members of the family who tend to be small also tend to be occupying all of the bandwidth during those earlier hours when the member of the family in question is able to be awake this is this is a hard problem to to scale but what I would just say is if you're ready to go to if you're actually ready to go to bed and your body is saying that you need to sleep you should probably do that um it's more likely that then you'll be awake the next day and be a more pleasant exciting partner to be around and be able to have more meaningful experiences with your partner that way otherwise I tell people look this is an issue if it's really an issue what we we're going to get a babysitter let's get figure it out right there are ways to get around these things people just often you know want it to work like they see in the movies like oh this should be easy now if the if obviously I'm talking about my wife here so I'll stop double speaking but but if my wife falls asleep every single time on the couch but then when said Netflix is over and we go up to bed she falls right back asleep and it doesn't seem to keep her awake is it pathologic no this isn't necessarily a problem but what I would say is that we do tend to have well we sleep more deeply at the beginning of the night we experience more slow wave sleep in the first half of the night more R sleep in the second half of the night and you know I think other podcasts guests you've had can definitely go into the neurobiology of this much more deeply but my a way that I like explaining this has to do with Evolution if you think about it when we're deeply deeply asleep we're kind of tuned out right and on the

[00:48:14] Prairie when we figured okay it's safe to go to sleep right now our bodies prioritized getting that really deep sleep when we knew it was safe and then as the night goes on we sleep more and more lightly which makes sense because hey there could be lions and tigers around or whatever that are going to come and eat us so evolutionarily speaking it was adaptive to sleep more deeply in the first half of the night now if your wife is falling asleep on the couch and getting some of that sleep at that stage of the night and maybe getting more interrupted aspects of that because there's noise from the TV or whatnot it could be disturbing the quality of that's the drawback right makes sense um and just and then to that effect on the Prairie right it also makes sense that evolutionarily that there's diversity in people who are night owls early morning Larks right we needed that diversity in order to keep the tribe safe from the threats on the

[00:49:02] Prairie some people were staying up late okay no lines some people were up early okay no lines um and yeah there's nothing pathologic about being a person who's going to be more likely to fall asleep earlier or be a person who's more of an idol it's not and it's very hard to change that y yeah a lot of patients want to change it and there are broadly two to three different archetypes of that right there are the I know there's a circadian rhythm test you can take online that kind of gives you a sense of it but it's I I almost think it's so self-evident if you pay attention to it is your patterns it is and I'm I'm really a clinician so I deal with what's in front of me all of the time I'm not so concerned about these tests I'm more concerned about what's the problem that's messing up your life right now and how can we work around that let's go back to sleep hygiene for a second we talked about temperature um yes you know nowadays we have these incredible devices that can cool our mattresses and and and things of that nature obviously we have air conditioning uh that that can cool the room do you have a preference for one or the other I mean clearly not everybody needs to to to buy a mattress cooling device if they can't afford it that shouldn't be an impediment to sleep um so do you do you have a room temp set we typically talk about the mid-60s as an ideal room temp do you adhere to that yes mid-60s is terrific and if people say oh this is just too cold I say well what's too cold and often they will St my feet and we have wonderful solutions for that they're called Socks and we can get really thick socks and I'm also not opposed to you know those tiny little heating pads you can get they're like this big like a foot and a half by a foot or something putting one of those in the foot of your bed it's got an auto shut off it shuts off after like an hour or something to fall asleep with I don't have a problem with that there's no issue there but yes a cool room is definitely key and you know insert my refrain about down comforters duvet Etc get cotton blankets get cotton sheets and then let's talk about light do we need to have it so pitch black you can't see your hand in front of your face do we need to block the

[00:51:09] Moonlight um how dark do we need it to be yeah so this is a common question you know if you closed your eyes right now you'd be able to tell that it's light in this room right we can we can sense light through our closed eyelids and um many women would tell you that their eyelids seem to get thinner as they age right so I think an eye mask is a great addition and this is for a lot of people with early morning Awakenings IM mask can be a game change because they don't realize that what's causing their early morning Awakenings is a little bit of light getting into the wrong part of their eye indicating it's time to be awake right now and I don't know the details on what wavelength of light that is or what necessarily the light is coming from whether it's a light in outside from the Sun or the moon what whatever it might be but the point just is a lot of folks with early morning Awakening can really benefit from having something covering their eyes whether it's asleep mask or there's like hats that go down here now um making I'm a big fan of making your room dark I am one of those people who travels with a roll of black electrical tape cuz you go to a hotel room and there's like 50,000 lights everywhere and you wouldn't you wouldn't just get relief from the eye mask in that situ I do but I'm one of those people who rips my eye mask off in the middle of the night and I've tried every single eye mask and it's coming off so I like to wear it I start with it I try and keep it on as much as I can but I also if there's egregious lights in a room I cover them with meaning like you're going to cover the alarm clock and or whatever the oh yeah no there's none of that in my room I don't do that but back to the the cool thing for a second my trick is I unplug alarm clocks because I realize sometimes they're so complicated that they just go off in the middle of the night and I didn't realize it and yeah oh totally and and the microwaves are the worst those the blinking time on clocks and but you mentioned the um cooling mattress stuff which I'm intrigued by but I also am concerned about it seems that a lot of these mattresses have settings where you can make it cooler but also you could make it warmer and I worry about two things one is I worry about messing with our circadian temperature biology because you remember in the 1980s for a hot minute when electric blankets were really popular and all of a sudden they're not they were starting to see associations between electric blanket use and some Cancers and at the time there was a lot of speculation that this was related to

[00:53:35] EMF but the great thing that time does is it gives us more perspective and there are some indications that actually that might have been messing with circadian temperature and that might have been part of the issue we know that night shift work is carcinogenic right so all of these things that mess do we though yeah night shift work's been declared well I mean no disrespect to the who I don't know what I believe that they say but um I know that there's an association between night shift work and cancer but do we really know that it's causal I think if we go Bradford Hill on this and we look at temporality I think that there are are age matched case control studies where they can look at people going through different to control for history effects right to see are people getting more and less cancers we know it's it is tricky because if for example you look at firefighters right they're more way more likely to get cancer they way more they have way more chemical Expos they have way more other things in the mix um but I think that some of the more classic Studies have also been done with Hospital workers right also confounding effects but yeah and how do we how do we get around the confounding effects of the diet the the obvious dietary shifts that occur in people when they're working under those conditions I mean if I think back to how

[00:54:55] I ate in residency or how I eat after a night of poor sleep I mean it's yeah I I I to me that's that would be more the um the the the cause I'd put more of that on kind of the metabolic ill health that might result um but but carry on I yeah I think that there's um it's it's often hard for people to sleep during the day making that change from going to sleeping at night to being being a person who sleeps during the day mhm for some people it's not even possible you talk to some night shift workers they shift they sleep very little because they just can't sleep during the day they're not able to flip their circadian biology MH but there's a whole history and I know we'll probably talk about thermal stuff in a bit but of looking at disruptions in circadian temperature as one of the most common like circadian disruptions in mental health Health disorders going back to the cancer thing what is the what what would be the believed mechanism of action I would talk to an oncologist about that and I would probably talk to a circadian biology person about that but what I can just speak to is just my understanding that electric blankets are no longer here with us and very common because there were these observed ill health effects whether they're due to

[00:56:20] EMF or whether they're due to messing with your body temperature at night but what concerns me about some of the exogenous interventions like mattresses that might heat up is that they're supposed to be a normal circadian temperature Rhythm that we do during the day and during the night and when we start imposing things on that my understanding is some of these mattresses can actually be set to cycle at different temperatures during the night and all these things yeah the I think so the one that I use and just by full disclosure I'm an adviser to that company the one that use you you you you change how cold it is throughout the night so I think I run it as I think the settings go from z0 to minus 10 like where- 10 is the absolute coldest zero is no temperature change is that like a point scale or is that degrees no it's a point scale yeah yeah yeah yeah so so you know I think I get in and I have it at like minus5 and then

[00:57:20] I run it down to -10 and then I bring it up to -5 in the morning so I'm taking it from cold to really cold to cold right okay so where my concern is just that my understanding you're saying people would heat themselves with these things yeah but that gets to the point which we know we don't want to be warm we don't want the duvet right but a lot of people get in bed and they don't like feeling cold because it is easier to fall asleep when your hands and your feet and your skin is warmer right so people will maybe mistakenly do this for more of the night than they should and I'm just concerned that our circadian temperature rhythm is an exquisitely controlled system and like a m a 10-point scale on a device I think pales in comparison to the complexity of what our bodies need to do in terms of temperature during well I mean I think the the good news is if you can keep your room at 65 yes none of this matters right and and if if you um and the biggest challenge honestly is hotels for most people it's where you have the hardest time controlling temperature hotels are the worst and there are some mattresses now that are just they're just hot and there's a whole well there's a short list of mattresses that

[00:58:35] I just tell people like look that's going to be a hot mattress don't get that one um and you want to be really careful to make sure that you can be cool in your bed and I think the easiest way to do that if you don't have the money to splurge on you know something that's going to be a mattress that's going to definitely be cool would be keeping your room cool what about um blue light before bed so so I've I've looked at these data quite a bit and I I would say that six years ago I sort of was in the camp of every light had to be red so you know I had to have my phone shifted into a red light phase my computer shifted into a red light phase

[00:59:18] I had all of these apps that managed all of this stuff so as soon as the sun went down blue light was being removed from my elect iics um and I have to say I sleep subjectively and objectively better today I say objectively if you can believe what a sleep tracker tells you but but we can bracket that and come back to it we should um paying never taking blue light out of my devices but instead paying attention to what I'm consuming in other words my new hypothesis has become it's not the blue light that is the problem it's the stimulus that often comes with the blue light in other words not looking at social media with regardless of light color is a far greater positive impact on my sleep than looking at those things but just making sure that there's no blue light coming through yeah um so so let's talk about that what what is the what is the role of minimizing blue light uh when it comes to preparing for sleep that's an excellent question well first

[01:00:30] I want to completely agree with you we didn't evolve for the neural experience of Instagram that's not we we're not ready for that right and um I think regardless of what color light you're getting your Instagram on that's probably not helpful before you go to bed so I think that you're entirely right I think the larger problem is not necessarily the blue light but is the thing that we're interacting with whether it's an iPad or phone or a computer because typically those things are going to involve social media work email all of these other things that I think are much more potent disruptors of sleep than the blue light itself I must caveat this though I have had a few patients who have found they were not using Instagram before bed they were not doing email before bed none of this not doing anything stressful or stimulating no but and I just finished with a patient recently like this who found that using orange colored glasses and I'm talking orange colored glasses not those beautiful blue light blocking glasses that are clear lenses that I'm not sure what they're really doing sometimes like

[01:01:40] I'm talking ugly motorcycle looking orange lenses and I found that a handful of patients wearing these 2 hours before bed it completely ameliorates their sleep onset and such that they were able to almost immediately put ambian the beauty of these interventions is if you can isolate them to one change at a time you can be empirical about it and something like wearing glasses is benign

[01:02:08] I mean you're only out the money you spend on them and if it works great and if you really want to test it take them off and see if your symptoms return exactly and if they don't maybe it fixed you maybe it wasn't that who cares if they return and you can fix it yeah like again I don't I try not to be terribly dogmatic about this stuff um but I also sort of think that um when people go to Great Lengths to remove blue light without removing stimulus they're missing the boat a little bit right and you know for me social media is not much of a stimulus actually because I don't pay that much attention to it but work is yeah so for me the single worst thing

[01:02:49] I can do right before bed is look at email oh yeah if I've like you know whereas watching TV totally like it's a total beautiful way for me to be distracted by watching you know something mindless on Netflix for an hour and as long as I don't go and check my email and see what got sent to me in the last hour right um it'll be great doesn't matter that I just finish watching a big bright screen of Netflix right doesn't seem to impact me totally cuz well one is much more interactive and stressful and one is very passive when you're just watching a movie that has nothing to do with you no bearing on your life right right and what I would say back to your what I'm going to call

[01:03:29] AB testing right whenever you want to test one of these individual what I call loow hanging fruit interventions you want to collect your own data on a paper sleep diary for two weeks make the change you must do it for two weeks and there's a few more low hanging fruit pieces of sleep hygiene by the way do you have a nice template that people can like we have one that we give our patients again it's super low Tech it's a piece of paper do do you have one on your on your UCSF website I can make it

[01:03:55] Pol yeah yeah yeah okay maybe we'll link to it in the show notes just so folks um easy to do and we we could link ours as well but yours is probably better ours is like boxes you color in oh yeah and it's like you put C when you had caffeine uh you know a when you had alcohol E when you exercise so we're documenting when did you exercise when did you have food alcohol caffeine and when were you in bed and when were you sleeping by the shading yours might be even more Hightech than mine but um what

[01:04:22] I will tell you is mine is just enough enough to get the information that I will definitely act on and nothing else but I will tell you can I go over a couple more pieces of low hanging on sleep hygiene y so okay so back to the glasses if you are a person who has trouble with what we call Early insomnia so difficulty falling asleep at the beginning of the night and you're already not looking at your email not doing Instagram you're just annoyed that you cannot fall asleep at the beginning of the night it's worth it to try these glasses for two hours a night for two weeks and see what happens it's it's to it's so easy to do right and to be clear what is there a particular brand I mean

[01:05:03] I have no affiliations with any of these things I can tell you there's some really nice ugly ones from lowl lights.com I think they still in business but they look like motorcycle goggles I do think that the wraparound feature is is important CU if we're going for it let's go for it yeah right uh so it's it's a worthy thing to do another important thing to do is to talk to to your physician I'm not a physician but I work with a ton of them and I learned this from an anesthesiologist all medications have circadian effects all of them somehow it's probably not known for all of them how they do but they do make sure you are taking your medications at the same time every day and at the right time of day for example I once had a patient coming in saying that they were taking 450 milligrams of bupropion for depression before bed no right that's going to be a pretty stimulating dose of something to take for a bed so make sure that you go over your medications with your doctor and that you're taking them at the optimal times of day and be really consistent with your medications and another one that is a particularly low hanging piece of fruit is something called decaffeinated coffee turns out there are speculations that decaf coffee can have as much as 15 to 30% of the caffeine that regular coffee has I haven't found that reference I've dug

[01:06:29] I've tried to find one that will show that I haven't found exactly that but there are some data from 2006 that were published saying that you know 15ish percent and but then again more recent data have shown that Starbucks I think says that their 12 ounce has 155 milligrams of caffeine but outside Laboratory Testing found like 310 something like that so when you're decaffeinating coffee that it's much more caffeinated than you started with this can make an absolutely huge difference I tell people we're done with caffeine by 11: that's my 11:00 a.m. that's my standard unless we've got an extreme phase delay or phase Advance uh

[01:07:06] I should Define those terms a phase delay is when you go to bed really late and you wake up really late a phase Advance is when you wake up really early and you go to bed really early so someone who's waking up at like 3:30 in the morning and going to bed at like 8: p.m. that would be like a phase advance phase delay would be like I'm going to bed at 3:00 a.m. and I'm waking up at at 10:00 a.m. right so in those cases I might do something differential with the caffeine but for most people who are neither of those I'll cut it off at 11 and it's that includes your your caffeinated coffee and your decaffeinated coffee and I never take people's caffeine away caffeine withdrawal is not something I want to deal with in my clinic and I don't think it's necessary you can cause a lot of damage taking away someone's coffee people really don't like that really puts them in a bad mood and it's not necessary so I tell people do not change how much coffee you're drinking put it all before 11: right just move it all what fraction of people are such rapid caffeine metabolizers that they seem immune to caffeine and sleep uh I think that that person doesn't actually exist

[01:08:16] I'm not I'm not I need to be convinced that there are people I mean what the normal caffeine halflife is four to 6 hours right so even if we take someone who's 4 hours that means after 4 hours you still have half of a cup of coffee and after 8 hours you still have a quarter of a cup of coffee and if you have that coffee at 2:00 p.m. and that coffee actually had 310 milligrams of caffeine in it and it was only a tall coffee from Starbucks there's a lot of contingencies to build in here but

[01:08:49] I I can tell you people someone we both just know actually stops using C decaf coffee after dinner and it's like a world of difference for their sleep quality people will say oh no I fall asleep just fine doesn't affect me well it is affecting you it's affecting the electrical quality of your sleep throughout the whole night and I would refer you to talking to like a sleep neurologist to interpret some of those sleep studies and and talk with you more about that for my purposes all I need to know is the person who's trying to fix the insomnia is oh you're having two decaf coffees after dinner every night that could add up and that could be doing something and that could make your sleep less restful okay so low hanging fruit just stop it at 11: to like do the experiment at at a minimum okay so those are three ruce it is the key thing anything any other really obvious things to AB test for two weeks so do you want to talk about getting off medications or do you want to leave that and put that in the next let's wrap up all of this and then I want to do I do want to talk about the weaning off especially the ambiens and the Lunas and all that stuff yeah no I think that that's the major part I will tell people also people like to fall asleep with podcasts on don't do that including this one right right yeah well this is an easy one to fall asleep too but I don't know I hope that people aren't falling asleep listen to this although if this helps him sleep um one other thing I want to talk about is on the real relaxation techniques where does um or does mindfulness-based practice come into it so um anyone who's done mindfulness based meditation probably appreciates how difficult it is uh it's not like you know Transcendental

[01:10:39] Meditation where you're focusing on a monra you're instead focusing on a sensation typically breathing um but body awareness is is a is a is is a a thing that you want to focus on is that counterproductive or is it productive as you're laying there awake So my unsatisfying answer to so many questions is always going to be it depends because there's moderator variables right and when it comes to cbti what we know is that what's been tested is progressive muscle relaxation which you could argue is a form of a body scan which is part of many mindfulness practices right where you scan your whole body you think about your hands you notice how they're feeling are they warm are they soft whatnot and you move through your whole body with progressive muscle relaxation you squeeze your hands and you let them go you squeeze them and you let them go more of an active process that you're paying attention to throughout your body doing this in bed right before you fall asleep for a few minutes is fine that's kind of the one exception to the sleep and sex rule I tell people that it's also fine to practice this in other parts of your house you don't have to just be in bed but the body scan and mindfulness in general has been studied in combination with cbti and what the data have shown is somewhat fascinating there's no actual differential

[01:11:55] Improvement on sleep duration or metrics of sleep but people like the mindfulness stuff they report they're just more they're more happy with it they like they like doing that right um but in terms of actual Improvement on sleep outcomes I don't think it really adds too too much to cbti the effects with cbti are pretty whopping um when it's done well you know 50 to 60% of people can get remission and 70% can get clinically meaningful Improvement to their sleep so that's I mean in the world of psychological treatments that's really good but to

[01:12:37] Circle back to your question mindfulness is great I think there's a lot of practical uses for it for helping yourself when you're in psychological States you don't want to be in it's a great way to be in life but when it comes to sleep do I need you to start a mindfulness practice to improve your sleep no so you mentioned 50 to 60% of people are going to have a remission closer to 50 but yeah 70% will have a clinical meaningful clinical Improvement of the 30% that do not why when does the treatment fail the treatment fails when people don't do it so in other words we're really saying it 30% of people are not able to adhere to the treatment I wouldn't go that far there are some people who are genetically short sleepers and at some point this may become distressing for them I had a great I had a story of a patient who was in her 70s and came to me say saying I have a huge problem I my sleep is not good and I asked her okay so so tell me all about tell me all about this she was like upper 70s had a volunteer job in s like really active full workout plan I'm like you're crushing it lady what what's the problem exactly she says well I joined this study and I had to wear this wearable device and I woke up in the morning and it says that things are not going well every morning morning after morning and it says I'm at risk for different things

[01:14:11] I'm not going to say which wearable company it was but um and I said oh okay okay so there's really there's an amazing treatment for that can I see the wearable device can I can I please just have that wearable device my vice grips exactly so um and this this was a while ago but I I I took it away from her because I thought I think you know and the wearable devices now are not doing doing this um This was oh gosh seven eight years ago this is actually I

[01:14:40] I actually wanted to ask this is a I made a note to ask you this question which is when do you tell people because we do this with our patients which is take the tracker off we're doing a six-month tracker holiday done with the tracker so is that kind of Mainstay part of your treatment is like let's get all that anxiety out of there for people with insomnia I tell them yes and I do like with were coming to me in my clinic the people who have bothered to wait a year and a half to get into the clinic those people yes I am telling them that and so to go back to your 30% of people the genetically short sleepers who become distressed about their sleep are not going to be helped by cbti they're not but maybe they shouldn't be helped maybe there's nothing to fix correct correct but they're presenting so I'm putting them in the in the group I got it and then yes we know that there are so there's such a huge body of data on cbti at this point it's just wonderfully studied and we know that when people don't do the treatment it doesn't work adherence is a major major component duration of treatment also matters uh it seems that if you do four or more sessions with a therapist doing the cbti your outcomes are going to be way better than if you try and cut it way short with one or two my treatment is five sessions I do an intake you get five treatment sessions and then I do a follow-up where we just tidy things up and the space between them is a week always one week I am militant about this if you if you're going to miss the week you can't be in it you have to wait for the next cycle given that people are waiting a year and a half to see you um tells me that there's a a mismatch on the supply demand curve yeah uh why is that the case yeah this is a great question so first of all there is a great directory that I can I give you for the show notes where people can so there's actually a way you can look up it all over the world use it ourselves theet behavi sleep medicine thing yeah so that is how you would find a provider who definitely knows how to do cbti one of the major problems comes down to psychologists and providers taking

[01:16:45] Insurance a lot of the best folks they're in private practice they don't take insurance and you could be paying hundreds of dollarss a session to see them right and they're pretty backed up as it is and they don't take insurance yeah I am fortunate I get to work at UCSF at the oer center for Integrative

[01:17:01] Health and we take Medicare and all kinds of insurance so people can pay minimal or non-existent co-pays to see me and there are other cbti providers at UCSF their weight lists are long long long too in fact in order to see patients now with at any volume I don't see individual patients I see eight patients at a time in group medical visits and I do it 90 minutes every week all eight patients in that 90 minutes to get it done so what will it take for AI to replicate what you're doing to scale this much more because a lot of this a lot of the work I do can be done by an

[01:17:44] AI um how much of the Art and Science of this is teachable to llms and um and at least as another offering right like I'm not saying it should ever displace what you're doing or what a therapist is doing but if we have a backlog of people for years shouldn't we have an alternative which might say look there's an online course that you can do that will give you 70% of the value of what you might get sitting in the group with with Ashley oh I hey if you can find a way to replace me I'm here for it if this can if we can actually come up with an alternative to to scale here's here's the issue there are some cbti apps apps um you know smartphone apps interventions out there and I've had patients who've tried these and there's they're while they're waiting yes exactly and they'll come in and they'll say oh you know it might have helped a little bit but and I think the major issue is that many many people with sleep problems think that their sleep problem is unique it's special this can't be treated by just a generic app my problem is different right and the joy of me having a group is that people can hear that everybody's problems are different and I'm going to treat you all the same way you're all are going to do the same things you might do it at different times but you're all going to do the same things and I think that there is a um a world where AI can help with the personalization aspect and I'm actually I I'm actually helping a company that's making an app it's called rest and they are integrating AI to use for example the way that I calculate someone's wake time which is is not something that's in standard cbti they're incorporating that and they're able to actually do more tailoring and I'm excited to see where it goes but I think that the biggest fly in the ointment with this is going to be getting patients to look at the fact that they have been assigned to wake up at the same time every day for the next seven days and think oh gosh I only wake up at 5:00 a.m. two days a week normally now I have to do it every day getting them to really do it is going to be hard before my patients enroll in my clinic they watch a 10-minute video and it's a really scary video in that video I'm basically saying look this is going to be hard you're going to hate me you're going to want to make a dartboard with my face on it and play darts on it you are going to suffer in the beginning of this treatment but guess what you have been suffering for months or years now you're going to suffer for five weeks you're going to do it my way right and if you don't like it you can go back to your way this is five weeks of your life how bad can it be how much worse can it get right so I do one of these kind of pep talk videos and there's just something about knowing that someone else is actually really paying attention to the one of the biggest problem if not the biggest problem in your life at that moment sleep is a 24-hour a day problem this is not just a problem at night it is affecting you all day it is intensely personal so it's a lot to trust an algorithm or an app to know oh okay I really should do these things

[01:20:55] I think it's a big ask and it's hard by the way it when you're giving them that um you know boot camp speech is the is the uh time and bed restriction typically the thing that causes the most distress I think the thing that causes the most well that's a great question uh they don't know about that at that stage

[01:21:13] I intentionally am not people are in the dark at that stage I just say look we're going to do this thing it's going to be really hard you're going to get worse before you get better because everybody sleeps less the first couple of weeks right while we're getting all these things lined up um and for some people what ends up being the hardest is the Wake time cuz they're used to just sleeping in whenever they can or catching up on those catching up on those hours when they when they can for other people o those the super late bedtime that I give them that's what crushes them like oh my gosh I have to stay up until then but the great news is that we we dial it back over time and I don't think we talked about this part with time and bed restriction which is just that there's a benchmark for efficiency sleep for efficiency and we Define sleep efficiency is the amount of time that you're in bed sleeping divided by the entire time that you're spending in bed and The Benchmark is 85% right so each week I'm actually calculating sleep efficiency from people's paper sleep Diaries and once we do time in bed restriction if they are above 85% I move their bedtime back 15 minutes and then if that's the same for another week you move back another 15 minutes and people say 15 minutes what who cares I'm like oh you'll care after after four weeks that's an extra hour every night that's huge and are people able to with a high enough Fidelity report awake time in bed like for example like if I were doing this let's assume I've got a clock next to my bed that I can look at because you have to do that for this purpose right you have to have some device to keep track of time so I get in bed because my time in bed tonight is 11:00 and my wakeup time tomorrow is 5:30 okay so I get in bed it's 11:00 check okay mhm how do I know what time I fell asleep let's just say I didn't have an issue falling asleep how do I know if it's 11:15 versus 11:30 I'm looking for the difference between 5 minutes and 50 minutes when those for that time to fall asleep thing right and in the middle of the night when you're waking up guess what if you're not getting laid you're getting out of bed so you can look at the clock and be like all right I'm out of bed and then you have to go do what I call a very fun and potentially embarrassing activity embarrassing meaning if your boss caught you doing this activity during the workday you should feel embarrassed so for example reading

[01:23:37] People magazine or reading some trashy magazine right you wouldn't want to be caught at your desk doing that at work that's exactly what you should be doing I mid night so so person wakes up at 2 in the morning the idea and they can't go back to sleep get up go and do something that is not productive not reward reing in the way that hey this is

[01:23:57] I'm building a pattern around getting up and doing something I like right so I wouldn't be able to get up and play chess do I wouldn't be able to do the online chess thing that I love maybe maybe not I mean I tell people they can play Solitaire okay adult coloring books are all the rage um people but I couldn't I couldn't check email no work-related work is a is a definite no what about scrolling social media no no we don't like that again like although that meets the criteria of your you wouldn't want your boss catching you doing it right um we don't do social media or interactive neur CH like neural experien we didn't evolve that's fine okay but we don't read about um global warming current events politics pandemics like those things are off the menu stock trading o not if it's stressful I wouldn't I wouldn't do that um okay so there's a narrow subset of activities that you are going to get out of bed to do yeah yeah MH stuff that's kind of boring but but entertaining enough because we don't want you to get a habit of looking forward to doing something in the middle of the night this happens with parents so I'll have parent like if like a parent for example who might be busy all the darn day with their kids and their family's needs and everything else and then in the mid then in the middle of the night they wake up and it's like oh this is me time right this is when I'm going to do all these really fun things that I don't get to do during the day we don't want to make a habit of U time being between 3: and 4:00 a.m. that's really when you you want you to be sleeping right so sometimes you have to schedule that stuff during the day but we want the stuff in the middle of the night to be mildly boring and to that end back to your blue light thing I don't mind if people watch for example an episode of mash or Gilligan's Island or sex in the city or some other sitcom

[01:25:39] I like 20 minute episodes because then you can generally turn it off check in with your body think am I ready to go back to sleep and then you can go back to sleep do you remember in the '90s um if you played video games ever how we had those like cartridges and we go we put them in and sometimes we have to take them out and blow them out to put them back in and reset them because they would like freeze that's what you're doing when you get out of bed in the middle of the night you do a different activity you're resetting and then you're going back to sleep instead of just having stewed in bed that whole time yeah right and it's much easier to fall back to sleep when you have that reset so we don't want the activity to be too stimulating but just like mildly boring and entertaining enough got it is that yep uh one obvious thing we haven't talked about and maybe it's so obvious we don't need to but just to close the loop on it is food and alcohol and how they pertain to this um so what's your what's the checklist you run through with the with the clients so since we're dealing with so much life I actually don't mess with their food all

[01:26:39] I do is say hey really let's try to not eat within three hours of going to bed okay right um sometimes it's it's rare that I'll have nighttime Bing eating disorder to deal with at the same time or a blood glucose issue that you know in diabetes that's poorly controlled at the same time but I'm going to put those cases aside for just a moment okay so I generally will go with don't eat for 3 hours before bed and when it comes to alcohol I tell my patients look this is five weeks of your life I'm not going to drink and you're not going to drink so when I'm running a clinic nobody's drinking and the reason for this is that in order for me to actually see what's going on with your sleep I need to see this with the least perturbation possible and alcohol and marijuana are those things now if people are using a lot of marijuana or a lot of alcohol I'm not here to put people into withdrawal so they just don't enroll until they're no no no I love them in so what I'll do is before people come to their first group I have them do a sleep diary so I can see what's going on and before that I will have done their intake and I'll have them have told me their alcohol intake and I'll have decided all right here's what you're going to do you're either going to you're going to not or you're going like let's say someone I just finished with some people one of them was drinking between 16 and 20 o of wine a night his usuge okay and I said okay so you're going to drink 2 ounces of wine a night out of that same glass and then you know what you're going to keep using that glass and you're going to drink something else some other FR fuit drink

[01:28:08] I don't care what it is right um but I want it to be something that is you don't drink during the day so I want it to be you know overpriced juice or overpriced bubbly water or something like that something special something special right and you're going to keep drinking it out of that wine glass and I have them do that right um and I make sure they can do it before they start treatment and they generally can because again the other part that I have going for me is that people have been waiting so long that by the time they get to me they'll do what I say which is just this lovely um lovely gift that I have but um

[01:28:43] I'll make people be very consistent with that they'll be like oh I have to drink two ounces of wine a night I'll say yes you do you must I want this consistent right that's the thing consistency um and so if someone's saying oh no I drink three nights a week and I'll say all right cut it out you're G to stop I'm going to stop we're all going to stop are there any specific cognitive techniques that people are instructed to be working on when they first wake up no nothing there's nothing no mind game to play It's All Behavior behavior all business yep at CBT I'm a purist and I don't involve the cognitive techniques until week three of five of treatment and that's when we get into things like scheduled worry time working with the thought records and then also one of my favorite things to do with patients who seem to wake up in the middle of the night maybe at 1:00 a.m. they jolt themselves awake worrying about something in particular and if I have a patient like that who every morning every night in the middle of the night wakes up at 1:00 a.m. and says oh

[01:29:54] I'm very worried about thing a I'll say okay thing a here's what I'd like you to do with thing a I would like you to track how worried you are about thing a all day every couple of hours this is called tracking degree of belief and a thought and what you might find is that I'll I'll build on this with an example of a patient that I had actually this might be an easier way to explain it I once had a patient with multiple sclerosis um early 30s pretty disease to have when you're that young uh working a full-time job who used to jolt awake in the morning every morning at 7: a.m. thinking I'm never going to make it through this day my whole body hurts this is a mess I'm never going to be able to do this and she would lay in bed for 2 hours until like 9:00 thinking these thoughts just oh I can't do this by 9:00 she'd get out of bed she'd shower she'd get to work by 10:00 cuz in the Bay Area all these startups don't start till like 10:00 and then she'd act she'd get her coffee work with her assistant do her meetings and if I asked her how how much do you believe that thought I'm never going to make it through this day at noon she'd probably say oh like 60% like this afternoon's going to be rough I don't know if I'm going to make it through but if you ask her at 530 when she's done working or whatnot oh how much do you believe that thought

[01:31:14] I'm never going to make it through this day she'll like oh I made it 0% and day after day she started realizing like oh I don't believe this thought at 7:00 a.m. because it's true that I'm never going to make it through this day I believe this thought because it's 7 a.m. right and once she was able to make that connection we were able to recapture her mornings and at 7: a.m. she went and sat on her couch and she started doing something she loved between seven and N which for her was uh learning Italian with an appp she loved it and 7 to n used to be her most hated part of the day but by the end of treatment it was her most beloved part of the day cuz no one was bothering her and she could learn Italian and whatnot and so one of the tricks and not tricks but cognitive tools that I've built into cbti in that cognitive package is tracking how much you believe a thought over a given day and if you believe a thought in different levels throughout the day how how true can it really be and it's really enlightening and I would invite you to notice what you're thinking about at 1: a.m. and then just see how worried are you or how much do you believe this the next day at 3 p.m. oh not at all hm how come this getss air time at how come this deserves air time at 1:00 a.m. but not 300 p.m. let's talk about sleep supplements right so do you do a purge of supplements when people come to you and they say hey I'm

[01:32:40] I'm taking you know a pound of melatonin every night I'm on an ashwaganda drip uh you know just rattle them off let's we could go through the list can I give you two links for the show notes to uh studies of melatonin supplements that found that these melatonin supplements either had none of what they said they had in them or yes I think we wrote a newsletter on one of them oh great well there's been two and so when people come in and they say they're taking melatonin

[01:33:07] I'm like okay the alleged melatonin how much of this is are you taking but let's assume um that that they're you know because obviously you okay they give a list well let's assume that they're taking they are actually taking melatonin because they're getting it from one of the um uh companies that submits to third party testing so now they know they're doing it and and again let's further um posit that they're not taking a dose that is deemed too high so if you look at some of the Sleep literature you know there seems to be a kind of like most people would agree anything north of a milligram is probably just too much um whereas kind of in the 3 to 600 microgram you know they're they might be some some benefit and and more importantly not just benefit but actually safety like it might be you know you're not sort of downregulating melatonin receptors you're offsetting the natural decline in melatonin levels over time I can tell from your face you don't agree with any of this so no I mean it's it's puzzling so it's it's it's my face is also because it's hard to know where to go with this question because so some countries you need a prescription for melatonin right this is something prescribed by a doctor it is regulated y um I don't remember all the countries off the top of my head like Australia

[01:34:19] New Zealand whatnot you want that you're not going to find it at their Walgreens um but you know in the US diing too much of it can't kill you so here you go right um there are by the time someone gets me if they've got a huge list of supplements supplements and they still have a sleep problem I say okay so clearly these aren't doing what you want they might be undermining what we want to do I don't know what's actually in all of those things because none of that's regulated the data for things like ashwagandha are weak if you want to go

[01:34:49] Bradford hill we could um the data are also pretty weak for melatonin except in certain cases which we can get we can unpack a few of those with the explicit acknowledgement that I'm I'm not a physician I've not been trained in this in the biological substrates whatnot but your question is do I take people off of this stuff yes get off that stuff it's not wor if you want to take it after treatment with me again great but let's get off of it for now and let's see what your body's actually doing because chances are you've been taking you've been adding a supplement or two or whatnot over time for years and we don't even know your body wants to do now and you actually could be shooting yourself in the foot with some of these things right now on the contrary sometimes a patient will come in and will say oh I'm taking a beta blocker for blood pressure now you and I both know that's like a fourth or fifth line treatment for blood pressure at this point nevertheless um beta blockers inhibit melatonin secretion and yet most prescribing doctors who are giving out beta blockers don't realize that there's a significant risk of insomnia when you prescribe these to patients and and I've had some patients who don't need treatment with me at all they need A5 milligram melatonin pill every night and that's it and those are some of the most angry and satisfied patients ever they have one visit with me it's done they're Furious that they've been suffering for 5 10 I had one patient who suffered for 30 years taking oh gosh metalol and he wouldn't he couldn't change his supplement because something having to do with the vocal chords he was a singer and some of the other blood pressure affect that I I didn't fully understand but he would not change his blood pressure med so that was all that he needed but do I think that the average healthy adult should be taking melatonin no no um now there's probably some excellent data that you are much more aware of than I am about how our melatonin secretion inhibition processes whatnot change as we age and there may be some patients who benefit from taking melatonin which is a hormone to induce sleep but remember melatonin is like the guy at the start of the race right he's the guy with the gun he fires the gun he doesn't have a car in the race he's not like helping you stay asleep he's telling you when to start the thing so for a lot of adults taking melatonin is really messing them up because they're trying to go to sleep when their body isn't ready to go to sleep they're forcing it to go to sleep then they wake up in the middle of the night and they wonder why and it's because oh you you went to sleep at the wrong time and your body's all kinds of confused interesting so I really try and take people off of these things so I can see what's really going on and then if there's something going on that looks like it might necessitate melatonin I tag in one of my physician friends and talk about it so what about sleep medications and let's talk about as many as you want right we can talk about benzo we can talk about trazodone we can talk about ambient we can talk about the ereen based drugs um how many of the patients who come to see you are on uh are regularly taking one of these prescription-based drugs for sleep a lot of people take over-the-counter drugs and prescription drugs for sleep and there was a huge shift uh that I noticed um in when when

[01:38:13] Co started and there was a ban on flying to different countries Mexico and and Europe and it turns out there are a lot of people who will fly to Mexico to get their ambient or and fly to Europe to get various sleep drugs that you you can't necessarily get here so all of a sudden I saw a wave of patients dealing with withdrawal in the in the early months of the pandemic because they couldn't go get more of their drugs oh my gosh I'm I'm screwed what am I doing now how do I how do I cope with this so there was a major why why couldn't they get them here in that situation uh

[01:38:46] Ambience prescription only and in you're saying they were buying without prescript I got it and they just they couldn't get a prescription while they were here yes because they were taking so much that they were well beyond what they could convince someone to prescribe them and a lot of Physicians are and a lot of my patients are Physicians and a lot of Physicians are pretty reticent to go above FDA recommended doses when it comes to ambian a lot of people don't realize that I believe I believe this is the case that ambian is still the only drug that is differentially um prescribed to men and women according to the FDA that starting dose for women should be 5 milligrams starting dose for men it's 5 to 10 um for instant release and then for extended release I believe for women it's 6.25 and then for men it's 6.25 all the way to 12.5 because women metabolize it less efficiently um so I mean the people who I've seen I've seen people taking 30 milligrams big big doses right um and gosh this is a very loaded question but there's a lot of patients who come to me who will say I've read something in the news it turns out this medication I'm taking for my sleep is bad for my brain I'll be like oh you saw that huh and and I want to quit immediately I need to quit by next week

[01:40:01] I'm like oh okay and you've been taking it for how long oh 20 years okay right that oh so that never works that never works and I don't have I wouldn't say that I have any sort of extreme expertise in the different classes of sleep meds but what I can tell you is the ones that people most often are coming to me saying I want to quit this

[01:40:23] I hate being dependent on this what do I what do I do these are going to be the benzos yeah which doctors are becoming less and less hip to prescribing for Sleep Ambien the Sonata lesta stuff um and then over-the-counter stuff like badril maybe your occasional doxin and then people are often prescribed rron for sleep and they run into metabolic issues and they need to get off of it so

[01:40:51] I think that covers probably the mo the the broadest swaths that I see of things people wanting to quit now the cuic and some of these newer ones I don't see them as much yet I'm sure it's coming yeah and what about trazodone trazodone is the one that I'm the least concerned about for a couple of reasons I've not seen compelling data that it negatively impacts the electrical quality of your sleep No in fact I've seen data that it does the opposite that it's slightly positive great I mean I I just I'm looking for what's negative

[01:41:23] I think I don't know if that the study that you're speaking of was statistically powered to if the primary outcome was improvements in sleep or decs in sleep I think the I think now I'm trying to remember something that I wrote many probably three years ago I I believe the study looked at sleep duration as the primary outcome um and a secondary outcome may have been staging yeah so I don't think it was powered for that but I think they incidentally did find an improvement um

[01:41:54] I think you've talked about extensively like it's important to think about what was a study power to look at um and all that but I'm not the most worried about that also because it's an anti-depressant drug and if someone's taking it and it is helping with their depression and I take them off of it in the name of trying to help with their sleep I have created a different problem although the dose people take it it tends to not have that effect I mean most people are typically taking it at kind of 25 50 typically no more than 100 um maybe at 100 depending on the size of an individual they're getting some of that benefit I often see 100 for Sleep Y and so for me I'm thinking o I don't know if that's just for sleep right and then I'm also if I see 50 even and then

[01:42:38] I see another anti-depressant I think o these could be working together you actually also have a diagnosis of depression we need to think about this carefully so if if if folks are showing up on 20 Mig of valium or you know Xanax or pick your favorite Ben do you have them go and do a taper detox with their physician before they come into the cbti program no I have them do it with me um most of the times so you will manage the medical withdrawal on that let me explain exactly what I do because scope of practice right so first of all I always work with the prescribing physician I never start without making sure the prescribing physician is explicitly aware of what I want to do I talk with them and this has to be one of your colleagues at UCSF or whoever they're prescribing whoever is prescribing the medication to this person we now share a patient and have an obligation too right I every single time I have done this The Physician has been in support of getting their patient off of benzo except for one time which isn't even worth really getting into but the point is it's an overwhelming amount of most of the time these patient these

[01:43:48] Physicians have already tried to get their patients to to to quit and to reduce um but in my opinion they've tried to do it way way way too quickly and that's because there are physiological dependencies on these drugs and psychological depend dependencies on these drugs and we have to attend to both of them while we're doing this taper process or it's going to be a botch and the patient's going to relapse and we're going to be back at square one or Square negative one unfortunately so here's what I do is

[01:44:21] I'll let's take can we take a a boring example um pick your favorite benzo favorite dose um I don't particularly like them myself take valum valum okay long 10 10 milligram yeah sure okay so let's say we've got a patient on valium they've tried to quit they've occasionally abused they've gone up they they've split an extra in half they've gone up to 15 sometimes whatnot the first thing that I do with a patient is

[01:44:46] I say all right we are going to get you stable actually for sake of better example for Sleep let's just can we can we do ambient CU it's a little more fun and we can make it more comp 10 of ambient every night let's take let's say 10 of ambient every night at the beginning of the night and then let's say sometimes they're actually taking a Fiverr in the middle of the night when they wake up because they want to get back to sleep right I like I like the party dose right not right so let's say there you know some nights it's 15 some nights it's 10 what do we do so the first thing I do is

[01:45:14] I take out the the middle of the night dosing and I say we're done with that you're limited to 10 a night and you got to take it before bed well yes you have to take it before bed you have to take the s time every night but if you're taking if if you're going 15 five nights a week and 10 two nights a week I'm going to make it a 12.5 before bed let's be generous start higher right so we'll we'll agree on a dose that the patient will take and it agreed upon time so the prescriber and I agree on this like okay same page this is what the patient's going to do and they start doing that generally the patient's like no no no

[01:45:42] I'm trying to quit I don't want to take more and I say no no before you quit it must be stable you cannot quit from a point of instability it will not work I've seen people try and people say oh I want to quit I want to go from 10 to 5 no that's not how we roll so let's say this patient is taking 12 and a half and they're like okay I want I want to cut down I'm like all right okay so how does going from 12 and a half to five sound and they say oh my gosh that's going to be really scary I don't think I can handle that and what I actually have them do is I rate it on a scale from 1 to 10 with 10 being the most anxiety-provoking upsetting thing and one being not upsetting at all this is called a subjective units of stress scale Suds okay I have them Suds it so I say okay so going from 12.5 to 5 that sounds really terrifying now cuz they've just done a week right where they're consistent with 12.5 at the beginning of the night they've had no middle of the night crutch and they're not feeling great about that right so then I say okay so how about going from 12 to 10 and they say oh not as bad but that's still like a six on my scale and I do this process all the way until I get them to a one and I'll say all right so next week we're going from 12. 5 to 12 how are you even making that increment yes I can tell you exactly how we're doing that we're going on the internet and we are buying something called a gem scale now you and I both know that people who are wealthy enough to have gems worth measuring aren't measuring their own so the people who are buying those scales are using them for other things and so what my patients end up doing is they buy these scales and they get a full-blown like breaking bads setup in their bathroom like we're gonna okay we're we're cutting pills we're weighing pills we're doing math because the pill actually weighs more than 12 and a half because it's got binders and fillers and what percent do we need we kind of make it fun and they end up having to put the crumbly pill into a shot glass with some water we shoot it and the whole thing we make a whole production out of it right but the point just is they're going from 12.5 to 12 and we do that for like three weeks if they've been on it for years we're looking at three weeks and the first couple nights are a little rough there a little if they're only doing a seven week program with you you're oh no no yeah no this this taper program we make and it will last a year it'll make a long it'll last long time before they enter the this the program this is a separate issue a separate issue and we do this after they' finished cbti treatment during cbti treatment I stabilize them on their meds and we just get it so they're not erratically taking five different cocktails of things when people come in to see me for treatment they'll say oh yeah so Mondays I do ambian Tuesdays I do trazodone Wednesdays is benad dril because they have it in their head because they think they don't want to get dependent on one so they think that by doing a rotating marry of these things that that's actually smart I would have never even thought of that oh yeah well sinister great so I generally work with the doctor and we decide okay here's the one you're going to do here's the dose you're going to do and you're going to be consistent with this vodka on Monday and then tequila on Tuesday red wine on uh Wednesday and then chardonay Thursday and this way I'll never become an alcoholic oh you figured it out Peter so in short I have people really stabilized during CBT and sometimes during week four week three four they're ready to start this and we start them on this program and once I have them in this on in this way they're able to do this on their own so they'll go from 12 to 12.5 for like 3 weeks and they'll be keeping sleep Diaries so they'll see like oh okay and we'll get some confidence and then they'll email me you know they'll message me and they'll say okay so now what and I'll say all right well how are you feeling like how what if we go down to 11.5 how does that sound like sometimes that'll be too scary for some reason crossing the five threshold is really scary so we go from five to 4.75 sometimes and just to be clear this is psychological there can't possibly be a physiologic difference between four and 4.75 and 5 migs of Ambi in fact the the medicine isn't even homogeneously enough compounded within the capsule to like yeah okay so as long as everybody understands that probably not but you know it's a something some for tablets and I don't know about the homogeneous uh I don't know about the requirements yeah because the binder and the active ingredient are are in no like yeah and generic has to be 85% similar to the to the real deal so there's all kinds of mess ups this is remember how I said there's the psychological part and the physiological part this is the psychological part that I think it's left out of a lot of the oh just cut it in half to start decreasing your dose aspect which is dealing with okay what can we physiologically do I'm talking about what can we psychologically do and do you think that this methodology of the incredibly slow taper um with incredibly High Precision do you think it works for opioids so

[01:50:21] I don't don't think I've ever seen that in my clinic it's just not something I've had to deal with I mean for sleep I just mean in general like if if we're dealing with people that are or or is the problem so grave that you have to be a little more aggressive and switch them to a completely different class of drugs like uh that's so far outside my area I can't speak to it but what I can tell you is just that doing this method with the sleep drugs slowly over time people get more confidence and they can make larger reductions at a time time and then importantly Peter when someone gets is tapering and something crazy in their life happens like a child gets diagnosed with cancer or something terrible happens we stop the taper and we stay where we're at so your taper might look like this yep right but there's not a huge rush to get off this thing you've been on it for 20 years better to stably get off it I always joke with people like yeah if you think if you can lose 10 pounds in two days how quickly do you think you can gain two pounds right so when it comes to quitting these meds slow steady wins the race having people gain the confidence that they can do it is such a big part of it and I know one of the critiques I've gotten from folks is like well wait a minute some of these pills have Coatings and but it's a lot of it is psychological so this works really well for a medication taper and people can do it themselves it there's no there's no like magic I mean I think we've kind of covered a lot on cbti and let's now revisit the idea of the the types of things that people should be on the lookout for that need to be addressed first right so we haven't talked about sleep apnea we haven't talked about restless leg syndrome we haven't talked about I don't know what are the other things where you just want to have some sort of sign off that says hey we've also confirmed that these things aren't present or what what gets your suspicion roused that says hey we got to look at something else cuz you're presumably not doing polysomnography on everybody on the way in m so how do you navigate that yeah so I have the wonderful luxury of being able to look in people's charts and see who referred them to me and why they are referred they can't be self-referred uh everybody needs a referral of some kind from and it can be from anybody but I I need a referral a lot of my referrals come from sleep disorder centers because they've already done all of that work up and they say all right it's none of these things so here you go if a p pent tells me I always ask a patient like oh does your has your partner anybody you've slept with ever told you that you snore or that you sound like you're gasping for air in the middle of the night so I I do have a bunch of those types of screening questions and I aggressively refer to colleagues with expertise in those areas it but before treatment with me a lot of times people have a CPAP and they say oh

[01:53:12] I don't really use it I'm not sure about that I say well I'm here to tell you that you should be sure about it and that you should use it every single night it doesn't fit cool I'm going to make a call because we're going to get it to fit there's a different mask you can probably get there's a you know there's all these different issues that we can tackle it just sometimes takes making a phone call and um unfortunately a lot of patients don't have great follow through for their CPAP in terms of just help using it and and figuring it out um so sometimes I have to just make that extra connection um the one thing I think I want to make sure that we put a bow on also is this obsession with bedtime

[01:53:53] I can make you wake up at any time by setting a very loud alarm I can anchor you into your day with a wakeup time and that could be consistent every single day I cannot wave a magic wand and make you fall asleep at the same time every day so when people think all right I'm going to get a handle in my sleep I'm going to go to bed at the same time every night no no no no wake up at the same time every day that's a much more important first step and if you're waking up at different times throughout the week that is the first thing to fix yeah what degree of social jet lag do you tolerate with again just for folks listening social jet lag meaning the experience of changing your sleep time during weekends which could be akin to jet lag if it differs by you know hours um in an Ideal

[01:54:44] World there would be zero right in an Ideal World I wake up at 7:00 in the morning every single day of the week for an individual who says oh but God on the weekends it's just so nice to not have to get up at 7 do you say look give yourself a 30-minute Grace and that would still be considered perfectly healthy great question so during treatment I tell people you need to wake up at the same time every day that ends in da so that means Monday Saturday

[01:55:09] Sunday yeah right so that's all of them that's yeah that's during treatment I to check yeah good there there is no room for negotiation during treatment we're we're in the dictatorship right um but what I do teach people at the end of treatment is how to cope with the fact that life is going to happen when treatment ends it happens during treatment but there's a lot that pauses during treatment to be honest but let's say that you've got a major event on a

[01:55:34] Friday night you're going to a concert yes and you're going to be out way later than usual and what I tell people is look you need to pick which day of that weekend do you want to suffer and which day do you want to feel good because we can sleep in one day you cannot sleep in two days in a row that's going to take you off the wagon we're not doing it so so let's say Friday night you go to a concert and you want to feel good on

[01:55:55] Saturday cool sleep in on Saturday sleep in by an hour on Saturday okay fine go to bed on Saturday night when you get tired spoiler alert you're probably going to get tired past your usual bedtime because you slept in but then Sunday you have to wake up at your wake time and Sunday you're going to suffer but let's say you want to feel good

[01:56:12] Sunday that means on Saturday you're going to wake up at your usual time Saturday is going to be a struggle bus but you'll make it to your bedtime and you'll go to bed at your bedtime then you'll feel better Sunday so you just have to choose when do I want to do suffering okay theed after so basically um Force the suffering into the narrowest place possible mhm you can but you can choose cuz it's it you know sometimes people don't want the suffering to be the next day they want it to be the day after so you get to choose that but I tell people look don't sleep in more than one day in a row it's going to mess you up and generally sleeping in past your bedtime you're not really getting quality sleep when you sleep in past your your bedtime I'm sorry your wake time when that's you know when it's been a pattern for a long time when you sleep in past your wake time you're probably getting some extra stage to sleep you're not getting more deep sleep that's for sure that's not happening we're recording this on a

[01:56:56] Tuesday Sunday two days ago I was flying back to Austin from LA and uh the flight got delayed over and over and over and over and over again um for reasons that are so asinine they're not even worth describing and then we finally got on the plane and taxied and then the water was leaking out of the coffee machine so we had to go back to get another plane

[01:57:24] I'm not making this up but I can I can only tell you how ridiculous this is uh the punchline of the story is we didn't get home till 2 in the morning yeah which is long past my bedtime so what would your strategy have been getting home at 2: in the morning prior to Monday a work day where you do have some leeway you you know I don't have to get up at 6:00 which would be my normal wakeup time um would you have said just get up at 6 stick with it and make it up by going to bed a lot earlier Monday night or would you say sleep until 8: you'll probably feel better then if you woke up at 6 how would you how would you handle that situation I'll say which day is more important for you to feel good on Monday or Tuesday let's say I said

[01:58:07] Tuesday because I'm sitting down with you well then I would say probably try and not to sleep in too much so that you can go to bed at your regular wake time on Monday and not have to like if you sleep in horribly on Monday morning you're going to stay up later Monday night and and then you'll get up at your awake time today and you're you're you will have had shorter sleep for today it will have rolled all the way over so that's actually what I did so I having not thought about this I just slept in I think my wife tried to get me out of bed at 700 and I said can you let me sleep till 8:00 so I didn't get up till 8: but last night you're right I had a very hard time going to bed and I did I it was like 11:00 and I was still up

[01:58:48] Meandering around so you just have to very carefully decide which day you want to prioritize and that's how you make that decision yeah so yeah so you have more control than you think is what's what's beautiful about that and I just I just remind people like you can never really make up for lost sleep that easily because sleep architecture really matters and when you're sleeping in you're not getting more deep sleep you're getting some more maybe light sleep and at worst that's robbing you of maybe some of the deep sleep you would have gotten the following night because you're on a circadian plan here right and we didn't really talk about process s and process C but maybe I can just briefly tell you what those two things would be absolutely okay so process s is sleep homeostasis and that's this sleep pressure idea that we are working on right and every day we build up sleep pressure until it's bedtime and then we capitulate we fall asleep and then we you know our our sleep pressure drains throughout the night while we sleep and then in the morning we are full of you know then we we build it up again the next day and this is just a Denine building up yeah think about that think about it that way and that's also why caffeine is problematic right so caffeine blocks adenosine receptors so that's that you know the caffeine crash when it wears off and then all the adenosine floods The receptors and we experience that oh sleepiness right uh so and that's why taking a nap is so difficult because what napping does is it basically kind of deflates your balloon a little bit of your sleep pressure it robs you of some of that sleep pressure so by the time you get around your bedtime if you've taken a long nap you've reduced how much sleep pressure you would ordinarily have at that time that's why napping could be dangerous and then we have process C which is the Circadian uh process and that just marches on it doesn't really care about your sleep pressure or how much you've slept have you ever I'm sure you've pulled an all nighter but when people pull on nighters what they often will notice how many on nighters do you think I've pulled in my life oh hundreds

[02:00:47] I mean I would need scientific notation to count them it's so pathetic it's a lot so the thing to note about that is that it you're you're sleepy during the night when you're pulling all nighter but in the morning you kind of have a burst of energy and that's the Circadian part speaking up right um and when we look at the the sign curve of it right that that's because your temperature is coming back up your adrenal glands still make cortisol everything still is function right so your circadian process doesn't really care much about the Sleep pressure it says okay if you line these two things up on a graph they look like they talk to each other they don't but but these two processes really determine a whole lot about your sleep and there are things that we can do to support each of them but cbti really focuses on the Sleep pressure aspect by regularizing people's schedules and then it supports the Circadian aspect by some of these little things that I talked about that I don't even know if you can't really call them standard cbti like standardizing what time people are taking their medications for example doing things that we know support circadian viol not eating right before bed in my perfect world you know all of these different zobers which are timekeepers during the day would be consistent from dayto day you eat lunch every day at the same time breakfast every day at the same time all of these things would support your circadian biology and and probably improve your sleep any rules about exercising do you have people that are showing up and you're you're going through your intake and you realize you know based on their schedule based on work based on kids or other uh uh oblig the only time they're going to get their workout in is in the evening and is that in in counterproductive uh or Point put it this way if it is an issue um how do you how do you adjust this is a really nuanced issue I once had a patient who a long time ago who said oh yeah I take the 10:00 spin class in the Castro I was like okay moving on I assumed it was 10:00 a.m. I was that was wrong and I learned that the next week when we were talking about other things but for some people exercise at night is fine for other people it's super stimulating and it also really depends on what kind of exercise we're talking about and I think that one moderating variable here is also going to be level of Fitness if you take a person who's extraordinarily cardiovascularly unfit and you put them in a spin class in the evening do you know it could take their heart rate quite a while to recover you could probably provide me a lot more information about that than I know right and what we know when in order to fall asleep is that your heart rate should be lowering right so if your heart rate is still elevated from a whole bunch of exercise you just did that's not going to help you but if you're super fit and your heart rate recovers really quickly it might affect you less so this this matters I think there was for a long time kind of this General suggestion to not exercise close to bedtime I still think for the most part it applies but I think that it's important to think about what kind of exercise you're doing if someone tells me oh I'm going to a yoga class I find this really relaxing and calming it's a form of stretching me D du fine okay this is the only time a day you can do it you got a job you got kids whatever right I'm not going to tell you to not go just because of the time of day that it is or weightlifting or whatnot but if there's an option if you want to go to a hit class I'm going to say well could we not do it at 10 o'clock at night like I think it would really be great if we could move it earlier um we try try to do that um I do tell people you know I have some patients who've come in and said oh you know like I wake up my my body wants to wake up every day at at 7:00 but I really want to go to this 5 a.m. spin class every day I'm like okay well like I understand exercise is very important I'm a Believer right also your circadian biology has you going to bed at 11:00 and getting up at 7:00 and even if you're getting up at 4:45 to get on your home spin bike to do this thing with this group your body doesn't want to go to bed until 11:00 and we're not going to be able to change that so you're going to have to make that you know cost benefit analysis with do you want to lose that much sleep to do that thing yeah it's um I I it was on my mind because I was my my brother-in-law plays in a men's hockey league and you know you only get ice time late at night so I think they literally play Sundays at 11:00 p.m. or something and he's always

[02:05:11] Fried Monday because you know pretty hard to to play a game of ice hockey and and then uh and then fall asleep right after that so um I want to understand more um kind of how what the what the spectrum of cbti looks like I mean your process sounds super dialed in but also it's quite bespoke you know you've brought a lot of your own expertise um to it and you've created a system where you've got we're going to do the intake we're going to do these five sessions which I think are group sessions the way you described them then we do kind of the exit um you you you bring so much rigor to it is that is that the way it is always done or are there cbti therapists out there who function like psychotherapists and they say yeah we're just going to engage with each other for until your problem is fixed and we'll see each other once a week or maybe once every other week like everything you're doing is sounds formulaic and I say that not in a bad way I think that's probably a big part of its efficacy um is that something people should expect when they are going to a CBD therapist it's something people should ask for I before people start treatment they fill out the Pittsburgh

[02:06:27] Sleep Quality Index and they fill out the insomnia severity index and I tell them look we're going to fill this out when you're done with treatment too and we're going to see how this worked for you we're going to actually take measurements how what type of scores are you getting on the psqi I mean it ranges from zero to 21 I get all the way to 21 wow okay yeah and

[02:06:45] Below five is considered uh no clinically significant sleep problems I relax that to six or seven because if you have a or if you're going through menopause of hot flashes you're going to be uh um elevated on that scale by no fault of your own or or your sleep's fault um and the insomnia severity index

[02:07:03] I mean yeah we see I see all the way up to what was it like 22 23 something like that so I see all the way up to the most severe levels in both of these scales commonly and the average Point drops are are huge huge in in clinic so I don't know if it was like 10 points in the insomnia severity index like it's it's it's very high very responsive to this treatment but back to your original question is I I think I wish everybody did it this this by the book I think there's a lot of practitioners out there who want to do it this by the book I have a luxury to do it this by the book because I'm able to enlist help from my team to help me process sleep Diaries every week and do probably two hours of work outside of my clinic of prep for me so they feed me my stuff that's been built into the systems that I have and I get to and I I'm prepping half an hour before uh Clinic I see everybody for an hour and a half and then I've got my my notes my templates and things but I think that it is very difficult to do cbti when you're not seeing patients weekly because I look at weekly sleep Diaries and I make changes based on that so when you find a cbti therapist I would say ask if you can set up a time in the future that therapist and see them weekly for a set of whatever 5 to 8 weeks and put it on the calendar that way with them if they say oh they don't have bandwidth to do that for another month say okay cool I'll wait and then get on every week and a lot of practitioners also aren't going to necessarily score your sleep diaries for you you can score them yourself if you want to I mean it's not that difficult if you just Google online you can find a sleep diary calculator and it's very easy to do the math yourself um there's a book that I really like called quiet your mind and get to sleep which written by Rachel manber and

[02:08:56] Colleen Carney and Dick boots and wrote the forward and it's it's kind of a guided way through the treatment and you can use that workbook yourself to do it and you can also use that workbook when you're working with the provider but um I think there are a lot of cbti providers out there who can see you weekly and can do this you'll probably just have to do your backend work with your calculations because they don't have the billable time for that uh they'll be busy during the sessions trying to teach you things I would also note that between my sessions with my patients I make them watch very annoying videos that I've made of myself giving a lecture about all of the science because I found that if you explain the science to patients you'll get the adherence here's why we're going to do this people think wait I have problem sleeping now you're going to make me not go to bed this is not what

[02:09:45] I'm going for right and I have to explain to them okay here's why we do this because this will ultimately get you where you want to go mhm but the principles of what I'm doing are not at all bespoke I'm doing the the you know time and bed restriction stimulus control the cognitive Tech techniques the relaxation techniques and and the Sleep hygiene those are the five major components what is bespoke is the way that I set the Wake time because that's not been standardized in literature the way I deal with standardizing medications the way I deal with medication tapers some of the anxiety tools that I bring in like scheduled worry time tracking degree of belief during the thought or track and belief during the day I think that is actually pretty well incorporated into cbti but some of those are a little bit more tilted toward my audience which which tends to be higher in anxiety so I

[02:10:34] I build those in but otherwise find someone on the the website that we'll put in your note show notes who knows how to do cbti and I have a feeling you'll go far the treatment works when you do it and it doesn't work when you don't do it is what I tell all of my patients the book um quiet your mind and go to sleep get to sleep get to sleep um you mentioned that um that's something that people could do in therapy but you also mentioned that it's something people could just do on their own so if somebody's listening to this and they're thinking a I can't afford cbti or B every practitioner I've called said the soonest I can get in is 9 months from now um if my choice is continue to suffer or do something proactively you would recommend that as a great strategy to start they can get that you know they can try some of the apps you know they're they're out there

[02:11:28] I think they have less traction currently they're still in early stages but you know I'm trying to help the rest app but the quiet your mind to get to sleep book people can do it by themselves and I actually had a patient this summer who was on the waight list he got to got his intake and he was like look I'm fixed I did the book it was awesome but I still want to be in this group because I want to see what it's all about I'm not giving up my spot and it was great great having them in the group CU they just cheer at everybody else and said this works when you do it uh any concerns with um extreme temperature changes before bed so people using sauna people using cold plunge taking hot showers hot baths great subjectively for my experience uh a a sauna before bed really seems to help um maybe it creates a great a bigger gradient in temperature drop as I go from high body temp to low when I get into that super cold bed but what what what is your experience with that and how do you manage it through the process well let's first take cold plunge before bed off the table um that's not a good idea because we know that when you get in the cold plunge it's immediately cold on your skin but then once you get out your body is busy warming itself back up and that's not what we want to be doing right before bed right and then I'm going to come to the sauna part by saying that it's another it depends some the theory the the outline that you just gave of the temperature gradient is beautiful it makes a lot of sense for people who are naive to sauna who get in a sauna and it increases their heart rate increasing your heart it might be the same problem as the exercise the exercise if they don't have the rapid recovery they don't have the rapid recovery so that's something to learn about yourself and In fairness I don't actually go straight from sauna to bed it's usually sauna to 30 minutes of

[02:13:05] Netflix to bed so yeah so it it that's going to be person to person another thing to keep in mind is that some people who will go in the sauna at night then drink a whole bunch of water afterwards and then that ends up causing them to wake up more in the middle of the night so it defeats the purpose so that's a consideration also if that's an issue for you um but I would say just don't make it too strenuous some people find that it's really helpful I do best with it a few hours before bed as opposed to right before bed I think it's going to be a do what works situation because we don't have enough data but we are I just started an NIH funded trial where we are looking at people who have difficulty with falling asleep and we are giving them whole body heating at home before bed and we're giving them cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia through an app and we're going to have them do this whole homebased treatment that's going to combine a body based heat treatment for before bed with the cbti treatment and the idea here is what you explained which is that by heating you up right before bed if we're heating up your hands and your feet we're helping you actually open the vasculature and dump some heat it's going to create that gradient and we think that gradient might be important for people with the early kind of insomnia with falling asleep at the start of the night so we're going to see if that helps people in a very like you know using a sauna blanket type thing yeah Ashley someone listening to us uh for the last two and a half hours might assume that the only thing you know about is cbti but it turns out that we've sort of only scratched the surface of your area of expertise and there are other clinical areas that you you have a lot of interest in that I think our listeners would have interest in as well um so the the good news is we've I think um when I say we I mean you um you've delivered kind of a master class on a topic that I've wanted to know much more about you know it's interesting it's a bit of a black box because we send a number of our patients to cbti therapy around the country and I would concur with what you said which is based on their ability to comply the efficacy has been unparalleled simply stated right so um you know we're as far as regular old doctors I think we're pretty good at helping people with sleep given the nature of our practice and how much attention we can pay um and therefore I think just by ourselves we do pretty pretty well um but when we can't and we refer to cbti I'm not I would have to think if there's been a patient who hasn't been helped so that's that's great and but but truthfully you've build in all the gaps for me and I think more importantly I think you've really helped listeners understand this and I hope given people a lot of confidence because what I also take away from this is there's really nobody who should be suffering from insomnia it's it's really not a necessary thing to suffer we there's things we might have to suffer with in life but this isn't one I think from very a very large percentage of the population that's the case I always I almost I'm afraid to say never because you just never know but but there are so many so many people countless suffering from this who definitely don't need to be uh the drawback is we have kind of run out of time to talk about a few other things that are really interesting which is not uncommon on this podcast which means we're going to have to do a part two at some point to to talk about uh eating behaviors thermal regulation uh the impact that that has on uh depression or other things like that so um apologies that maybe we spent more time on cbti than we intended to but um as as I kind of warned you before we started we we we love to just Meander where the discussion goes so um is there anything else you want to talk about on the cbti front um those were that I have a lot of notes on on kind of where I wanted to go but I also realize there's probably something I've forgotten or there's an area you want to double click on no I think that it's really important for people just to remember with this one that even if you don't know what caused your insomnia you can do this treatment you don't have to have figured out oh this is where it started or this was the the root of it all you can start this treatment without that knowledge because this treatment is going to address what you're doing now that's actually perpetuating the problem and don't wait there's never going to feel like a good time to do it now is the best time your life is always going to be crazy you're always going to have 50 more things on the schedule than you wish you did it's always going to be too busy you're always going to have events just do it now because it's so difficult to live with you live with insomnia and all the problems that it causes I had a one I had this patient who was 87 who I finished treatment with last year and she just said my I wish I'd done this 40 years ago you know and it's so don't wait just just do it you won't regret it are you under the impression that obviously people are waiting a long time to see you um that probably speaks to how good you are um and the resources that UCSF provides maybe in combination but if a person's listening to this and they're like yeah I I wish I could work with Ashley but I'm I'm I just want to work with somebody do you have a sense of how large the cbti community is and how long a person should expect to wait um and do the do these therapists ever work via tele medicine so that you have more opportunity to work with folks I think that it is easier now to get than ever largely because of Tel medicine so

[02:19:15] I see patients all over California I'm licensed in California right oh so you're eight people per br braet don't all physically come to San Francisco nobody does great I'm only I only see patients on Zoom now okay which is actually a whole lot safer CU patients used to drive in for example from Fresno they'd stay overnight in a hotel inco screw up everything right um patients would have to fly in in some cases it's just it was nuts but now I can I just see people on Zoom which is great and there's a lot of versions of me who do that and by going to that website you'll be able to find a cbti provider and chances are they do tele medicine there are just so many benefits and one of the great pieces of news about that is that if you live somewhere more rural now it is instantly more accessible to you although we have to hope that the providers take have a you know if you live in Iowa we want to make sure they have license in Iowa because you wouldn't be able to see somebody right they'll be licensed in Iowa um and there's also actually a growing and great thing called cact where I think 40 different states now are members of cact where if licensed in one state you can be licensed in all of these states of course California does not participate because we're

[02:20:26] California y but there are it's it's getting easier and easier and I do think that um there's there's ways you can start to do this on your own if you get that book if you try an app you you can actually do this you just have to remember that as ESP special as each human is you need to try and not feel like a delicate flower with your insomnia just assume that you need to do this as it says you need to do it well Ashley this was awesome uh I I really uh I learned a lot and I'm I'm pretty sure everybody listening did so thanks for sharing and look forward to to round two at some point next year okay thanks [Music]
