## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic

[00:01:04] I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming

[00:01:23] I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our show's members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:28] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription I guess this week is Kevin Sayer Kevin is the executive chairman of the board of directors and the president and CEO of Dexcom during his tenure with Dexcom he's been instrumental in leading the development of new technology including the g5 the g4 and of course now at the g6 if you've followed me for some time you probably know how much I love my Dexcom glucose monitor I consider it to be one of the two most important devices that I wear and I wear it pretty much all the time I would say three hundred to three hundred and thirty days a year I am wearing my CGM it's offered me great insight not just into the obvious things like how does eating food ex impact my glucose although I still continue to learn a lot through that lens but also the impact of exercise sleep and stress on mitigating those things or amplifying those things so for example one of the things I've noticed much more recently is the role that cortisol in the evening plays on my glucose in this interview with Kevin we talked about a bunch of things we talked about how we met in his path to becoming the CEO of Dexcom we talked about how the CGM technology works and what makes the g6 what I conceive to be is the best model yet we talked about the challenges of working in the US healthcare system after getting CGM insured talked about developing an even smaller more user-friendly less costly product while maintaining performance and accuracy and

[00:05:36] Kevin does a really good job of explaining his framework on what are the constitutive elements that would drive a CGM device and you'll see where this performance and accuracy become important talk about what's the next thing on horizon for patients with type 1 diabetes the accuracy of the g6 software improvements for people with type 2 diabetes and the remarkable benefits of real-time feedback that drive behavioral change for anybody using this talk a little bit about

[00:06:02] Dexcom versus the competitors there's basically three large companies that do this Dexcom being one Abbott being the other through the acquisition of Libre and Medtronic and we talk about less invasive options that people have asked about a lot talk about the cost why you need a prescription when there might be an OTC that's over-the-counter option we talk about SmartWatch integration

[00:06:23] Bluetooth exciting collaborations and partnerships and future places for CGM such as in the hospital we talk about lessons learned through failures and successes before we get to this I want to read a disclaimer that Kevin's team has asked me to read and that's of course because he's the CEO of a publicly-traded company this presentation includes four looking statements all forward-looking statements included in this presentation are made as of September 21st 2018 that was the date of the interview based on information currently available to

[00:06:49] Dexcom and are subject to various risks and uncertainties and the actual results could differ Dexcom undertakes no obligation to update such statements with that said and without further delay please enjoy my conversation with Kevin Sayer Evan how are you I'm great thanks so much for making time I don't often come into somebody's office take them away from their work and ask him to sit down and talk you know our discussions have been so interesting over time I was thrilled when you asked me to do this I can't imagine what journey we'll go on as we talk for the next while but I'm really looking forward to it so speaking of which I think I've told the story a couple of times to some friends how we met but it's sort of funny to me because anyone who knows me knows I'm when I'm on an airplane I'm there to mostly just work and I don't really talk to people occasionally if somebody talks to me

[00:07:38] I'll certainly be polite but I'm really focused and and so of course there's about three years ago you and I met an airplane yeah the funny part to me is how could happen which is I'm taking a little break from work to look at one of my 12 favorite watch sites and you look over do you remember what you saw I I do

[00:07:57] I took my headphones off I said are you sure you want one of those you know and I'm the same as you Peter I get on a plane to my wife claims I am the most unfriendly individual in the world because I sit down I wait for that moment when I can open up my computer I'm hooked to Wi-Fi I start working and

[00:08:14] I'm thrilled or I just take a break from life and watch something on the screen so we hadn't said a word and all of a sudden you open up two watches and I go I've got to talk with this guy we don't look at these things and make sure he picks the right one it was a very fun meeting and then neither of us worked the rest of the flight yeah but the best part is we talked about watches for an hour and then we're about an hour outside of New York and at some point we literally hadn't talked about anything but watches but I just sort of said oh are you heading home or heading to work and you said oh you're going to work and then it was like what do you do and then this is a part thing I told you I had only heard about Dexcom two months earlier from a guy named Jake Kushner I don't if you know Jake but yeah and he has his endocrinologist yeah and so I was having dinner in Houston would Jake a couple months earlier and he was showing me his data on his kids with type 1 diabetes that are walking around with hemoglobin a1cs of five point six and he's saying to me it's a game-changer we're done with telling kids with t1d that seven point five is normal in the new normal is five point six and we're having no hypo of events and he goes but we can't do it without this thing called CGM I was like tell me more and he said so we use this thing I think was the g5 that they were using at the time and and I remember sort of think I'm a god that sounds so interesting that's on my list of things

[00:09:34] I need to learn more about and then I asked you what you do and this is what you did they couldn't have made it up no and this is all we do here index come and we do see remarkable results in type 1 diabetes with these kids and with everybody who uses the technology well I've been wearing one now for almost three years I think after that flight you said well you got to come in one day and and well shoot the breeze and within like a week I was wearing one and I've never stopped well and I also use you as a critique because if we give Peter technology you're a very very good critic and very objective versus our diabetes patients who well they love the technology it's life-saving for them for you you kind of look at it from a different perspective and I use observations like that all the time when

[00:10:18] I talk to engineers and as we design future products I love different perspectives on things and one of the things in our culture that is very unique we are very curious as an executive team by nature and curious is the word that I would use we love to learn explore we all wear these things we all wear the new ones in fact I'm supposed to get a prototype of a new one next week that's gonna communicate with some other devices it's really fun and it does allow for learning it keeps your mind going very quickly we put Peter on our g6 technology right as it was approved yeah and well actually I mean I was on that g5x is almost a g6 minus the calibration issue that's right so now let's go back a little bit what were you doing before Dexcom so if you go back in the history of my career I started in diabetes in 1994 I met an individual named al man he was one of the most remarkable entrepreneurs ever and he had designed the insulin pump that is now Medtronic diabetes and we had a glucose sensor there that's why I saw the first one and I worked in diabetes there as the finance person a very much a business person till we sold the company in Medtronic I stayed on with Medtronic for a while and we launched the first continuous glucose monitor at mini Mendham Medtronic back in those days and then I decided I didn't love big company so I left and I found a couple of other jobs that were interesting but I didn't love them my job right before this company was culturally fascinating it was a singapore headquartered singapore public company and i was head of the US operation and the chief financial officer the entire company but we had operations in china japan and all over europe at the same time I joined the

[00:12:06] Dexcom board my dear friend and associate from MiniMed Terry Gregg was the CEO here and as we wrapped our other company down as it became obvious we weren't going to be a US presence the opportunity came to move to San Diego and go to work in Dexcom so I went home after our board meeting in December 2010 and told my wife I I think we're leaving our dream house here in North LA we're gonna go I have another adventure and we moved in here in June of 2011 and it's been just a tremendous right ever since now between the time you spent at

[00:12:42] Medtronic where you were a finance guy but obviously as the listeners gonna learn soon you you have pretty good technical chops on this stuff but you were working on CGM then and you probably just by osmosis absorbed a lot of it but between the what sounds like the mid to late 90s and then your return here via Dexcom were you still in a CGM space nope my position right after

[00:13:04] Medtronic was with a specialty laboratory that ran esoteric lab tests and did that for a little while and my company right before here the Singapore company was a drug-eluting stent business and we had a proprietary drug formulation and a proprietary polymer that was by absorbable so when the drug eluting stent was expanded into the vessel both the drug and the polymer would absorb for better safety rates but getting a stand approved in the United

[00:13:34] States was too big of a deal for a company as small as ours we did specially when Abbott Medtronic J&J and Boston Scientific before of them owned the entire market the LA for you have medical device companies you see technologies you start with a couple they swell up to ten or eleven and then you go back down to three or four this is emitted unwish podcast when we go grab coffee we'll talk about my previous life where I had to know everything about drug eluting stents oh I spent two months interviewing a hundred and fifty interventional cardiologists around the country when I was at McKinsey trying to learn everything about this for our client which was obviously I can't say who but it was one of those four and it was at the reintroduction because remember there was a period of time when they had to go back to bare metal oh yeah and then they had to reintroduce so fascinating topic so basically you came back to this company and what I assumed you were bringing that was of most value was you understood medical devices you understand durable medical goods you understood the law of health care it wasn't that you were the world's expert on CGM no I'd been on the board and I really will never be the world cgm technical expert these guys here are our spectacular but what I did bring air at least I believe is very much that curious factor I talked about and in a very open and aggressive mind to grow our business this company has gone through tremendous change I came in for a couple reasons a Terry's exactly ten years older than me and I was supposed to succeed him at

[00:15:06] Medtronic and that one didn't work out the way we wanted to and when I joined the board that was something we talked about early on and I know knew all these guys I knew the technology very well I knew how bright they were and I just thought it would be a tremendous opportunity let's take another step back just for folks to give him a basic because there's so many questions I get asked about this and

[00:15:28] I went out to Twitter a week ago and said you know it's gonna be sitting down with you and hey folks if you have questions shoot him over and I was really amazed at how many people asked questions and and there are a lot of questions that I could answer truthfully but there's some that I can't so I'm gonna try to assimilate the question so

[00:15:43] I think the first question that I get asked a lot is how does this actually work in other words why is it that even if you don't look at CGM if you just talk about point-of-care glucose why is it that with one prick of blood you can measure something like glucose but you can't measure a number of other things what is it about measuring glucose that enables that well our technology is designed to measure glucose only and the way our sensor works is there is a small wire that's thinner literally than a human hair as thin as a human hair that's inserted subcutaneously into your tissue that wire is very special metal alloys and it's coated with a number of membranes that wire in those membranes then generate an electrochemical signal that goes up into a transmitter that sits on top of the sensor you you've worn it you know what it looks like and inside that transmitter is an algorithm that converts that electrochemical signal to a glucose value so that is the only thing that we have done with this technology there probably are other analytes we could take and develop enzymatic layers that would sense that type of chemistry in fact you and I have talked about some of the things that might be meaningful and useful over time but we've grown so quickly we just we haven't addressed those but I think the key is its it's an enzymatic reaction and I think that's the point I try to make to folks is if there's an antibody that can be linked to it if there's an enzymatic reaction that can be done with that multiple washes that's the kind of stuff you can measure in point of care whereas many things that are complex you can you know you can't measure you know the number of lipoproteins or something like that because that requires NMR it's a very separate test you can't even measure insulin you know either gonna do it through a radio immune assay or you're gonna do it through multiple washes something called an Eliza paste assay where you have to rinse and repeat and stuff like that so out of the gate there are some things that can be measured in a drop of blood which again is different from what you guys are doing and you know glucose is one of them electrolytes lactate bate hydroxybutyrate which you and i have talked about a lot so I mean I guess let's go back and so how deep is that that little filament that sits inside the patient it goes in at a at an angle now it sits in probably a half inch under the skin the insertion that technology of the sensor goes in with a needle the needle comes out there is so many engineering hours into the insertion of that sensor and one of the first things you notice about the Gen 6 product it's an automated insertion the needle is in your skin as the engineers tell me less time that it takes a hummingbird to flap its wings a couple of times so it's in and out very quickly so a patient doesn't feel it and then the sensor rests and the subcutaneous tissue and you really don't feel that sensor at all I think I've commented to you probably the very first time I tried this which was on that prototype that with the g5 of course you are the one is the patient who is responsible for the velocity with which that needle goes in and if you're a human being which we all are I think we're just hardwired to do it a little slower than we'd like because it's so it is you know it's a little uncomfortable with it look it wasn't the most uncomfortable in the world but it's if you're doing it it's scary yeah yeah it is not an appealing thing you look at that our old device which was very functional but you look at it and it truly looks like no I don't know if I want and we've had patients send emails saying I've stared at this thing for six weeks and I don't dare put it in my body we're not having that reaction with a new one yeah and I had that reaction with a number of my patients because as you know a lot of the patients in my practice though they don't have type 1 or type 2 diabetes like me they understand the value of even people would you know quote-unquote normal glucose levels being able to track this but occasionally folks would freak out and they'd say you know you'd go through the all the process of getting them a three-month supply and they you know they've already paid for it because of course their insurance isn't going to cover it they don't have diabetes but then that needle just sort of scares them away of course the other thing that we speculate or maybe it's not a speculation maybe it's just a given is the lack of trauma that's involved with the g6 insertion seems to make for a much more accurate device which the g5 itself was remarkably accurate but

[00:19:55] I don't know if it's anecdotal but in my hands at least the way I track it the g6 seems to be so accurate it's almost hard to believe that there's so many elements that go into the performance of a sensor I believe the insertion process does make it more accurate but that g6 sensor has new membrane technology versus the old one there's also a new algorithm in fact one of the things that has made our company successful during this g6 project in the middle of it our algorithm engineers came and they said we have a better way to do this but as can delay the project if we do it we looked around the room and said but if it's going to be that much better let's delay it and put it in and so we did and we made that decision that algorithm has helped tremendously with the accuracy so all those things together the easier insertion the new murmuring technology the new algorithm I think even the fact that it's flatter on the body and doesn't pull as much as is helpful as well I think on three occasions over two plus years my kids kicked out by g5 you know just and and I mean including once on the very first day I put it in which really bummed me out when I picked up my son and he obviously just not playing around he coursing and he kicked me and the thing came out whereas the g6 yeah it's a lower form factor and obviously this is only going to continue as the evolution of these things goes so you talked about a couple of other things that could be measured besides glucose are there any that you think are commercially viable there's lots that could be interesting but you think there's anything else that's commercially viable we don't know yet but we have so many markets to take our technology to now that we need to capitalize on this opportunity and and take care of the people that we serve and open the other markets where glucose can just be a wonderful tool that we really haven't done that much of yet so approximately how many patients in the

[00:21:56] United States have type 1 diabetes or what percentage population how do you think about it about a million in anything you read in the literature says anywhere from 1 point 3 to 2 million in the United States how common numbers one point five and there are another 1.5 million people with type 2 diabetes who intensively use insulin so they are really in need of a continuous glucose sensor to manage their health now going back to those those folks with type 1 diabetes what percentage of them use one of the commercially available continuous glucose monitors most would estimates somewhere between 20 and 30 percent right now and again these percentages have grown rapidly over the past couple years as we've gotten better and as other products come to the market so you and your competitors and I guess your main competitor is Abbot a banana

[00:22:45] Medtronic yes the three of you collectively aren't even remotely close to saturating the most obvious market for this product which is type one diabetes that's right again hard to speak speculatively about what others think but I assume everybody's also looking at that second group you just mentioned which is another market which is the insulin using patients with type 2 diabetes in fact when Medicare and CMS gave us approval in January of 2017 they approved the use of CTM for intensive insulin using type 2 patients and that was a step that we really needed one of the barriers and it's not really a barrier but it's very interesting as you grow a business and one of the fascinating things about our journey here it makes such common sense everybody thinks well everybody should just have this and the insurance companies were very well insured and very well covered but it's not always easy to get I was in a state not recently not too long ago for example where a patient had to document a certain number of events where their blood Sugar's went below 50 before they can get an X come even if they have type 1 diabetes which is very dangerous which is one diabetic very dangerous for anybody yes you know and yet because of fear for spending money on devices and treatments that aren't useful payers are hesitant sometimes not all of them we get very very good coverage but it is cyclical you know a payer will cover us very well for a two-year period and they'll look and man we've added so many people this technology what are we doing let's slow it down so they'll slow it down through criteria we have a full-on sales team that does nothing but call on those who reimburse for the product and we try and make it as easy as we can there are trade-offs for price and access and we try and negotiate those things on a regular basis I believe over time at least 80% of the people with type 1 and I've said this in public forums 80% of the type 1 intensive population should be using continuous glucose monitoring has there been an economic analysis done ideally of independently but it might be done obviously by one of the companies or more that does the equivalent of what we would think of as an N NT for a drug trial so for the listener and n NT as a number needed to treat this is an analysis that's not done economically this is this is more of a life-saving so how many patients do you need to treat with a certain drug to save a life but you can also start to do these things economically and is there a question of how many patients need to be on a CGM before you either save a life through a hypoglycemic event or maybe a different analysis would be the cost of the CGM versus the cost of the complications from mismanagement so has any of that been done we have done some economic models and studies in that area what we find is the major cost of cgm prevents is exactly what you talked about in the acute setting they prevent hospitalizations so you end up with a specific set of patients who are what are often called hypoglycemia unaware who aren't aware when their blood sugars go low the CGM gives them alerts and alarms and our system also alerts and alarms others who give care to those patients too whereby they can be taken care of that share feature is really one of the most remarkable things we've done here you could be in

[00:26:11] Singapore and your wife could be here if you had type 1 diabetes and your blood Sugar's went low your wife would know and she could call the hotel and wake you up and we hear stories like that all well does Medtronic's product or does Abbott's product do that I believe meant Ronix new product does I believe they do have some sharing capabilities but I I know we pioneered it we're the ones who got it through the FDA and it took a lot of effort so that sharing capability is really good for hypoglycemia unaware that category 1 hospitalization I've seen numbers ranging from ten to thirty thousand dollars for that one you know hospitalization but not everybody is hospitalized we certainly save on the long-term complications of diabetes and that has been measured historically and you know

[00:26:56] I've talked about this with a1c which neither us believe is the perfect measure but in our studies we see at least a half a point drop over the course of a 12-month period compared to multiple finger sticks a full point drop for the patients if you just look at them independently on continuous glucose monitoring use for a six month period that is sustained that drop in a1c weeds to reduce costs in the healthcare system and there are very you know well-known economic models to build that out but here's where the rubber meets the road a 25 year old probably isn't generating all those complications yet and it's 25 year old is with an insurance plan for two years mm-hmm before they move to their next job and they're on another insurance plan for two years so we have to do a better job as a company documenting these economic benefits we run more studies to see how you know how much quality of lives improve to see what we can prevent we are currently building outcome type based models to whereby we can look we can go into an insurance company or a payer and say look here's what we think we can save you if we can put everybody on CGM but we're creating a new industry here it's a completely new business so every day is a challenge like that and every day there's more thoughts and more things to address along those lines the

[00:28:16] Medicare one is the most interesting I spoke at a conference on on a January Wednesday where I told a group of our investors we would not have Medicare approval for 18 months and we got it Thursday that makes you look not terribly well it makes me correct and and the way it was approved our device talks to a phone or a dedicated Dexcom receiver the way it was approved for the

[00:28:43] Medicare patients is they couldn't use the phone app yet our Medicare patients are the ones most likely other than children to need to share the data with somebody else it took us I want to say 18 months we finally got the phone use approved for the Medicare patients when you're creating an industry like that there are all sorts of hurdles that you run into that you don't contemplate you just kind of have to react I mean I think that's one of the challenges that folks face in this industry in general which is the policy piece of it is hard because you don't exactly know from a long-term planning standpoint exactly what changes are going to come about you know the challenge that you raised I think is I'm glad you brought it up because I think it's one of the most misunderstood issues in the US healthcare system I grew up in Canada and I'm actually not incredibly that impressed with the

[00:29:37] Canadian healthcare system I know that's gonna make me a lot of enemies out there but I don't think it's like a panacea I don't think necessarily Canada's doing it right either but there's one thing that I think a single-payer system at least one thing a single-payer system brings over a system that we have in the

[00:29:50] United States which is the incentive is aligned between the payer the patient the provider over a long term it's easier to align incentives because one way or the other that payer is going to pay its really pay later yeah that's right which by the way we were we were talking about children before we went on the mic and you know you had great piece of advice which I'm gonna ask of you to share with others but my brother's advice which is my brother has five kids his piece of advice is pay now or pay later pay now or pay later you know if you can through discipline your kid when they're five or you're gonna discipline them when they're older you know user but this thing with healthcare is if you have that 25 year old and the difference between them having a hemoglobin a1c of 8% versus six percent in the next year it's nothing it doesn't matter but in 20 years it matters beyond words I mean if you as the payer are on the hook for that one way or the other the economic model becomes so much more straightforward because you don't have the portability of healthcare that's right again I'm not close enough to this to know if a single-payer system is even something that's viable in the u.s. it strikes me as politically very unviable you know who knows that said it's not what you're dealing with now so you've got to be able to you have a harder challenge to make the case economically

[00:31:06] I suppose no we knew but again we're covered by ninety nine literally 99% of all reimbursement authorities where coverage is a little spotty still is in the Medicaid programs we've got several states but it's still there's a lot of documentation required we're covered where it gets difficult is the documentation the patients have to provide or the physicians have to provide and consistency of co-pays and things of that nature we're also classified as durable medical equipment so our patients have a cocaine addict table which leads to a very seasonal business for us because in the fourth quarter most of our patients are maxed out on their deductible and co-pays and they want to buy everything they possibly can it's like Christmas it's like Christmas so from October to the end of December here it is all hands on deck that's interesting what percentage of your patients I'm guessing it's very small but do what me and my patients do which is it's a cash pay business there's no dealing with insurance it's directly from you know physician writes the prescription and the patient comes straight to Dexcom not very many again like you do we have cash pay patients and everybody in your system uses prescription is important for the regulatory folks that I point that out not as many as we used to we used to have a lot of Medicare patients who paid cash I see but once Medicare covered we actually had to refuse the Medicare cash patients because if we took cash

[00:32:27] Medicare while Medicare covered advise we were in trouble and it took them seven or eight months to figure out how we can ship and process this new product code so we had upset patients for somewhere between six and eight months before we could start serving them properly the people who don't live in the United States that are listening to this are scratching their heads thinking what is going on over there it is a we have a really complicated healthcare system yeah we do but look there are some things that I think it does well and I think you know one of the things that does well is it seems to set up an economic engine that allows for an innovation that I think is hard to do outside of the United States oh I'd agree with that and I don't think it's a small accident that the disproportionate share of the innovations come out of the u.s. so you know kind of one back to some of the technical stuff you have a partnership you have a collaboration with verily we do so tell people what is verily how does it have what does have to do with Google and how did that collaboration come about and how does it work well the way it came about was interesting back in 2015 there was a healthcare group within the walls of Google before alphabet came around and they analyzed technologies where they felt they could develop technology that would make an impact on future products and they also analyzed disease states where they felt they could use

[00:33:46] Google's or Google Health Care's analytic capabilities to develop better care models Google has made a couple of attempts at health care and they came down and met with us and said look we've looked at your product we've looked at what you do we have a lot of electronics expertise we have expertise and data analytics and a bunch of other areas we would like to partner with you Ellen told us they were going to talk to other glucose sensor companies as well we looked at that and said you know what this Google is a big company and and they do a lot of things and we've looked at their concepts and their thoughts and they've looked at the problems different than we do they look more at miniaturization in size and convenience and the things that consumers look at because we as a company again serving our our population of people with type 1 diabetes are anybody would tell you this our core principle has been performance and accuracy will performance and accuracy we always want to build the best we were the first to be connected but as far as really getting the thing tiny or something that somebody without diabetes could wear that had not been a focus here and you know that they wear for fitness so when when they came down and presented this this to us we decided that as an electronics and design partner that we would like to work with them so after several months of negotiations we we not several months a couple of months we signed up a deal and we're Co developing future products for

[00:35:14] Dexcom those products will be Dexcom sensors those membranes and those algorithms that we've developed to make our sensor accurate and perform very well will come from our core technology that we've always developed the electronics and in some of the communication and the Bluetooth and those other things have been driven by the very early engineers that's where they have great areas of expertise the overall package of mechanical part of the system we've done together we've talked about this Peter we focus on performance patient convenience and usability and then taking cost out of it we kept all three of those in mind as we did that yeah it seems to me and I like your framework right so let me see if I remember what you said it's it's gonna be performance performance how accurate is this thing end of the day that's the single most important thing if it doesn't perform who cares what else it does right then the patient experience how big is it how easy is it to use how often you have to change it you have to separate the sensor from the transmit you know all that what is the software look like yeah yeah and then cost an in cost it seems to me having been fiddling around with this thing for a while that the the step between G 5 and G 6 you're now on the asymptotic part of the performance curve there's not a lot of performance gain at this point is there there is some performance to gain boy we spend a lot of time studying this and talking about this as far as just bringing the overall accuracy percentage down there's not a whole lot to gain where there is a gain on the performance side is bringing that that curve of performance you have a bell curve of performance for every sensor yeah pushing that bell curve in to whereby every experience is the same most of them are the same now and we believe it's very consistent but that consistency and reliability enables us to do two things number one enables us to do very sophisticated things with people who want to control their insulin dosage with our sensor via whether through an artificial pancreas system or on their own using our data but the other thing it enables to do if that performs the same all the time it will enable us to go out to broader markets because people won't question or challenge the data they will see it in okay this this is right this one works you know we call it internally eliminating the outliers and I know every company does this with what they build and and so performance wise that's where we're headed there and those are the things that we look at and in our meetings all the time you know I don't even know if I told you the story it's kind of funny about a year and a half ago a mutual friend so it's a friend that I introduced to you but I won't

[00:37:41] I'll keep his identity private he introduced me to Andi Conrad at verily but it was through some completely unrelated there was a different reason for us to meet so I'm up there and I didn't I at the time I just I either didn't know that you guys had worked with verily or I just hadn't put together so I'm sitting in his office and I see these mock-ups of things that look like next-gen see GM's and I said

[00:38:03] Andy what are those and he goes oh yeah we work with this company called Dexcom and of course I lifted up my shirt and showed him at the time it was a g5 and oh my god I mean it was I felt like Dorothy this was like Oz I couldn't believe what the future could hold so going back then from a technical standpoint cuz you alluded to what the future could hold right now you are measuring glucose in subcutaneous fluid yes that's correct not in blood not a people need to understand that so even a relatively lean individual has enough subcutaneous tissue that the risk of using this thing it's like it is is it an issue in kids cuz I've seen some tiny little kids with type 1 diabetes sometimes it is and parents learn how to make sure they inserted and that the needle doesn't go into the muscle tissue there will be an occasional instance where a sensor may go too far in the tissue and but by and large no it's very successfully there's a meeting in

[00:38:59] Florida every year a group called children with diabetes and look at all the kids who wear this it's not an issue for children they do extremely well with it you know I don't know if I'd ever told you the story but I was at a swim meet because my daughter's for me I had just finished my swim workout at the same pool so I'm in my bathing suit finishing my workout as the kids are about to start the meet and this kid comes over to me and his eyes light up like saucers cuz he's he sees that I have a sensor on and he's got a sensor on and he is tiny he is the littlest kid I've ever seen and he was like do you have type 1 diabetes

[00:39:33] I said no why anything he looked I didn't even realize that what he was looking at and I said he said because you're wearing the same thing I'm wearing and I said oh hey little buddy let me tell you I volunteer to wear this thing that's how cool it is to wear oh that's great yeah he loved that he loved that there was some adult who was wearing this who didn't quote-unquote have to wear it but I was like yeah we're the coolest guys here I I assure one of the most humbling things about this job is when I go out to a diabetes function and meet the children or the adult patients whoever who has had this device saved their life or change their life the way that it has they want their picture taken with me I said how about we just take care no we want you nobody wants it needs their picture with me no they want to take a picture they are so gracious they are so I know they're so indebted to our company and it's really why we come to work every day what keeps us going we had my favorite meeting ever an 11 year old young man comes in we sit down and and and people come to San Diego on vacation and they come to decks con so we got

[00:40:41] Legoland SeaWorld and xxxx come and parents will bring their kids in and if whichever the executive is here we'll take him on a tour of the factory then we'll sit in the conference room with them because that is the best market research in the world to sit and talk to somebody who uses this each and every day this 11 year old young man said I have some questions ok he tougher than any animal he pulls like a legal pad out of his notebook out of his backpack and he has 40 questions he wanted to know the chemical composition of the membrane 11 he's at and we just looked at me go no we're not going to tell you all those things but he had thoughtfully written out all these questions and then had a several suggestions for us it's just amazing and your story it happens all the time yeah it's it's really special and I you know I do have a friend of type one diabetes and she did say something to me that I've thought a lot about since she said you know Peter you have the luxury of if you don't want to wear that sensor for a couple of weeks you don't have to wear that sensor she goes I don't have that luxury like again she wasn't saying that to be critical of how much I loved using it she was just saying like understand that my relationship with this cgm is different from yours this is my lifeline for you this is just a gain in your health but it's not necessary for you to for you to function and I I was sort of humbled by that a little bit and I realized you know I can understand why someone who's got type 1 diabetes has sort of a a different relationship with this on both extremes on both extremes it it is love a lot of time it's sometimes hey and the hate I think is the I have to do this I have I have to have this thing on me I had two close friends in residency who had type 1 diabetes and this was back in the Wild West I mean it was I couldn't believe how archaic it was and how hard it was for them to manage their diabetes because you know in a surgical residency it's very difficult to predict when you're going to eat oh yeah and therefore it's very difficult to predict when you're going to use insulin and which insulin you're going to use and I remember one of my friends who's now a cardiac surgeon in Minnesota there would be times when he always had to have a thing orange juice and candies in the O

[00:42:53] R next to his pager and you know he would hopefully get to the point where mo you know he could say to a nurse while he's operating hey I need some orange juice quickly and she would bring over the orange juice and tuck the straw behind the mask and let him sip some orange juice or stick a candy in his mouth or something like that if he was you know this was an operation was supposed to be done in three hours and now it's five hours that kind of thing we take for granted in many ways like what this disease meant before Banting oh I I don't know how people did it well they did it they managed and then people who have lived long healthy lives but this tool is so much better than what we had before and the things that can come in the future we made an acquisition a couple weeks ago the next thing on the horizon for type 1 diabetes let me take a step back is to develop algorithms to go with the sensor because right now we tell your glucose value we tell you your trend we tell you how fast you're going up or going down we will give you alerts and alarms based on what's going on but we don't tell you what to do and algorithm it developed for automated insulin delivery that will automatically do things for you one product that we're partnering with is tandems new insulin pump and it shuts off when your glucose goes too low and then turns back on based on sensor signals in the early read on that product from consumers has been wonderful from patients but these algorithms are getting more and more sophisticated explaining for the listener where that product sits how does it actually work so there's an insulin pump that is on your body it's about the size of a good old-fashioned pager and they used to carry around in your hand and there's an insulin cartridge inside that pump contains software that regulates the delivery of insulin with a with that through that insulin cartridge to a small infusion set but it is usually placed on your abdomen a little teflon cannula goes under your skin and the sensor resides another place on your body and the sensor signal is read by that pump which then takes all the information about insulin that it knows how much has been delivered your glucose value and will determine at least for this system if your blood sugars go too low it turns off insulin delivery for some period of time then turns it back on when it sees the trend that you're coming back up algorithms over time will do more than that they can regulate your insulin delivery all throughout the day whether you're higher your low and detect things like meals I mean if this is very futuristic but there are algorithms that will detect okay it's very apparent that

[00:45:28] Kevin just ate let's put some insulin in here and see how it goes there are algorithms again to take care of you more during the night time because during the night time while you sleep you're not eating you're not exercising so there's not as many variables involved so we acquired one of these algorithms two or three weeks ago just because it's an asset we felt we needed to have and develop not everybody uses an insulin pump not everyone will have access to that technology it's not inexpensive either we think a lot of people will but we also think we can take these algorithms and apply them to people who use multiple daily injections as well to develop decision support you know I always tell the engineers I want the staples button I want the easy button I want to take a shot and I want to hit something and say how much insulin do I take or I want at 10 o'clock I want to hit a button that says

[00:46:20] I'm about to go to bed what do you predict is going to happen those types of things are an engineer's dream which is what again why it's so fun to work here we have chemical engineers software engineers electrical engineers mechanical engineers package any engineer you could think of well the algorithm guys and along with the the wonderful asset we acquired are gonna look at developing those types of decision support tools to help make this easier for patients to make good decisions now the question becomes how much benefit does that add to their care if they only go from 8 a 1 C to 7.8 it's probably not worth it and nobody's gonna pay for that but we think we can build a very strong outcome case over time but even if you went from 8 to 8 but reduced bad outcomes what were the hypose yeah and reduced hypos yeah that often time happens your a1c may stay the same but your time hypoglycemic may go away that's the thing I was impressed with

[00:47:17] Jake's data went way back even before you and I met which was they dropped hemoglobin a1c I want to say like 2% on average but they reduced the high post - oh yeah and that's the part that like I remember in medical school the standard teaching was you don't care about the Hyper's are fine yes you can go to hyper but the thing that you have to ward against is the hypo and you'll accept a higher a1c to do it and I think the tide is changing I think people are understanding that because of how long a person is gonna live with type 1 diabetes the microvascular complications are real and as you probably know there are data that actually suggests when I saw this through Jake's work that better glycemic control in kids when they're young these are not randomized so there's an obvious confounder here but it can predict better intellectual performance in school and stuff like that now again the the obvious confounder there is may be the kids that have better glycemic control have better glycemic control because of some other variable that's impacting their performance later on socioeconomic status or the education of parents or the attention of parents so there's you know lots of other things there I don't follow this literature closely so it's possible that there's actually been a randomization that would allow for determining that but the other thing we talked a lot about average blood glucose and instantaneous blood glucose but another variable that I find very informative is the standard deviation so every day I look at my report I always do the 7-day report that's I want to see the 7-day report every day and that's showing me my average blood glucose for the last seven days and my standard deviation and then every in a month or so I want to see my 90 day trailing report and you brought up hemoglobin a1c earlier you know I'm one of those people for whom hemoglobin a1c is categorically useless because I have beta thalassemia minor so my red blood cells are very small they stick around for very long periods of time my hemoglobin a1c on a blood test generally varies between five point six and six point zero basically I'm pre-diabetic on a yeah on that test on that a test but using CGM for the last few years and calibrating it because even the g6 I still calibrate everyday just to we left that option in by the way that is a very elegant option that's that's basically when I took my Libre and threw it out the door because I was used to use the two in parallel and I just gave up on the Libra because you couldn't force the calibration and it was so inaccurate and you couldn't get real-time I mean there was just too many problems with it to even discuss here but using these forced calibrations I realize this thing's plus or minus 3% they and there are there are many days

[00:49:50] Kevin when it is the exact same number and I think to myself this can't be happening you know the the meter says I'm 88 and I poked my finger and it says I'm 88 and I'm like yeah we call we call that the unicorn yeah but I get a lot of unicorns today before I came here I did a calibration and I don't know the device said 89 and I was 88 or something

[00:50:11] I mean it was staggering it's an interesting dynamic because you are very focused on accuracy I would say the biggest benefit of g6 to our users has been the accuracy without the calibrations we had somebody in yesterday who's been on our product for a very long time one of our Dexcom warriors and i asked him how was it going and he held his hands out to me and he goes my fingers have not felt like this for 15 years and that's how long I've had diabetes well that's and that's another one chin point you bring up which is when I do my fasts I'm calibrating twice a day I'm checking ketones two or three times a day just 14 days of that kind of checking my fingers are all blue oh yeah and they hurt like crazy and that's another realization for me which is think of all those kids that that is their life that's right it it's its it sounds like how big a deal is that it's really painful in fact you start to lose sensation one day I was upset about some clinical results I saw because we were calibrating the center with a meter and it became apparent that the meter was off so I got my car I dropped to the drugstore I bought three meters and I stuck my finger 60 times in a day 20 times with each of the three meters and

[00:51:29] I made my own little spreadsheet recorded all the meters recorded the CGM reading to see what had happened because in the old days when you had to calibrate this device twice a day a bad finger stick would set it off for a while now we have since revised the algorithm to identify a finger stick that we just think is inaccurate and we'll wait a while and ask for another one if somebody enters him but it was very discouraging because we'd submitted a clinical trial to the FDA based on a meter from a large company that we were told was fabulous and it turned out to be high all the time and that drives our accuracy level off do you have a point of view about which of the commercially available drugstore meters do you find the most accurate I wouldn't offer that

[00:52:12] I have idea I think most of them are okay I would tell you my experience the meters isn't is also about the consistency so oftentimes when I'm wearing our sensor and go to check the accuracy no I don't enter the calibrations like you I like to see what the patient is experiencing but I'll stick my finger twice in a row and get like some meters I'll get a big difference others I don't get and do you do two sticks or same blood I vary it okay so here's a little tip that I've learned and maybe you've already heard this from patients but by washing your hands before you do it then using the alcohol you can get some false elevations if you have any food on your hands if you have just a little you know again like a crumb on your hand can actually raise the glucose so and I remember my friend in residence he again

[00:53:00] I'm glad I'm not identifying as I'm gonna call him out I mean he wouldn't even wash his hands before he'd be poking his finger cuz he was just like you know on the gold yeah I'm the ghost I got it I don't have alcohol pads I'm just gonna poke my finger and you know but you know those little things do I think add up to little bit of benefit for what it's worth I guess I can say what I like the most for glucose I like the OneTouch ultra okay I've switched to that I used to use an Abbott meter or a different meter by it I think was by Abbott and I don't know I found the one touch altar to be pretty darn good and I've done the same sort of experience the thing you've done where they've done multiple steaks multiple fingers blah-blah-blah-blah-blah going back to finish the a1c thing my 90 day trailing average glucose under these very tight conditions shows an imputed a1c of 4.5 to 5.1 depending on how tight my nutrition is so in other words my hemoglobin a1c is a full percent higher oh yeah and that's actually posed real difficulties for me when applying for life insurance because they say you're pre-diabetic and I say I'm not a pre dive I know and they say yeah but cheery mclogan a1c is you know 5.8 or whatever it is and I I've had many interesting discussions with the actuaries as I explained the limitations of hemoglobin a1c but if I could you know be health czar for a day and wave a magic wand I would love to have you know something that meets all of your criteria right so it does the performance it's got the patient it costs very little but I really think that if everybody had a CGM on every minute of every day in some completely you know fantasy based way where it doesn't hurt it's not doesn't cost anything but they had that data it just drives such a behavioral change and

[00:54:41] I think that that's why the use of CGM even without a deliberate intervention superimposed improves outcomes because it is really hard to not pay attention to how activities in your life mostly food but not just food stress it's amazing what stress can do to your glucose level I think one of the first insights I remember coming and talking to your team about a couple of years ago was how high nighttime cortisol levels were raising my glucose levels at night you know I'd go to bed with a glucose of 93 hours after eating dinner and I'd wake up with a glucose of 105 and you know once I started measuring nighttime cortisol levels by collecting urine overnight I could sort of correlate this amount of cortisol produced at night to how much that glucose level would rise in the morning and today I'll tell patients that you know fasting glucose is not nearly as helpful as people think it is inside of a reasonably physiologic range so someone who has a fasting glucose of 130 that's a different situation there's are something going on there but I have patients that get very upset if their fasting glucose is a hundred instead of being ninety and I say you know it's it's very difficult to understand what's going on there that can very easily be explained by cortisol or hepatic glucose output for some other reason that's not you know a function of insulin resistance so that's why I just think that these tools are so valuable and like even yesterday I was on a late flight coming back from I was in Chicago and I just hadn't eaten much and my flight was delayed that's hitting so I wanted to like the little store near the gate and they don't sell anything but crap absolutely yeah and I've already like there are certain snacks that I love and they're kind of my comfort food when my flights are delayed like I feel like I deserve a treat because I'm stuck in the airport and I bought one I bought my treat my treat is trail mix I love trail mix will spike you as fast as anything you can eat yep so I get on the plane and I buy the big trail mix because I don't know anything in modern it's got you know it's full of M&Ms and raisins and peanuts and little whatever and I get on the plane and I'm looking at the bag and I'm looking at my glucose and my glucose levels great and I just decide I'm not eating it so I didn't eat it oh my goodness I promise you if I didn't have that CGM I would have eaten it but I just didn't feel like looking at that glucose of because I know I've done it in the past I eat that whole bag of trail mix my blood glucose will be 130 easily oh then that that shows what good shape you're in because that'll get me up to 150 or 160 it'll get me it'll get me higher the the worst glucose experience I've ever had was in an airport and I had been with investors all day long and I had not my glucose hadn't spiked at all because when I sit in those meetings all day I don't even and I'm in the airport and I'm in Boston and I see you know what I'm gonna try something here the yogurt-covered raisins in the little thing where you turn the wheel like the bubblegum machine got myself a cup of yogurt covered raisins I think there's some chocolate raisins in it too and ate the whole little cup of them and I'm telling you that was my only ever above 200 glucose spike in my life and it only took 30 minutes it just mmm right up as fast as possible and it came down very quickly as well yeah I mean it overshoots it probably came down to 60 and then it overshot and I was yea over shot down in the in the low 70s because I put so much glucose into my body that's how my pain cures reacted but all of our bodies behave differently we've talked a lot about type 1 diabetes today and one of our visions going forward is to get into other other conditions and you're certainly a pioneer in this and in really one of our first we've started doing work in type 2 diabetes so again let's paint a picture we've talked about kids with type 1 adults with type 1 who have to deal with insulin their entire lives or they die and the device is a love-hate relationship because it always reminds them now let's look at somebody with type 2 diabetes they're my age 60 years old may have had type 2 diabetes for five years all they do is they go to the doctor they get some pills that get a meter they go home and nobody tells them what's going on and they say you need to eat less and exercise more and take your pills and after five 10 years of this all of a sudden you're anyone sees at 11 and what do you do so we start adding more drugs and you can turn on the television anytime you want to and you can see more type 2 diabetes drug advertisements probably than any other pharmaceutical product because these drugs are expensive and there is a big population here to be addressed so we start prescribing other compounds hoping the a1c will come down and it might come down a little bit it might not and if it doesn't come down enough we prescribe another compound and another compound at another compound and some point in time that patients gets the dreaded information they've got to go on insulin but type 2 diabetes I'm not a neuro scientific issue but it's almost not diabetes it's almost a completely different disorder with all the insulin resistance and all the other things that go on in your body yeah the biggest disservice that I think has been done to this field this is hyperbolic I mean there have been many disservice a''s it's the fact that we refer to them both as diabetes now I understand why historically that's the case but you're absolutely right type one diabetes and type 2 diabetes are so different and I try to be disciplined about always referring to them that way and not just saying diabetes because it really does a disservice to them what you point out is very important Kevin which is that the real problem in type 2 diabetes is that we have fixated so much on just the glucose and not worrying about how we get there so when you use a class of drugs that increases endogenous insulin production and or when you use more insulin what you reduce is the glucose and what you reduce are the micro vascular complications you do not save lives they're still getting cancer they're still getting heart disease you're still getting Alzheimer's disease at a much higher rate the challenge in type 2 diabetes is the combination of the hyperglycemia with the hyperinsulinemia so the therapies that save lives in type 2 diabetes would be things like metformin where you're actually fixing the glucose side of the equation and not just adding more insulin to the system the sglt2 inhibitors these are the things that are getting the glucose out of the system which actually brings me to a question based on something you said earlier is there any way it is algorithmically possible to estimate let's say the average insulin that a non diabetic would make over the course of the day based on glucose if you had some data points so if if I came to Kevin's head look let me go and get under test conditions certain levels of glucose and insulin that are associated we developed a you know a kinetics model for it and then by tracking mice continuous glucose data over time could we ever try to estimate what my insulin levels are in between we have some studies that are very preliminary and I really can't talk too much about it but we do believe that it's possible to measure how quickly insulin reacts and how by the slope of the glucose curves but not at our five minute measurement intervals so we're looking at other ways to record data to develop algorithms to do that but it's very preliminary right now I think over time and this gets back into another thing that Dexcom will do over time we have an open architecture platform as well hmm so we've developed api's 2 whereby we will provide data to other software platforms if they can analyze glucose values better than then we can one drop there are a number of them they ever produced a lot for us commercially but we've made the decision that this is the type of company we want to be because we just can't do everything I think over time that might be something that we'll look at but else might be something somebody might be able to look at better than us your raisins won by the way this is so funny because I've had a number of those experiences my similar to that one where I was shocked was grapes grapes are awful yeah I thought blue coasts values yeah I had not eaten anything in about 18 hours you had grapes the glucose sensor on and I was so pissed off I was like I thought the thing was broken I was like ready to rip it off my body was like there is no way my glucose is this high after I haven't had a grape since that was about the 6 months ago and I was on an airplane about a month ago and they they had like a snack tray and it was like some cheese you know a strawberry and some grapes and it had like five grapes and I was actually really hungry I ate everything but I didn't eat the five grapes now I'm sure the five grapes wouldn't do anything but

[01:03:43] I'm I'm boycotting grapes I've done with that what I call quasi fruit well I have I have not eaten many yogurt-covered raisins since that episode in Boston either so there you go but see that's my point right I think see GM has the potential to change the way people eat more than any other technology I have ever laid eyes on I'm heavily biased

[01:04:04] I mean I've stated my bias many times I'm a very big proponent of CGM but I also believe in real-time feedback I think it's very difficult to curb a person's behavior when the feedback loop is so long and the weight on the scale the blood test that you get at your doctor every six months those things are valuable they help but nothing Trump's the 30 minutes after I eat the chocolate-covered raisins hey I see what it looks like and now I can correlate that feeling of I feel like crap an hour later because my glucose has gone from 200 to 60 that's a crappy feeling you don't that's not physiologically reasonable and now people see why so overtime where this gets very interesting is that core technology platform I talked about where we make products perform well that patients will use and that cost less never goes away but there's a software element to what we do that we can change dramatically given the experience we want a patient they have or that a patient needs and yet I'll give you the perfect example are type 1 patients the alerts and the alarms at nighttime while they sleep are absolutely critical but somebody with type 2 diabetes who's taking these compounds that may not be as critical for them but what would be critical is an analysis at the end of the day where where we complement somebody on G you kept your glucose within range extremely well or insights as we look back what did you eat for dinner today or integrating the CGM data into a food database to whereby you take pictures of what you eat over time and when you go back you look at that food and say well

[01:05:48] I ate those scrambled eggs this morning and my glucose values didn't go up maybe scrambled eggs for breakfast there's a good thing for me and then you take a picture of pancakes and the next time you sit down to eat if you take a picture of those pancakes you get reminded you know you had pancakes a month ago and that may not have been the outcome and I think this is the kind of stuff neutrino is working yes and I agree that that's that stuff is so powerful I feel like you know people assume I know a lot about food because of you know sort of the work I've done and the things I've talked about and written about and but the reality of it is I'm still humbled by how much I don't know because it's not just what you eat but it's the physiologic state you are in when you eat it it's very different what happens if you eat a bowl of pasta after you've exercised you know 30 minutes after a hard workout versus you know eating it after having not exercised a very different glycemic responds stress we've talked about this and it can't be understated how much higher my glucose levels are when my sleep is crappy a hole or the correlation between high glucose levels and crappy sleep because if you go to bed with very high glucose levels after eating a very high carb dinner I've seen a direct correlation between my sleep and my glucose values yeah personally anyway I can't make this case enough now we talked about there a couple other companies out there that are doing this is there any publicly available information that compares the performance and fidelity of the Abbott product or the Medtronic product to your current product we all have accuracy tables and our user guides but they're biased towards the way the companies want to project themselves we have studies that we've published comparing ours to the other products we maintain our performance all the time yeah it's not subtle in my hands I mean I've been pretty vocal about it it's not a subtle difference and it isn't we perform extremely well across all the range of glucose in the low and in the high range

[01:07:38] I won't speak as much to the other guys our patients know our patients know what a Dexcom is versus the others and we can live with that one do you think that you will be able to maintain performance as the sensor gets smaller and smaller so in other words is there a day when there's going to be a one millimeter sensor so something that really doesn't even get into the interstitial but is still sort of in the you know dermis itself that can perform this well or is there just a technical limit to being able to do this without accessing interstitial fluid for us today we've only go down to the interstitial fluid we have looked at technologies that would go down more shallow we have with an R&D group an advanced technology group who looks at nothing but things like that our secondarily product one of our goals is to have a shorter sensor and to make it smaller but there are complications of a shorter sensor what did the membrane layers look like so you can get an extended wear on a fourteen-day sensor housing electrochemical reaction on a 14 and you know on a longer life sensor if it's shorter versus the one that we have now so we go through a lot of trial and errors we look at these things to determine what is the best combination of all of these features I think we'll a shorter one right now we're very comfortable the interstitial fluid if the pain of insertion is effectively eliminated which it is once it's in there you don't I don't actually know the difference between it being in me versus on the yeah in this unit and I've played with other sensors out there that there are some that are you know as short as 400 microns there are some very short ones and we evaluate those technologies we look at them one of the beautiful things of being a public company having resources if we saw one that we thought was remarkable we'd talk to them and see if there's something we can do to further it along but right now we're comfortable with what we're doing to what we have now another question I get asked a lot is why can't this be done optically why can't this be done the way a pulse oximeter where you put it on your finger so for someone listening this who doesn't know what that is but if you've ever had surgery or anything like that when you're under anesthesia there's a little device they usually put on your finger on your earlobe and using light it's actually measuring or estimating the saturation of oxygen and can't we just do that to measure glucose are there limit other limitations to this that are just too great it has been tried on numerous occasions to do that several technologies have tried non-invasive sensors in fact the first glucose sensor that I saw somebody wear other than one we developed at mini med at Medtronic was one called the gluco watch which actually was a watch that sat on your wrist and would take fluid out of your skin through reverse iontophoresis and measure it that way Wow it would leave a red mark on your on the outside of your arm and it it was hard we've seen a lot of non-invasive glucose sensors and people call our sensor invasive because there's a needle and a needle it goes in your body and comes out in a sensor that remains so oftentimes people say we're gonna develop something that is non-invasive if it's 2 inches by 3 inches and sits on the outside of your body and you can say yeah I was non-invasive well how do you find invasive to me invasive is does it invade your lifestyle and does it produce the result that you're looking for a lot of people have worked on on that type of thing they've worked on I'm just measuring on the skin there's one company that has one that measures in your tears that you put inside your that I've seen hmm are these accurate not not accurate enough and they never been to market yet but only time will tell people will continue to look but they're not solving the fundamental problem I'll go back to those three things we build our product around and

[01:11:17] I'll add a fourth if it's accurate if you solve the accuracy problem if you make it more convenient and solve the convenient problem if you lower the cost and finally if you can produce a healthcare outcome you have something that's meaningful well not having the little wire in your skin while while one can try and paint a horse story around that it's not really that invasive to your body so anything that comes has to solve one of those problems better than the technologies that are on the market and if somebody can do that with an infrared sensor optical sensor then we've had a wonderful technological step and and and well I'll figure out where we move from there we just haven't seen anything yet that's accurate enough performs well enough yeah I suspect it's gonna depend heavily on how much this stuff matters and meaning how much accuracy matters obviously for me and for my patients that's the highest priority and what you give up it right now is cost I think of the four metrics you just identified the place where this is by far the biggest barrier is the economic there's the economics I would agree so on that thread anyone listen to this who says gosh I got to have a CGM they have to go get a prescription from their doctor and very likely they're going to pay out-of-pocket for it unless they have diabetes yeah I have diabetes they including type 2 depends a few payers cover type 2 not many but a few do you have the liberty of saying which payers you know which pair is cover type 2 cuz it's gonna depend by region it's very regional and most of the type 2 patients are patients who use intensive insulin such as the CMS Medicare patients and this gets into our Parana goshi ations sometimes we sit and we discuss we want to make this easier for everyone to get we want to cover type twos we want to cover type ones we want all these things and they go back to their economic models and say well we can't do all those things but we can give you this and we can give you this for type ones and and it is it is very much a business negotiation and then based on your insurance plan typically our patients pay 20% of the cost standard copay for durable medical equipment and depending upon the timing of the year if you buy the first of the year and their co-payments and their deductibles have not been met it's more expensive for them and is the cash cost fixed across the country or is that regional we have cash prices here that are that are pretty much national you can say what the cash I don't even you know something

[01:13:42] I don't even know what they are I should know this on my office does all the buying the sensors come in boxes of threes right it's recent and we typically buy them nine at a time so that's about a three month supply because it's 10 days percent so it's 90 days you know what I used to do the math on what are you paying per day I'd amortize the whole thing over a per day cost does 9 bucks a day sound about right that's about right as to what somebody pays on the outside yeah I think that's what we passed 9 or 10 bucks a day between 9 and 11 dollars a day we say on our earnings calls for example our average price per sensor is is X we used to be only seven days sensors so our average price is always between 70 and 75 dollars that we have recognized in our revenue our 10 day sensor we have different models as we've gotten that reimbursed that cost per day has to come down what do you think or have you guys done an internal analysis that says look at this point this is a product where you know if we have you know 1% of the population has type 2 diabetes you've obviously built a very successful company where your customer base is 1% of the US population or less yes you've got a type 2 diabetes population that I think would benefit from this as much as the type 1 population would even though as you've pointed out eloquently different diseases basically so that takes you to 10% of the population then you get the pre diabetic population either 10 exactly but then you've got like sort of half the people are kind of I hate the term wellness but these are people that we're trying to optimize health for and they don't have a disease but it's not just that we're trying to prevent them from getting diabetes but we're trying to figure out if you can actually you know make them live longer through better glycemic control what do you think or what's your intuition about what is that neither cause per day to make that group say look out-of-pocket

[01:15:26] I'm gonna pay for this because there's no way an insurance he's gonna pay for you know healthy people wearing these things we drive those discussions all the time it's interesting I had a discussion with a pair once and I said look we want this to go to everybody that uses insulin intensively tell me what the prices just tell me what to make it give me a number and the response I got was how low would you go so I don't know what a person would pay out of pocket cuz all we do is speculate on these kinds of things is it $25.00 for a two-week sensor is it $50 for a two-week sensor a lot would depend upon the information and the things that you learn from it there's a whole regulatory process we'll have to go through to get a health and wellness product for example our device is a prescription device now we've been very clear in our discussions your patients who use this in its non-diabetic state they have a prescription from you and you pay cash for then we write them a new prescription every three months and they get it to make this a non prescription product there's a lot of steps we'd have to go through at the FDA and one of the things that we look at with respect to are our human factors on our software design if it weren't on prescription what would that software experience have to look like so let's explain for the listener why that's the case so right now everything we've talked about as you said is still a medical device and it's a class to medical device physician writes a prescription and I'm only just talking about the cash patient so this is not about insurance anymore physician writes prescription patient gets it filled and they're all in cost is about nine bucks a day that to wear this thing and they are seeing the exact same data using the exact same device with the exact same algorithms that a patient would type one day and the exact same yeah everything is the same I am using everything that someone with type 1 diabetes is using so explain Kevin why if tomorrow a little elf jumped out of your desk and said wallah we can make this thing for a dollar and and just say that the dollar was the price we're like at a dollar a day you could penetrate this new market that that the FDA doesn't say great go ahead go start selling it like there's a fundamental issue what is that issue we have to go through clinical trials particularly if we're labeled for use for people with diabetes so demonstrate the cursing consistency the product across all glucose ranges the FDA in all candor has been very progressive with Dexcom I mean we're the first company ever to go directly to the phone were the first company to share data we're the first company ever to have a sensor perform at the accuracy levels that we have most every first with the FDA and our industry has come to us partnering with them most recently they created a new category for continuous glucose monitoring and this isn't the intensive diabetes world called IC GM versus C GM where they said accuracy standards where the products have to demonstrate on a statistical basis they perform and you have to have a certain number of values in a study in a low range in the high range and a certain number of points to statistically prove that that product is capable of doing the things that we want it to do and in our intensive world that's dosing insulin either through a manual calculation or thinking by a patient but also with this IC GM category which stands for interconnected we can connect to other devices and they've made an easier path for other devices to connect to our product so for example if you have an insulin pump at an algorithm and would like to run that algorithm a glucose sensor your regulatory path with Dexcom is just to show you get the signal you don't have to do a study to show that dex comes accurate we're done it's interconnected and tandems recent approval is along those lines but if you're displaying a glucose value and that is a real-time glucose value and that is where we've been in our discussions with the FDA that's a class 2 medical device and as of the day that requires a prescription at some point in time again as we look to the future and as you and I have talked unlike a device we could sell over-the-counter or we could sell through nutrition programs that a patient couldn't use to dose insulin but what would be the real-time feedback you'd give somebody's explained why that's necessary that's that what you just said is the important point which is if you want to sell this over-the-counter the FDA is going to say it cannot be used by someone to dose insulin for today for today maybe that will change over time but but for now those are the rules those are the rules that we play by and that's very important for I think people to understand because that's one of the questions I get asked the most which is why can't this thing just be over-the-counter now I'm willing to pay the full price why do I have to because not every patient has a physician who understands the benefit of this and I know just from what I see on social media a lot of people go to their doctor and say hey you know doctor so-and-so please write me the prescription and he or she says what the hell for get out of here now what are you talking about yeah and so now that patient who's actually says look I'm willing to make an enormous investment in this because it's my health and I believe that this is going to matter well there they can't do it so what I'm hearing you say is there's one regulatory path that says maybe down the road the FDA says you know what this will no longer be something that requires a prescription if the patient's willing to pay for it the patient can have it I can't speak for them but they have been so progressive with us so far and what we would literally have to present again is a case as to how somebody would never harm themselves and remember there's a needle involved in inserting our product as well there may be standards and rules around needles things like that so I can't speculate how we get there but I think over time that's something we would like to take on but again it would not be a device used for diabetes stream and to be a device used for other things we'll have to figure out what that looks like we we don't know yet and what you were alluding to a moment ago was the other option for making this OTC is not to take the same device and just deal with the FDA changing a rule but it's to create a device that would fit into the current sort of regulatory environment which says the device would basically have to be dumbed down you'd basically have to strip functionality out of the device right strip functionality and the user experience yeah not necessarily accuracy no in that performance but strip down the information that's presented to the individual so the ways that that can be done is one you could make it such that they don't get real-time information because if you don't real-time information if you see the perfectly accurate identical data a day later doesn't help you dose insulin another way is as you said you just show ranges colors the circles on your Apple watch I don't wear one of those things but I know you don't do you and I both like to wear our irregular watches I do our apple the Apple watch frequently just to see what the user experience is okay so what are the circles what are the circles is for training you track your how many times you stand up how many steps you take advance you know they have some very simple measures it's right there it's pretty easy to see and very easy to use this is a totally unrelated question does the Apple watch have a little app or plugin that allows you to put the face of really cool watches on it so that you like if you really want to have a paddock you could have like a little paddock Apple watch because I mean that would be easy to do you just need a picture of the paddock and you could have it like looking like you know your pick your favorite GMT you know or what Peter we start talking it gets back to watch is another businesses we'd like to go start and do I don't I don't know that that exists but that would be fun why haven't I maybe maybe somebody has someone's got would develop the plugin that allows you to have any watch you want as your Apple watch Apple Apple watches cos what a few hundred bucks yeah but you could put the face of a million dollar watch on it if you want well and what we have found within our company and with our patient base there's a very high number of Apple watch users because our device goes from the phone and then the phone there's a watch app also I didn't even because I don't use the thing I've never noticed that there is a watch happen then we are developing and direct to watch transmitter communication protocol what that would do for a patient again the new Apple watches have cell your capability as well as will some of the

[01:23:39] Android watches and some of the new Fitbit products but with that direct cell capability that watch then can become a patient's receiver and the data could still be shared you wouldn't have to have it go to your phone and again we're thinking about those criteria talked to you about earlier as far as convenience it's a lot easier for some of our people to pull their sleeve up and look at their glucose then they get their phone out during an important meeting or to even take their phone to bed you know you can wear their watch to bed well that's another thing I like about the g6 a lot we didn't talk about this with the g5 I had to keep my phone in my room to see all my nighttime data the g6 seems to store the data so that if I keep my phone in the office it back loads my file there is some back loading if you do lose connectivity the transmission range of our product I believe it's labeled for 20 feet and if we've learned one thing about going to the phone bluetooth is not an exact science and I think we've all experienced that where some headphones connect really well other headphones do not sometimes you get your car it works sometimes it doesn't it is very hard to explain but is that why you went with

[01:24:52] Bluetooth as opposed to near-field communication we went with bluetooth because we didn't want our patients to have to put the phone close to the device we wanted the continuous feed I think there is a place for near-field and it's quite possible we'd have both chips in a future one but but for now we're very ble oriented and it worked pretty well are there any and again I want to be sensitive to what you can and can't talk about publicly are there any other partnerships or collaborations that you're able to speak about that are maybe interesting to consumers especially in this sort of non diabetes non type one non type-2 market for the you know for the people like me who are thinking about this for quote-unquote wellness well nothing real concrete I will tell you that Apple has been a wonderful partner for us in getting the device to the iPhone and getting our apps working on Apple watch in fact at the developer conference one year we got a VIP invitation our head of R&D couldn't go so I went and Peter and I are dressed differently I'm total business person and Peter's Peter and so

[01:25:52] I show up at the Apple Developer Conference in my sport coat in my shoes and of course the guys next to me are in shorts and they're way younger than me and they're looking at me like who's this who's this nobody dresses like this here and I'm sitting there feeling pretty uncomfortable and they came out and talked about Apple watch and lo and behold apples got Dexcom watch on the screen Wow up there and I elbowed the kid next to me I said do you see that he said yeah I said I run that company I thought I was pretty pretty special for the day our partnership with verily includes work with a company that they have called on duo that is developing treatment for type 2 diabetes and developing apps that combine everything they've learned about diabetes with a lot of Google technology and they're in pilot phases with various payers on the type 2 side we're also doing a lot of work with United

[01:26:46] Healthcare on type 2 diabetes and I think in the future with them we're also going to develop some pre-diabetes models as we take this gen 6 technology out you know we talked about going to the consumer Peter you wouldn't have taken g5 to a consumer anywhere it's too hard yeah I had a hard time getting patients today too high v g6 is it's not all the way there but it's close there are things we can do to make a little bit easier like pairing the device with the transmitter and some of the other things that that have been inherent within our system but it's close as we get this thing closer to consumers I think you'll see us try more things more in different things a couple of other applications where we'd love to take our continuous Koko's monitoring technology where it's not I've had numerous physicians ping me on LinkedIn saying why aren't you in the hospital why aren't you in the hospital that's a question why aren't we in the ICU of all places right we tried many years ago we had a joint venture with Edwards

[01:27:52] Lifesciences and then the FDA was extremely strict on accuracy and performance and by the time we built what we built it just it didn't work out our technology has come so far and we've learned so much through projects like that in the past that we will make a run with g6 in that type of market to help patients I mean thinking about it you connect the Bluetooth to the nurse's station I was in one Medical Center where patients in the ICU are tested every 30 minutes 48 finger sticks in a 24 hour period not uncommon intensive insulin therapy of course has had its ups and downs resurgence in the literature and the critical care literature but basically there was a there was a paper that came out in 2001 or 2002 in the England Journal of

[01:28:35] Medicine that really changed the face of how glucose and insulin levels were managed or glucose levels were managed using intensive insulin therapy in the ICU that has been questioned obviously then we had subsequent trials that have suggested that you know maybe the benefit on the glucose I'd come at the cost with an insulin side etc but you're a bright now that reminds me of something though which is acetaminophen tylenol has an effect on the performance at least of the g5 does not g6 oh it doesn't have to be in 1986 we ran a very very very large study and put a lot of acetaminophen into patients - whereby we have no contraindication for seen a benefit anymore so that's interesting but the g5 would over or it would go high they would over a little bit yeah so one of the challenges I suspect in the ICU patient is all of the drugs that they're on also they thirdspace like crazy so their interstitial looks totally different from a normal person's interstitial it's almost like there's a whole new calibration right we're gonna have to go around some studies but that being said

[01:29:40] I'll go back to what you said your friend told you you can pay me now or pay me later mhm if we can get this in the right configuration in the hospital on most every patient at least every patient over 50 that comes in forget where that I have diabetes that hyperglycemia effect on healing we know is a very difficult thing if we can get it on everybody make this affordable and fit within a normal workflow of the hospital that's a tremendous market for us another place we haven't been or been labeled and you're gonna be a little bit probably chastised me after this we've never been labeled for gestational diabetes what we had this discussion once I didn't realize you weren't actually labeled but I have a patient whose fiance is pregnant and she had a device in and it turned out she had an old device so she had the device and then never used it for with one pregnancy then used it with another and it wasn't working and we did some troubleshooting in the mini long story short she said well I called Dex coma but they said it's not approved for gestational use and I remember saying what would be the difference and I'm very proud of my pate my people for saying the right thing it's just we haven't run a study in gestational diabetes we'll have to run a study there to get that label one of my daughters-in-law contracted gestational diabetes while pregnant with twins so her ob/gyn run a scar and we procured a Dexcom for her and he just looked at I said this this is remarkable we should all be on this and this gets back to a1c and other measures as we look at evolving this gen six technology one of the things that we look at is this product it's our diagnostic as well right now you drink that real sugary drink go away Hawaii you go away low it's kind of awful what about a blinded sensor on somebody for a week you know infinitely better and and then develop the algorithms to see what we can predict with respect to gestational diabetes those are the type of studies that we want to run in the future in the way we like to go about that market and there's others as well again I'll go back to your health and wellness one combining this with some of the nutrition apps out there the Weight

[01:31:51] Watchers app combining if that had glucose data and you ate your points per day and nature 32 points today but your glucose bags were still high maybe we take you down to 26 and vice versa you can you can see how that can integrate with it wonderfully and integrate without showing a glucose value that you can dose insulin off of just think in the end it's a much better metric for health and I think health matters more than weight you know weight is weight is correlated with health but the correlation is not exceptional it's reasonable but it's so far from great and you know my prediction would be when those trials are done your standard deviation of blood glucose over you know a three-month period is gonna tell you infinitely more than whatever the fluctuations were in your weight and it's frankly gonna help you identify probably the type of weight that matters more obviously there's been a big discussion about the difference between subcutaneous fat and visceral fat you could have two people that weigh exactly the same and you could even have two people that have a similar mass of fat but where that fat resides probably tells us much more about their metabolic health so I don't know like I said if I could be czar of whatever for a day I just don't see why I wouldn't want someone to have this information continuously in real time every minute of every day under physiologic circumstance because what you learn and not just someone who's got type 2 diabetes or type 1 diabetes or gestational diabetes it's gonna alter your baby comes back to the the airport stories yeah when we're in these environments that are at our at our worst and you'll learn other really interesting things I mean you think you know I you get a sense of how much even exercise can transiently raise your blood glucose but what the benefits are after the fact which is your ability to dispose of glucose goes up significantly yeah I get about a 30 point spike in a workout but for the rest of the day my average glucose is about 10 points lower yeah it's so amazing to think that such a simple biomarker is glucose something we take for granted on every chemistry test we do on patients you know no one goes there doctor and doesn't get their glucose measured but what the utility of that is when you can have measured every five minutes mmm Kevin this has been super interesting I wanna be respectful of your time I know we don't have all day here and you have to get back to work one of the stories you just told that I love so much I didn't know was the going to the pharmacy getting three of these things and pokin yourself 60 times to me that's like you know

[01:34:28] Dexcom is a pretty big public company your market caps like what 12 billion 12 billion dollars yeah and but yet you're still kind of a start-up company oh that's that's a start-up CEO move it really is and I've had to learn to be less startup as we've grown we've all grown with the company but that culture and again one of the things that I manage a CEO here is we've had to bring in skills and supplement our management team from that startup mentality to the mid-size company mentality to whereby we have more structure and systems of a large company so we're trying to mix all of those things together we just add our employee survey and it's interesting I read every comment it's almost 200 pages of comments I read everything all the employees write the good ones the bad ones and the funny ones I will not quote the funny ones but they're there there's some pretty hilarious things people say the most contradicting comments are we all need to go back to being a startup versus we need more structure to be bigger and both are true both are true the the nimbleness of a start-up in an industry where you're creating everything is absolutely essential you've got to remain nimble you've got to be willing to fail you've got to be willing to start over you got to be willing to do what's right conversely that big company structure where you have systems and and balances and checks to make sure you're doing the right thing and you start watching dollars more is a different culture so we're mixing those two together we're kind of like a mixed family here we will have added more than 1500 employees in the last two years

[01:36:07] Wow I didn't realize where that I was employee 3 about 300 in 2011 I think we have 2,500 full-time employees and several hundred temps we do a lot of our manufacturing or attempt to hire and bring them in and grow and shrink with volume there with a temporary workforce but no we have that many pecan I had one more question for your internal survey that I think will produce awesome interesting results every month have a or every quarter or whatever frequency makes sense have a tell us your best surprise glucose spiked story because I mean honestly this the grapes the stupid chocolate-covered M&Ms what I mean I think I mean there's gonna be the obvious ones like I ate a bag of swedish fish look what happened my blood sugar but there's these surprise ones either in the velocity of glucose escape or the pea because I'm guessing most your employees are wearing these things right for no no no no there's too many of us there's actually there's too many of us now but you know if we run an internal study under IRB protocol and everything we will recruit volunteers within the company we have several people with type 1 diabetes that work here because they can lend us a perspective for our patients that we don't have on our own so that's important to us as well a lot of Wehrman a lot of the things that we learn are through those in-house studies and through that in hand that in-house where process you said something a second ago about failing quickly you have five kids right I have five cents and just before we were getting ready to start we were talking about our kids and you asked me if I wanted some advice on being a parent who which I couldn't say no of course I did remember the advice you gave me I do and

[01:37:48] I was recounting a story of how things have changed there's a big gap my oldest is 15 years older than my youngest and there's an 8 year gap between number 4 in number 5 but what I told you is we can't be afraid to let our kids fail I know I'm gonna sound horribly mean but everybody getting a ribbon and everybody gave me a trophy every I once told a coach to cut my son so he would learn something hmm if he wasn't gonna play him go ahead do that we learned in life as much from our failures as we do our successes sometimes we learn more and sometimes they they motivate us to be great and and motivate us to do great things but we oftentimes as parents shelter our kids so much from that what appears to be traumatic and I'd given that advice to somebody who didn't have any children and he came in my office he goes give me one bit of advice and I said alright I'll give it to you because we just try and manage and regulate everything so much all the time and look

[01:38:48] I will tell you with number 5 I did a lot more that than I did with number 1 number 1 would tell you that I was very tough on him but I let him carve his own way and it's a good thing to let him learn last question Kevin is there a failure that you point to in your professional life leading up to where you are today that that has taught you more than the others about what you're doing now boy that is a great question I wouldn't tell you one in particular at a corporate level I'm going to go big-picture

[01:39:20] I was at one company where I knew exactly what to do and it was really the only course of action that would have made that company successful and I present it to my board and they said no and I then rolled up my sleeves and work hard for several months and several months as over months and I still got the answer no and I finally left after beating my head up against the wall and that taught me a lot of lessons number one to be better prepared and how I give my message i and i tribute players like that to me I don't blame the others to be better prepared on how I deliver my message to be more thoughtful but if the situation isn't gonna work out and what

[01:40:06] I ended up doing and my wife would tell you this my commute was five miles at the time is the most miserable I've ever been in my entire life she would look at me and say what on earth are you doing I'm gonna fix this and we're gonna get this me and it couldn't win so I left and that's the one time where I felt like I didn't get done what what we could have got completed but I didn't see all the signs on the wall so I've looked at ways I can be better from that when I see something strategic like that

[01:40:37] I do more homework we have the people around us do more homework or more thoughtful so that's one of them we've all had numerous little failures sometimes again our failures are our biggest blessings I would say the the failure that's been my biggest blessing or all the jobs I didn't take because you get opportunities and you get mesmerized with an opportunity I'm gonna go do this and countless times in my life those didn't work out and then lo and behold an opportunity comes along and it's well I'm so glad that didn't work out and then you learn so much from that no I would say the other thing that's important as far as a success you're only as good as those people that are around you and it becomes clearer and clearer to me the longer I work this team we have here at Dexcom they are committed they work hard we are all engaged in our business each and every day I never go to a meeting with another company where their people are engaged in what they do as ours well that's an interesting point to end on because I do think that Dex come obviously I'm very biased I've been very very vocal about my bias to Dexcom over the other two

[01:41:44] Abbott and Medtronic but I think you guys have an advantage that on the one hand as a disadvantage let's be honest diversification as most companies have a million products to fall back on they just see GM is but one of a hundred things they do but that disadvantage is actually your biggest advantage which is everybody shows up too and I feel like I know half the staff here I'm here so often shooting the breeze with you there's something to be said for what's the expression you burn your ships that's right yeah yeah you guys have burned your ships you're all in on CGM we are Oh Kevin I want to thank you very much for your time for your insights and for your friendship it's been amazing to think that we we met on that airplane airplane three four years ago and to this day we we managed to do a good job of not talking watches this whole thing once we turn the recording off I want to talk to you about the one I'm wearing right now which I think you're gonna love it is beautiful thank you I wore it today because I knew I was gonna see you okay this is what watch idiots do we do like Show and Tell does your wife make fun of you as well oh that's ridiculous now I've learned a good trick which is you start giving your wife nice watches and she now understands and appreciates like why a Daytona's a nice watch and you know the what Paul Newman meant in bubble bubble blonds other things so now she she's a little bit more tolerant of my nonsense all right all right Kevin have a have a great I thank you very much for your time we'll see ya you can find all of this information and more at
