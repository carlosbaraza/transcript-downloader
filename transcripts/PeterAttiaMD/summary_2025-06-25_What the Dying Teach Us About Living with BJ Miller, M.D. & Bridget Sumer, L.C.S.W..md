This clip is from episode  354 – What the dying can teach us about living well: lessons on life and reflections on mortality | BJ Miller, M.D. and Bridget Sumser, L.C.S.W.

In this clip, they discuss:

- Lessons from the Dying – Insights gained from spending time with people near the end of life
- Common Regrets Shared – People most often regret not being emotionally honest, suppressing feelings, or failing to express love due to shame or fear
- Being Present in the Now – Embracing the present moment becomes a coping strategy, reinforced by the reality that tomorrow is never guaranteed
- We Die How We Lived – The idea that death reflects the way one lived is emphasized, suggesting that the emotional patterns and coping strategies we develop in life persist until the end
- Start Practicing Today – The final message encourages viewers to start building emotional and psychological "muscles" now, since we all begin dying the moment we start living
