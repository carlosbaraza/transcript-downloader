In this clip, they discuss:

- Death Feels Distant for Most – Many people aren’t even adjacent to the reality of death, making it a foreign and often ignored topic

## Transcript

[00:00:00] Uh, and you you two live in this world. Um, I would say I'm adjacent to the world, but I don't live in it. And most people aren't even adjacent to it. So, death is a really foreign thing. The reason I suspect that this can gets kicked down the road so much, so much in fact, that after all the can kicking, people get to the end of their life, there's no road and there's just a pile of cans.

[00:00:28] So, what is it culturally that prevents us from talking about this when we're 50, when we're 60, when we're 70? When we're 30. Yeah. Like, why? Why is it? Because it's it's become such a I don't I don't know if I want to say it's a black box. I don't want to say it's a mystery, but but it's just something that we don't want to talk about. And as such, I I really believe that that's why we get to that three week, okay, fine, we're pulling the plug. It's three weeks and you fall off a cliff kind of thing. Um, do we know anything about other cultures? You know, do we know how is it in Japan? How is it in Europe? How is it in in other parts of the world? Do we know anything about how how end of life functions there? A little bit. Culturally, there's a lot to study. I mean often it'd be so fun to take a couple years and really study the anthropology around dying and which cultures how cultures do this differently. We've been dying a long time. Um you know so but one thing I think it's our greatest skill. Yeah. I mean we're really good at it. Um you will not do it. Yeah thing you will not fail. You pro I promise you. So um and I think what you're calling attention to there's the the culture. So like

[00:01:43] Scandinavian cultures, um, Japan, a place that venerates its elders, you know, and aging and dying are different. Um, but they bump bump into each other a lot. So I my armchair read on say life in Japan where you the the comfort of being in old skin might be a different experience but there you're still left with the sort of natural phenomenon cultural phenomenon of aging bumping into this health care system idea and that is the cognitive dissonance. We have these systems that are engineered and wired in such a way that are so at odds with mother nature on some level and so blind to cultural issues in the name of science in so many sort of reductive ways that I think you'd still if you were in Japan I think you'd still find a a health care system that struggles with this question even as the culture uh maybe doesn't as much similar probably in Scandinavia but I think in those places I know in the Scandinavian model you will one of things that comes up for people the end of life is you know other living issues like housing like you know your relationships they're still there. So we one of the things that makes dying harder in this country is the social determinance of health in society are not cared for. So you still have your housing issues when you're trying to die. You still got bill paying things that are you know that's the stuff that makes dying extra extraordinarily hard in some cases or in many cases. So you're saying that the the lower the the wider net of the social safety net here compared to a country like Canada or Scandinavia or

[00:03:23] Japan presumably just adds one more stressor to an already stressful situation largely and it I I any one sentence doesn't do it justice because as you said the health care systems these places they can also do amazing work and so I don't want to just blindly categorically denigrate a health care system in any country there's some good

[00:03:44] But it is such a mixed bag. Um, and as many problems as it solves, it creates some other ones, especially around issues that people are struggled to look at. To your point, still holds like that we do have a problem and why Bridget and I came this far besides to see your smiling face, but to talk about this in such a way that allows an audience as large as yours to begin to think about this before it's sort of too late. This is, I think, all of our work as citizens to begin to rope this part of reality into our views so that we can prepare ourselves for it and we can live with these realities and not be so surprised by the fact that we die someday. In part is so that we learn how to advocate for ourselves versus yeah, I'd love to see our health system mature around these issues and we'll continue to work on that or towards that. But I think the bigger note for your audience is what can each of us do to prepare ourselves in ways that the health system is not.

[00:04:39] In some ways, you're going to have to say no to health. Like to die well in this country at some point, you kind of have to say no thanks to medicine. One thing your audience needs to appreciate and why advanced directives are so helpful for example is the system is what is it is by def the default modes of our health care system would be just do more stuff prop your body up anything to give you a pulse unless you've written or stated otherwise we're going to try to protect you having a pulse most of us don't equate having a pulse with actually really being alive and that becomes a problem at some point we in this this sort of carnival where we can really prop up a body almost in indefinitely. So it becomes a you have to find a way to say no to that and unwind what that hospital can do. You have to get out of the way of that to die peacefully in this country. Does that make some sense? No. No. I mean PJ, it makes so much sense. And as you're saying it, I'm just reflecting on the internal struggle that I think most nurses and doctors experience. And I we don't talk about it much, but I remember during residency the pride that I took in how heroic we could be, what we could do for a patient in the ICU, like how many central lines I could put in you and how I could look at all the different cultures and figure out the five antibiotics you need and how good I was at managing your dialysis and getting that CVBHD to manage the pressure and this and that and how I could alter the aortic intraaortic balloon pump to just keep your heart like we were we there was such a sense of awesomeness in like this technology.

[00:06:24] It is awesome. But then you take a step back and you're thinking what am I doing? What am I doing? This is a physiologic experiment. It's not a life anymore. Yeah. And and and and you would say well is there a chance that this person's going to recover? Well, of course there's always a chance, but how big does that chance need to be for the expected outcome to justify what you're doing? And there's two ways to answer this question. The first is economically. That's an easier way to answer it because expected outcomes are probabilities. It's what is the expected outcome of this survival multiplied by the cost of this intervention. You take the dotproduct of those, you add them all up, there's the cost of your health care system with respect to end of life care. Let's put that aside. There's the human one, right? There's the how many people are spending their last weeks or months in an ICU where they are for all intents and purposes no longer there right because you the amount of sedation you have to put on a person to keep them in that state is extreme they're now swelling into a Michelin man and is this what we want their family's final memories to be of something I you know something I I as you're talking I just like feel I have such visceral memories of you know sitt sitting in those family meetings in the

[00:07:39] ICU where the person in the bed is unrecognizable and you know the expectation that physicians and nurses and social workers and spiritual you know that the healthcare teams are a should be able to have all of that expertise knowledge you know not all of it just some of the expertise knowledge that you just outlined and then also the very nuanced interpersonal capacity to with a relative stranger ask some of the biggest philosophical questions in a moment of crisis. I mean that is like in some ways a a a beyond human expectation of physicians which is where the and and many do it I mean just like with profound grace and beauty. um even when it really doesn't feel like it to them.

[00:08:39] But that's where sort of like the consumer side or the patient side is like, you know, come in having wrestled with it, not because you were given a diagnosis of a serious illness, but because we all do die. And that and that kind of gets back to your original question like this is hard cuz it's kind of impossible to imagine not existing anymore to actually psychologically, spiritually, philosophically grapple with like I'm here and I won't be and my children are here and they won't be and my spouse is here and they won't be and maybe I can kind of wrap my head around that being true for my grandparents maybe and then my you know it's it like this is a fundamental sort of contemplation of being human and you know it's a good muscle good it's a it's a lifegiving muscle I think to start to flex when you are healthy when you feel good when you're like it is actually true that I don't know when I'm going to die it could be because I'm hit by a bus it could be from some unexpected instantaneous physiologic thing or it could be some process when

[00:09:54] I'm 85 like we don't know and collectively we have a hard time talking about and being in spaces together when when fundamentally we don't know. I'm Peter Aia.
