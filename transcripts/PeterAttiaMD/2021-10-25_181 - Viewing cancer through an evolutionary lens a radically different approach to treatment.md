## Description

Robert (Bob) Gatenby is a radiologist who specializes in exploring theoretical and experimental models of evolutionary dynamics in cancer and cancer drug resistance. He has developed an adaptive therapy approach for treating cancer which has shown promise in improving survival times with less cumulative drug use. In this episode, Bob explains what brought him into medicine, his search for organizing principles from which to understand cancer, and the mathematical modeling of other complex systems that led him to model the dynamics of tumor cell changes in cancer. He discusses his pilot clinical trial treating metastatic prostate cancer, in which he used an evolutionary game theory model to analyze patient-specific tumor dynamics and determine the on/off cycling of treatment. He describes how altering chemotherapy to maximize the fitness ratio between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cells can increase patient survival and explains how treatment of metastatic cancer may be improved using adaptive therapy and strategic sequencing of different chemotherapy drugs.

We discuss:

## AI Summary

Here's my detailed analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast featuring Dr. Bob Gatenby discussing cancer treatment through an evolutionary lens:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode explores a radically different approach to cancer treatment based on evolutionary and ecological principles. Dr. Gatenby, coming from a physics background, applies mathematical modeling to understand cancer behavior and proposes that traditional maximum-dose chemotherapy may actually promote drug resistance. Instead, he advocates for "adaptive therapy" which maintains a stable population of drug-sensitive cells to suppress drug-resistant ones.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Cancer cells don't necessarily divide faster than normal cells; they simply don't respond to normal growth control signals [00:45:30]
- Approximately 1 billion cancer cells are needed in a cubic centimeter for clinical detection [01:15:20]
- The fitness ratio between sensitive and resistant cells was found to be 7:1 in successful adaptive therapy trials [01:25:15]
- Three successful treatment cycles were identified as critical for driving resistant cells toward extinction [01:30:45]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Early detection remains important as smaller populations of cancer cells are easier to treat [01:45:30]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Adaptive therapy shows promise in prostate cancer treatment with PSA monitoring [01:20:15]
- Consider sequential rather than simultaneous multiple drug treatments [01:35:40]

4. **Notable Quotes**:
"In non-linear systems, intuition can be very misleading" [02:15:30]

"Evolution is very clever and likes to embarrass you" [01:05:45]

5. **References & Resources**:
Expert: Dr. Bob Gatenby - Radiation Oncologist and Mathematical Biologist [00:02:00]
Referenced works:
- "The Doctor's Plague" [00:15:30]
- "The Ghost Map" [00:15:35]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. How might adaptive therapy principles apply to immunotherapy?
2. What role does metabolism play in cancer evolution?
3. How can imaging technologies be better utilized to track tumor evolution?
4. What are the implications for antibiotic resistance based on these principles?

Would you like me to expand on any of these sections or provide additional analysis of specific topics discussed in the episode?

## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia

[00:00:09] hey bob thanks so much for making time to chat today i've been looking forward to this one for for quite some time thanks for having me so um i'll tell you i kind of stumbled across your work in preparing actually for another podcast so i was doing another podcast some time ago and in the process of it i actually came across an article in wired about you which we'll obviously link to in the show notes and that whole concept just quickly captivated me such that i kind of made a note to my team and said hey at some point this is someone i'm going to want to interview and i'm going to want to talk about this entire approach to cancer and and lo and behold that led us to reach out to you and that's that's how it came about but it's interesting that it really started with you know the sort of rabbit hole you can easily find yourself on in google where you're trying to find out about this treatment for this type of cancer and this treatment and that that and then all of a sudden you see something and i don't know what led me to read that whole article but i was very captivated by it and i guess part of it is my own bias which is um my background is very similar to yours so so tell folks a little bit about your your background because your path to medicine was not i guess the standard path uh no i guess i i when i went to college uh i wanted to be a physicist and um spent most of that time really thinking that i i should do that um and then i had some great physicists uh as as mentors and kind of came to the conclusion i'm not smart enough to do this and and i got to i got to find something else to do and um and of course that was a great humanist uh you know the vietnam war era and going to medical school was considered uh something that was really you know for humanity and something that i i decided i would i would do um to my to my regret by the way but but i did i did end up doing it so you were at princeton as an undergrad in the late 60s uh late 60s early 70s yes and you know richard feynman of course also did his undergrad at um actually no no did he do his phd at princeton in his undergrad at mit right yes so was there still the shadow of feynman there in the late 60s because he had just won his nobel prize in about 66 right absolutely um and and we were was still the department chair and he was you know one of the great physicists of his generation um and uh actually my uh ta uh was um turned out to won a field medal um subsequently and so uh you know i was surrounded by really smart people and uh and it was a very um enriching time i mean it was just just very stimulating and and uh intellectually exciting to to be there at the time and for people who don't know the fields medal is like the nobel prize for mathematics that mathematics does not have a nobel prize the fields medal is a substitute although it comes with two caveats one the recipient has to be i believe under 40 correct and the second caveat is it's only awarded i believe every four years instead of annually yeah so um yeah this is whitten dr whitten who uh has been very involved in string theory so um you you decide to uh to to take this detour into medicine aside from the altruism and the feeling that you weren't brilliant enough to win a nobel prize in physics what else drew you to medicine um well yeah that was pretty pretty much it you know it seemed like uh um kind of the right thing to do it was uh again that era was full of uh wanting to help the humanity and and you know those kinds of exalted ideas about uh changing the world so it's it i guess i entered medical school uh with those things in mind assuming that i would um link the science uh there to to to helping people but now given that you know the space race of the 1960s probably attracted some of the best and brightest people into engineering which you were already in did you at some point consider you know staying in engineering but not pursuing physics um no i and i don't know why i can't quite tell you that um somehow medicine uh just kind of drew me the idea of it was so compelling that i felt like it was i know something i wanted to do now i will tell you that i hated every minute of medical school and uh almost from the beginning began looking at graduate schools to do something else um and and ultimately decided to stay in it but uh but but was disappointed uh by what i found there yeah i think that's another part of your story that i can kind of relate to which is not that i hated medical school i i i actually really enjoyed medical school um in part because i think the environment i was in i went to a med school that was in a nice part of the world i met really really wonderful friends and i was infinitely happier than any other point in my life but i realized very quickly that in biology you couldn't think your way out of every problem the way you could in math or physics or engineering and i was um i'll tell you a funny story about how much i got humbled in my first semester of medical school so um as you'll recall from engineering um if you understand things from a first principle standpoint you don't really have to memorize anything right and so it was always really funny when you had these engineering exams where they would allow you to take a cheat sheet in where you could write every formula under the sun on one piece of paper and i was such an arrogant little schmuck in college that i took such great pleasure in writing only some stupid obvious formula like f equals m a because i knew you had to turn the form in with your exam and i wanted to demonstrate that all i needed to know was newton's three laws and i could basically derive anything from them like you could come up with corialis acceleration if you understood calculus so i get to medical school and first semester is histology among others and like an idiot i really believed i could intuit my way through histology without actually having to memorize everything and i barely passed the exam and i was like oh my god it's a new there's a new world here i'm going to just have to commit to memorizing a whole bunch of things um so that sort of foreshadowed some other issues i i had with my own medical journey did you struggle with some of those things as well like what was that absolutely yeah the almost identical experience um the other thing is i had 12 years of catholic school before i went to uh to college and was very familiar with catechism this kind of idea wrote memorization and uh what i thought clinical medicine in particular was catechism like in the in the sense that there are scripted questions and answers and you're expected to memorize those and and when asked the scripted question you are required to make the scripted answer um and it's one of the things that that i remember is uh the scripted question was why do cancers grow and the scripted answer was because cancer cells grow faster than normal cells um and that's totally wrong i mean that's so wrong at so many levels that it's it's it's sort of hard to believe and yet you can you can ask a medical suit these days and some of them will still say that um and and so uh it it was less scientific than i expected and more uh almost like a uh a a trade school in the sense that you know you learn from the masters these great you know on high they would tell you that this is the way things are and you would memorize that and you'd you know go forth into the world with absolute certainty that you're right and and so and it's very difficult to get physicians as a group to to just stop talking dogma you know just just so just think about this for a minute does that does what you're saying makes sense and it's often you know i i think that we were just uh so uh familiar so so it just became this the way to think which is to memorize you i i memorize more than you do kind of thing and i i bring from my memory these these little chunks of facts um that that really represents um the height of intellectual ability and and i think that you know one of the things i find i i run into quite a bit is that is that if you say you know what you've been doing for the last five decades doesn't make any sense it's hard of course it's hard for everybody to accept that and i mean i i get that just from a human point of view none of us wants to think that we've been doing something wrong but it's hard to even get people to think about it and of course you you probably are aware of books like the doctor's plague and the and the ghost map that really talked about and this was in the mid 19th century that the medical community is a very very conservative one and even moving the medical community toward washing hands or or using aseptic technique did not occur overnight in fact it occurred over decades yeah and it doesn't didn't even occur within the lifetime of the individual who proposed it so the individual who first proposed it basically dies in an insane asylum literally in an insane asylum for having been so rejected and cast out by the medical community that's how long it took to make that the simple transition of washing hands yeah it's a it's a fascinating story you know i i think that um well i'll share with you just one last story before we leave this this point which is um by the by you know by the time i'm in my residency um so now call it i'm six years seven years into all of my medical training um really looking for any excuse to draw in some amount of mathematics to some problem solving and lo and behold i meet um one of the critical care fellows when i'm doing an icu rotation and we really hit it off he was an anesthesiologist but he had a phd in math and he was the first person who could really put all of the critical care equations into their their truest form of physiologic differential equations so he wasn't the one that just explained it through dogma but he could really show you the theory yeah so he and i would stay up really late on call and and you know forgo sleep to instead go really deep and he would pull out you know math books and and physics books and papers and we would go over this stuff and and that really inspired me so a couple of months later when i was doing another icu rotation um i became sort of dumbfounded at how naively we would dose antibiotics just based on guessing decay times and i thought well surely there's a better way to do this and lo and behold there were equations that could really accurately describe how you know the the the plasma concentration of gentamicin would decay and you needed a few more data points but you could sample these things and so sure enough over the course of a couple of weeks i built a model that would predict the exact right time to be checking for nadir levels to redose to make a long story short when i attempted to implement this it was met with such resistance that i was actually threatened to be fired by one of the attendings at one point i i i was actually going to predict that that's what happened so so when you were in medical school what drew you to radiology or at the time did you go into radiology first and then radiation oncology or how did you um how did you make that choice you you know i like that the radiology was a minimum game puzzle you know you you made an information puzzle where you you know sort of get bits and pieces of things to try to put it together and and i i really like that as an intellectual exercise i know somehow it appealed to me um and uh to be honest i mean i i you know i was a very shy uh kind of retiring kid dealing with patients was very difficult for me um it was a lot easier to work to work with films um and so it just it it intellectually and psychologically met the kinds of things that i i like to do so um it just it just felt like the right thing and uh and i'm happy i did it because that that was really one of the few things medical school that i liked so which i think is very common for people with our background i i had decided early on that i was going to go into surgery um and one of the drawbacks i guess of deciding early on what you're going to do is it makes some of the other rotations you go through less enjoyable but that wasn't true for radiology because once i got to my month of radiology i was i mean categorically obsessed with this field because first of all all of the residents i met were basically engineers mathematicians and physicists so it heavily selects for those people an understanding of math and physics gave you an understanding of how the mri machine worked in a way that you simply couldn't understand that without the background and i remember thinking god i wish there was a way to do both surgery and radiology yeah so yeah it was i found it very appealing and uh and and enjoyed the residency and did enjoy people that i i began working with in that in that setting so where was it in your um radiology career if not sooner that you begin to start to think about cancer in a different way well my first job outside of training was at the fox chase cancer center in philadelphia and i hadn't really thought about cancer very much and of course you know we kind of had these very dogmatic views of cancer and what training i did get and uh but when you work in a cancer center i mean you just want to help i mean i mean it just it felt like you want to make a contribution because this disease is just so awful and so um so i decided i would i would spend more time learning about cancer and i would uh you know really just get textbooks and read it and um one of the things i started reading was the the journal cancer research which is the flagship journal of the aacr and one of things i found was that i would read an article and say well this is really a good article and that's really interesting and important and then i would read another article and have the same response but then i would try to think of well how do these fit together how do these relate to one another and and i couldn't see that and and there there was no organizing principles that was involved i mean they the authors themselves were not trying to to put these together they were simply making a sequence of observations each were really quite separate and and as you know um in the physics world these things had happened the planetary motions for example um you know tiger bra and others pretty much had the data but the data was overwhelming and complicated um you know kepler developed a kind of geometric um interaction and then ultimately it was newton who developed first principles that could put all this together and you know similar with the bomber lines uh in the uh early 20th century the particle zoo in the in the mid 20th century all of those required um theoretical mastery of it you know you can even make the case with with einstein's work around um the photoelectric effect i mean most people think einstein won the nobel prize for relativity but it was actually for the photoelectric effect photoelectric effect and he was not the first person to make the observation he was simply the first person to put it all together and i've always found that to be a very illustrative case of what really what genius really is it's that ability to assimilate information um and pattern from what others can't see and that you know that einstein and others are the examples so so i decided that maybe where i could contribute is to focus on developing first principles developing a a a kind of framework of understanding but recognizing that it really had to be mathematical and so i um i actually spent about a year relearning the mathematics um i'd forgotten it all by then and then worked on developing you know so what are the first principles and i i decided it would you know have to be evolution and ecology that all living systems essentially obey the laws of darwin and therefore cancer must do the same and so i sat down and i started writing um uh population uh dynamic equations looking at a cancer looking at the interaction of cancer with with normal cells and then the cancers with each other cancer cells with each other and competing them and and that sort of thing and so that was um how i started it um now why why were you so convinced bob that this had to be done mathematically as opposed to theoretically but without the the quote-unquote cumbersome mathematics that comes with it i think that that i brought with it an appreciation of non-linearity that human beings think linearly and when complex systems have non-linear things like feedback loops that uh you know so the linear thinking is if you do one you get two you get two you do two you get four you get four you do eight you know that we're real good the human brain is very good at that but non-linear dynamics were really not good at all and and a great example which is also from philadelphia uh was uh benjamin franklin wanted to see the uh a lunar eclipse one evening and um but a nor'easter came in now in nor'easter if you live in philadelphia you're familiar with these they winds coming from the north northeast hence the name and this uh you know these are often violent storms and so it rolled in and he couldn't see the the the winter eclipse now franklin like all scientists of his day thought that the wind carried the storm and in fact if you ask a child how do you how do you think storms move they will say well it must be the wind blowing it because it makes sense it's intuitively obvious that that's the case but when he learned what he talked to his brother in boston about the eclipse it turned out that the storm arrived in boston after the eclipse was over so in fact the storm was going in the opposite direction of the wind and he was really the first uh scientist to be to to recognize that that's that that that obvious that that something that's intuitively clear must be happening is also wrong and and so i think that um in cancers we see non-linearities all the time and and again the feedback the evolutionary dynamics of resistance for example is a good example that and we can't intuitively predict those things we need to actually understand first principles and the underlying mathematics to to to capture that piece of it and so i guess i was very involved in that kind of thing and to me it seemed obvious that we needed to do the math because um what what the things that were were being done in in cancer treatment were often intuitively obvious but we're clearly not working um so uh so i don't know i mean i i mean i may be putting retrospective you know analysis on that but at the time it seemed that it really had to be understood mathematically of course from a physics background that's just kind of a natural you know the theory has to be fundamentally about mathematics so just this is just sort of a fun aside question why do you think that evolution gave us as humans the ability to understand linear systems quite well and absolutely no capability to understand non-linear systems so for example it's clear that we don't understand hyperbolic discounting like we just can't do it is it simply that evolution wasn't optimizing for that problem and it really didn't when it came down to reproduction and survival linearity was sufficient that would be my guess that that what we need to know to survive and and proof rate is is linear is sufficiently linear that we can probably that's probably all that was needed uh but i i you know i i'd have to think more about that i mean what's what's linear in the world that um is so important but but my sense is that um relatively simple things that that are related to you know eating and running away from uh predators and that sort of thing and running after mates probably sufficiently linear that that was really all that was necessary so as you're getting deeper into the mathematics of um of of of um of the biology you're probably struck by the fact that you don't have a lot of colleagues in this space right there's not a conference for theoretical biologists right i know no and and and similar to the the response of your colleagues to your model um pretty much everybody pretty much all of my colleagues hated it um thought the whole thing was ridiculous were they even qualified to understand it probably not but but just on an intuitive level it was um they just couldn't understand why you would do this and it's funny because if i had a dollar for every time someone said to me that cancer is too complicated to model i you know i wouldn't have to apply for grants anymore because that was kind of the prevailing wisdom and and i mean the irony of that is that the argument itself is self is self-defeating if it's that complicated then you have to have mathematics i mean you there's there's no way that the the human brain is going to understand complex systems without sufficient you know mathematics unfortunately i think in there was a certain arrogance that you're also taught as physicians which is that well it's too complicated to model but my superior intellect will be able to sort of master this and and figure it out i mean i i always got the feeling that there was that that second clause in that statement that that was that went unsaid but was part of this kind of idea that this confidence that um we can understand this and you know we step back and we can take care of this without the mathematics um and so so i think it takes some humility to say well i really need to look at the math models and the computer simulations to understand how i think this is going to happen i don't know that we physicians have been taught humility with sufficiently well to um you know to accept that yeah and and another great example of that is look at other incredibly complex systems like um economics um and of course i i don't know what the stats would be but certainly a sufficient number of the nobel prizes awarded in that field are you know in their fun are fundamentally based on mathematics right whether it be game theory or otherwise obviously a lot of them are behavioral as well but nevertheless i don't think anybody is suggesting that the models are sufficient in economics in other words that you can take an economic model you can plug in all of the initial conditions and it will tell you the answer if unemployment is this if the rate of home price appreciation is this if inflation is this here are 50 you know starting variables put them in the model and it will spit out you know gdp growth 10 years from now i don't think anybody's so delusional to believe that that's true but it still doesn't minimize what the model can do for your understanding of the system yeah we we like to talk about uh hurricane modeling um you know and weather modeling in general which is which is a classic example of how to master a complex dynamic system um and you know you can you can pretty much you could be pretty sure that you can predict what's going to happen in the next 24 hours after that the the um the complexity as well as stochastic uh you know changes are going to degrade the the accuracy but that doesn't mean that so at each day you you you get more data and you just keep predicting forward um it's it's not necessary at least again in in sort of cancer modeling to say what's going to happen 10 years from now it's it's just you need to know what should i do what therapy should i use today and and for the next three months say and then after that we'll we'll get more data we'll we'll start again um but but sometimes people expect more of that of it than that and like you said that's uh this idea that we should be able to predict the entire course is is is not realistic you know i'm glad you brought up hurricanes and weather because as you note they're some of the most complicated models out there and that has to do with the fact that they behave in many ways as these you know like lorenz curves right so they are chaotic systems and because they are so so so sensitive to initial conditions um they don't really behave well outside of very very narrow delta t windows and you know as we i remember still i remember in college when we began studying chaos you know the first example you learn is about the butterfly that flaps its wings in tokyo that leads to the storm two weeks later in new york where would you put and this is getting way ahead of ourselves because we're going to come back and go through it from an evolution perspective but just at the outset before i forget to ask this question where would you put cancer models on the relative spectrum of here's a really well-behaved model on one side you know some linear regression model that works perfectly because you have infinite past data and the future scenarios don't deviate so that's like a monkey model and then at the other end of the spectrum you have the weather predicting hurricane predicting model as the most chaotic if if that's a one and a ten where does where does cancer biology behave i think probably eight or nine okay i mean i think it's i think it's on more on the chaotic i think there's a lot of stochasticity there's also a lot of heterogeneity um and i think those things make it difficult um and um so it's it's harder to predict but not infinitely hard i mean i think we can we can do this but we always have to have a level of humility and understanding that um first of all evolution is very clever uh and likes to embarrass you so that um you know you can easily you can easily crash and burn um but it's not it's not random either i mean there's there's predictability to it and and finding that that that point between them where you can predict with reasonable certainty um and also sort of hedge your bets in ways that even if things don't go exactly as you plan but you can still benefit the patient from you know early recognition that it's not going the way you planned recalibrating models rethinking the underlying dynamics and then going forward um as opposed to you know here's your your model you know just take one a day for the next 10 years and you'll be fine uh i i don't think we can we can be at that point so let's go back to you know that first year where you're you've relearned the mathematics um [Music] presumably at some point you say i want to look in nature and see where mathematics has already come up with an elegant way to describe a similar problem is that what led you to the study of predator prey models yeah it just the um equal evolutionary dynamics in general um and and because it's very appealing because of course their living systems you know the ecology of of you know swamps and that sort of thing is very complicated and yet they can more or less master these these these complex relationships and so that was appealing to me um it was also appealing to me because you know when you work in a cancer center um the the uh the cancer almost takes on a a persona a like an evil entity kind of thing almost magical in its ability to uh to overcome anything that the physicians do and and and if you talk to oncologists many of them will you know have that they may not say it but they have that kind of sense of it and to me just saying that cancers have to obey darwinian laws that they're not magic they're not unfathomable they they simply are really good evolutionary machines and we can we can we can master this we we understand evolution and and we can get on top of this this is this you know it's not it's not something that we cannot understand because before that it just felt like we have no basis to understand this it just happens and we do this and this happens and so this to me gave it some deterministic quality some some cause effect uh relationships that uh that at least to me were comforting like yeah we could we could deal with this so explain to folks how the standard relatively simple predator prey models work so um the swamp is too complicated because you might have multiple predators in multiple prey but let's start with first order differential equations second order differential equations where you've got one you know you've got an isolated ecosystem where you've got foxes and hairs how does that dynamic work well the you know the hairs uh essentially turn uh convert um local vegetation to babies uh to baby hairs and so they reproduce the foxes or whatever the predator is going to eat the the the rabbits um and of course so then you get these these population rises and falls because uh if the um if the predator eats too many of the of the prey then its population will tend to decline as its population declines the predator population expands and so you can see these this cycling effect that goes on for prolonged periods of time and there at least are some data that have suggested that this is the case but as with everything that's that's living it's it's always more complicated than that there's always various factors that that's come into play but at least that was really i think probably if probably the first of uh really kind of recognized uh population models that began to be applied to nature um and so it's kind of it's interesting to see that and predator prey models are still are things that we use a little bit like for the immune system where the immune system is kind of a predator and the and it's chasing after the the cancer cells um but of course there's there's important differences in that the the uh predator eats the prey and gains you know substrate from that whereas in in the pre in the immune system it kills the the cancer cells but it loses substrate doesn't eat them up and in fact if anything if anybody's eating anything it's probably the cancer cells are swooping up uh you know elements of their brethren that you know the macromolecules that they're getting spilled into the environment so so there's it again it's one of those things that's an appealing model the predator prey model in in immunotherapy and yet there are important distinctions that you have to recognize that that make the biology different and in some ways can give advantages to the prey that you don't really expect so when you move on to a more complicated system like the swamp right where you've got you know you've got everything from algae to bacteria to you know small fish and then you have to deal with how much sunlight is coming in and what's the temperature i mean now it starts to look a little bit more like the human body where why is there an algal you know bloom here that basically consumes all of the oxygen and rapidly kills all the fish versus a system that can be somewhat in a sustained setting where you never fully get rid of the algae but the fish can live and there's kind of a beautiful chain of carbon fixation that goes from algae to fish so to me like how did you get to the point where you could look at that and say we can now model this for human cancer given that this is far more likely how it behaves um again it's you know simplifying uh it it's uh you know the best we can do is sort of a cartoon and it's interesting to think about why i mean ecologists that are looking at a new ecosystem we'll begin by asking a very simple question what's the birth rate and death rate of each species that's present we don't know that in the cancer i mean astonishingly enough that's not data that we get what's the carbon cycle what's the iron cycle what's the you know nitrogen what are all these cycles how can we can we watch these substrate pass through individuals and and how does that work we don't get that so one of the uh problems that and so we called this kind of turned pale when we when they started asking these questions and realized that we have that the cancer biologists have never thought in those terms i mean something as simple as what is the what is the birth rate and the death rate of the cancer population um you know it's it's astonishing to me that we we don't know that that that and um you know things like that you know what's the growth rate of the tumor what are we kind of dealing with even in a first order kind of uh estimate um we we often don't do um and it's kind of astounding to me it that that we have we do things very crudely in in my opinion we don't we you know the evolutionary biologists ecologists are you know take a far more sophisticated view of these of these interactions than we do even to the point an interesting fact is that if you were a pesticide manufacturer you are required by law to submit a a resistance management plan you have to identify how pes become resistant to your you know what are the mechanisms of resistance and how do i plan to prevent that from occurring you can you can introduce cancer drugs i mean what cancer drugs are routinely um approved without any knowledge of what the resistance mechanism is much less how you're going to manage that in a patient so again this this odd kind of disconnect that um in some ways i think the ecologists evolution biologists have have pushed ahead of us and we're just still trying to catch up with them in terms of understanding of taking their sophisticated models and applying them to cancer so let's talk about the ecologic models of pests and um pesticides because that's something that i think gave you a big insight correct yes so uh one of the things that i had run across was just a a kind of a story on the on the internet news somewhere about the diamondback moth and and it was a the story was that it was that it it uh was first recognized i think it's in indiana somewhere in the midwest uh in the uh mid 19th century and and this this the dimebag moth has has the i guess the the um uh the the honor of having received and struck by every pesticide developed in the modern era and um and what it has done is is absolutely nothing uh the it in fact it's spread all over the i'm back boss spread all over the country and to europe and to asia and it's just everywhere and in the 1980s it was they were uncovering diamondback moths that were uh not susceptible to any known pesticide i mean they had become resistant to all of them and uh to me this was it was interesting because so it began to sort of look at this this whole process and and of course farmers for for centuries um used pesticides freely and the idea is you dump as much of it on on the the uh your fields as you can you want to you know get rid of as many of the pests as you can um but what people realize is that by doing that you're selecting for resistance and so explain to people why that's true because it is counter-intuitive i think most people would say well gosh if i'm a farmer and i've got my acre of corn here and there are a million moths that have descended on this acre i want to get every one of them eradicated and the best odds of doing that wouldn't that just be using all of the pesticide i can just shy of killing my own crop yes and that that's one of those things that is intuitively appealing but not necessarily true and and the reason is that you're you're dealing with a very large population and this is not a uniform population it's that this is biology which means that there's there's heterogeneity within that population and there are moths in that population that are extremely sensitive to the pesticide and there's going to be moths in that that population that are not very sensitive okay so let's put some numbers to it so that i just gave you a million moths you dump the best pesticide imaginable on them what if we assume that there's a spectrum and you know 20 of them die at the first whiff of the pesticide 60 of them uh eventually get clubbed to death but 20 percent of them i don't know they they seem somewhat immune is that yeah let's just use those numbers right sure sure um and then so short term you did good because you got it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you got it right right now dump pesticide on them again and now you know maybe one so that population that's that's that's that 20 percent now has a whole field that's open to it it has no competitors um so it can rapidly expand um and it's taking its genome with it and so it's you know the the its offspring will also be somewhat heterogeneous but they will definitely be shifted more toward the uh the resistant one so you now you you dump your your massive amounts of pesticide and maybe you have five percent of them that die and maybe you get 20 of them that you know eventually die but 80 of them don't and and you just keep doing so year one or you know season one um looks good and and again that intuitively you know like a really good idea but the long-term effect is that now you've got pests that you can't control anymore you're you're you have a pesticide that doesn't work um and so in in the longer term what you've done is you've created a species you can no longer control um now you have to find a new pesticide and you know there's always some cross-resistance and and in any large biological population there's sufficient heterogeneity that it's most likely that you're going to have resistance so if it worked and and part of this is say well yeah okay that but how do you know that uh there's resistance and and it's simple if it worked there wasn't resistance but you know from from experience you know for that and over and over and over again what you found was that you use this large you know dose pesticides you can you can get a short-term gain but in the long term it doesn't work um so believe you know your your eyes and so it it and so this actually uh you know again ecologists that was about you know were way ahead of us here and they said well okay that doesn't this this has got to there's got to be something different to this and so uh in the nixon administration this is a long time ago same time that they started the one cancer um the this this the using large doses of pesticide was essentially um uh not allowed and they started to do this thing they called integrated pest management and the idea with this is that you recognize that you can't eradicate the pests that there's simply no um just historically there's nothing that's ever done that before so let's assume that's not going to happen this time let's give enough pesticide that we're going to knock this population low enough that that they're not going to do very much crop damage but don't do more than that and and there's a number of ways you can do that so for example um they would take a field and they would they would put pesticide on three quarters of the field and leave one quarter alone these you know you would knock this population down but you would not you to this last quarter of the field you're applying no selection for resistance and so these guys would then uh move out to the rest of the field and you know you would eventually get this low population but you're not selecting for resistance um there's a there's a another bit of this and that is that the resistance costs something um you know to be able to deal with a toxic uh pesticide or toxic drug you know you have to have the molecular machinery necessary to deal with it you have to be able to repair your mecha your your dna if it's if it's damaged you have to be able to pump it out which is what a lot of them do i mean there's a number of different mechanisms but all those mechanisms have a cost it doesn't necessarily have to be a big cost but uh but but and and in the cost-benefit ratio when you've got a lot of this drug around those guys are clearly that you know the the benefit greatly outweighs the cost but when there's no drug present the the then the cost does not uh it does not outweigh the ben i'm sorry the benefit does not away the cost and so now the guys that are not resistant don't have to carry that machinery around with them are more fit and so there's this then subtle competition that goes on so you'll be selecting for resistance in let's say the three quarters of the field but when the one when the ones that are sensitive move into that area they have a benefit they have the benefit of not having this uh pesticide being applied to them anymore there's no selection for resistance and their fitness advantage will be such that the that when the uh when the pest population comes back to something close to what it was the beginning it's as sensitive as it was in the in the beginning and so will it actually get better i mean is there a is there a scenario here under which if i'm understanding you correctly yeah the moths that will um be able to best resist the pesticide they that comes at a cost and the cost is molecular machinery that is only there to allow them to survive the toxicity of the pesticide but not reproduce better or acquire food better so the the more quickly you can get non-pesticide resistant moths back into their ecosystem who presumably in the absence of pesticide now have a fitness advantage over them because they don't have the extra baggage they don't need in a non-pesticide world they'll actually out-compete them so is there a scenario where in year one 20 of the moths are resistant to the pesticide but if you manage it correctly in year five that number is 10 because they have actually been out competed by the other moths yeah so where were you 20 years ago because um when i i only recently has this has has your scenario come up and um i i guess we're getting a little ahead of ourselves but but we we've done a study now with with in men with prostate cancer where we've used a drug and what we did was that this we gave the drug until the tumor responded to 50 of its pre-treatment value pulled it away let the let the tumor come back up but again similar to this tool we talked about the the um there's no pesticide being applied there's no drug being applied there's no re there's no um there's no sen there's no selection for resistance and so the sensitive guys are supposed to come back up and there's and and so grow at the expense of the resistance now for a very long time our models said that what would happen is that every time the sensitive population came down the resistant population would go up a little bit and when the sensitive population started going we took the drug away let the sensitive population grow the the resistant population would plateau and what we then assumed is that at each cycle you would you would have this plateau so stepwise it would just keep going up and at some point you would lose control inevitably and all of our models said that if we did this somewhere between two and twenty cycles the three would fail wow that's that's a that's a huge variance though two to 20 cycles that could be the difference between a few months and a few years why such a why such a difference well we we didn't know the at time we we we didn't know what the fraction of resistant population was at the beginning so that was probably the biggest thing so if it's one percent it's you know that takes longer than if it's if it's uh let's say 20 or 30 percent um and there are some other things like the the uh we didn't we weren't really entirely sure what the proliferation rate was and again i mean things like birth and death we didn't we just estimated those um but so we we've done so we did this um trial on this just a a a pilot trial to see if this worked and and so what we did was we then so we gave this kind of intermittent therapy and we compared it to patients that just got the standard maximum tolerated dose until progression the the difference between the groups was 16 months so the median time progression for standard of care was 14 months which is pretty much what's what's uh in the literature for the for the the um adaptive therapy group it was 30 months um which was which was great uh but then we said but of the 20 four patients are now out five years and they're still cycling and this is this is patients with metastatic prostate cancer that's that's correct um so what the models said and this is this is now gets this gets very nerdy but but the perhaps the most important thing that came out of this trial was the number seven because the ratio of the fitness uh measure for the sensitive cells was seven fold that of the resistant cells and we had estimated at two or three so it's a big difference and and the reason and it's a big difference in favor of the healthy cell exactly and so what we see then is that when the sensitive cells you have sensitive cells to go down resistant cells go up sensitive cells go up we expected them to plateau but in fact they're going down but seven they go down and what we found was that if you in fact had three cycles where you you hit that sweet spot exactly the the resistance cells progressively went toward extinction so three successive cycles is a critical enough mass that you can drive that resistance cell to a presumably to a place where and by the way is it limited by substrate is that the most important factor that is creating the fitness differential yes we think now it's it's going to be they're competing for space and substrate um and of course in the tumor environment is um one in which usually the substrate delivers very poor because the the you know the blood flow isn't very good so substrate is probably the most limiting factor but again we don't know this i mean this is again one of those things that i wish we knew more about because we're in in some ways we're just working in the dark but what's happened is that what we and so when we go back and looked at these these four patients that that's that you know have just you have gone far beyond anything that you would expect uh for this treatment i mean it's just there's very rare that someone would go five years um on this treatment using standard of care and what we found was that each of them had these three sequences cycles where we where the model predicted that they drove the the the resistant population to extinction or or something very close to none of the others had the three cycles no none and and and that was the key thing that we learned from this and which is one of the great advantages of having the math models because you can self-critique now now you don't just take the the results of the cohort and say well this is nice we did 16 months better we can also look at what we did and say what did we do right and what did we do wrong and what the model said was that we had built into the into the protocol some components that that that as a result we did not hit those those three consecutive cycles perfectly and and we and universally we over treat it um if we had cut back on therapy we would have done still better and the models predicted that every patient in both cohorts in this study could have had we we could have gained control of the tumor indefinitely what were the two what was the other cohort the other cohort received standard of care which is maximum oh but this was but this was not randomized those were that's correct it was a contemporaries and what were you following was your metric psa or was the essay well that was probably where the biggest mistake we made is that we we were following the psa but then we required that when when the psa went down then it would be confirmed by radiographic studies and we were getting the psa every month but you're constrained by insurance to get radiographic studies every three months and so what would happen is that the psa would get to 50 but we didn't do we didn't change therapy until we got the the radiographic exchange so you were which meant they were lagging for two months they kept getting treatment and they kept driving down so we were take we were killing off too many of the resistance of the sensitive cells and therefore they were not able to you were impeding their fitness now of course this is you know what what this what the model said is you guys are idiots you know if you just stayed with the psa you know you would have been you would have gotten far better results than you did and you got pretty good results anyway um so so your your your your question um goes to something that we honestly never thought about before which is that um we may be able so we we thought we could use the sensitive cells to control the resistant cells this suggests you can actually use the sensitive cells to destroy the resistant cells to eradicate the crit now i you know never thought about that but this is now opening up a whole new avenues of of therapy at least theoretically i mean at least potentially because there's a lot of cases where um you know the initial therapy for for cancers gets great results i mean you know they talk about remission tumors going into remission and of course what happens is the tumor eventually comes back um and what we know then is is that this the resistance cells are there but they're in a very small number and you can then estimate that they must be way way way less fit than the sensitive cells in the absence of treatment and that so that fitness difference is it must be very large and so um using a number like seven as the ratio is not unreasonable in fact it's it's highly likely and so now we've got this situation where maybe we can um start to think about using these very effective therapies so right now what we do is we we give the therapy you know tumor kind of disappears can't see it and what do we do we keep giving the same therapy we give it until progression well as we're doing that you know we've knocked the tumor to the ground but we just keep giving it the same treatment and of course what we're doing so we're just we're closing the gap we're reducing the fitness ratio from seven six five four three two one and it'll flip on you yeah so now suddenly we've got all we've got is resistant cells i can keep treating that all i want that's not gonna work but these are highly vulnerable to additional perturbations so the the thing is instead of just giving this treatment you know putting the the get you know getting the um cancer populations to something that's very very small and then just keep training them at that point hit them again do do something different um apply additional perturbations um one of my colleagues likes to say this is we we we're like we're like boxing here you know you knock your opponent down and when you go to your you go to your corner and you know the referee counts and when the when the opponents back up then you start again and you know this is it's not a boxing match it's a knife fight you know this is to the death and and that means that when you knock your opponent down you don't stand back and wait you go attack and and i think that we've that's an approach and we've called that an extinction approach that we think is something that has not been explored yet but it's interesting that if you look at anthropocene extinctions if you look at how our species has killed off other species this is the way it happens there's usually a an initial perturbation but then after that when you get a small population you get a sequence of smaller perturbations that drive it to extinction it's a two-step kind of process what's interesting is that you cause extinction through a sequence of perturbations none of which by itself could cause extinction in cancer we're always looking for the magic bullet the one that will eradicate the cancer and not and and not the normal cells and for death for a century we've been looking for magic bullets but maybe all we need is a series of pretty good bullets um and and so that's a different sort of thinking process but it but it is hard to to to to sell that um especially to a medical community in which new drug development is is what's most incentivized um so using the same drug um so the in the in the case of our of our protocol it's it's using a drug called aberration which is which is off patent nobody's making any money on this you know so um it's not there's no pharma there's no pharma company that's going to support you know the clinical trials there's it's really it's kind of an orphan drug so there's no there's there's no natural supporter for this and the same is true with a lot of these other things that we're really just talking about using drugs that already exist about using them better you know again there's just not a there's not kind of a natural um support for it within the you know medical community i want to detour for a second bob and talk about um how this logic fits into an area that frankly i've never considered until now i've just taken it for granted which is the use of antibiotics and bacteria so standard thinking is you have a bacterial infection you give the antibiotic and you know there's some magic number which is you're going to give it for x number of days it's a 10 day course now three days into that 10 day course the patient is defervest they feel completely better the tissue culture is negative but we continue to give the antibiotic for seven more days because our fear is or what we were told was if you don't you will generate resistance but based on what you're telling me now that might not be true in fact it might be that giving that seven additional days of antibiotic might be exactly the thing that is leading to resistance is that am i misunderstanding yes i think that's certainly true i mean i don't work with um infections and there are but there are um people that are are looking at this exact issue um how do we uh how do you prevent uh the development of resistance of bacteria and worldwide it's a big problem with malaria and tuberculosis and and things like that and so the world health organization actively uses evolution-based mathematical models um to plan how they they deliver treatment and a lot of it is as as i understand it again this isn't my area is that they are trying to kind of uh do this kind of adaptive approach where you just keep the resistant population low now there are some exceptions where uh i i my understanding is some people have advocated regional attempts to eradicate a uh a population so so and again a little bit like the anthropocene extinctions so bob is one difference i guess as the more i think about this between antibiotics and bacteria versus chemotherapy and cancer technically a person can live with a billion cancer cells in their body and not i mean you could live with billions of cancer cells in your body and be totally fine is that true with you know bacteria is that true could you have a billion mrsa floating around your bloodstream and still be fine or do we need complete extinction there in a way that we don't with cancer i you know i don't know uh we'll have to we have to get a uh someone that's expert in this um i i think that the the one thing to remember is that by the time you have a cancer it's defeated your immune system whereas bacteria often you know are still very different from our normal cells and therefore i think more targetable by the immune system i think there's probably a slightly different dynamic in that that that may change things but but i i would defer to the uh to the people that are that are doing this i i can give you some names of people that are um interested in this topic well i'm glad to hear that people are studying this because antibiotic resistant bacteria are a huge problem in the hospital right and we've heard it you know again we've heard about these super bugs um and you can't help but wonder based on what you're saying if a big part of the problem is we're creating them by over treating in situations when we don't need to uh you know using using a drug for a lot longer than we need to let's give people a sense of some numbers because i you know i remember when i was in medical school i spent a few months at the nih and the nci and i i got all these amazing assignments to do and what my favorite assignment to do as the medical student was to look up all of the literature on cancer growth rates um and so and they gave me this assignment because of my background in math and so it was sort of like i could go digging in all the literature on you know every you know starting with the most trivial sort of logistic models to the you know gompertz model and all of these other models but one of the things that really is interesting is just how many cancer cells you need to actually even be detected right it's about a billion cells in a centimeter cubed so usually the number that's used yeah you couldn't even there's no clinical outside of what we now have as liquid biopsies there's no clinical way to even detect cancer shy of about a billion cells and this speaks to the non-linearity right to go from a million to a billion versus a billion to a trillion like these are it's hard for people to wrap their head around what's involved in those things and and both from a growth perspective because that's not linear and a size perspective because you're dealing with something that's growing with a cube power not a square power where do you see this being an issue because the numbers are so enormous right and this gets to your question of if we talked about the example i used earlier there being like a million moths well the heterogeneity there is already significant but once you're talking about tens of billions of cells by definition the heterogeneity is probably even more significant correct absolutely i and and it's really important i think there's two factors to think about one is that is stochasticity if you have a small population small changes in birth and death rates can be quite significant you know small populations can go extinct based on very small changes the other thing is what's called the ali effect and that is that in a classic uh evolutionary model as a population grows the fitness should be decreasing because you're getting toward the carrying capacity of the environment uh but ali and others have found that it increases as and the reason is that there's an advantage in groups um and uh in in herds for example i mean you can the obvious advantage is that they can gather themselves to uh to defeat uh predators uh but they can also there's there's sort of leadership issues and and and other things in tumors um there's there's a couple of things one is they have to make blood vessels and that means that there's small groups of them have to get together and make the angiogenic factors that they then send to the uh to the blood vessels to to bring a blood vessel in it's probably not a single cell that can do that it's to be a loosely organized system um the development of exchange matrix that you know the tumors it's just not tumor cells they make a uh collagen and other things that go in the between the cells that provide a kind of a structure for them to to live on um they have to make that and that it can't just be anything they probably act together for that and then they also probably act together to defeat the immune system um they they can secrete things um and and they they can and so there's a number of things that that they can act together on so that the you know tumor cells small populations may not grow as fast as large populations and they may be more vulnerable to treatment they may not be as able to deal with immunotherapy or target therapy or or even chemotherapy because they don't have the capacity to act together so those two things are i think important factors in understanding treatment and this is a little bit why um you know i was talking about when you know there are therapies now that can take large cancers and and drive them down so that they become not detectable by ct scans which means that their population has to be very small um those guys are now vulnerable to dynamics related to stochasticity and effects that the larger populations are not necessarily um you know applicable are not necessarily responsive to and if you and one of the things that's very interesting if you take something like neoadjuvant therapy where you when you take a big uh breast cancer for example you you make it small and then take it out what you find is that the tumor isn't a ball that just shrinks so you don't start with a big ball you get a smaller ball in fact it fragments and so what you get are little islands of tumor cells surrounded by uh fibrosis or necrosis or something like that so these guys are iowans you know this these are highly vulnerable um and so i think that that this is when we you know we should crank it up and kill it uh i i think that this i think tumors are vulnerable at this point but i think that the way we've done things which is this dogma in oncology you know continuous maximum tolerated dose until progression and as you just said you can't see it if if you're waiting for a progression you you won't see that until you have billions of cells i mean it has to be big enough that you can image or feel and that's at least a cc of tumor and it's probably two or three cc's um by that time now if you when you change therapy you're you're you're dealing with a really big population whereas you could have been dealing with a small fraction of it you know a few months earlier when you couldn't see it now the oncologists always get well i have to be able to see something to be able to understand whether it's effective or not you know my therapy is effective yeah and and that's i you know i get that but but you're not going to be able to do that in this setting um what's interesting is that the pediatric oncologists learned this a long time ago this is how they cure leukemia um they give an induction therapy and then they immediately change to a different therapies so what they learned was that even after induction therapy when there was no apparent tumor in the bone marrow or in the blood that if you didn't do anything the kids would all relapse and so they hit it immediately with another with another group of drugs and then another group of drugs they they it and so this is you know first strike second strike kind of approaches um but they're not they can't measure their outcome they can only measure their outcome in the long term by saying well we've cured this kid right they can't say which drug was more effective in that cocktail right and it you'll probably never know in in in uh there's this there's this thing called the extinction vortex that they talk about in in uh extinctions where when the when you've got a small population there's a there's typically a sequence of perturbations and and and they if they they um they tend to be self-synergizing in other words they the further down the population you push uh the more sensitive it is to stochastic and and um alley effects and so now you you can never really tease apart those dynamics it just it just all goes into extinction eventually um and and the goal then is not to try to really put these things together in a in a really additive way except to say that all these guys together um will tend to push this to you know this this population to extinction again it's a different strategy uh than you know we it's and it's a little less um precise than i guess you know we would like but but that that is you know the nature i think of the of the extinction process as we've learned it i mean we it's interesting because whenever you say extinction everybody thinks about the dinosaurs um and and i would argue even that some of our therapy uh is is that that kind of single event single cause you know extinction um application of massive evolutionary force to to the species and you wipe it out and of course the problem is you also wipe out most of the land animals on earth so it's it's indiscriminate whereas uh what we've learned from anthropocene extinctions from our own species eradicating other species you know as unfortunate as that is we've been able to study those in detail and have learned that in fact most extinctions are multi-cause multi-event not not it's not the dinosaurs they are the exception not the rule and so when we want to think about an anthropocene extinction of cancer cells which is which is arguably what therapy is that we would probably we should probably be thinking more about these multi-cause you know approaches rather than trying to find a magic bullet that um can could could cure the cancer by itself because you always have these side effects um and it's it's so far we've not found a magic bullet well and to your point it's uh the bigger issue with the dinosaur analogy is not even so much that it's the exception and not the rule it's the collateral damage when it's when it's when there's a single strike success the collateral damage you know changes the planet um if what killed the dinosaurs when that killed them came on our planet today it would probably kill a lot of other things as well absolutely let me ask you a question oh go ahead no i was just saying that sometimes when i talk tell people about that you know i said that you know a tumor might have a hundred grams of tumor which is a which is still a pretty small tumor is going to have 100 billion cells let's say which is far more than the human population on earth you know think about could you do one thing could you apply one event that would kill all the people on earth and now nothing else you know and and i i think it'd be i mean it's probably something could be done but i i think that'd be very difficult and and it's a kind of a gruesome analogy but at least it it kind of makes the point that it's it's it's the idea of a magic bullet i think is um may not be it may not be an achievable result what role does time play in the sequencing of this so let's go back to the example of pediatric oncology where um you could sequence you know you go induction therapy and then you go with a series of therapies to follow so single shots right so one two three four five six versus all six at once let's put aside the toxicity for a moment because a big reason you wouldn't do that is the toxicity to the child and a lot of these you know you have synergistic side effects that are intolerable but just thinking about this from a theoretical standpoint um would there be an advantage or disadvantage to one of those approaches yeah so i think that i mean it would certainly be reasonable to say well if we've if if we've got these three different therapies why don't we put them together and give them all once and and oncology has been doing this for a long time and the results have been pretty much uh uniform in that what we find is that they do better than one that you know the the results are they they the tumor is controlled for a longer period of time but the result is still that they dye the disease that the tumor comes back and they die now and but and you can add more you know four or five drugs and what tends to happen is that you get this diminishing return so that you just start getting more toxicity and no real increased benefit so one of these to think about is suppose you have two drugs and you're applying it to a 10 billion population you know so what is the probability that that there are going to be cells present that are resistant to both still high you have a big denominator you know so but now let's say you you have a million so let's say you give one drug you get it you know you really do a great job you're down to a million cells let's say 10 million cells now you add the second drug and so now it's what's what is the probability that within this 10 million uh that you you will have some resistance knock it down again give a third drug now what's the probability let's say of a hundred thousand so you see what i mean so but is that is that predicated on delivery because you would argue that if those are independent events it shouldn't matter if they're done in sequence or all at once right what is it about sequencing those that would create a treatment advantage there's two things one is you get as you get smaller the there's going to be you're with killing the tumor cells that are sensitive but remember that that the ones that are resistant are also have to deploy mechanisms of resistance uh bingo we're right back to that discussion and and i guess to your point they're gonna be more fragmented and therefore have less of the group network effect right and so now you know again when you've got a small population subtle changes in birth and death rates will be sufficient to drive it to extinction that makes sense and so even and and as i talked to people about potentially designing this even though there may be resistance um that you can still use the resistance to your to your uh your benefit and some people have talked about then adding things like uh environmental changes so let's take an ang antiandrogenic so that you're now you're delivering less blood and you're creating a more difficult substrate and environment um and some people have you know there's there's people that have used uh antacids people have used you know a number of different uh and these are more these aren't typically you know common medical practice but but what individuals are doing based on their own exploration through google and other other websites is that and they use various metabolic uh things and i i think there you know is potentially advantage to that again in combination with this in a way that that makes sense so so far most of what we've been speaking about is really more or less one class of drug with a slightly different take on another one right we've been talking about chemotherapy these are chemicals that are aimed at disproportionately killing cells that in theory are dividing right so let's go back to what you said earlier the the thing we learned in medical school that was incorrect was cancer cells divide more quickly than regular cells uh those of us that pay attention today know that that's not actually true at all the fundamental difference between a cancer cell and a non-cancer cell is the response to cell cycle signaling it's that a normal cell doesn't divide slower it just when it's told to stop dividing it stops dividing the cancer cell doesn't when it's told to stop dividing it says piss off i'm going to keep dividing yeah that's a very good point i mean that that really is and uh evolutionarily what this what this is is that it has a self-defined fitness function its proliferation is dependent on its own properties uh as they interact with the environment not on instructions from the tissue normal tissue cannot evolve because its birth and death is dependent on tissue controls and so you're dealing with that's right so knowing that chemotherapy which is the earliest form in the of of drug in the modern arsenal against cancer says how can we kill a cell that is not responding to cell cycle signaling and the the first shot across the bow is well let's just kill anything that's dividing because we know that normal cells are less likely to be dividing and cancer cells are more likely to be dividing so let's target different cycles of the dna proliferation phase and that's why of course most people who are getting chemotherapy have side effects to the normal tissues that relate to that so the mucosal ulcers the hair loss the you know skin damage nail thinning all of that stuff is because those are tissues even though they're normal that are dividing more rapidly and they're being you know smacked as part of the collateral damage you mentioned another class of drugs uh courtesy of you know someone named judah folkman who was really one of the first people to point out this idea that you've raised which is you know cancer cells have another challenge that they face which is they have to get the blood vessels to bring in the substrate the glucose that they need to replicate make energy and make building blocks to make more cells and what if we target those things these vascular endothelial growth factors and those drugs haven't turned out to be very successful by the way so they're billion dollar blockbuster drugs you know a vast and probably the first if i recall and they've extended median survival like a few months here and there but they really haven't been blockbuster drugs we haven't talked about immunotherapy right so we haven't talked about the you know katrudas of the world how they fit into that um but it seems to me and and there's others of course right we can talk about you know the the few cancers where a single gene mutation exists and you can target it with like a gleevac or something like that but it seems that you could use selective chemotherapies and target on top of that anti-vegf and the real question then becomes timing right how do you cycle those on and off to always be maximizing the gap in fitness so how do you maximize that fitness ratio by the way did your model predict that there's something specific about the number seven because if i recall you said your model thought you would end up between two and three you actually ended up at seven in retrospect does the model now tell you seven is the tipping point it's somewhere around there we've looked at that at the transition as you go from you know zero to two to three to seven it's it's in that range um i i don't know exactly where it is and it is certainly going to vary from uh from from tumor to tumor but it's in that it's certainly i would guess at the five-ish and so going back to my question do you think for example example the anti-vegf drugs play a critical role in this when the tumor is scattered the way i'm thinking about it right this i've anthropomorphized everything you've said into a society right which is the united states is 330 million people it's a mighty nation and if anybody attacks us in theory we can mount a response in a coordinated fashion et cetera et cetera et cetera and this analogy may be too stupid by the time it comes out of my mouth but basically if you decimated the population by 90 and there were only 33 million people left presumably we would no longer continue to be the united states of america we would be a whole bunch of disparate tribes in total chaos therefore we'd be a heck of a lot more susceptible is that a fair assessment yes yes and that's the you know in in in the military they talk about talk about defeating your enemy in detail meaning that if they're fragmented you you don't have to deal with the whole population you could just do it one at a time and and yes i think those are the case that's the case and when you look at tumors after neoadjuvant therapy these these small little populations look like they're you know a hundred maybe a thousand cells not not that millions of south wow and and they're widely separated you know they're not sending cells back and forth very much if at all so uh it's a very different dynamic than these continuous tumors that you know where if you take if you you know chop out this corner of the tumor for some reason and all the cells die they everything just sort of moves in there and eventually it repopulates you don't have that luxury in these fragmented populations and that's one of the major components of uh of anthropocene extinctions um uh the uh heath hand for example which pop which was all up and down the the northeast coast when the european settlers arrived was was finally just limited to martha's island and and although it was protected by the humans there um a series of things happened a couple of bad winters there was a fire in one in part of their habitat um and there was an a a disease developed uh and and although the the the humans um protected it so that its population grew considerably it was still in only the martha's vineyard and these perturbations uh essentially wiped it out you know it died again it was that kind of that that the extinction vortex several things and you can't point to any one of them as the cause but but together they they they wiped it out and there was you know if they had had another colony somewhere else you know they would still be alive um but but that that you know just didn't happen so so where do you think immunotherapy fits into the uh the tool kit here given that it's it tends to be more binary than chemotherapy right so immunotherapy i'm making this up because it varies by histology but let's just say you take people in the best case scenario to people that have checkpoint checkpoint mutations right so someone that has a a pd-1 mutation um the response rate to those people for a an anti-pd-1 drug like katruda is very high and very durable i mean far more than anything you see with chemotherapy absolutely conversely if they don't have the pd-1 mutation the drug is useless um so what does that tell us about the opportunity to use immune-based therapies and by the way we borrow the term adaptive therapy again here right so you have adaptive therapies within immunotherapy which are not to be confused with what you're describing as adaptive therapy yeah i think you know it's it's going to be a critical component of all this and yeah and as you say sometimes immunotherapy can stand on its own it's the closest thing to a magic bullet that i i think we have um i think what we tend to to to the the group i work with tends to view immunotherapy with the exception of those those unusually responsive tumors as your closer and this is our baseball analogy that um when you get the population that's small we think that alley effects are particularly important in immune response in response to the immune system meaning evasion from the immune system yeah right and so uh bringing the immune system in when you've got the the tumor on the mat you know it's it's small fragmented i think that will be the most effective closer that we have uh to to essentially wipe it out um i could be wrong but that in theory that's that looks like a a good um you know this is the one you bring in to win the game and by the way that could be going back to gen 1 immunotherapy which is interleukin-2 interleukin-2 had about a maybe a 10 to 20 response rate in melanoma a particularly immune sensitive cancer but but that was treating patients with full-blown metastatic melanoma maybe it would look very different in patients who were nad or who are you know visibly without disease and and there are some i i know that there have been some experiments that have suggested that cells that survive chemotherapy are more vulnerable to immunotherapy and ultimately that would be the game that you'd want to play here is that you what you want to do is apply a therapy and you know that the resistance strategy might be the following thing you know this is how it's going to evolve to become resistant and then attack the achilles heel that's that's uh that's exposed by this uh immune response um we had a person here do a as that's kind of the adverse of this now they did a p53 vaccine in in lung cancer patients that were had been treated it with multiple different things and and it didn't really get an effect i mean there was minimal efficacy one patient got a partial response none of the others did although they did generate immune cells to the to the vaccine they then went on and gave them chemotherapy and the response rate to the chemotherapy was was 60 to 70 percent astonishing number for patients at that stage in their disease it should have been less than five percent and the patients that had the best response to the best immune response to the um to the vaccine were the ones that were most responsive to therapy suggesting that those that responded you know they had they they developed adaptive strategies [Music] and those adaptive strategies then made them more vulnerable to toxicity i mean it's appealing to think that maybe they down regulated p53 so that you know they didn't have they were not expressing the target and of course p53 is important in survival mechanisms and that sort of thing so perhaps um that was a mechanism i'm just speculating of course but that's the kind of thinking that that um i would would like to apply here so that we're not isolating this you know you do this therapy and then you do this therapy and you do this therapy all of them in isolation but but start to put strategic strings of therapy together where the adaptive strategies that you're you're going to select for with one become vulnerable to the to two and three and so that you're putting them together in a strategic kind of thoughtful way rather than just kind of putting them together um you know in a in a kind of haphazard or intuitive way and again that's where math models can i think can be very helpful no that that actually makes a ton of sense um i want to talk about another feature of of cancer which is um what i call the source sync uh trade-off right so i'm sure you've thought a lot about this uh i endlessly thought about this and and really never came up with a great insight there are some cancers so so let's start from first principles there aren't that many cancers that can kill you without spreading let's list the ones that can brain cancer can kill you without spreading right so glioblastoma multiforme can kill you and it doesn't leave the brain uh primary hepatic cancer can kill you without spreading hepatocellular carcinoma can kill you um i suppose lung cancer can kill you without spreading though it's less common am i missing an example is there some other cancer that can kill you shy of metastasizing i think if you've for all for all intents and purposes yes okay i think you're right okay so that's principle number one then let's go to observation number two or observation number one i suppose there are certain cancers that always leave and they're very so there are certain cancers that are very deadly that leave tissues that other cancers never come to so breast cancer prostate cancer pancreatic cancer colon cancer these are deadly cancers which come from an environment that are not especially hospitable to cancers because when a woman gets breast cancer the first thing that cancer wants to do is get out and kill her by going to her bones her brain her lungs her liver pancreatic cancer virtually always wants to go to the liver and that's where it kills right you know colon cancer wants to go to the lungs wants to go to the liver and wants to go to the brain sometimes and that's where it kills but rarely does a cancer go to the breast or go to the pancreas or go to the colon or go to the prostate prostate virtually always wants to kill you by going to the bones so you see where i'm going with this like you have this and i could go on for hours with all of my observations right the brain is another one right it's an enormously attractive place for cancers to go to but a primary cancer from the brain never seems to leave now theoretically there's an exception to that i suppose there are some vascular tumors of the brain that can leave but they're not really brain parenchymal tumors do you have an insight into what explains this and more importantly does does the answer to that question or the the inference of an answer to that question offer an insight into the environment in which tumors thrive and therefore what we might be able to do about it um the short answer is i don't know the um let me tell you what i what i i'm certain of and that is this is not a planned event that uh we tend to give uh cancer cells this sort of anthropos you know anthropomorphic kind of you know they are first they go out and prepare a metastatic site and then they send their cells out to it that doesn't happen um the an evolving population can never adapt to conditions it has not seen before it it it it you it cannot plan to make metastases it can it and and it certainly can't plan to feather its nest you know in some distant site before sending out its scouts that's not happening but we know in nature that that we see introductions all the time and we know from nature that uh these inter species introductions are sometimes uh successful and sometimes not and it has to do with the way their phenotype interacts with the local adaptive landscape and can they adjust or not and and we know that sometimes it takes several introductions before one occurs sometimes it never happens sometimes they can expand and then and then die out um so i think that those are uh that this is again this is they're just basic rules that they have to uh you know live by so for example uh the you can see uh uh species being coming out of the amazon they they're they they get on to get you know just the amazon collects uh uh trees and and things that are floating down the animals are on it and so they go out and then anything that's in front of the amazon is going to be receiving more of these and so more are more likely to see a metastatic you know monkey or something like that from the middle of the amazon but and so the the the pancreas uh spills into the portal vein which then goes into the river and so it's delivering a lot of its cells to the liver so it makes sense then that it tends to metastasize there if only because it's just sending a lot of cells there um with others right the pancreas makes sense but how do you how do we make sure this stuff does yeah how do we make sense of the breast how do we make sense of the prostate going to the bone disproportionately yeah and so i think that there's um i mean there's i think we just suggest general principles that there's something about you know some of the breast cancer cells seem to be able to set up shop and bones some of them in the lung and some and and for reasons that are are not yet clear um but you mentioned actually something that's that's i think important source sync and i think that's dynamic and that's something that we've been talking about recently source habitat sink habitats the idea that you've got habitats that are uh have have very good blood supply that they produce a lot of cells but they and then now they're producing too many cells for the spatial environment and those cells have to go out and um one can think of those within a cell so that you've got areas with poor blood flow and areas of good blood flow next to another and you can imagine cells migrating between them and this can set up dynamics that are very interesting but you could also think about a you know breast cancer cell that's got let's say is near a blood vessel because and as as you might expect it so now it's getting big there's too many cells they crowd into the blood vessels it sends them out and so now you've got perhaps sink habitats somewhere else and there may be some coupling that goes on in ways that honestly i don't understand but but i think that we can sort of make up rules for that but but for sure i mean i think what what we know is that the limiting factor in this is the dynamics at this metastatic site that if you inject cancer cells into mice the nearly all of them die at the metastatic sites only a very small percentage of them that will form even a few cells in a smaller percentage of those that ultimately form more cells that form a population but i think this is again is that small population dynamics that we we've talked about there's stochastic effects uh lee effects you know there's there's a lot of uh statistical uh problems with with going from a single cell to uh to a cancer that's that's significant we are very lucky for that because we know that human cancers are frequently dumping millions of cells into the blood and aesthetic sites metastasis are are relatively rare when you think that you know people with early stage lung cancer you know you can find cancer cells in their bone marrow and yet they don't get bone marrow metastasis breast cancer is the same kind of thing you can do bone marrow biopsies on women getting mastectomies for apparently localized disease and maybe 30 to 40 of them will have breast cancer cells in their bone marrow and yet all of them do not develop um you know metastatic disease in the bones think thank goodness because uh it seems like for a variety of reasons and how much of that do you attribute to the alia fx and the stochastic variability that says look they're just not going to be fit enough to take up residence there um versus some other inherent principle of like the genetic robustness of the tumor itself because a lot of those women may go on to get adjuvant therapy and then it becomes a question of how successful was the adjuvant exactly yes exactly and i think that's where you know if you look at breast cancer for example what we know is that adjuvant therapy will reduce the probability of metastatic disease but not eliminated it's best a small effect and we need to do better with that um and and i it's it's a great point because um how do we treat you know adjuvant how do we treat breast cancer with aging therapy well we give them platinum or some you know some drug for some period of time and that's it well why don't we give you know a sequence of drugs why don't we take advantage of because we know for sure we're dealing with small populations and we know for sure that we can we can cause them to go extinct at least some of the time so why don't we optimize how we do this instead of simply pick up a drug from the shelf and and and administer it continuously you know for six months i that does you know this is another good example of where i think we've we've we've not thought through the eco-evolutionary dynamics of what we're trying to treat it seems to me yeah it's basically a paint by numbers approach right which is paint by numbers is we're just going to do it this way and and versus i'm going to think through this strategically um we we have a pretty good sense that the more cancer cells a person has in their body the more mutations they have right so the difference between a billion cells i.e one cc of cancer versus a trillion cells right which is like an almost fatal load of cancer is an enormous number of mutations and therefore it's not only bad from the mass effect but also from now the fitness of it right you have so you just have such a genetically a bad genetically diverse population so you have enormous heterogeneity within the genetic um you know badness for lack of a smarter word um can i add that you you also have diversity of their uh ecosystem well i i wanted to now get into the eco yeah yeah yeah no no but but let's let's do that yeah so let's talk about these two indices of of eco and evo indices which you've written about in in a very recent paper so explain for folks what these mean because these are these are they're not the easiest concepts to get your head around sometimes yeah so so when you talk to a cancer biologist about evolution they say it's mutation selection you know you get a random mutation and that the cancer cells you know accumulate these mutations occasionally they provide a benefit and that's what causes the tumor to expand the the problem with that approach is that um it assumes that the environment is stable it's they're all dealing with the same environment now um the alternative is to say that and i think the more evolutionary appropriate thing to say is that um there's tremendous variation in blood flow and and other factors within the tumor and um as the tumor goes into these areas of say low blood flow the environment is entirely different and so the the environment is applying selection forces that are totally different from let's say down the road where the it's you know the blood vessels are really good and the edge of the tumor these cells are competing with the normal cells internally they're competing with other tumor cells so so again entirely different environments and so the the more evolutionary model in my opinion is to say that the different environments within the tumor are the ones that give rise to different phenotypes which in in turn give rise to different genotypes so that in this case the genes aren't causing the evolution the genes are the consequences of evolution um one of the uh ways to think about this is to is to think about whether a modern-day darwin sitting on the beagle you know in the in the ship uh with his microwave machine he's got all these fancy molecular biology equipment and sailors just brought random samples of finches to this modern darwin they ground them up put them through the machine got you know billions and billions and billions of of data points could they have written origin of the species from that from that data and and i think the answer is no and i think that the reason is that what darwin saw was that this the beak of the bird and the seed matched there's a morphologic uh matching that makes common sense this is not this isn't magic it's just that beak's got to be bigger to you know pick up that seed and he paired phenotype to environment to environment to environmental section right that is that's the logical way that evolution occurs the the genes are kind of downstream of that the you know multiple genes you know the beak uh you know could be under the uh the control of you know a few genes and but how would you how would you distinguish these genetic changes um and and say well there's the beak there and oh there must be that means there must be a big seed there and well isn't it safe to say we might not even know like isn't it safe to say that if you took the two closest finches right that the one that went from the beak like this to the beak like this and you sequence them both you might not be able to extract which genetic differences between those accounted for the beak in fact i'd be surprised if you could yeah i agree i mean put a human in a chimpanzee i i don't actually i don't know that so i don't want to go there but um no no i completely agree and i i think that when we talk about cancer as a disease of the genes um what it's more complicated than that and i think that the intense effort to characterize the genetics of tumors you know has had some benefit but it also has some disadvantages because you lose that morphologic uh matching of of uh of the of the environment and and the and the morphology of the of the cell which is more common sense and i think in the long term helps us understand it better i mean one of the questions one of my colleagues likes to ask is uh who's an evolution biologist you know how many niches do you think are present in a cancer and how many species are present um and and you know you can the answers are all you know it could be some people say i mean certainly not one right and it's good we i mean virtually never is it going to be one but is it nine is it a hundred is it a million um and and so we when we think about you know tumor is a clade it's a starting from a single cell or small number but it's speciating all over the place you know as it as it gets into different environments but the speciation isn't magic and it's not just due to a random mutation it's because there are environmental variations and trying to understand that i think would help us a lot uh in in terms of really getting a handle on you know what the cancer is is is doing and the reverse of that is i mean so so take cancer cells out of a patient put them in a dish and now you start to grow from culture will know that they're no longer uh being attacked by the immune system they no longer have to worry about androgenesis they i mean it's an entire world they don't have the edge effects that you described earlier where some of them have a selective advantage vis-a-vis access to substrate whereas others are more competing with the tumors at the inside sure so they they may be they're subjected to entirely different environmental selection forces now we say we take those tumors out we do molecular biology studies and we say oh well this came from a lung cancer that means lung cancer must interact with this to do this when in fact we're dealing with cells that have evolved far past you know they're they're far different from the cancer cells that were present um those you know that that makes up an enormous amount of the cancer literature right now and i don't know that that's useful um i don't know that you you can um extrapolate from those results to anything that goes on in vivo and it's also i think has led to very confusing literature at least in my opinion you take you know genes that are commonly that are that have been extensively evaluated and it's like they could do anything of course you know according to literature they have any function you can name um because they they hit from everywhere so i think it's that's becoming um non-useful it i mean if if you don't if you can't really sort of pin down what its role is um in in in vivo in a patient um you've got a lot of literature but i don't know that you have a lot of knowledge so how does this fit into the evo index how do you which basically looks at the diversity versus genetic change over time how do you then use that to clinically make a decision um i i don't know i mean is in dealing with a very heterogeneous population and i think this is your question it does as you increase the heterogeneity does that increase the let's say it's resistance to therapy or the likelihood and i think that's probably true um but i i i i don't know how that can be taken into account right now in a clinical setting and i'm sure that someone smarter than me is going to figure this out but but right now i i don't have a good feeling about this so in other words we can't do something as simple as biopsy patients to get a sense of drug resistance versus non-resistance because it immediately takes them out of the environment in which it matters and we get back to this problem of well we can't really do this in vitro right so that's right yeah

[01:51:09] the nice thing i mean you get you get information about the the the tumor but those cells are dead yeah you know what's in the tumor is now going to rapidly diverge from there because the minute you touch it with therapy or or you know some other perturbation it's evolving and changing very rapidly um so so that again it's like the hurricane going on further and further you know that that whatever the data you got in day one you know is important for day two but becomes less important on day three and day four and day five and ultimately then having nothing to do with you know having no predictive capacity at all um for the hurricane so so i think one of the things that i think we have to be careful careful about is how we use data i mean there's a lot of interest in circulating dna and circulating tumor cells and that sort of thing but there's very little information about where they come from exactly are those so are those is the dna coming from cells that have died because they're less fit and and so those are the losers in the in the evolution game so they you know we may not care about those um or are they the winners you know and that's in that case we do care about them um and how do they how are they representative of of all the different range of cells is this is it a is the distribution of dna representative of the distribution of populations or i i think that's highly unlikely and so i think that we do have to be thinking about using imaging as a way to look at the internal evolution over time it's a non-destructive way to do it but we have to be able to take the macroscopic scale images that we can get from radiologic studies and bridge the scale to a microscopic uh level that can tell us about what's going on at the cellular molecular level and what what kind of tool could do that there is um the um landscape ecologists uh have developed technology where they take satellite images and they can they can look at them and say and and again this is that's this is simplifying things quite a bit but they could say well can we get can we generate a species map from from these these high level images so and the the way they tend to do it is that they look for habitats you know they they identify distinctive areas within this uh within the the image and usually there's you know this there's five types every part of the image is one of these five let's say and then you you can so instead of tramping through this entire state or however you know large area you just through one of the habitats and say what what are the species distribution here and then you extrapolate um i think that those kinds of things and again this is part of the reason is that in the images we see areas of good blood flow of poor blood flow we might even see areas of temporal variations in blood flow we can see edema we can see a lot of different things we may be able to define habitats and and again not we won't see the the cells but we can see them indirectly in the sense that we know that for example in an area that where the blood flow is varying frequently that there's certain types of pheno there's certain phenotypes they're going to be adapting to that environment and so we can at least make that much extrapolation and make those kinds of suggestions it may be we can do better than that uh and even start to think about you know molecular properties of the cells that are present at least in a general way um it's not perfect but it's it's at least a another mechanism perhaps in combination with serum uh with blood circulating tumor cells and and or cell free dna and things like self-reading all those things you know combining with that i i think probably neither alone is going to be sufficient but together they may be they may be sufficient that you can understand inter-terminal evolution during therapy which is really a key piece of of clinical data that we currently cannot get what inference do you draw from your work with respect to the importance or lack thereof of early early screening in other words do you now have a point of view one way or the other from the mainstream view which truthfully is that screening is kind of important but probably not that important right i mean there's only five cancers for which you know the american college of uh or sorry the um is it would it be probably the american cancer society would even offer um or certainly the u.s task force on preventative services would even offer a point of view on screening uh prostate we've basically thrown our hands up and said talk to your doctor you know so we have a point of view on lung cancer and smokers mammography cervical cancer and colon cancer but but given that we now have many more tools to go looking for cancer early whether it be liquid biopsies and cell free dna or far far better imaging studies um does does your work point you one way or the other towards having a better shot at treating cancer by getting it early i you know i i think it would make sense that again the smaller the population the more likely you could uh cause extinction um but that said i'm i'm not i don't think really qualified to you know comment on the the screening uh program i i i'm very supportive of screening it just intuitively makes sense but but that's just from a personal point of view i i i'm not not based on any work that i've done because when i hear so so so when i hear what you were saying it it it makes me think you should be doubling down on screening right it makes me think that notwithstanding the challenges of screening which are both economic and the psychological toll of false positives which invariably happen the earlier and earlier you look for a cancer the trade-off is is those effects that we've described which is you are going after a colony if you you were going after you know a group of hunter-gatherer colonies rather than the united states of america right you have a much easier chance and they've had far less time to accumulate mutations um and they are far less interconnected far more vulnerable yeah exactly um why did you select prostate cancer for your trial was it simply because you had a great biomarker in psa or was there anything else about the biology of prostate cancer that attracted you um the the the two things was that um it had a great biomarker and and it had a very brave oncologist willing to do it you should not minimize the courage of the latter because it does go against the the grain and does take um you know it's it's the oncologists have to swim against the the you know the stream you know to do this and and many of them are really not willing to do it so uh uh it's just you know i i salute uh jin seong zhang who was the very brave oncologist that uh ran the trial and did it very well well given the success of that trial now has that increased the appetite of of of others to consider doing this either in a larger scale with randomization for prostate cancer and or for other histologies uh minimally uh the there is a um a philanthropic um fund in europe that will that wants to uh fund a phase three trial and er in in prostate cancer so so that's really good and i think that's really important but but i would say that at the same time uh i the if anything i get the feeling there's more resistance i think just everybody's got their back up um it's interesting the the article that i mentioned about um showing how you can you can eliminate the resistant cells um i i i just got i got this morning actually got the tenth rejection um for for that article i mean it just um people just don't want to hear it so it's been um i i don't get the sense that there's any uh greater interest in in that sense if if funding were available what what cl and and more importantly than funding or at least equally important would be um oncologist collaboration what what other experiments would you want to do well i think there's some low-hanging fruit i think ovarian cancer is one that could be treated using this technique and very successfully again they have a nice serum marker there is a i think that small cell lung cancer almost universally fatal disease but one that is responsive extremely well to initial therapy so it you know any tumor that responds well to initial therapy to the point that you you you know you virtually cannot see any tumor is one that um in theory could be uh i think we could eradicate and then um initial prostate cancer uh therapy so pre-metastatic no no metastatic men men that present with metastatic prostate cancer they get they're treated with androgen deprivation therapy and the psa becomes normal or undetectable in 90 plus percent of the of these of these men and of course what do we do we just keep treating with androgen deprivation therapy i think which by the way says nothing about the metabolic damage and the total metabolic derangement it it brings on those men so if they don't die from prostate cancer they're going to die from diabetes and yeah the complications of fatty liver disease yeah i mean they hate this disease that the therapy um so i think um we should uh when as soon as it normalizes we should you know use additional therapies hit it again you know this is the knife fight again um and and that's a very common disease and a very common scenario and it's interesting that um i cannot get um anyone any any oncologist uh to be interested in doing that um and to me that's very low-hanging fruit that um we should certainly try um what or we could try the this the cycling but with the idea that we drive the the resistant cells to extinction also probably fairly easy to do perhaps even easier to do um but with the idea that we we we get to the point where these men don't have to keep taking this the energy deprivation therapy i mean that it's funny because you're you're exactly right i mean i i think there tends to be the sense of it's not really cancer therapy and it's certainly not like chemotherapy i find it to be worse truthfully than the patients that are miserable um and yes i mean it's it's we should not minimize the effect of this which is very significant and it's a pretty common problem um so so i think that we there there are some opportunities i i don't think to be honest i don't think this will be uh something that i'll see in my lifetime but um but i do hope that that you know the next generation of oncologists and cancer biologists will um try to uh at least bring this another step forward is there a cancer that you would stay away from at the early stage in other words you obviously want to start with the ones where you think you have the highest likelihood of success what would you put at the other end of that spectrum where you think you know that's that's going to be a really tough problem to solve i think the toughest problem i can think of is glioblastoma one that you mentioned i i i just don't understand how i mean every other tumor virtually is the problem is not local control if you if you control locally you cure it it's messed up disease gbm is is you can't control it i i it bothers me that this this there's something we're missing in this that that um that i don't understand but but it it feels like first of all it's a it's an intimidating cancer and i would never try to get involved with it if if i i mean i would i mean i'd love to be to be able to make an impact to help people with the disease but it's such a difficult problem that i would be both to do that unless someone came up with a really good idea um i mean i think part of the problem is there's the there's the quote unquote the simple mass effect problem right which is you're just you know anything in the brain is problematic due to the inability of the organ to absorb growth i think a second problem with gbm is the ubiquity of radiation that is understandably used to treat it but it introduces mutagenesis probably at an even greater rate so now you have two layers it basically puts i i think it puts a bit of an accelerator on its ability to out-compete its environment it just introduces a new uh genetic heterogeneity um i don't know if that's right i mean that's just a theoretical argument i don't know that that's been documented it's it's interesting of course the brain is inaccessible and so it's hard to see what goes on um but but just uh i mean even what we know is that you know you hammer this tumor with i mean you you take take it out you bulk it most of it give it radiation therapy chemotherapy i mean very little can survive that and yet it does and the question is is it because as some people think that the tumor cells on the periphery sort of grow back into it uh or is it because it's there's there's resistant cells that emerge that are so tough that you can virtually hit them with a hammer and they and they they just shrug it off one of the things i suggested at one point maybe we could do radiation first and then take then do the surgery and see if you can learn about what how the cells change during radiation therapy that could give you some idea about whether they're evolving resistance whether that's the major factor or not um but it's it's very hard to convince anybody to do it insurgents of course are both to work on anything that's that's had radiation before it but but it's interesting because the neurosurgeon said well you could probably do it but and nobody wants to do it you know you know it's just kind of those you know well everybody knows that you you know that's not what you're supposed to do so um it's never gone anywhere and of course i've not pushed it because i i'm i would be afraid of causing harm um what about other bad actors i mean i always define to put cancers in the category of the there's the cancers that give cancer a bad name like gbm is one of them yeah pancreatic adeno is another what what would be your level of optimism or pessimism around pancreatic adenocarcinoma um you know again i've sort of worked with some people on this um i think there's still there's opportunities again i don't think we understand enough about the biology so for example classically pancreatic cancers have a lot of fibrosis associated with it um one question is is that fibrosis a host response or is it a tumor um exactly strategy yeah all right now nobody really seems to know that and you know so little things like that so should we promote fibroblasts i mean you know classically we we try to reduce the fibroblasts because they there's this idea that you can't you can get more therapy and if you do that but suppose it's a it's a host response maybe we should be giving uh fiberglass growth factor uh to them and and maybe they're competing against each other for space and if you just promote the fibroblasts a little bit they'll kill off the tumor cell for you again i don't know that i'm just you know i'm just saying that with every tumor we could ask questions because we often don't know really basic things about them about the underlying uh uh eco-evolution dynamics and and by if we could learn more about them i think we could uh you know have some some different solutions some different strategies i will point out that um another brave uh pediatric oncologist that i work with damon reed has started a trial for kids with um metastatic sarcoma and uh and if if you know as for giving cancer a bad name uh you know this is uh a this is one of those tumors that responds very well this is a rhabdomyosarcoma it responds very well to chemotherapy and then comes back and they and the doc and they die and of course these are teenagers young adults i can't think of anything more tragic short of a you know you know younger children dying and so he is actually trying an extinction therapy protocol in a um in a trial so um i i just wanted to give him some recognition for for doing this and i i certainly hope it uh i i i god i would love to help these kids i mean there's no doubt bob that they're gonna be people listening to this who either themselves or their loved ones are progressing through therapy and basically looking down the barrel of no options um and we're so let's say someone's in that boat and they hear this and they say well look i'm basically being told my by my oncologist i've progressed through all my therapy or uh the term that oncologists use some that some oncologists use that i don't particularly find uh fond is you've failed therapy which is a bit incorrect i hate that expression yeah um and and let's say they're listening to this and they say i want to find a doctor who can help me try this therapy what what would their options be well you know you have to find an oncologist willing to do this and um there are some you know who who will will work with them um but there's a lot that will not um and it's a very difficult problem and i can't help because i mean i'm not an oncologist i i and i'm not qualified to be um you know prescribing anything for for people um really always you know when people call me i said i'm happy to work with your oncologist if your oncologist is willing to to to try something different i'm happy to at least give them my best sense for what the underlying eco-evolutionary dynamics are um understanding of course that a lot of times we don't really know for sure but but this again in desperate situations um if they want to try this that's between them and their doctor um but most you know phys and as you know this physicians are very aware of medical legal issues um are very afraid of doing anything that's non-standard because it does open them up to um to lawsuits and and that sort of thing so it's um and i understand that and i'm not that's not a criticism it's just the statement um so unfortunately it's it's a it's a very difficult problem and it's a lot easier to deal with patients that are just presenting with cancer than the ones who have been through many therapies unfortunately and i've you know my father died of esophageal cancer and i i remember this uh you know vividly uh the desperation and and the despair and the and and and everything that comes along with people at the end stages of the disease um and and you know i i would love to help i mean i i really wish i could but um unfortunately most of the time it's there's just nothing left to to do well bob i i have found your your story really interesting and really provocative and um i think the frustrating thing about what you say is that there is in my opinion very little downside to trying it it would be very easy to conduct clinical trials that would have a crossover arm where you know you could take this adoptive approach pit it against a standard approach and if the patients and the adoptive approach were progressing you could cross them over and by the way vice versa when the patients who are progressing on the standard therapy too quickly you would cross them over in other words you know when you think about some of the risks that we talk about in medicine this actually strikes me as a relatively low risk proposition the greatest risk is to our egos and to the dogma as opposed to the patients and that's to me a bit of the unfortunate part of medicine is um is when we then we're all guilty of it i can probably count 100 examples of where my ego gets in the way but but this is a particularly uh sad example of it when there is um a disease that we've really had very limited success treating right you referenced nixon earlier right the war on cancer is now in its 50th year um and we don't have a whole heck of a lot to show for it certainly not given the time and the resources that have gone into it i don't i don't think anybody in that era in the early 1970s if they had a crystal ball and showed them what we have today would say that's success yeah i mean we've certainly made some progress but we have not made a lot of progress in the metastatic you know cancer population which is still more or less as fatal as it was um 50 years ago and of course well before then um and you know i i i think we do i think it's important to try to rethink some of the things we do that just just keep doing the doing the same thing over and over again and just keep you know looking for new drugs um is certainly you know new drugs no doubt is is important but but i think we could do better with the old drugs and i don't think that we've been um really that um incentivized i'm not sure we've really taken a lot of time to to think this and again this is perhaps a bit of the what we started with that you know intuitively it would seem like killing as many cancer cells as possible is the best approach to for the patient and um in fact in a non-linear system intuition is often not wrong but it's but nevertheless it seems like it it's it's right i mean we just you feel absolutely certain you're correct um even when uh you know your own eyes tell you that it's different um and that's hard i mean it's hard for all of us yeah i i mean i think look i think that statement um is a great place to end this which is in non-linear systems your intuition can be very misleading and that's that's true in life of which biology especially this corner of biology happens to be exceedingly non-linear um and with that bob i want to i want to thank you for for your generosity and time and more much more importantly of course the work you've done which i think is helping a lot of people and you're right i mean it might not put a dent in the world of cancer in the next decade but i as as we've alluded to earlier sometimes some of the most interesting things in in medicine take decades plural to take hold so hopefully there are a number of people who are going to be able to pick up this baton and run with you and eventually even be able to carry it thank you
