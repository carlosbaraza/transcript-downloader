This clip is from episode 345 ‒ Chronic pain: pathways, treatment, and the path to physical and psychological recovery

In this clip, they discuss:

- What Patients Should Ask Before Surgery – Patients are encouraged to advocate for a pre-op pain consult to support smoother recovery
- Why Pain Doctors Are Involved Before Surgery – For major surgeries, pre-op pain consults can be essential
- The Power of Nerve Blocks & Epidurals – Pain teams often place nerve catheters or epidurals before surgery to minimize post-op pain
- Team-Based Surgical Recovery – Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols now include pain specialists, anesthesiologists, and rehab experts
- Avoiding Opioid Overuse – Proactive pain plans can help patients manage pain with fewer narcotics, improving function and safety

## AI Summary

I'll help analyze this clip from The Drive podcast. Based on the transcript provided, I'll focus on the relevant sections:

**1. Executive Summary**:
This segment discusses perioperative pain management, focusing on the role of pain specialists in surgical care. Dr. Mackey and Dr. Attia discuss the evolution of pain management in surgery, from historical practices to modern enhanced recovery protocols. They emphasize the importance of pre-surgical pain planning and the benefits of having dedicated pain specialists involved in surgical cases.

**2. Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Thoracotomy cases historically required mandatory pain consultation due to their highly painful nature [00:00:00]
- Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols have led to more team-based healthcare approaches [00:01:27]
- Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) results in lower opioid usage compared to nurse-administered pain medication [00:04:13]

**3. Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Request pain specialist consultation before elective surgery [00:02:30]
- Discuss pain management plans with surgeons before procedures [00:03:00]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Pre-surgical planning is especially important for patients already taking opioids [00:03:00]

**4. Supplements & Medications**:
Medications mentioned:
- Fentanyl [00:04:13]
- Morphine [00:04:13]
- Dilaudid [00:04:13]
- Ketamine (for augmentation) [00:03:00]

**5. Notable Quotes**:
"If someone's listening to us and they're going to have elective surgery... Should they be requesting this of their surgeon?" [00:02:30]

**6. Pain Management Techniques Discussed**:
- Epidural catheters [00:00:38]
- Peripheral nerve catheters [00:01:27]
- Local anesthetic administration [00:01:27]
- Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) [00:04:13]

**Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are the specific components of ERAS protocols?
2. What are the criteria for determining which patients should receive pre-surgical pain consultation?
3. What are the long-term outcomes for patients who receive comprehensive pre-surgical pain planning versus those who don't?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] You know when we brought pain in for every case when I was in residency uh was uh anytime we did a thoricottomy was a non-negotiable. Yeah. Pain was consulted before the case. Just for people listening a thoracic we didn't do these often because a lot of times by the time I was in residency we did minimally invasive surgery in the chest but sometimes you had to actually make a huge incision uh under the ribs and that's a very painful we just you know you just know this from experience that that's such a a painful experience. You you cut this huge incision in the intercostal muscles. You put rib spreaders in. You crank these things open so you can do this big operation.

[00:00:38] We just know those patients are going to need an epidural catheter. And we want that in before surgery, not after. And it makes all the difference in the world. So pain was a part of that response. I don't remember us routinely bringing pain in otherwise, but things have changed, I'm sure, in 20 years. So today for a general abdominal case or a general orthopedic case are you brought in pre-operatively? Yeah. Yeah. These days there's a lot of movement towards these ARS protocols and enhanced recovery after surgery and so um fortunately the field of medicine is moving more and more towards a team-based healthc care model where you know surgeons um pain docs, anesthesiologists, nursing, rehab are all working in a collaborative manner.

[00:01:27] They're putting together protocols to what is the best optimal approach to prehab a patient before surgery, move them through the uh intraoperative and then peroperative period and it's gotten better and better and better. Can we still improve it? Yes. But the acute pain service does get involved particularly as you alluded when we put in peripheral nerve catheters or epidural catheterss. And this is where we're running that local anesthetic, the numbing medication that stops the nerve impulses to provide pain relief after surgery. Um, and so yes, we do get deeply deeply involved in that acute surgical pain space and then also with internal medicine docs and the when patients are admitted into the hospital for whatever cause. If someone's listening to us and they're going to have elective surgery at some point, like I want to plant a seed in their head for someone who's going to have the knee replacement, the hip replacement, the colicacyctomy, the appy, whatever.

[00:02:30] Yeah. Should they be requesting this of their surgeon? Should they say, "Hey, I want to be diligent about my recovery. I want to minimize my use of narcotics. Do you mind calling in a pain consult so that we can I can just have a team of docs who are exclusively thinking about my pain? Cuz let's be honest, the surgeon, I got enough to worry about. I got to make sure you didn't leak, that that anastmosis is fine, that you're not getting a wound infection, your pain is literally like third or fourth on the list of my concerns for you to have the best outcome. You are right. And if uh a patient is listening to this, a person is listening and they have the ability, they have the wherewithal to go to their doc, their surgeon, and ask uh what will pain management be like? Is there an opportunity to interface with an acute pain service, particularly if they're taking opioids now for a chronic pain problem or even if they're not taking opioids for a chronic pain problem. So, we will see them in our clinic before surgery. We will put together a pre-surgical plan for them, which will often include a regional anesthetic approach, meaning those those nerve blocks or the catheterss. We sometimes involve um uh introvenous ketamine to augment. We will uh put together the whole plan, communicate with the anesthesiologist, make sure there's a good handoff after surgery, and then we will follow them afterwards. And then we will typically follow them outside the hospital and help the surgeon out with the medication management and the pain management. All of this is not just solely to reduce pain, but to put that person in an optimal state for rehab, for functional recovery. How ubiquitous is the uh the patient controlled an analesic device?

[00:04:13] The PCA that we used to Okay. So it's still so people are still typically getting fentinel through a PCA in the immediate postoperative phase. Fentinyl morphine. Okay. Delotted. Yeah. Yeah. No, the PCA uh is a very common tool and one it puts pain control in the hands of the patient. Two, studies have been shown that PCA delivered medication, opioids, they end up taking less than if it's nursing delivered. [Music]
