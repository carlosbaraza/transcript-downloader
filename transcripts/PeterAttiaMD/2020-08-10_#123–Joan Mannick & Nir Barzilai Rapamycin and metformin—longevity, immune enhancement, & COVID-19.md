## Description

In this episode, Joan and Nir discuss their extensive research into rapamycin (including the category of analogs to rapamycin known as rapalogs) and metformin, respectively. Based on his work with metformin, Nir shares how he believes it could be a pro-longevity drug and the clinical trial he’s leading to test this belief. Joan discusses her work with rapalogs, their ability to suppress the immune system as well as provide immune-enhancement, and the clinical trials she has led that inform her insights. We also talk about the potential beneficial roles of both metformin and rapamycin in reducing mortality from COVID-19, reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, and delaying aging as well as its related diseases.

We discuss:

[00:00:09] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the member only podcast feed for the drive i'm your host peter attia [Music] my guests this week are doctors joan manick and near barzlai joan is the co-founder and chief medical officer of restore bio and that's a play on the word tor t-o-r target of rapamycin before joining restore bio she was the executive director in the new indications discovery unit of novartis which we discussed early on in this podcast she's an md by training receiving her md from harvard medical school completing her residency in internal medicine and infectious diseases at the brigham and women's hospital near barcelona is making his second appearance on the podcast so that name may sound familiar to a number of you he is the director of the institute for aging research at albert einstein college of medicine in new york he has spearheaded one of the most impressive longevity gene projects which basically looked at more than 500 healthy people aged 95 to north of 110 along with following their offspring the centenarian studies in the centenarian offspring study near also has a brand new book that just came out oh at the time of this recording probably a week before it's called age later healthspan lifespan and the new science of longevity we get into a couple of funny stories about that okay this episode is one i've been looking forward to for a very long time because we discuss the two drugs i get asked about more than all other drugs combined namely metformin and rapamycin or the category of analogues to rapamycin known as rapalogs now the reason we decided to do this as a podcast with both near and joan as guests was because of course there were many overlaps between rapamycin and metformin not just in terms of longevity but also of recent note their potential for reducing the risk of saros cov2 infection or other infections and of course covet 19 morbidity and we speculate on those things to a great deal so basically the way this podcast goes is i want to make sure everybody has the appropriate background information on metformin arapamycin so coming into this episode you don't have to know anything about those two drugs if you do i think you'll follow it a little bit better because these are technical and of course the show notes will have all of the pictures and images and things that make it a little easier to follow this but you can come into this not knowing a lot about them though we have had many previous podcasts that discuss these things and then we get into kind of the clinical indications that focus specifically around this issue of how would these drugs factor into the immune response resilience and the amelioration of a hyperactive immune response in the presence of these diseases so without further delay please enjoy my conversation today with joan and nir [Music] joan near this is a first for me and it is also very exciting it's a first and then it's the first time i have interviewed two people virtually simultaneously it is also incredibly exciting because i am just such a fan of your work joan and obviously yours near uh near you've been a guest on this podcast before and joan i have been eagerly looking forward to having you on for probably uh since the moment the podcast released so i'm grateful to both of you for making the time and then of course to do this together is something that i've been a little nervous about for the past month because i've been thinking how do i integrate the stories of rapamycin and metformin how do i integrate the stories of these two incredible compounds that in their most native form came to us naturally and then of course we now have evolved elaborate synthetic versions of these things that have these sort of magical properties so i have an idea for how these two can overlap but before we do that i i think we should assume that maybe the listener is not familiar with you joan and even you near though you've been on before and maybe just help us understand a little bit about what you do joan i know you're a physician by training and you're also one of the world's experts on my favorite molecule so help us understand how you got to be doing what you're doing sure so i was actually started my career in academic medicine i trained in infectious disease and ran a basic science lab but in my basic science lab i happened to read some papers by cynthia kenyon that were sort of transformative for me and i remember reading a review piece from cynthia where she said the genetic mutations in worms that cause doubling of lifespan show that organisms have the capacity to live longer than they normally do and i just thought that was the coolest piece of research and the coolest idea that sort of threw medicine on its head and so i started to do a little bit of aging research in my lab but eventually ended up at novartis in a group called the new indications discovery unit and you heard a little bit of this from lloyd clickstein but it's a unit of novartis where they tackle areas of drug development that fall in between traditional big pharma silos so when i got there they said what would you like to work on and i said i want to work on aging and when i first said this i was told we understand that makes sense but everyone's going to think you're wacky so you have to pick a different area and i was really disappointed but a few months after i got there the ceo at the time who was dan vasela and the head of research was mark fishman decided they thought novartis should work on aging what year was this joan this was must have been 2012. lloyd who was my boss at the time said joan wants to work on aging so they said okay john go go do something in aging we just had this blank slate of saying do something in a clinical trial that is targeting aging biology and you get to pick what you want to do so novartis had a rapamycin analog and there was a lot of data that mtor inhibitors have beneficial effects on aging and lifespan so i decided i would take our rapamycin analog and i thought a organ system whose function i can change in a relatively short period of time is immune function so i decided let's do a trial and see if we give older adults an mtor inhibitor can we make their immune function better and the readout was a vaccine the response to a flu vaccine so that was the beginning couple questions going back i know your your father was one of maybe six or seven people to hold one of the most prestigious chairmanships in all of american surgery john manick at the brigham and women's hospital and you of course trained at the brigham as well correct yes what was your father's response to this career change which in effect it sort of was right which was you're trained as an infectious disease doctor at a very prestigious you know one of the most prestigious academic institutions in the world and not only are you leaving academia to go into industry but you're also making what sounds like a very rash change in your focus was that something you discussed with him and if so what were his thoughts i did everybody in my family was in academic medicine but as you know academic medicine has changed a lot and i was thinking am i going to spend the rest of my life in academia or do i want to do something else and i had some friends who had left and gone into biotech and told me how much fun it was and so i was starting to get calls by recruiters and i asked my dad i said you know should i do this should i leave and he said i was 50 at the time and he said joan at age 50 this is the last time you have to really try something new with your career so go for it academic medicine isn't what it used to be this is like an exciting thing you can try and so he was supportive it was interesting that's fantastic yeah the other question i want to ask you going back to your first attempt at studying a rapamycin analog was you chose to go after something that as you said could be modified in short order which is the immune system but of course as you knew very well and will explain to the listener the clinical application for rapamycin was of course immune suppression so what made you think that you could actually use the same drug whose clinical indication was to suppress the immune system in a transplant patient to do the opposite which was to enhance the response to vaccine novartis asked me the same question i remember presenting this proposal to the committee that approves trials and i go why are you doing this why are you taking the drug that we sell to suppress the immune system and think it's going to enhance it it was because of all the data that mtor inhibition has beneficial effects on aging and every organism tested and so i said someone's just got to do the trial in humans and see if this is true in humans and we're going to dose this really carefully to minimize any side effects and either it's going to work or it's going to turn out none of this translates to humans but we got to just sort of have the guts to try it so that's what we did joan i think it's interesting the way you frame that which is look we had in 2012 at least three or four years of very good evidence that rapamycin could be beneficial to extend lifespan through the itps so the interventions testing programs run through nih there had been several indications either directly through administration of rapamycin or indirectly through genetic inhibition of mtor that you could extend the life of yeast worms flies and mice but of course you can't do a lifespan extension study in humans so your study that would be published in 2014 which any listener of this podcast knows and has heard me refer to as the manic study the 2014 christmas gift um i still remember getting my embargoed copy the day before christmas that was a very important paper and and again i i still applaud you for the nerve because it's one thing to say the following we have reason to believe this could extend life on average it's quite another thing to say it still enhances immune function in other words there's a scenario under which rapamycin did extend life across all those species and would extend life in a human on average but still impairs the adaptive immune system so that a subset of humans are actually dying sooner due to overwhelming immune compromise while on average people are going to get cancer later or dementia later etc in retrospect it worked out pretty remarkably that the thing you chose to go after which was in many ways the riskiest thing to look at turned out to work was that something that you noodled at the time you sort of had to have the stomach to do it and i really wanted to do no harm to these older people who were very bravely entering the trial but you don't know till you do the trial how it's going to work out and i tried my best to again dose very lower intermittent dosing that wouldn't be likely to be sufficient to immunosuppress because figuring the only dose that will ever move forward is one that is low enough that it's safe and that it doesn't immunosuppress and there had been data in mice older mice given and rapamycin that vaccination response was improved so i just said someone's got to do this and see if this translates because if it does it will be the start of really being able to move medicine in new important paths forward now lloyd discussed the study in some detail but just so that if you know maybe someone who hasn't gone back and listened to that can you explain somewhat briefly you know there were four arms in this study what were they dosed what was the purpose of the dosing how was it pulsed etc and what were you measuring and and most of all what did you learn from that study so we'd used very unusual dosing regimens of this rapamycin analog that we either dosed at a very low dose once daily or once weekly the reason we did this is we wanted to just partially inhibit mtor not completely inhibit mtor because when you completely inhibit mtor you stop t cells from proliferating and you'll get immunosuppressed so these were chosen purposefully to limit the amount of mtor inhibition and what we found is if you gave it one of these mtor inhibitors for six weeks and then gave people a two week break and gave them a flu vaccination they responded better to the flu vaccination we found is the lower of the lowest two doses either 0.5 milligrams once daily of a verilimus or five milligrams once weekly were the best and those gave less amateur inhibition than the highest dose which was 20 milligrams weekly what it looked like is just turning mtor down in the elderly not turning it off is the best for enhancing immune function so i'm going to hit pause on that for a moment you mentioned the name of the drug evarolimus it also went by another name i believe rad001 correct okay let's bring metformin up to speed for folks so they now understand why would we want to talk about these drugs together and why are these the two drugs i get asked more questions about by my patients than all other drugs combined so near take us back to the first time you started paying attention to metformin outside of its normal clinical indication which is of course an early line treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes serendipitous when i came to the united states to do my first post doc which was at yale with ralph de fronzo what i did that year was to find the mechanism of action of metformin it wasn't in the united states yet lifo pharmaceutical just brought it in and commissioned some studies in order to show that metformin works in the u.s population as well okay because we didn't accept anything still don't from other populations and my study was the first to show that metformin specifically targets a hepatic glucose production rather than or or let's say the insulin sensitivity of the liver rather than the muscle although it's doing a little bit of both so when i did that then and we're talking 8788 i was actually doing aging there i took people and did clamps young and old people but i never thought that metformin is coming back metformin start coming back when all those data appeared whether it was with clinical studies or with association studies that people of on metformin in clinical studies will not develop diabetes the dpp will it will prevent diabetes or in people with diabetes it will prevent cardiovascular disease that's the uk pds the association studies with cancer hundreds of studies on cancers and all kinds of cancers the association studies on alzheimer's and also some clinical studies on mci and the day that i knew we have to do that was when a paper from the uk underappreciated that looked at almost 180 subjects in united states into pharmaceuticals and they looked at people who were treated by the same doctors some were diabetic and some were not somewhere getting sulfanilurea drugs summit forming if they were diabetic and controls for non-diabetic people the people on metformin who were diabetic were more obese had more diseases to start with had significantly less mortality this kind of linked all of it together if metformin targets aging which we kind of knew from animals okay it increased health spin and lifespan of animals many animals two weeks ago killing fish if you give killing fish with foramen they live significantly longer if you give it to all animals they live longer they live healthier and all of a sudden we have everything we have all ages age-related disease clinical association studies would have mortality that just made metformin the perfect tool for us to push geroscience ahead i'm not as familiar with the metformin results in the itp i'm very familiar with all of the rapa studies did metformin show benefits in the itp complicated and i get this a lot because there are i think 30 studies that i summarize in a paper somewhere where we're giving metformin in many animals increased lifespan there are two stories so generally people in itp will say no we haven't shown we haven't shown effect on metformin but i would say there are two exceptions one is in male mice itp happens in three centers explain to folks what the itp is we're gonna we're gonna link to it in the show notes because you're gonna explain why it's so rigorous but they're in so many cohorts i mean i think cohort 12 will begin to we're going to start to see the results of cohort 12 this year i follow the itps a little more closely now than i used to because now they're looking at sglt2 inhibitors and all sorts of other really exciting drugs but yeah explain the rigor behind it and why people put a lot of weight into it well the intervention testing program was established in order to have like pre-clinical multi-central studies of drugs that investigators could say without proving or without doing standard studies would say this affects longevity so the idea is you have a committee you get the drug you have animals who are genetically heterogeneous because we want it to be aging and not genetic and they're giving in the same way in three different centers around the united states so that we have a standard way to say yes or no those are two big caveats right i mean lots of times things will work in one lab and then they don't go on to work in other labs so that's an important bridge to cross and and as you you said i think the heterogeneity of the animals also adds to the rigor because these models where we have mice that are homogeneous at each and every loci they are so genetically flawed that you run into trouble where they become so artificial in terms of their model right in the metformin study in males in one center they lived ten percent longer in one also ten one was nine one was eleven or something like that in one center it was one percent less okay so you know it's not significant although by the way there is a power for each study there's a power for each study to be significant because they're using 50 mice per arm the second point is when they added rapamycin to metformin to rapamycin you could say if you think metformin has no effect that was that was cohort seven that was a nine-month intervention or they were they treated the mice at nine months with metformin and rappa together the nice thing of being young like you is that uh you recall those numbers they're seven eleven that's the longest living animals i think so far in this itp they live 24 longer okay right and the rapa solo which joan is pretty impressive as well was i believe 16 and 9 by gender right and i should add it wasn't studied at the same time okay so you can say there's a cohort effect there are people in the itp so that's what i want to warn people against is the implication that two of the arms showed effectively a 10 increase in the lifespan with metformin and one showed effectively no change are you saying it's possible there were methodologic errors in the third site that again if you had done it across 50 sites which as a purpose of a thought experiment it might have shown a benefit but three sites if one goes wrong i want to make a bigger comment maybe yes i want to make a bigger comment it's a little bit too late to discuss my style right because we have all those data in humans i think we have to be careful with the itp because it's possible that for example in humans metformin will have better effects than in mice rapamycin might have less effect in mice so i i don't think it's of the interest of anyone to start saying you know some of the investors say you know we're not impressed with metformin i i understand that there are other studies that totally have shown that there's other animal studies that have shown that there are model studies that have shown it but who cares yeah your point is which i think is a great point near we probably have more than enough information of the power of this intervention in humans that it's a little bit of the tail wagging the dog if we're gonna get wound up about which strain of mice does better on metformin or not and obviously joan i think we're in we're long past that point as well and frankly i think that's where the focus of the itps are moving to other more novel compounds they're looking at nicotinamide riboside they're looking at sglt2 inhibitors they're looking at acrobose which actually looked like it did have a positive effect so let's continue with the story which is and i remember the paper of course you're talking about because it's one that people still often reference which is how is it possible that a cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes and all of the associated microvascular damage that would come from the hyperglycemia the macrovascular damage that's accompanied by the hyperinsulinemia i mean the deck is really stacked against this patient and yet somehow if you give them metformin and compare them to someone who has better glycemic control presumably less hyperinsulinemia they somehow live longer i mean it shouldn't be right so i want to pass forward to 2020 because we published a cell metabolism paper the figure is open in front of me but i want to make sense of what we try to do and go back to aging you know we geroscientists kind of agree that there are hallmarks of aging and we kind of agree on the hallmarks we call them sometimes different some some people say seven and some people say nine okay and the hallmarks are very important mainly because once we had the hallmarks biotechs started forming because all of a sudden there were targets not only did we have the hallmarks that the hallmarks were interacting you don't have you can target one hallmark and you affect the others you can change autophagy and improve insulin action and mitochondria function right so we have these hallmarks and in this paper we try to do something very simple we try to say let's look at the mechanism of action of metformin the papers that were published and let's see which hallmark exactly metformin is heating and this was the great surprise and i'll tell you the surprise and i tell you my interpretation but the bottom line is there's evidence that metformin hits every one of those hallmarks and you have a big figure there with the hallmarks on the bottom the mechanisms of action and all the papers that show yeah it does that it does that it does every one of them we're going to include that near in the show notes it's a great figure and we actually i believe included it from our first discussion but it's so important that it is worth going through do you want to maybe talk about what you think are the three most important of the mechanisms that metformin targets and and joan i'm gonna really ask you the same question in a moment what do you think are the three or four most important of those pillars or hallmarks that rappa or rapalogs are targeting because i think i think these are very important for people to understand where these drugs work and how i'll tell you that but i just before i'm telling you that i want to tell you that i don't believe for a second that metformin independently targets all of them and i think that's what we should note metformin let's say on the cellular level it fixes aging okay once it fixes aging a lot of things improve okay maybe the fact that insulin levels go down doesn't have to do only with metformin effect on glucose but because autophagy has increased mitochondrial function is better genetic stability is good you know things like that i think when you do an experiment at the end of which you see so much effect and there's an argument because people say hey it's all epigenetic here's the study that shows epigenetics well yes but the question is did metformin do it or did what metformin did on aging do that so for me there are three major arms of metformin one of them is the metabolic the effect that it targets complex one in the mitochondria and by that and i'm skipping the stages it increase amp kinase and it targets mtor okay and everything that metabolically happens on that side so let me ask you a question near i've never been able to get a straight answer out of anybody on this do we have a dose equivalence because what you just said for the listener i want to make sure is is clear metformin is a weak mitochondrial toxin it inhibits complex one that tricks the body basically into doing something which is thinking nutrients are scarce amp kinase goes up it thinks there's a deficiency of energy we know that that has a downstream effect on the inhibition of mtor something that we're going to talk about happening directly through the rapamycin rapilog pathway but what i'm trying to understand is using the cellular assays where we can read out the extent of that inhibition do we know that five milligrams of rapamycin or everolimus is equivalent to a thousand milligrams of metformin in other words do we have a sense of what an apples to apples mtor inhibition looks like even though one's direct and one is is indirect it's a good question i can find the answer on a cellular level because ana maria cuervo are jones and my friend is using metformin as the positive control for autophagy okay she actually uses metformin and not rapamycin so she must have tried and have the dose response on a cellular level i'm not aware john are you aware i'm not aware it's a it's a good question i don't know the answer for that what's also complicated because rapamycin actually isn't a good inducer of autophagy the catalytic inhibitors are much better so it's not just which dose of mtor inhibitor but what downstream readout of mtor is equivalent are you looking at autophagy or are you looking at protein synthesis each one uh so you're saying i mean we're going to come back to this joan when we talk about the difference between the allosteric and the catalytic inhibitors but you're saying the way you go about inhibiting mtor will shift the lever more towards maybe inhibition of senescence versus protein synthesis versus autophagy so right okay we'll come back to that but near sorry to interrupt let's go back to what you were saying so big pillar one is the metabolic complex one ampk mtor pathway right which is what we just discussed the second is there is a decrease in oxidative stress in rose production and therefore also on dm dna damage that is the consequence of using a low dose of a mitochondrial poison right so there's this aspect of that and the third aspect the relationship to autoin to immune function and inflammation so those are kind of the i think the major effects on metformin and it is because by accident it's kind of doing those two arm the metabolic and the ros inflammation you're getting a two for one there can you say more about the potential immune enhancement and presumably cytokine reduction if it's cytokine that's sort of deleterious yes it's doing both of them i think joan will give a good example do you want the cellular mechanism of that because i don't want to get into that now i think john has a better explanation because we don't have the same we have the clinical data on metformin but i wouldn't tell you what exactly is the most relevant target in the in the whole okay okay so joan let's go back to we're still talking about either rapamycin or rad001 arapalog what do you think are the places where it plays the greatest effect in longevity in terms of these cellular mechanisms or critical pillars yeah i think it's an area where we have to understand more but one of the things that will happen with a wrapalog is that you'll get less protein and lipid synthesis and that may decrease proteotoxic stress just by having less proteins made that your protein degradation system has to deal with then people have assumed autophagy is another mechanism but actually as i was just mentioning rap logs don't consistently induce autophagy it's cell dependent so how much of a role autophagy has in the benefits of rapolog is probably tissue dependent where do we think it has the most effect versus the places where we think it has the least effect on autophagy we look in cell lines and we don't see in many cell lines any induction of autophagy but then there will be a few cell lines that do have induction of autophagy and i can't tell you is it cells from the liver versus the cells from neurons i don't know whether it's the tissue of origin or if it's something like the level of fkbp 12 in the cell so then the third part which is it so it's interesting it's similar to what near was saying for metformin is there's a regulation of the sasp so these inflammatory cytokines that are secreted by senescent cells that accumulate as we age that is regulated in part by mtor so inhibiting mtor will decrease sas which will decrease systemic inflammation when we think about that and go back to the results that you demonstrated in humans six years ago how does that story make sense so now i want to bring both the stories of rapamycin or rapologs and metformin to as near said to 2020 where most of us are now focusing on something new and i'll just use myself as an example i mean you guys have been focusing on this forever i don't think i've thought about immune enhancement as much at a clinical level as i have in the past four months so prior to covid most of my interest around an immune enhancement and the reason i've been so interested in rapamycin is more in my belief around anything that you can do that's going to enhance the immune system at the adaptive level which is what you're getting out of a vaccine is going to help help with cancer surveillance and inasmuch as delaying the onset of cancer is an important pillar of longevity that's the real reason we want to have enhanced immunity i would say i very naively didn't pay enough attention to the mortality from even influenza which of course is is also getting more attention appropriately today so it's not just that coronavirus is you know we have a new strain of coronavirus that now adds to our burden of these but look there's there's a non-trivial chance that a 75 or 85 year old person is going to die from an influenza virus and now of course we have another virus that's going to be probably five times more more virulent so how do you make this link why is it that the t cells got better at recognizing an antigen when a patient was pulsed with a drug that is inhibiting senescent cells or at least the soluble factors of senescent cells is it as you said maybe there's some tissue specific or cell specific autophagy reduction in protein synthesis and lipid synthesis how does that story go from the mechanistic story to the clinical story i think it's going to be complicated but one of the factors and how you respond to a vaccine is actually innate immunity and you need innate immunity to bring in the adaptive t and b cells to respond to antigen one of the problems in the elderly is that they have a defect in type 1 interferon production after getting a flu vaccine that's been shown by a group from yale and it's also been shown by another group from stanford that all sorts of stimuli to the innate immune system that should induce interferon there's a defect in immune cells from the elderly what we've shown is that with mtor inhibitors you can enhance that interferon production in interferon induced gene expression and so the innate immune function enhancing that may be one of the reasons that the adaptive immune system is working better when you get vaccinated we've also shown that there's a decrease in exhausted t cells we first showed that in older humans and then tyler curiel showed the same thing in older mice so there's more t-cell exhaustion and when you give an mtor inhibitor in particular arapalog that decreases and we don't know the mechanism for that yet has anyone ever tried this is sort of off topic but to your first point i was actually not aware of the interferon issue that's super interesting if you vaccinate older patients with a low dose of interferon do you get around that nobody's tried you have to be careful with that interferon is pretty dangerous yeah right so i think what it looks like is that there's just enhancing kind of the response to the vaccine antigen and not sort of just dumping interferon yeah it's not the interferon per se it's that the lack of interference is a proxy for a failure to recognize in the first place exactly in your 2014 paper remind me did you look only at t cell or also b cell assays did you look at neutralizing antibodies and t cell killing so we only looked at hemagglutination inhibition h i titers didn't look at neutralizing antibody and didn't look at t cell function we just looked at shifts in 76 different peripheral blood subsets and it was interesting the wrapalongs didn't shift any of the subsets very much except there was about a 20 a 25 to 30 percent decrease in the pd1 positive cd4 and cd8 these are the exhausted t cells that accumulate with age i think i forgot that detail so these are cells with checkpoint inhibitors on them these are cd4 cd8 killer cells with a pd1 checkpoint exactly so those go down which may be another you know part of the adaptive immune system that's getting improved from the wrap log yeah which might also speak to again if you want to shoot for the stars you can see some cancer protection benefits potentially with that application yeah so near explain to me the immune benefits of metformin i've obviously first and foremost always thought of rapalogs as interfering with the immune system one way or the other right if the dose is high and frequent enough it's going to impair the immune system but as joan has explained if you learn how to thread the needle correctly you can enhance the immune system when did it become apparent to you that metformin which i mean the metabolic benefits tend to jump out at us but when did these immune benefits start to become really apparent there are papers in the 40 and 50s on baiguanids that were actually looking like metformin remember the history of metformin it had a cousin fenforming that seems to be more active against diabetes but it was associated with lactic acidosis so they went back to metformin but in the 40s and 50s and 60s metformin was used around the world for influenza in the elderly and there's a lot of literature unfortunately the literature is in czech and swedish and philippines and i'm not starting to get a lot of translation but all of them were positive response to using metformin as an immune enhancer against the fluid by the way against malaria and some other indications this is started really early on and unlike what john did to rapamycin this didn't really come back until recently but we knew several things about metformin we knew that patients with type 2 diabetes if they get metformin they immunize better against the flu there is a at least a study like that and there are a studies that showed so when we talk about metformin oropomycin we're talking about several things we're talking about fixing the immune decline we're talking about the inflammatory response right and we're talking also with both these drugs not about their immune function but do they help the elderly body sustain a severe disease right in the case of covet we need all those those things we need to have better immunization not get to the cytokine storm and if we are sick you know be tough let's unpack that a little bit because it's a great point you raise near which is if you had to wave a magic wand and make someone most resistant to sars co v2 you probably wouldn't just increase their immunity by 10 to 20 percent you would reduce their comorbidities first and foremost in other words to use an extreme example right if you take a 30 year old with no comorbidities their probability of succumbing to this virus is infinitesimally small it's almost unmeasurable whereas if you take even a 40 year old with comorbidities the risk starts to become non-trivial in as much as these drugs can reduce comorbidities they may have at least as much benefit on protecting against the mortality as they would on enhancing the immune system and i don't think those are necessarily dependent on each other are they no they're not let me just say one thing across the world if you're 80 years old and older your chances to die is 180 times more than if you're 20. but let's make sure that there are young people who are dying too okay it's just it's really an incredible ageism let me not be hypothetical let me give you an example there's a a paper that was published in china a little bit more than a week ago where they looked at the 100 people with kovid that were treated with metformin comparing them to the 178 people that were diabetic and treated and not treated with metformin and just to be clear this was these were prospectively treated with metformin or this was a retrospective analysis of diabetics with and without metformin no and it's a good point i don't think any one of us are saying you get to the hospital you get metformin this will be a big mistake we might kill people there in lactic acid doses anyhow i mean we don't want to do that those were people that were hospitalized with metformin or without metformin so those are the 278 diabetic patients in who won that were there and you're saying for the only difference that is apparent upon admission to the hospital is a group of them are on metformin and a group are not but they are otherwise as as close to equal as you would find them shy of being able to randomize absolutely the only significant difference is that the actually the glucose level in hospitalization of the metformin was higher than that of control but otherwise they're the same age okay gender distribution and everything okay and they had the people on metformin had 25 of the mortality let's change it around they had four times decrease in mortality but this is not what grabbed my attention i went to the web and tried to figure out how many diabetic patients in china are treated with metformin and there is an exact data i did get a little bit indirect data because the people who give you the exact data you have to pay them 3 500 so i wasn't ready to do that but the use of metformin in china is between 60 and 70 and you see the ratio of the people who are hospitalized was the opposite so i'm thinking less people on metformin showed up in the hospital and probably the mortality had to do more with the inflammatory with a cytokine storm or with their ability to handle severe disease than the immunization let's think about this for a second because obviously kovid kills in several ways and again when you contrast it with influenza i think it's an important contrast right influenza is probably more dis and joan you should step in because i think you probably know more about influenza than i'll ever know but really the issue with influenza is that it can paralyze the immune system and it's these secondary infections that come in so so obviously there are certain strains of the flu that can kill you through the cytokine storm but isn't the way that the majority of older patients die of influenza is just that their immune system gets sort of whacked by this thing becomes almost somewhat paralyzed and they become more susceptible to other infections such as a bacterial infection isn't that a big part of the danger of influenza beyond just the virus itself well you know we used to think that but there was a paper that came out from the cdc in new england journal in 2015 that looked at what actually causes pneumonia and the elderly that gets them hospitalized and it's not a combination of virus and bacteria that is some of it but the majority is a virus and the most common virus is actually rhinovirus which is the cause of the comic cold and it's that the elderly just can't handle viruses the same way as younger people do so they can actually die from the flu just make sure that's what you're saying they don't have to get bacterial super infection no even with rhinovirus and the virus itself causes damage and then the immune response to the virus also causes damage so not even without cytokine storm you can kind of get immune mediated damage and i want to come back to near's point in a second but i just want to go down this path a little further as you look at the damage from specifically sars co v2 seems like a much worse virus in the sense that it causes much more direct damage to the pneumocyte so you now get much more direct damage to the end organ and that's not saying anything about all of the other disadvantages of it through its transmissibility do we believe that at the immunologic response level it is eliciting a much more toxic autoimmune response or cytokine response than say influenza which itself is quite nasty the coronavirus infects cells including lung cells and that causes direct damage from the virus but then the host response to the virus is good because it will get rid of the virus but if it gets excessive you'll get cytokine storm which will cause major life-threatening consequences independent of the virus but if you can enhance the ability of the host to sort of get control of the virus very quickly the thought will be you won't be susceptible to that cytokine storm and you'll you know stay with mild disease so based on the little bit that we know about the ability of a wrapalog to enhance immunity through these early stage clinical trials and then near based on what you know based on these uncontrolled trials that have more relevant recent data because they're dealing with the the virus of interest what are your best guesses about the particular places where each of these agents is exerting their benefits so starting with you joan where do you think a rapalog has the greatest potential to reduce the risk of succumbing to covin what we also see is that in people who get mr inhibitors their innate antiviral gene expression is enhanced when they get a viral infection so what this suggests is early on like as post-exposure prophylaxis or pro in a prevention mode the rapalogs or the mtor inhibitors may have benefit by boosting the body's response that is defective as we get older to the virus so we can clear it better so that we don't go on to get severe symptoms from the virus okay does that suggest that well i want to come back to this because i want to talk about it in the context of rtb 101 and how you would think about where i'm going to come back to joan just is is going to be around how do you think about dosing this is this something where we think about these as maintenance drugs that people probably ought to be on in anticipation of such a thing versus a drug that comes in from a treatment standpoint so while we park that thought near let's go down this sort of same path on metformin so one thing that you suggested from the cohort that you just described in china is first of all the people taking metformin we're disproportionately less severely ill so fewer people who take metformin wind up in the hospital and the ones that do end up doing better that's let me add to it that i've been looking for this literature and i've started my own study at einstein because i got emails from spain and italy from physicians who noticed the saying on metformin and so this is like january and february when they're hitting that first right they said do you know do i hear about that and i beg them you you should publish i i should say another thing and that kind of links to the mechanism there's a a study that was published yesterday in med rexif so it's study that was submitted right and not reviewed okay and in fact when i'm reading this study you can ask me questions there and i wouldn't know because they don't give enough details but they show two things that women on metformin have about twenty more than twenty percent twenty one twenty two percent less mortality this is from minnesota i'm sorry this is mortality due to covid19 or all covet 19 they had access to 6 000 patients through the university of minnesota i'm sure they're all not all in minnesota access to 6 000 patients and they found that females on metformin have 21 less mortality now i don't know if those are only diabetic patient or it's only women on metformin i i don't know what's the what's the one here okay but but there was a sex specific decrease in mortality but even more important they had 80 decrease in peripheral in plasma tnf alpha levels that was also highly significant that kind of ties i mean i don't know why they measure only tnf alpha or if they measured only dnf alpha but there's a kind of a link to the inflammatory response again let's think about that is there any indication by the way that metformin alters ace ii expression no there's no indication of that i actually put ace2 and metformin to see the reason early one of the first studies that came on dragon kovid was in an in silico analysis that put 76 drugs or something like that including europamycin as metformin as potential interacting with the cove source to a pathway basically the fact that there isn't some apparent link between metformin and its ability to alter the tissue target it would seem that any benefits that you're describing that turn out to be real are either based on immune enhancement or immune modulation either you're turning up the immune system when you want it to be turned up or toning it down when you need it to be toned down correct yeah as long as you don't say it's the same it's the same mechanism that you turn on and off i think no no no that's my point these are different and what i'm really trying to tease out is first of all is that the right way that to think about it that's how i would think about it secondly if so which of those two do you think it's acting on well i think both that's why i made the point that at least this study and some of the things i hear from europe suggest that less people in metformin are hospitalized so they get their immunities better right and then when they're in their hospital less of them go into an inflammatory response and the time course is different remember it's when you get the disease and the inflammatory thing is like five days later right did the chinese data that you referred to that were published about a week and a half ago obviously your analysis suggests the first part of that your analysis which is looking at the proportion of patients in china taking metformin versus those hospitalized would suggest the immune enhanced piece of that do you have data beyond the obvious which are the survival data that suggests that you actually saw attenuation of a pathologic immune response for example did they measure cytokines in the chinese cohort no it was just the outcomes no it was just the outcomes again i want to say i'm interpreting lack of data to suggest that maybe not enough for the hospital but i i don't know that maybe in one only thirty percent take metformin right and and the others do not so let's not make too much out of it i i use this more to say that we really need to look at both issues the immune response and the cytokines and and then the third is the ability of the body to sustain severe disease you're going to say something joan on that oh i was even wondering in someone who's critically ill would they not receive metformin anyway would it just be dc discontinued in your patient i want to say about that you know we've done this study we talked about it before miles where we gave metformin for six weeks and then crossed over to elderly people crossed over we were taking biopsies and we're doing transcripts two weeks off and then six weeks and there was an effect of metformin in those who got metformin first on the placebo results there was still lingering effect of metformin so i i think okay you stop metformin and you should and we shouldn't say we the people should get metformin to prevent coffee not to not to turkey but i think that when you so substantially change the aging phenotype of a cell it's not it's not that you stop and it goes back to old so i think it's okay five days later it can still be effective yep so joan what is your take now on basically the role that a wrapalog could play in the prevention of mortality from covid19 along these two axes let's pause it that arapalog plays no direct role in inhibiting the virus from getting into a cell it's not going to play a role on that pathway so instead we focus on these two immune properties the ability to enhance immunity to fight the virus versus the ability to tone down the immune response when it becomes over exuberant how do you see those two playing out first there is some data that mtor inhibitors may interact directly with covid and inhibit replication both meaning the virus the sars virus the virus there may be a direct antiviral effect that's seen with cmv and bk virus and transplant patients where they have lower cmv and bk viral infections probably because of the direct effect of m21 inhibition because the virus needs that's interesting is there any any evidence of that in the other four coronaviruses that commonly occur no but that to near's point there have been a bunch of transcriptomic metabolomic proteomic big data analyses that have identified mtor and rapologs as potential drugs that would interfere with the replication of sars kov2 okay and joan in your study you also had less coronavirus right so that's what we think is probably not a direct effect on the virus that's immune function okay i was getting before and in studies where we've looked at laboratory confirmed respiratory tract infections in our phase tube study we looked at 17 different viruses that caused respiratory tract infections in older people and four of them were the common coronaviruses and what we saw was that mtor inhibitors upregulated anterior gene expression and reduced the incidence and severity of coronavirus infections soros cov2 wasn't circulating at that time right and if i recall joan and we're gonna this would be just as good a time as i need to go back and talk about rtb 101 which was the drug you're talking about but it was the coronavirus has had a huge difference between drug and placebo as did the rhinovirus you've already alluded to along with rsv and i think one of the influenza strains right not both right so let's do that let's detour back for a moment and talk about what came out of the rad001 trial which is the one we talked about in 2014 that showed enhancement to flu vaccination and then what this new compound rtb 101 is you've already made one reference to it when you casually mentioned that it's a atp competitive mtor inhibitor as opposed to an allosteric inhibitor you might have to explain to people what that difference is but we've now talked about it twice so i think it is worth an explanation and i think it does become germane and then let's talk about the difference between the 2a and the 2b study sure in that first study where we just looked at rapalogs to enhance flu vaccine response we noticed in a clinical trial you always collect adverse events reported by people and we noticed that the people who were getting the amter the rapalog were reporting fewer respiratory tract infection as adverse events and they weren't flu they were just all common respiratory tract infections so it made us think hey if this is enhancing immune function it's not going to be enhancing just the response to a flu vaccine it's probably going to enhance the response to all sorts of different pathogens so in our face tube we said let's not only look at vaccine response but let's actually look at infections that occur to see are we decreasing infection rates and in that phase tube we also said if mtor inhibitors really do enhance immune function this shouldn't be specific to a wrapalog which is a drug that changes the confirmation of mtor and that's how it inhibits it and we said other kinds of mtor inhibitors which block the catalytic site and towards an enzyme in it they block the catalytic site they should also have benefits if this is really an mtor mediated effect so we looked at arapalog and we looked at a catalytic inhibitor called rtb 101 and we looked at the two together and we looked not only at vaccine response but we looked at infection rates for a whole year now rtb 101 also has some pi3 kinase inhibitory properties as well doesn't it so in a biochemical assay with you know an isolated enzyme it inhibits pi3 kinase and novartis made this drug in the hopes that it would be a dual mtor pi3 kinase inhibitor for cancer patients but when you bring in in cells and in humans you need much higher concentrations of rgb to inhibit pi3 kinase and at the concentrations that are achievable in the clinic it's mostly just a torque 1 inhibitor it doesn't even get concentrations easily high enough to inhibit torque 2. so there's two mtor complexes that contain mtor and this is most potent inhibitor of the torque one complex now you achieved that in the first study by using the wrapalog dosed intermittently at the lower doses so i know the higher dose which was 20 milligrams you probably still get some c2 inhibition but at the 0.5 daily you probably don't get much at the five weekly you're probably mostly just hitting one correct and not hitting two exactly like we didn't see any real hyperglycemia or hyperlipidemia which are the torque two side effects so is it safe to say that at the doses you give rtb 101 it has comparable m torque 1 inhibition to rad 001 at 5 milligrams weekly would that be the closest comparison probably more 0.5 milligram daily because we give rtb every day got it okay and the reason you give it daily is of course the selectivity the catalytic selectivity and also it has a shorter half-life it's half-life is four to six hours so if you dose it once a day it's inhibiting torque 1 for a shorter period of time than at verilyminus and if you give it twice a day it's a little bit more persistent inhibition now explain there were two were there two studies one that was combining these two rad001 plus rtb101 and then there was was the protector study just rtb 101 by itself correct so we had two phase two studies looking at rtb alone and in combination with the verilymus in the first study the combination looked the best when you dose it for just six weeks in the second study when we extended dosing for 16 weeks in a sicker population the rtb alone was better so in both studies rtb alone decreased respiratory tract infections and in one the combination did and the other it didn't so the study that did not meet its hard outcome was rtb 101 alone but not for vaccine response was it for it was for total respiratory tract infections no and that's part of the problem for our phase 3 study the fda said we don't want an end point of laboratory confirmed respiratory tract infections where we had seen the benefit and they said people don't care this was pre-covered 19 if a respiratory tract infection is laboratory confirmed all they care about is how they feel and function and that's their symptoms so what you have to do in the phase three is show you can decrease respiratory symptoms that are consistent with a respiratory tract infection but don't have to be due to a respiratory tract infection and we couldn't decrease the total respiratory symptoms that the elderly have what it does look like we did was decrease the severity of the symptoms but you weren't powered to detect that or were you if you're looking at the laboratory confirmed infections we were underpowered because there weren't very many i think what the mtor inhibitors are doing is not stopping people from getting infected but if you get infected there's a better immune response and your symptoms will be milder yeah i mean near i've heard you say that because i want to come back and really talk about tame in some detail but you know it's a bit of a blessing in disguise that you didn't start tame a year ago because obviously it would have been interrupted as a result of this i mean all the clinical trials that i've been following closely have been interrupted by this i follow very closely for example the clinical trials looking at um liquid biopsies and cancer and all of a sudden these these trials are completely interrupted so there's that there's that component to it of course the flip side of that is depending on how large the study is you might have actually inadvertently got another look at an indication you weren't necessarily thinking about and i guess my question for you joan is do you have enough subjects from the protector where there might be some lingering benefits or do you think that that window has closed and there's no benefit to going back and looking at the patients who received active drug in protector to see if they had any downstream benefits in terms of protection from sarsko v2 we'd haven't even thought about it you're the first person to suggest it no it's a great one when did those patients finish enrolling in november last november like november of 19. november of 19. and those were in new zealand too new zealand and australia so new zealand doesn't have the covered yet right maybe no it had it but it was pretty mild they were they were very well controlled but we also had us i don't know how things are going in australia so we also had sites in australia i mean i guess it would be an interesting exploration because again this is one of those things where you now wonder if you repeat the protector study either as it was done with rtb 101 or with rad001 or in combination but you now do it specifically for this virus do you get a different outcome and i do think you know we're learning as we get more and more data i think we're actually doing a trial in nursing homes now looking at severity and not just incidents because i think what's happening is once you get infected you're better able to upregulate that interferon induced innate immune response and my guess is that's why you're having less severe symptoms it's not happening before you get infected i want to make i i think an important comment because we we spend time and peter you try to really look at those drugs apropos mechanisms of covet 19 but i think that what we are trying to sell out there is that we are reinforcing we're not fighting the virus we're reinforcing the host okay we're defending the host and the claim is that what we sow to influenza is relevant to covet because after all what what's difference between the the people who are dying it's their age right it's the biology of aging that is different by the way you you previously said multi-more uh multi-morbidity for me me multimobility is how old you are biologically that's all it is okay sixty-five percent of the people have more than two diseases and sixty-five percent more chronological and biological age are different so i really think that part of what we have to discuss is the fact that we are defending the older individual whether there is something specific that can help is really great but but this goes not only to the immunity doesn't go to the inflammation but goes also to how do we develop vaccines now because the vaccines that i'm seeing developing are not considering the older host in several ways the new york times today says that they even are going to test it over the age of 65 okay i think the vaccine is going to be such a trap and the way to go over that is either realizing how to do it with the biology of aging and there's a way i'm ready to discuss with you some mechanisms or the elderly have to be on metformin or apolog in order to get their immunity going i think this is this is the next disaster if we have a vaccine that doesn't protect the elderly we did nothing let's talk a little bit about this is a topic that's near and dear to my heart i'm getting involved in a study that's looking at a question from a slightly different angle which is what's the durability of immune response historically as you guys probably know coronaviruses are not exactly the most robust at inducing durable immunity in fact if you remain immune for a year that's considered reasonable this poses a huge problem which is what if after all the trouble of getting sars kovi ii getting sick with kovid 19 bouncing back you only have a year of immunity the probability then that a vaccine is going to provide lifelong immunity the way we get it from several of our most famous vaccines seems quite low and so now you're in a situation of saying well gosh what is the efficacy of a vaccine going to look like is this going to look like a 30 efficacious vaccine that you're going to need every year is it going to need to be supplemented by monoclonal antibodies in the most high risk populations i think we're all basically saying the same thing which is there's a real risk here so so so taken in order what is the probability this virus is going away zero i mean it's somewhere between zero and epsilon but the the likelihood that sars cov2 magically you know mutates its way out of impacting humans is so low it's it's it would be foolish to entertain that so we now have a fifth coronavirus that's here to stay except unlike its other four cousins this one can really whack you and then let's assume we can make some safe and efficacious vaccines are they really likely to keep you protected for five years ten years or more even without the genetic drift based on what we know of other coronaviruses that seems unlikely again we're going to do a study to try to answer that question but i think we do have to get ready for something that says oh man we could be in a we could be in a really unpleasant place where we never really naturally acquire herd immunity and if that's true not to fear monger it means we need a better strategy around immune enhancement and that's that's sort of my general take on this would you guys tone that down or ramp it up i think it's quite a reasonable stance and i think you know finding things that help generate persistent immunity is going to be important especially for the vulnerable population i mean that's the part that i think is is really frustrating is you were all struggling to come to grips with well what is the implication of this for school kids where the restrictions seem so impossible to manage that it it seems ridiculous right like you know a seventh grader shouldn't have to be you know completely quarantined in the manner that we would think about quarantining a 70 year old so we have to be able to now think about immune targeted therapies for the most immune vulnerable i mean i guess joan how do you now think about juggling these things because i know that prior to covid you guys were already looking at an indication in parkinson's disease right help me understand from a pre-clinical standpoint what that was about but then also how do you now think about juggling resources including time and just cognitive bandwidth around parkinson's which was sort of the path you were on with now something that seems even more pressing and maybe even closer i don't know if you think this is closer just based on the data yeah we have you know just reams of data now of using mtor inhibitors to enhance immune function and older people safety data and data on incidents severity of respiratory tract infections and a lot of biomarker data to start understanding what is actually going on in the immune system so we're farthest ahead there when we used to go and try to raise money for you know doing this kind of research investors would just you would mention respiratory tract infections and they would start to yawn like nobody cared they cared about cancer and they cared about rare diseases but they thought respiratory tract infections were boring the nice thing about covid19 is it's making it obvious why enhancing immune function is a really important area and giving us a little bit more bandwidth to see if we can get it right for the parkinson's disease it turns out neurodegenerative diseases there's an accumulation of toxic protein aggregates and if you enhance autophagy in preclinical models that is has benefit i mentioned rapalogs aren't great at inducing autophagy rtb at high doses is very good but it's hard to achieve those concentrations in the brain if you use the two of those together you can lower the concentration of rtb that's needed to induce autophagy so you don't have to get so much across the blood-brain barrier and that was the reason we did the trial of that combination in parkinson's disease now matt cabellon wrote a really elegant piece gosh it's probably been a year ago now where he said and i thought it was just great but i'm obviously biased that like why in the world are we not pouring more resources into rapalogs and alzheimer's disease and he basically gave the argument you're giving which is when you look at their potential to both ameliorate and potentially clean up a lot of the protein aggregation disaggregation that's occurring in the cns it seems like almost a crime when you look at some of the cockamamie ideas especially that are being proposed to treat alzheimer's disease near that brings me to a question for you about this what is the state of the art of understanding the role of metformin in the risk reduction for alzheimer's disease beyond the obvious in other words anything that normalizes glucose and insulin is going to have a direct benefit on dementia and you mentioned mci earlier but do we have any other data that suggests that metformin should be a part of the tool kit to reduce the risk of alzheimer's disease not directly there are several other funded nih projects that will take a couple of years to look at people with mci the two studies that looked at mci metformin for six months and one for nine months had decreased deterioration in some of the domains of alzheimer's for both of them name recalls which is a real problem for me are you saying you're an mci near no i'm on metformin but i think it's common problem to some of us the alzheimer is is more complicated there are several the good studies all showed that people of metformin have less alzheimer's there are some studies that don't show that and there are two reasons for that or possible explanation one they're from china okay either it's not similar mechanisms genetics and environmental interaction somehow you know possibly but more likely is that think about this this way you you really have to do it good because if metformin delays mortality by 20 okay that means you'll get more people on metformin lingering longer right and it might be just that effect that all of a sudden the people with alzheimer are hanging around longer so those studies it's kind of why we need clinical studies and not associate studies absolutely because they're so co-dependent dependency of things that we're looking at that's a great point what have you two ever discussed about the combination in humans of metformin and rapalogs what are your thoughts on that are these drugs that are accretive are these drugs that should never be combined i mean i'll just share personally my experience i've taken both together i so so near knows all this stuff joan i started taking metformin in 2010 that's when i sort of became pretty convinced about the data i started taking rapamycin in i want to say 2018 it's been about two years that was a bigger thing for me to jump but i stopped taking metformin around the same time though not because i thought one shouldn't be on one or the other and near i want to come back and talk about why i stopped taking metformin so see if you can talk me into taking it again i don't want to give you all my reasons why i stopped but but what what are your thoughts on how these drugs would combine in humans well for me it's simple look as you already know we're trying to advance the field okay and the reason i chose metformin it's not because it was the best drug i think rapamycin should be better drug but it's because we didn't want to kill anyone on the road to success that's really is and i think combining metformin and rapamycin is like just i mean the rapamycin part is the one that we want to be careful with but on theory look that's where it's going let's say tame ends okay and let's say the fda agrees that aging can be prevented age-related disease can be prevented and everybody can take metformin because it's so cheap i think the next stage is combination of drugs better drugs timeline you know different timeline when is the best time to start rapamycin when is the best time to start metformin synolitics we don't want to start when you're 20 years old there's nothing obstinacies right so there'll be a lot of calculations so i'm not against that i'm i'm trying i'm focused on achieving a goal that the fda you know metformin is the tool to pave the road for an indication that's all i'm trying to do in the meantime i'm a believer in it for me but tell me where we are with tame joan will you remember that i want to come back and hear your opinion about the combination because i do and really i'm asking from a mechanistic question i near i appreciate your point which i think is the voice of reason and wisdom which says by doing them sequentially in parallel like this we can risk stratify a bit better but but i'm also just interested in just sort of speculating mechanistically but near give us kind of a brief update on tame and help me understand by the way metformin as you said is a free drug effectively who has a financial interest in this i mean there's there's no drug company that could be interested in this right it has to be sort of philanthropic or nih driven correct first of all i i will quote you on what you said i i feel totally lucky now that somehow metformin was delayed it was very frustrating but it's almost uh we get help of of god the second help i hope is discovered 19th story so we're lucky in a way the company that's going to give us the metformin which is cheap and the placebo which is expensive it's is merck germany okay merc germany holds the a world license for metformin so they're contributing it which is not a simple contribution part of the problem with aim is that there's no commercial interest so nobody was going to pay for a phase three like study right for five years and the nih which is a longer story and i don't think i told all of it last time but the nih bottom line found that it's too risky to do this study the major comment what if it doesn't work well if we knew it will work we didn't we didn't have to do the study interestingly we know it works separately for each one of the age-related disease and mortality so i don't know what chance we were looking and and there's also politics of the nia i have to tell you there's also politics there so this is what we're doing american federation of aging research has non-profit people people on a non from non-profit and non-industry that are supporting tame in fact we're expected to get the money any day now sorry what is the total budget for tame going to be so we have a study 78 million dollars that was our initially budget and now we have three pockets because we had three specific aim the primary outcome is the fda outcome it's prevention of edge-related disease and mortality okay this is about 35 million dollars and this is the afr grant the second part is biomarkers we want to make sure that we know what are the biomarkers for metformin action and for aging and this was funded by the nia and will get the money once the tame is funded in order to take plasma and blood and dna and everything and be able to do omics and other things and find biomarkers the third part could come later and this is the geriatric part you know how many hospitalization and what's the adl and the frailty index and and things like that we have enough power to do it at the end of looking at people at the end and people with metformin and without metformin but of course it will be better to start at baseline but we're not funded for that yet and how many subjects in each arm well we are discussing now we were planning 3000 our powers based on 3 000 subjects but we might have enough money to increase to 3500 subjects with the hope that it might accelerate our results it's not necessarily so it's possible that you need the time that you need but it's 3 000 subjects now but could be more later and does your budget permit for serology testing or other things to now include potential given that your subjects i assume are older you have a beautiful population to also study the effects of metformin on immune function specifically with respect to cova 19. right so the way we organize the study and this is also in negotiation with the nih we will have auxiliary ancillary studies that will be reviewed sometimes you need only 250 people so you it can be in one center we have 14 centers and part of the examples we gave is actually immunity that was the example we had it was against the flu but of course now we're talking about if we start before immunization will immunize for influenza the first year and see the response and then for covet 19 the next year and see the response joan back to you on this other question then what do you think about the idea of could there potentially be a benefit in combining metformin with a wrapalog knowing what we know now about the potential pillars there's not a huge amount of overlap at least in the most fundamentally important pillars right i mean the two really clear things that rapalogs are doing is impairing synthesis and probably inhibiting sasp i mean those two seem undeniable and then there's probably some autophagy depending on the way that you inhibit and or the tissue so how does that fit with the double down effect of the metabolic side of metformin along with the potential increase of ross and and some of these other benefits around inflammation that come from metformin is there a is there a synergy with these things yeah i don't think we know enough as i recall from the itp study where they used both the effect was driven by one center but i had seen that data early before the whole study was finished i have done analyses of people who are getting the rapalogs or rtb who are on or off metformin just to see if i could see a difference but we're way underpowered so i can't say anything yet and near you may understand the biochemical rationale for using the two together but i do think tanir's point every drug that has a biologic effect has a side effect and so if you use two drugs that have a biologic effect you're just going to get more side effects so you got to make sure that the benefits outweighing the risks let me give you an example if both of them are enhancing autophagy okay which is good and it's synergistic but the patient has cancer then it's when we want to stop autophagy but peter can i ask you a question i love hearing people who are taking rapalogs or mike foreman what did you notice on each of them yeah why did you stop sure sure so well i as i said i started metformin in 2010 the spring of 2010 may of 2010 i remember it very well actually and i stupidly just started at 2000 milligrams a day i didn't escalate the dose so i remember having lots of nausea for about two months and again some people if they just go straight to a high dose they do feel nauseous others usually when i put patients on it now we titrate them we go 500 at night then 500 bid a thousand at night 500 in the morning etc so that was my first beyond that i didn't even notice i was taking it so never a side effect again so why did i stop it in 2018 in 2018 i started to very very closely track my lactate levels during exercise and in particular i was tracking my lactate levels during a type of exercise called zone 2 exercise which is when you're basically trying to see how much work you can do under purely aerobic conditions the definition of this is is actually how much work you can do while keeping lactate below 2 millimole i used to do a lot of lactate testing on myself when i was an athlete so i was familiar with what these levels looked like and i was kind of surprised at how high my lactate levels were even at baseline you know i was walking around at a lactate level of 1.6 millimole now it would dip a little bit when i would start exercising but i was realizing that i just had you know higher lactate levels than i wanted to and i thought about it and i was like wait this is obvious i'm taking a mitochondrial toxin of course my lactate levels are going to be higher so then i did the experiment and i did all this sort of talking with a friend of mine inagosan milan who's also been on the podcast of stopping metformin and starting it again just to see if we could reproduce the effect and sure enough it was clearly the metformin that was allowing my lactate levels and this you do this at a fixed power level right so you on an ergometer you would just say look at this many watts or this many miles per hour on a treadmill you could watch your lactate level go up and down as a function of metformin and then you know we looked at a couple of studies and you saw that look there were some things that metformin was blunting with respect to exercise some things i didn't care much about but you could certainly see i think in the master's trial you saw and and near i'd love for you to talk about this trial a bit some blunting of of hypertrophy so muscle mass though i don't think they looked at muscle function so maybe it wasn't having any impact on on muscle function they looked they hid it well did they look yeah so we have a paper in review now that by the way took us a long time because the authors disagreed on the interpretation of the same data joan it was everybody exercised half of them with metformin enough without and they got a grant because they said it's going to be synergistic you know through amp kinase we're going to have better effect the people with metformin exercise are going to do better and what happened the people that were exercising metformin had significantly not they all increased muscle mass but they had signifi they had less muscle mass in the supplement they show you that the function was actually the same in other words gram of muscle when urine metformin is doing better work when than gram of muscle when you exercise only it was a little bit hidden and that's why i took this study and i said i want to see the transcript and the transcript all showed what you kind of missed in this whole idea metformin is decreasing mdor and exercising increasing mtor so all the emptor transcripts were higher in the exercise only group and were blunted by metformin and were these elderly or young 75 years old 75 yeah all elderly because there's other papers where emptor inhibitors don't decrease muscle mass in older people so that's you know it doesn't seem to just a minute let me just tell you the main result 516 of the transcript were different between them they were only in the metformin group and those were the transcripts that we want to see with aging such as transcripts for autophagy so basically what i'm saying in this elderly population what the metformin did is kept the young profile of the muscle and at the end yeah maybe you had less muscle but the same function but you gained by metformin protecting 500 transcripts that are aging transcripts and then what do you make of the changes in aerobic efficiency wasn't there another study and i i was thinking while you were talking i could find it and i just can't find it i think it's the konopka right from colorado a group in colorado i forgot their name but what you said about lactic acid i saw it in my first study with the fronzo all our patients increased their lactic acid some of them above two some of them below two all of them increased and the increase in lactic acid was associated with better glucose control interesting yeah it's one thing to have lactic acidosis and to be clear my concern was not at all lactic acidosis it was are my mitochondria less efficient as someone who is exercising so much so it was really my my concern was this i still have many patients who are taking metformin my thinking became if you are metabolically healthy and if you are exercising to a maximum degree if you are maximizing the dose of exercise is there additional benefit that comes from metformin or is this a drug that is better reserved for people who are not taking the maximum dose of the drug known as exercise that basically is my question my answer is there's an independent effect of metformin when you're exercising at least if you're those people and that's why i'm taking metformin and i'm exercising daily and when you say those people near you mean people above a certain age yeah those were a group that were above 70 years old okay this study that i'm telling you i don't know at 40 50 and stuff and i don't know about maximal exercising right it's not i didn't describe a study that you were the example of the patient and what dose is tame going to be testing one gram twice a day 1500 milligram of extended release they'll get three tablets every morning or every night whatever they choose 300 500 milligram extended release peels and is that what you take personally is 1500 milligrams yes okay so then going back to your question joan when i started rapamycin and i think i've talked about this maybe even with lloyd on that podcast i knew i wanted to take rapamycin going back to 2011 2012 again based on just the data in the mice the yeast the flies the worms my biggest fear was immune suppression your paper comes along in 2014. now all of a sudden i'm feeling much more emboldened still not sure how to dose it but again if your paper suggested anything five milligrams once a week was a pretty good place to start then triangulating from some of the data in matt caberland's dogs and some other folks i sort of arrived at i think i arrived at six milligrams once a week was the right place to go what wasn't clear to me and still probably remains unclear to me is how to cycle it i mean i have a protocol where i think sort of go on for eight weeks and off for six or i think it's on for eight off for five so it works out to be exactly a quarter but truthfully you know without more advanced testing i'm really making it up and therefore i don't i don't like talking about it i just did but you know i don't want to suggest that i know anything more than i'm i'm extrapolating that said i definitely do get side effects from it i get aphthous ulcers not as many as i used to so there must be some acclimation i'm having but i remember i used to get aptos ulcers in residency all the time i mean i don't think i went more than two weeks without a horrible aptos ulcer in my mouth during my residency and i remember the day i walked out of the hospital for the last time never getting one again until i started rapamycin you know 12 14 years later that's been the only thing i've noticed one other little thing i've noticed which is really odd is when i'm on it it's not surprising my fingernails grow slower for example i'm not taking it right now and this is gonna sound dumb i feel like i have to cut my fingernails like every four or five days do you feel any benefits of from either of them when you are on them or not really nope i don't feel anything that i can that i can comment on joan you didn't see him before but he looks so much older these days i bet you looks younger i looked like a spring chicken until i started taking it near talk to us a little bit about your book i want to kind of go back and talk about a couple things there was some funny stories in there that i was unaware of and i want to at least have you tell one of them i had no idea that you were one of the reviewers on the university of wisconsin program i'm writing about this experiment in great detail for my book that will hopefully be out in the next 10 years and i talk about the nih monkeys and the wisconsin monkeys etc but talk to us about i don't know if you know this story joan do you know the story about what near found when he was doing this no so set the stage near this is the single biggest experiment ever on caloric restriction right we we couldn't do longevity in humans so let's do it in primate and make sure that we're making progress so wisconsin set up their experiment they go for i think it's already ten years actually i'm not sure it was five years or ten years but there's the renewal okay and they write the renewal and the committee meets in wisconsin the night before and we go first over our comments i'm reading their preliminary data and i see something very interesting the elderly animals are before the body weight were separated in parallel and all of a sudden the monkeys are older but they're starting to weigh the same although they're calorically restricted supposedly there's a disappearance of the delta weight and i'm thinking first maybe maybe it has to do with aging it you know it just doesn't work as well metabolic rates are slowing right something is slowing i don't know but then i'm noticing that those cohorts were started at different times they had like three cohorts i don't remember exactly but three chords that were started a different time so there were different ages but all of them in the last year their weight disappeared and i'm sitting in the community and i said there's only one possibility that i can think of that all cohorts are doing that and that somebody's feeding the monkeys okay and and not noticing them and indeed they're coming those guys in the morning and they say before we start we want to tell you somebody was feeding the monkeys extra food out of compassion oh my gosh and basically ruining this study the wisconsin monkeys took a year a year break and we're at leave them fed but nobody talks about this on the difference between the nia and wisconsin i know and maybe there's no difference but i'm telling this story for another reason because you know you realize i have all those monkeys all those rats that are caloric restriction because that's my positive control right so i'm going to einstein and i said i want you know you're you're meeting the animal caretaker are they meeting he said yeah i said i'd love to talk with them and very simply i'm telling you know we're looking at aging caloric restriction extends lifespan and we we're doing it in animals and i'm telling them the story of wisconsin and since then they were i mean nobody did anything wrong but i knew that those guys are with me but i said it's better for those who are caloric restrictors they are less sick they live longer don't meet them right i love that story by the way because it speaks to the human nature of science right and at the end of the day science is still an operational discipline and you can have the most perfect idea imaginable you can have the most beautiful theory imaginable but it is so difficult to do clinical trials and even though that was a trial in primates and not in humans it's as complicated as any human trial imaginable and whether it's that study or any of these studies we're talking about the decisions you make can come back to haunt you forever if you pick the wrong patient in which to study this if you pick the wrong indication i mean i'm constantly amazed at how often science actually works out when you consider all of the permutations in which it could go wrong absolutely all the washout periods that you wash out long enough that you not wash out long enough these things amaze me let's pivot a little bit to talk about epigenetic clocks they're getting a lot of attention lately there was a paper that came out probably three weeks ago looking at some changes in in methylation do either of you want to just take a stab at sort of explaining to the listener what an epigenetic clock is given that we're talking about aging and then maybe we could talk a bit about them with aging their epigenetic changes would mean it's not the sequence of the dna right but on top of the dna there is a way to control whether gene is activated or not and one of the ways to control that is methylation which is a relatively simple reaction and methylation is one way where the environment interacts with our genome and the methylation with aging are either increasing or decreasing both of them happens and they very often the consequences change in a gene activity david sinclair in his book you can see that i'm seeing it as one of the hallmarks of aging david sinclair really thinks that that's not only the major cause of aging but also the major way we we changed it anyhow horvat and morgan levine and some other people around the world have looked at methylation sites and tried to correlate them to chronological age okay and it's a big process it's also with artificial intelligence you have to take lots of methylation sites you have to do and see the chronological age but more important and more the most important thing is to distinct between biological age and chronological age and there's a huge body of work that really showed that methylation clogs and they're in development there's newer and better that methylation clocks are good they're really good clocks of biological age in particular when you see if they predict mortality for example but also prediction of a lot of diseases not all of them and so all of a sudden this methylation became not only an important biology a predictive biology a biomarker but also became a business and this is kind of available out there i mean i think what's interesting to me is are these changes all pathologic or are some of them compensatory and actually good and so is reversing a biologic clock going to mean you're in a better state or not so there's it's a two it's independent things and i would add to that i think near you and i have maybe even talked about this or i feel like i've talked about it with somebody so i don't know if it was you but we don't know if a person has a let's just say person shows up at time t not and they have methylation status m naught you then apply an intervention that is beneficial you give them mapamycin you give them metformin you go down to you know another time point even if you have not undone methylation how do you know you haven't done good that is proactive as opposed to retroactive exactly so we it's one thing to have a biomarker that predict biological age but we want much more than that we want biomarkers to predict if we're targeting aging right we don't want to do phase three studies for every drug that we have and spend billion of dollar over five years to find that it doesn't work we need something that will show it in weeks or months that it's doing that my fear though i just want to insert my concern on this is every time i've looked at one of these i have found the data to be somewhat unhelpful because i don't know what to make of them so i just had a patient use one of the very famous clocks so he's a healthy guy you know so his baseline test said he was 34 his biologic age was 34 which was younger than his chronologic age so you are to the gate you're thinking well that's already great news so then we put him through a five-day water-only fast it's a pretty extreme measure and then we checked the blood test immediately after and sure enough on the same biologic clock his age went down to 27. so does that really mean that in five days of water only fasting he got seven years younger i mean it's nonsensical to me truthfully and i i find it a little bit annoying that people look to these clocks as though there's some you know stone that comes from a deity that tells us something like you know you can reverse engineer these things in any way you want actually right and i think that's the problem i think that methylations are kind of stable so what we've been doing we had a nature medicine paper um at the end of last year with tony weiss i don't know if you know tony wise corey from stanford but and we had the paper just accepted too but we were looking for proteomic and doing a clock from proteomic so i have a study where i have i took thousand patients between the age 65 and 95 and by optimal technology we looked at each one of the thousand patients on 5 000 proteins and we asked what was changed between age 65 and 95 and we we got hundreds of proteins the most important thing about the proteins they were a bunch of proteins that were breakdowns okay breakdowns of collagen of metrics of granule of granulocytes of platelets and initially i said oh give me a break that's you know what do i do with that coming to realize that that's possibly the best biomarker that we have because no matter what we're going to do whether it's with rapamycin or metformin or autophagy what we're going to do is stop the breakdown that is typical to aging and also proteomics are much more reactive than methylation i think although peter just said in five days the methylation responded well and in fairness i don't know how much of that clock response was methylation versus the other biomarkers so these commercial tests are using methylation is one thing but they're using glucose level insulin level they're using a whole bunch of biomarkers and again i just know from having looked at the inputs you never know what the algorithm is but you know what some of the inputs are you know vitamin d level is one of them well you take somebody whose vitamin d level is 20 which is low you could give them 5 000 units a day and normalize it and that change alone improves biologic age in a manner that's simply inconsistent with a single clinical trial that has ever suggested you can extend life with vitamin d and so these are the problems i have with these things but but i agree like to me the really interesting stuff is at the metabolomic proteomic transcriptomic level of which maybe methylation becomes an additional thing that matters but i i think i just struggle with any one of these things being a magic bullet but again i might just be too jaded on this one well there is an aging cell paper where somebody tried to rejuvenate the thymus and they took patients and gave them a growth hormone right growth hormone metformin and dhea yeah i was hiding that i think it's a metformin effect but they showed methylation reversal so i i don't want to say that methylation doesn't go back i don't i don't know this biochemistry to be like that and i'm doing lots of methylation on my centenarians and their children and so i'm like you i'm excited of other omics and their potential as biomarkers that change with aging and i'll just say we've done some of this at novartis with proteomics and aging and the problem is some of the proteins that go up with age are actually they've been shown in the framingham heart study to be beneficial like it's it is a compensatory good thing so saying oh i'm moving my proteome to a younger age can sometimes actually be bad clinically so that is part of the mix absolutely when we get the proton that's why i i looked at the breakdown when you look at the proteome you don't know what's in fact a lot of them we know are compensatory like a gdf 15 mic right there's a lot that are obviously are beneficial and we don't want to take them down but we need to find the ones that are are moving most i want to say two more things about the protonic data of those thousand people 500 are children of centenarians that we know are slowing much much later and we published about them they had about third of the proteome of the 500 that are just usual people who are aging so we have some relationship to longevity also really interesting and i think peter this is worth the whole program the gender effects of aging are so incredible and we've missed them in every model in you know in mice in rats in humans but while in man there are 700 proteins that are changing actually 560 that are changing in women there are only 200 that are changing the proteome of women is much more stable okay so we'll need to think of different biomarkers that are gender are sex dependent not only common to all aging why do you think that is near well we don't know it's not as simple as saying sex chromosomes okay it's much more complicated and i can get you to people who are who have nih grant with lots of you know innovative id to do that you know from the itp that it's all sex dependent you know thank god that they did it there was a discussion whether we should do it at all but it's different could it be possible if it's not sex chromosomes that it's endocrine related and because women go through menopause older women have a more homogeneous no because even with hrt you'd think that would mess that up huh that's interesting i would i wouldn't have guessed that by the way if you'd turn that into a multiple choice question i would have got that one wrong well i fulfilled the idea that women live two and a half years long was like a fact that i i didn't go on and thought that you know even if we cure heart disease today we're not going to get two years back you know that this is huge and we said yeah but they live longer and they are sick and there's some truth to that but i think there's the rate of aging itself is actually different and a lot of the itp what they do in male they get them to the lifespan of women of females right in the mice going back to the the idea of aging more broadly bringing it back to your centenarians i think there is you know i think some people talk about centenarians as being escapers versus survivors as you put them i talk about this with my patients a lot i talk about centenarians having a superpower and our goal is to understand the superpower and try to emulate the superpower and the way i describe it to patients which is based very much on your work near is that their superpower is not that they survive better when they get diseases it's just that they phase shift when those diseases hit them they just you know when they're 80 they're just acting like physiologically 60 year olds but you know once they get cancer and once they get heart disease and once they get alzheimer's disease they're not bulletproof they just happen to be able to dodge bullets better so then i invoke images of you know neo in the matrix and things like that do you think i mean do you think i'm interpreting your research correctly or do you think that they are super survivors and who who actually can take bullets on the chest and and have them bounce off no look um their aging is slowed and and when i'm saying they're aging from an age-related disease perspective they live 30 years longer than a cohort that's 20 years younger than them i mean their friends died when they were between 40 and 60. so they already more than doubled life expectancy right their aging has been delayed what happens though their aging has been delayed enough to prevent age major age-related diseases but it's not obviously that they didn't age so when they get to their end of life they are just almost frail enough that whenever disease they get it kills them okay i i don't know that i want it out there like that okay because they still live longer still live healthier and still have a contraction of morbidity but why does it happen because they're old i have always this argument like with tom pearls who's doing centenarian study i said i don't care how they look when they're 100 years old because now 30 of them will die next year so no matter what i measure it will either be the predictive of their death next year or they're predictive of their longevity before right the better thing is when they were 80 how do they look compared to their 80 year old non-centenarian peers right and so we have their offspring who are now becoming 80 and it's really interesting because the offspring inherited only half of their genetic makeup right but they're so much healthier than control i think our best paper was in a american journal of cardiology when we showed their habits well their bmi and their food intake and social economy and everything like that but they had 40 of the heart disease of of the control okay so genetics plays a major role here and it's slower their age-related diseases near you were quoted in an article maybe you was taken out of context but it was very recent and the quote is something to the effect of rapamycin could reduce the morbidity of covid19 by 50 percent maybe it's out of context i'm referring to jones a phase 2b study where severe disease was decreased by 52 am i right joan you are right with that joan what is your dream experiment right now if you could go right back to restore bio tomorrow and say guys we we just got an unlimited amount of funding to do the definitive experiment and the fda came in and said guys the stakes are high enough with the appropriate monitoring in place we're going to let you go right to a phase 3 trial what experiment do you want to do right now to test the hypothesis of this agent with respect to immune function yeah i would do the phase 2b as a phase 3 i would do lab confirmed respiratory tract infections including covid19 and just show that elderly people who take rtb 101 have decreased severity of illness you would not include rad001 you would just do rtb101 versus placebo so in our phase 2a we saw that the benefit for rtb was better than for a vera leibniz but i it yeah it's a dream experiment you can have three arms add a wrap a log to add a verilimus at rtb101 i wouldn't add the combo because that gives you that didn't work as well in our phase to be so i'd use those head to head and just show we could decrease the severity of illness and now to the point that says these are things that presumably have to be in the system before you encounter these aren't drugs you start giving patients who show up sick how would you then think about the on versus off cycle of the drug specifically would you dose it as eight weeks on four weeks off i mean what would these patients be enrolled to take so there's a peak of hospitalizations and deaths in people particularly 70 and older right during four months of winter cold and flu season so that's when i would give it to them where there's the peak incidence and peak health care resource utilization take it during that period and show that we have decreased hospitalization decrease severe symptoms so your view is that the the benefit is coming when they're on drug not post washout exactly there may be some benefit post washout but we saw that in the phase 2a in the phase 2b we didn't have enough events after they stopped taking drug because the season was over so i'm where i'm most confident is while they're on drug okay that's interesting so that's a big deal i had a webinar that i called to be or not to be and the two was the number two and it's an ethical dilemma we are at war now okay this is not normal times and we're war like when when we went to iraq we chase saddam hussein we chase the terrorists but in the meantime we had to also build better humvees right to defend the soldiers right we have to attack the virus and we have to defend the host and you have joan who's telling you very convincingly of many studies that showed that immunity was improved and the price from a matter of side effects the safety was actually this the safety profile were better because it was treating their aging too and you have metformin that's been in so many years out there we know that it's safe so should we actually come and say you know it's a war you cannot stop the death of the elderly why don't we do those studies and monitor them it's not going to be controlled but is there something that we lose are we putting them in enough danger tell me you're a clinician you're such a thoughtful guy what would you think we should do well first of all near you give me far too much credit but i understand your question and i think it's you know a question of of risk versus reward and those are not static and what you're basically saying is when you ask this question in the summer of 2020 it's a very different question from what it was in the summer of 2018 and as such our regulatory environment and our appetite for risk had better have changed in those two years or else we live in a static risk environment and we're not adaptable and therefore we're really ineffective so in many ways i struggle with this all the time guys because i don't prescribe rapamycin to my patients though a number of them have asked i prescribe metformin to my patients some who need it for the standard indication of hyperglycemia hyperinsulinemia but a number who say look peter i've read enough of your stuff i've listened to enough of your podcasts i want to you know i want to take metformin for these other benefits and look i think it's completely ethical to do so they're paying for it out of their own pocket it's not like we're asking an insurance company to buy it for them so that's fine i don't know what it is with rapamycin that has me hesitating a little bit more though i would completely concur it is probably as safe as any other in fact i mean i feel less nervous taking rapamycin personally than an antibiotic you know every time i mean i had to take a cephalosporin a year ago i mean i was like god oh i just don't want to take this drug you know i mean so we know that these drugs are safe but yet there is still some hesitation in me and and that waffling speaks to i think a broader issue now of course that's at the personal level as a clinician who has to make that decision with each and every patient i do think that what we have talked about today i think it needs to be on the radar of whatever entity is going to be self-appointed as the czar of getting us through this mess and all subsequent messes you know i was on a podcast with stanley perlman recently and we talked about how do you think about the no regret moves that need to always be in place for the subsequent pandemics like there are just certain things that we should always have in place right we should always have a national stockpile of ppe we should have a national stockpile of every reagent you would ever want to do pcr we should have a national stockpile of any form of you know antiviral therapy or immune modulating therapy that could be effective and and then of course the moment we find out about viruses and we sequence a new virus we should have the infrastructure in place that we can rapidly test and have the electronic infrastructure to do the appropriate amount of contact tracing and surveillance but somewhere along that way is why wouldn't we also in parallel have an enormous path around doing rigorous research around immune enhancement so i'll give you an example why hasn't someone done the definitive study to test the effect of sleep on immune function i mean really let's let's put this to rest and be done with it does it matter if you get eight hours versus six hours of sleep and if so how much does it matter does vitamin d matter does it matter if you get it from the sun or does it matter if you supplement it does vitamin c matter i mean you can say oh but peter each of those studies would cost tens of millions of dollars to which i say and shutting down the economy of this country cost how much such a good time yep right so i completely agree with you and i would love to see a full out scientific assault on these questions and obviously my view is that there are agents like metformin and rapamycin that could play a significant role in preparedness and basically what it really comes down to is resilience i mean that's really what you're talking about is host resilience these are not drugs as you say that you want people taking in the er when they're already sick these are drugs that you should have taken long before that so that a you don't get sick or if you do get sick it's less severe as the chinese data that were published a week and a half ago suggest or where before you immunize when you'll have the that's right look i keep talking about this stuff forever anything else that you guys want to talk about with respect to this particular subject matter i want to be kind of mindful of our time i know we've been we've been chatting for quite a while here and i was thinking the dose response to you were you had asked me would you use a rapalog early or late in the disease low doses you'd use to prevent high doses that immunosuppressive doses actually might have benefit for that over reaction of the immune system that's really really interesting so has anybody talked about that which is when you when you have that patient who is now in the second wave where the immune response is what's going to kill them you hammer them with 20 milligrams of avralimus on three consecutive days or something anybody discussing that there was a small study showing i think it was out of hong kong showing there was a benefit in patients with severe influenza and i think there's one trial looking at rapamycin in hospitalized patients with covid so i think the jury's out there was a people are thinking about it but whether it's going to work or not nobody knows but the other thing i wanted to bring up to your point peter is i do think these shouldn't be used until we prove that they have benefit and i think near's going to get some really important data from metformin hopefully you know restore buyer or someone will start getting placebo placebo-controlled really compelling data showing where there is and isn't benefit of these drugs yeah you don't personally take these agents yet i'm guessing no and that says something right i mean that do you do you think of yourself as a particularly risk-averse individual or is that just sort of the way you you you think about things and unintended consequences i like data i want the data to decide what i'm going to do so i want to generate the data if i i would want to be in a clinical trial where there's data generated to say what is this doing so that we learn yeah i want to say two things i i think for metformin what needs to be considered is that tame will answer some of the ques let's say we decide it's we don't know what to do we're going to give it for me now okay because people are dying the tank study will provide maybe later but will provide some more evidence it could be a little bit different but i actually want to say something else to the scientists to joan and the scientist we no matter how it's going to turn out i believe that we won science one here the scientists have been much more popular right than the president or other things science is one you could see that the pope is asking people not to go to church right and rabbis are asking people not to go to synagogues and and ramadan was not in mosques so there was an influence and the influence was because they so that we know and that we are responsible and i certainly don't want to change that okay that's why what i'm saying is an ethical dilemma but as a as a physician i don't want to see studies that are not clinical studies right that's my whole shtick here so i i think we won and we need to find how we do things effectively as fast as possible and that it's still led by science the last point i'd add to that near is it has to do also with i think how you get to the stage 2b right which is if you look at oncology i mean why does oncology have such an abysmal track record in clinical trials well it might be that a lot of the pre-clinical work is subpar it's being done in animal models that are not particularly representative it's being done in cell lines that are not particularly helpful and so it's it's really less about what are we doing in phase three versus how efficient is the pipeline to get an agent into phase three and so i guess to go back to your question of me a minute ago i i would say that the other thing to be thinking about is how much more efficiently can drugs be scrutinized in the pre-phase two so that you're taking better things into phase three because there everybody wins the investor wins because you just have a much more efficient roi the patient wins because the probability of success to failure goes up and then society wins because you're you're basically improving outcomes broadly not just at the individual level and again i think it speaks to all these challenges we've talked about which is what's the right question to ask what is the right outcome what is the right indication and how you know you alluded to something earlier which is look the itp is early enough figured out you better be really clear on which animals you're studying this in or you will miss effects and and so i don't know i just think i don't know if enough time and science goes to this type of question because it's not a very sexy question right like if if you're myopically focused as a scientist on your problem well then that's all you want to think about you don't really want to think about these broad structural things of reproducibility and blind spots and things like that but but i think you have to start thinking about when i say you i don't mean you individually i mean we collectively have to be thinking about those things if we want to accelerate therapies to the clinic safely i think the other thing peter that people don't oftentimes think about is there is the issue of regulatory authorities you're absolutely right you have to get the phase to be right but the fda's never had a drug to give immuno resilience and decrease all sorts of infections so they'd have they have to figure it out and i think we also have to have a little bit of willingness to have a learning curve here to figure all this stuff out with the regulatory authorities and we don't always have complete control over these designs and we're going to have to just they educate us we educate them and have an iterative process and i think your phase three demonstrate that you know i'm i'm joking always that geriatrician are telling their patients if you wake up in the morning and you have no pain you're dead right so this idea that the fda decided to take 70 i don't know 75 year old people and have a subjective assessment of how they are it's crazy it works if you're young and have arthritis you will say if it's gone or not but to elderly people about their health they'll complain no matter what or they'll shut up no matter what you're not going to get a signal like that so it's just crazy sometimes what the loops that you have to go through and they lead you terribly and it's just life i mean the fda admitted they're trying to learn too but i think there's this perception that oh my god a phase three failed that was because it's you know people don't know what they're doing or the mtor doesn't work it's so much more complicated than that as peter you were referring to there are so many ways for things to go wrong that sometimes you can control and sometimes you can't but we have to have the perseverance to go hey you know let's look through this and see what's there and what is it if there's a silver lining in the last four months and i think there are a couple right if we're going to be brutally honest i think you know for example many more people have figured out you don't have to get on airplanes nearly as much i don't exactly have any love loss for the airlines so that's certainly a win but i think to your point near i think i think biomedical research has been elevated a notch and look if the right studies can be done and that by the way goes back to something that we haven't discussed or you discussed earlier but i think we should bring back to your question which is better biomarkers better biomarkers is going to allow for better studies bottom line and right now our biomarkers are so crude as to border on unhelpful at times so imagine you could three months into a study have a biomarker that tells you you're on the wrong direction you're on the right direction you need to pivot you have a phase three design that is flexible enough to allow you to make the dose change or take a certain population out of the study and you know these things matter because of the cost and the logistics of doing the study so look a lot of those things again they're not that interesting to people who wants to study biomarkers it's not that fun but they think we are in a new environment and i think people are going to say wow we really need to invest in biomedical research even for something that's not an immediate threat like immune enhancement guys thank you for tolerating me through a very awkward three-person video interview thank you so much thank you thank you for listening to this week's
