## Transcript

[00:00:00] I want people to understand what the difference is between a phase one, a phase two, a phase three study. Also understand what's preclinical. Um it's not intuitive to people why it costs a billion dollars to get a drug to market and why it can take a decade. Um and then within that if you could just embed enough of the details about decisions that you can make that will make or break you, right? you how many times has a drug failed because the experimental design, the wrong patient selection, the wrong disease selection. You it is you have got to line up four pieces of Swiss cheese just right to get the pen through to hit it. So, let's Sorry to interrupt, but let's go back to you got Judah

[00:00:45] Folkman talking about VeF VeF Vef. That then turns into well if we made an antibbody to VEGF. Okay. So there's your idea. Now yeah start the clock and start the dollars. If you start with a target often in oncology today we'll start with a target. There's two things you have to to start with. One is what's the best way to turn down or turn off that target. Is it a small molecule? Is it an antibbody? Um, tell folks the difference. How do you think of small molecule versus antibody?

[00:01:19] Where do we draw the line? So, here's a really simple way I think of that helps. Small molecule is chemistry. Small molecule is it can be not always a pill. Uh, um, a small molecule you're you're impacting on often pathways or enzymes or things that happen in the cell. um a large molecule, whether it's a protein or especially an antibbody. An antibbody is biology. An antibbody, you're trying to do something that may be immune in nature or you use the antibbody as a delivery device. You're getting something to the cell. Um it's a a company like Janentech um and many modern companies really like antibodies.

[00:02:07] I like antibodies because when something happens, it's on target. It it doesn't tend to be offtarget. Small molecules that chemistry tends to have surprises in negative ways offtarget like liver toxicity or kidney toxicity. This is the way I I do it this through cardiovascular medicine to explain to people the difference between a statin and a PCSK9 inhibitor. You have these two very common drugs that are used to lower cholesterol, but a statin is a small molecule. And I don't say this in an insulting way, but we use the terminology it's dirty, right? So it it does block an enzyme, but it's got all these offtarget things and your liver function gets whacked. You get insulin resistance. Some people get horrible muscle soreness. Right. So 5 to 10% of people taking this drug are going to have a side effect that prevents them from taking the drug. Right. Right. never seen a person yet who couldn't tolerate a PCSK9 inhibitor where you inject an antibbody into them that binds to a protein and shuts it off. That's that that's really a good example and that that that the choice of molecule is driven by that. When I was first in product development, there was this thing of oh you need a pill especially for chronic indications. You need a pill um for um compliance, right? Who would take an injection for cardiovascular for cholesterol? Look at obesity drugs.

[00:03:32] Turns out a lot of people would take an injection if they want to. But once you have your your selection, you you need to make sure you can make it. Y and one of the critical things for a biotech company, if it's a protein or or an antibbody, is the smallcale production of it in small, they call it a mini firm, uh the mini firm has to resemble what is actually going to be used because the next thing you start doing is a bunch of models. Judah Folkman giving a great talk doesn't mean you believe that blocking VEF will help cancer. So we do models in mice. We may do larger animals. Um we do fewer animal models than we used to because they're really limited. Um I would rather have a great target with good biology than an animal model. But it's still helpful.

[00:04:23] It's still helpful. And then the the critical thing is the preclinical work that you do. What FDA is going to want to ask you, and they should, this is not them being bad, this is them being good. They're going to want to ask you about toxicology. What's your safety plan based on biology of Vegoff? What are you most worried about? I'm most worried about bleeding. It's an antibbody. I'm most worried about an allergy to the antibbody. Did any of the p the uh um talk studies show allergy to the antibbody? What are you going to look for? And how are you going to look? How often are you going to measure the patient? So the pre-clinical safety plan is really important and based on what you find in toxicology. The other thing that's essential is and especially modern oncology if you have a targeted therapy you must have a diagnostic and that is wicked hard because you've got the therapeutic and the diagnostic at the same time. Now things like CD20, things like VEGF are very ubiquitous. So it's not really targeted in the sense of her two um where we needed a diagnostic but if you need to have that we had a what we called a clinical trials assay for her septin that wasn't to be marketed from the moment you guys hit uh go decision on we want to do this we want to pursue this path how long until you file the IND oh gosh it could be years it could be two three years because you're doing animal models you've got now if you hit the maybe tell folks what the IND is so they understand why that's an important milestone. So the investigational new drug is asking the food and drug administration permission to ship an unapproved drug across state lines. If if you and I wanted to do something in

[00:06:11] Austin um we could actually do it which is sort of weird when you think about it but most people don't know. So we're going to do the Peter Sue drug. It's going to be amazing. We're going to set the lab up right over there. But the moment we want to run a clinical trial and ship it and get it out of the state, you got to have the IND. So the investigational new drug is the request.

[00:06:31] And what happens is that you bring take all this information I've been talking about that that you know you have a molecule. You you trust the the way you're uh producing the molecule. You you understand the biology enough. You have a safety plan. You know what's uh uh and you have a phase one protocol. So phase one is has one purpose. We're all greedy. I've been there. It is only for safety. Phase one is is it safe to give humans this molecule? Is it safe to give it once? Is it safe to give it multiple times? And there's an art to knowing where to start the dose because it's an escalating dose trial, but you're extrapolating from what you learned about toxicity in a totally different organism that never translates one to one to the organism of choice. It's absolutely true and it's not uncommon and you see people all the time backing up on the dose thinking, "Oh, that was more than we needed um or more than we wanted." But phase one um with a good pre-clinical package, a good IND, phase one should be uneventful. Y and because we are greedy in oncology, we always look to see if anybody responds just because that's what we do. But phase one often to be fair has some really tough patients who are trying something and have tried a lot of other things. So the patient population um uh can can be tough to find any efficacy in phase two is where things get so so phase one I always think of phase one is it might be a year that you're in phase one if you're doing really and typical cost given the relatively low numbers of patients. Oh gosh in the tens of millions. Tens of millions. Yep. Yeah. Tens of millions.

[00:08:15] And then you get into the 20s and 30s and 40s of millions with the phase two depending on how big your phase 2 is. And phase two I think is um that's where people can use their intellect I think in many ways. Phase two you start to look at what's the right dose and schedule. Um very very important to get the right dose and schedule and what's what's the right outcome? What's the right patient? who do you want to treat? And and really what phase two is supposed to do is with one exception, phase two is supposed to get you ready for phase three. You've got a dose, you've got a schedule, you've got a patient selection criteria, and you've got a hypothesis of where this is going to be a drug. Um the the exception in oncology is sometimes you want to get an approval off phase two.

[00:09:07] Um when we tested uh anti-vegF in breast cancer in phase two, we wanted to use that as an approvable study because we would go in and say, "Look, these patients have it can be a contingent approval, but these patients have nothing else to do." Um and so I think that can happen, especially targeted therapy where you've got the perfect target and FDA's um feeling good about it too, that can be a phase two study, but most of the time you're getting ready for phase three. So where were you guys with uh antivf in phase 2? You're at breast cancer and did you do colon?

[00:09:42] We did colon but not the kind of study that I just mentioned for approval. We did a traditional phase two in colon. So what happened is the breast cancer study failed and um oh so disappointed. I was so hoping that that would work. I still remember that day. Um it for me it was like oh we need it we need more better drugs for breast cancer because I often heard from people when her sept you know when they're the three out of four patients through her septin wasn't for them. um if you looked at your stock that day, it also looked really bad because all the hype about avasten um uh was there. But in colon cancer, we had a phase two got ready on the dose and schedule and then we went to a phase three study in colon cancer. Much more traditional um just plus plus minus uh five of you and the usual suspects. Five of you and the the usual suspects plus minus a vast and that succeeded. And that was a that was a stage four or stage Yeah, it was only stage four. Only stage four. And what was the different?

[00:10:45] This was a this is a median survival study. You're not doing overall survival, correct? That was a median survival study. Actually, I don't remember all the details of that one. The the I feel like it was eight more months of median survival. Does that sound about right? That's probably right. Yeah. Yeah. It was it was the first new thing in colon cancer for a while, too. So, people were pretty excited. Now, at this point, I'm in medical school just down the street. I'm at Stanford. And I remember we had a big discussion about this. I'm in my first year of medical school. And the discussion we had in class was,

[00:11:15] I think at the time, Avasten was $100,000 for the treatment, extends median survival by whatever, but I think it was 8 months. The UK said no. The NHS said we are not paying for this. Because at the time the NIH uh pardon me, the NHS had this $100,000 quality adjusted life-year hurdle. Yeah. So they were, which is understandable, right? That's how you throttle supply side economics. They said, "Look, we can't pay for a drug. We can't pay more than $100,000 for an incremental year of quality adjusted life here. This is only giving you eight months." That's why I know it was less than 12. And so the NHS flatly said, "We're not paying for this." And I do believe people in the UK could pay out of pocket for it. You can get it out of pocket, but not through the National

[00:11:56] Health Service. That's right. People in Canada could not because you couldn't have private insurance in Canada, though. You could come to the US for treatment. And so, of course, this just became a great topic of discussion for med school, you know, freshmen. Um, what was your thought at the time of, you know, have we moved the needle enough?

[00:12:14] How do we think about the economics of this? I had a a lot of different reactions. first of all with a vest and it was the first time I remember reading and I think it was one of those curtain raisor um things in the Wall Street Journal for the breast cancer study it and the the title of the headline was um avasin might help breast cancer patients but can they afford to take it and I was shocked that it was the first time I had read and as long as I had been at Janentech um that somebody couldn't afford one of our drugs like that that instead of saying oh isn't that cool toxin herptin avasten it was too much money and that felt really important to me and really uh um not good. Uh we had as a company a philosophy that no patient should go without any of our drugs because of an inability to pay. So we had a bunch of patient um uh what do you call those patient support programs? whatever. Um, so we had a bunch of different things in place. So I knew we had those programs, but that doesn't help the patients in the UK and it doesn't help the overall cost because we're actually supplementing, but the cost is still really high. And we started to have a lot more discussion at the executive committee about the price and how we would think about it and how we would price the drugs. Um, because that was, like I say, that was not um, uh, not good. [Music]
