[00:00:01] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia this podcast my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness full stop and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level at the end of this episode i'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to peteratiamd.com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode [Music] my guest this week is john arnold john is probably the guy that'll go down in history as the most successful natural gas trader of all time and we spend the first part of this episode explaining that story and you might think well what does that have to do with anything well it's only by understanding how john came to amass a fortune of billions of dollars trading natural gas can you understand the second part of this discussion which is how at the age of about 37 or 38 he shut it all down and turned all of his attention to the full-time craft slash business slash art of philanthropy john's philanthropy is as serious as his natural gas trading and his foundation arnold ventures which he is the co-chair of along with his wife laura focuses on really the hardest social problems imaginable and in this episode john discusses at great length where philanthropy fits into the broader picture of the non-profit sector differentiating it from charity and how that fits into even the broader umbrella of public or government spending and even private spending and it's only by understanding that lens that you can really understand how someone like john thinks about deploying the types of resources they do which are legion to be clear the foundation currently spends about 400 million dollars a year in grants and john's goal is to basically spend their entire fortune in their lifetime solving very hard problems problems like criminal justice reform health policy reform k-12 reform public finance things like that we obviously don't go nearly as deep as i would love to go into all of these topics and yet somehow this podcast managed to be probably two and a half hours if not slightly more which certainly leaves ample room for a part two of this at some point in time i guess one thing i would say about this is i'm obviously fascinated by this topic and could sit here and talk about natural gas trading forever if that subject matter isn't that interesting to you what i would suggest is paying close attention to the time stamps in your podcast player you'll probably want to listen to the first part of this because it's i think john's background in growing up and his card trading business his baseball card trading business i think that stuff is really important to kind of understand john's mentality you may actually want to skip his career where he goes from college to work at enron and don't worry he's one of the good guys at enron and then you may want to sort of skip to the part where he decides to shut his own hedge fund down and instead focus on philanthropy again i'll leave it up to you but i guess the point i want to make is i wouldn't be put off by the fact that if you're not interested in natural gas you won't find this episode interesting i think this episode is interesting start to finish but there may be some people who only find one part in string or another so so just pay attention to where that is so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with john arnold [Music] hey john awesome to sit down with you i'm bummed we are not able to do this in person because anytime we sit down in person it is a long and fruitful discussion where i just feel like i'm learning at a geometric rate but nevertheless i'm excited that we're finally getting to sit down and talk because there's so many things on my mind now a lot of people listening to this podcast will not really know who you are and i've struggled to think about the best way to introduce you so i thought one of the funniest ways to introduce you is to do so through the tweet that you have pinned at the top of your page so remind me your handle on twitter is is it john arnold foundation john arnold foundation yeah okay and what is it that you have pinned at the very top of that so it's essentially that i've been called the next koch brother by the far left and i've been labeled the next george soros for by the far right and i think i write that i'm an equal opportunity special interest pot stirrer and i think it does label me a couple ways first is our actions at the foundation which has been kind of in its current form for about 10 years have led to getting into a lot of squabbles with both the left and the right and at times it's been frustrating at times it's been liberating but it has brought a lot of conflict which one doesn't normally think about when you think about philanthropy and a philanthropist about having conflict and fights and battles with a lot of these issues and that's generally been a component of our work not by design but by necessity and then i think the second part of it that i like is that we don't approach all problems with the same ideology i think problems are different problems are complex and the type of solution for each problem is different so we don't say that the free market is the right answer for everything don't say government's the right answer for everything but it depends on the makeup of the problem the actors the market failures etc as to what the right solution is and therefore over the years have managed to make mad both the left and the right and sometimes simultaneously and by extension i think there are many times that the right and the left also think you are doing the greatest work on earth i mean i think that's the corollary of that which is there are times when you are in lockstep agreement with both sides as well correct yes although whenever not simultaneously they tend to be louder whenever you're in conflict with them than when they're showing appreciation yeah i think part of how we've chosen issues to work on is we're looking for these system problems that have a lot of impact in people's lives where the two sides the left and the right have historically been divided for some reason and that they're starting to come together like there's a reason why there can be a solution that's viable today that wasn't viable five years ago or ten years ago and that ends up being a component of almost every issue we work on is that the left and the right are coming together and so we need to be able to work with both sides and so we've tried to tamp down the politics both personally and professionally over the years and try to see in the venn diagram of things the left will support and the things the right will support even if it's for different reasons or different motivations let's explore those territories and see what can be done and i think we're going to explore one of those in greater detail perhaps than others which will be criminal justice but currently the foundation i know focuses very heavily on health policy public finance platforms and criminal justice and i think at least one of those and i don't know why i just personally find criminal justice to be such an important one maybe we'll come back to it because it is one where i think maybe the left and right have a different ultimate motivation for establishing it but the solutions can certainly benefit society and both sides let's take a step back because to put the magnitude of your philanthropy in scale the foundation is deploying what type of assets per year can you put some numbers to this for people we give about 400 million a year the assets in the foundation are a little over two billion and then we have a couple other giving vehicles specifically at daf we contribute money every year as well so we have a high spend rate but one of our philanthropic intent is to give away the vast majority of our money during our lifetimes yeah and you're very young john you're in your mid-40s you and your wife laura have been at this as you said since you're in your 30s and yeah you're sort of on a mission to spend this enormous sum of money during your lifetime that's something i want to come back to because it's also not a typical path to philanthropy many people are thinking about serious philanthropy at a slightly later stage of their life let's start with the first half of the story which is where did this money come from you didn't have a trust fund to my recollection right i did not i did not so where did you grow up i grew up in dallas in a very boring great upper-middle-class lifestyle in dallas went to dallas public schools ended up going to vanderbilt well let's go before vanderbilt what was your first business first business so probably mowing lawns i was sitting around one summer and said i want to make some money so what can a 12 year old do to try to make a dollar not much and so went knocking on every neighbor's door and tried to find a lawn demo and realized that everybody either cut it themselves or had a lawn service already set up and so that wasn't going to be my path to riches and then kind of around age 14 i ended up getting into the baseball card business pretty actively so this was right around 1988 89 90 when the sports court business was taking off and i had a small collection at the time but i always thought of it more as a asset rather than a collectible that i wanted to put on my desk and look at every day and so the first experience was just renting a table at a local trade show for 30 and going and putting a lot of the collection on the table and trying to sell it and again the sports card business was booming and so came home with maybe a hundred dollars from the 30 dollar investment now of course the cost of goods sold was didn't really factor that in maybe that was a sunk cost at the time but it started getting me interested in this as a potential business and i kind of quickly figured out i didn't want to be spending my weekends sitting at the local trade fair and couldn't i played highly competitive soccer so i had things to do on the weekend but there was a wholesale market that didn't require as much time and so this was really kind of again during the start of the bulletin boards of ways where people would transact and there was a small bulletin board of baseball card dealers where they would do the wholesale trading and the market was so volatile at the time if a particular player went on a good streak for two weeks that card would get hot especially in the region he played and you'd start seeing number one volatility in prices and second and geographic differentiation in prices so the market for hockey cards was very strong in the northeast and in canada a little michigan they would sell them across the nation now the guys that bought them in texas there wasn't much of a local market so i could go buy the hockey cards there ship them up to a dealer in new york and make a few dollars and that few dollars i would then reinvest and do it more than the sports card business was going parabolic at the time and so kind of one thing led to another and i ended up spending a couple summers just kind of full time on this baseball card really geographic arbitrage and information arbitrage that i would have a sense of who the best buyer was for every product wherever they were in the united states or even into canada and would go around and try to find any bargains i could in the texas oklahoma louisiana tri-state area going to do day trips down to houston and go to the big fairs down here would go canvas all the dealers and that was really my first business and how are you able to drive around so young this was pretty unusual for a kid your age to be able to track that circle of geography right it was i got my driver's license at a young age i think it was at 14 my father at the time was going through an illness he had crohn's disease through his life and kind of a chronic condition that especially in my teen years became a bit debilitating for him and so i was able to get i forget what the name of that particular license was but because there was a kind of family hurdle family handicap that i was able to start driving when i was 14. did you know what the word arbitrage actually meant when you were conducting it great question and i don't remember can you explain to people i mean you've effectively explained it in concept because it's such a big part of your ultimate business can you explain it more formally and technically to people i would describe arbitrage as taking advantage of price differences with little to no risk i think true arbitrage is no risk where you bought it for one and you've sold it at two and you've taken no risk in doing so in reality there's always a little bit of risk and so by knowing that the market in new york valued something at twenty dollars and it was trading in texas at fifteen dollars i could take advantage of what i call geographic arbitrage there that the market in in texas was different from the market in new york now of course today with the internet a lot of those arbitrages and inefficiencies pricing and efficiencies have gone away or have been recalling the trade armed out and so now you see the high frequency traders trying to make a hundredth of a penny on a share of stock and have huge incentive to do so and do so at massive volume but it's like buying and selling same item with little to no risk which is a theme we'll obviously come back to at length so you go to vanderbilt you studied if i recall economics yes econ and math did you have a sense of what you wanted to do when you were finished college i remember reading liars poker and i think barbarians at the gate both classic books about wall street and although growing up in dallas with my mom as a accountant my dad as a corporate lawyer i didn't have a sense as to what wall street was except through these books except by reading wall street journal every day and it seemed like that was the biggest game around i got drawn to that game or the desire to enter that game and so my goal throughout college was to get the job and the classic post-college analyst job at a big wall street bank so then how did that pan out and i also recall from our discussions that you blazed through college i think you got your degree in three years by taking summer classes and just being kind of maniacally focused on your degree is that right yeah take 18 hours every semester did summer school one summer came in with some credits and i was the guy that was trying to get out of there and into the game as quickly as possible every day i was at college it was one less day that i had to be in the game and i think my grades probably reflected that i was not academically focused either in high school or in college i think academics came relatively easy to me so it didn't instill great work ethic at school but i just wanted to move on it was a task to complete to get me to the next stage so do you start interviewing for a bunch of wall street firms when you're in your senior year or junior year i guess i did so at the time vanderbilt was probably a tier lower than it's considered today as a school and the investment banks didn't do much recruiting there so there was maybe one or two and some of the regional banks and then i was able to talk my way into a couple interviews but i didn't get those jobs so i was a bit crushed here's what i want to do and i got things that were close to that working at the regional investment bank and then one of the jobs i got which i thought was closest to what i wanted to do to being in that game was at the company enron and enron at the time was in this transformation trying to become essentially an investment bank to the energy industry and specifically the natural gas and electricity industry what year was that so i started at that job in 95 1995. so at 95 nobody knows enron they're a pretty unsexy company right correct they're basically doing disintermediation like their market making on energy and that's about it they're not this darling of wall street that they would become before their fall is that do i have my era right right it was historically a pipeline company and over the decades natural gas which went from a highly regulated business and all the troubles associated with trying to regulate a commodity right that you end up having these huge booms and busts way too much supply or way too little supply was deregulated and that deregulation ended in 1992 and that was really the emergence of enron as it became the late stage company was that previous to then you had the pipeline was responsible for providing the merchant services to the buyer and seller so the producer of gas would sell to the pipeline and then the pipeline would transport the gas and sell it to the customer it was viewed that this was negative because it was pipelines or natural monopolies frequently and so the services and the costs of those services were too high and so 92 they deregulate and here's enron as the gas merchant only because they become relevant later in the story so was ken lay the ceo at that time of deregulation and when you came on board or was jeff skilling there at that point in time not that you would have had any interaction with those guys as a lowly yeah first year guy so ken lay was chairman ceo shortly after i joined and joined i think may of 95 there had been two aspects of the company i had the historical pipeline business and then it had this new is called investment bank side and there was what i later came to realize was the great decision point for the company was who was going to be the number two at enron was it going to be the head of the pipeline business or was it going to be jeff skilling who is the head of the energy bank and so shortly after i joined jeff was promoted up and rich kinder ended up leaving and starting kinder morgan and obviously that promotion was based just as much on perhaps who they were as the direction that the company was going to go in right i think this was a trend in corporate america then was go asset light so get rid of your big assets coca-cola spins off its bottling business they just become the seller of this europe because that's wider on assets but your return on equity is higher if you have fewer assets and so that was the direction of corporate america generally and the one that enron took so i love that you show up in may of 95 not even taking a month off like any other kid would and what is your first job at enron where do they stick you it's very rare for someone at enron and even someone at an investment bank to be put on the trading floor there's just mistakes are expensive on the trading floor and so they don't want the kid that's a few days out of college that would be the equivalent of we're going to take kids out of medical school and you're going to get to start operating even simple operations without supervision that would be catastrophic organ transplants your first thing right right but i had expressed interest on the trading side when i went through the interview process and they called me in april and said a couple people recently left our oil trading group if you can store it immediately you can start in trading and i said well i graduate in 10 days how about 12 days from now i'll be there and so i literally graduated drove from nashville to houston that weekend and that monday show up at work in the oil trading group at enron so what did that mean what did an oil trader do without as much supervision or experience as maybe you would ideally want of a trader right so i certainly was not trading i was kind of an assistant on the desk which meant doing a lot of spreadsheets of running analytical studies and correlation studies building models getting lunch doing all the things that first years do right trying to learn the business and at what point did your bosses there start to realize that this kid that just came out of vanderbilt a year younger than everybody else has a knack for this game or maybe asked another way when did you first realize you had a knack for it quickly i looked back at all the good timings and kind of good decisions that went into my career and one of them was i found the perfect job for my skill set as my first job and i think that's pretty rare and it happened kind of by accident could have very easily ended up a merger as an acquisition investment banker at merrill lynch but i ended up trading commodities at a relative upstart of a company that was just the perfect spot for my skill set so tell me a little bit more about that so oil is a very complicated thing gas perhaps less so at least at the time were those two viewed as the same trading desk at enron or did you shuttle back and forth between them and find yourself eventually at gas enron by its nature was always a gas company it was gas focused the oil group was small it was kind of the red-headed stepchild it didn't make much money it was necessary because some customers wanted to transact on oil with the same company that they were doing their gas transactions with but it was always this small group so then how did you work up the ranks in natural gas trading and when did you actually start to go from modeling to actually making some trades and by extension then earning enron some money so early 1996 i was supposed to be on a formal rotation six months on one desk six months on a different business within enron and kind of rotate four rotations over two years and then go back to business school and after six months i think the team there liked me and i liked being there and kind of got made in to be an exception so i didn't have to rotate but kind of shortly thereafter one of the traders i was speaking earlier about mistakes are costly in the trading side and there was an older gentleman who made a mistake kind of did a trade that ended up going bad and they reorganized the whole group and the new boss came up and i worked for him for a couple months and one day he pulls me aside and says i have to blow up this group i like you it's not going to be good for your career to be here you need to find a different group and he gave me two options one was go to london and work in the oil group there or go downstairs and work in the natural gas trading group and as a 21 year old getting offered an expat package to go to uk it was extraordinarily tempting because i think i'm going back to business school anyway and it was a hard decision but i realized the core of this company is natural gas that's where i need to be that i need to learn that and so i went downstairs and started natural gas and that was on its own just very fortuitous timing i spoke about in 1992 was when the full deregulation happened the winter of 96 was the first time that natural gas prices really blew out it was extremely cold winter and all the historical relationships that gas had just completely changed and so going down there i knew nothing about gas but people who had spent their career in gas wasn't sure if they knew anything about gas either they knew i had the fundamentals about the physical molecules but what the historical pricing relationships were it was a whole new game so i went down there knowing nothing but it felt like the whole industry was trying to figure out what does the world of natural gas look like today going forward given everything's changed how did you rise through those ranks there because that's a pretty interesting situation where it's not necessarily the person with the most historical knowledge that's going to bring the most value it's probably the person who can learn the quickest spot patterns the quickest and basically morph to a new environment right so my first job in the netgas division was they put me as an assistant trader with a gentleman who had expertise on the physical side of the business didn't know anything about trading but he knew natural gas and i knew nothing about natural gas but knew something about trading and was good with numbers and and they essentially put the two of us together and said you guys go figure this out work together and run this book and so that was my first real trading job where although i was an assistant trader on the book but where i was involved in the trading at this time enron started to become a darling and it was certainly within the energy side and within the pipeline business had become this darling its stock was higher than all other stocks so every other company was trying to figure out how do i be more like enron so what's the easy way to be more like enron is go higher enron people go hire someone kind of mid-level give them a promotion and a raise and have them come over to your company and so that was happening all the time which was great for the young guy at enron because the guy above you was leaving to go get a better job and so it was an environment where if you could prove that you were responsible and that you were smart you could rise much faster than you could at a mature company or in a mature industry and so that next four years for me was really the roller coaster where every nine months or so i would get a promotion again like much faster than i would have gotten had i been at a more mature company and ended up by the time i was 25 i was the head natural gas trader at the largest natural gas trading company in the industry it's almost hard to believe that that's possible especially now when i look at what i was doing when i was 25 right right it is almost hard to believe it was a company that was very merit focused i think by giving out that responsibility it was fantastic to work at a place like that i think it ended up being the downfall of the company as well as there just wasn't the controls on people who were given too much responsibility too much of the company's balance sheet to use without their adequate controls on it what was the stress like that you felt just in a self-imposed manner i mean were you if you're 25 years old and just give me a sense of as a head trader at enron with the largest gas trading company we're talking in the billions of dollars worth of potential profits and losses here correct in a given day i was trading billions of dollars of notional value of gas so a lot of it was trying to buy it two dollars trying to sell it at two dollars and a half penny for enormous volumes and so enron was the largest market maker it was the largest speculative trader of gas that had the most customer business coming through it and so being at the center of that being the head trader there it was just from the moment you sat down in the morning until about three four o'clock it was just non-stop trading someone would bring food and put it in front of me i'd run to the bathroom and run back internet trading was starting to take off then so there was still the trading in the pit on the trading floor like trading places style so there was that there was trading that was happening on the internet there was trading that was happening with other people within the company that they had customers or somebody needed to put a hedge on because of another deal that they did and so it was just non-stop action and the stress level was intense i think i'm very good at handling stress the stress level was intense to a point of not being healthy and i think this is true of many trading floors especially back in in those days i think it's why traders generally have short lives treating lives trading careers it's hard for the body to handle that level of stress for decades and decades were you seeing this creep out into other areas of your life did you have difficulty sleeping were you able to exercise in the periods of time like presumably in the evenings would be your only window to exercise were you eating like crap i mean you're a very fit healthy guy today is this what john arnold looked like when he was the head of trading no i didn't realize it kind of looking back probably after after i eventually lost the weight that i gained during those years and cut down on some of the drinking started exercising a lot more looking back at the health of my life it was a bit telling even like going and putting on some of the clothes that i used to wear and seeing how i'm so differently built today than i was back then you had to find some method to relieve stress and unfortunately for a lot of traders that's pretty negative behaviors right it's more drinking more partying more gambling or whatever exactly exactly it is not a healthy lifestyle as i grew up i was able i learned how to handle the stress better i got tired of the drinking and partying and gambling and especially kind of as i got into my 30s as i got married as i had kids that all starts changing but it also can be a reason why people start to get repulsed by that career is the lifestyle that doesn't necessarily go along with it but oftentimes does i want to go back to just something before we leave this topic which is did you get a sense of an addiction to trading because i've spoken with many friends of mine who are have at some point in their life been in that in that field and for some of them the addiction the high the physiologic response that they get to a good trade is easily on par with what the most indebted gambler feels when they're sitting at a blackjack table or with the drive that someone has to drink who is so disproportionately dysregulated by alcohol i mean did you personally get that or was it more of an intellectual exercise for you how much of this was just purely limbic system dopamine surging versus more of a calculus so i had definitely seen traders where they had that dopamine aspect to their trading personality i've gotten the question many times why were you a good trader why were you considered one of the best traders in the market and it's always been hard for me to answer i think part of it is i had this emotional detachment from the business so if i was having one of my best days or having one of my worst days if you walked by me you couldn't tell it was just 100 focus on executing the process right so my views would change but the process of how you look at the market can easily get swayed by emotions whenever and there's the phrase fear and greed that drives a lot of price trends in financial assets you're either greedy or you're fearful and that's driving your behavior and to the extent i think that you can eliminate those two emotions from the trading and from the process you get better and you know me well enough you you wouldn't describe me as an emotional guy right so does that mean it was natural for you john that this superpower because that is probably a trading superpower is that something you had to cultivate or spend any energy training in yourself was it the product or byproduct of something in your childhood or was it simply as innate to you as your hair color and height i think it was just innate i think this is how i was born and that detachment from the emotions that doesn't affect my decision-making process and so i think that's one of the two superpowers what super powers that i had i think i also fell perfectly on the confidence spectrum and i say that it takes a certain amount of arrogance to be a trader because the market's usually right and to be a trader you have to say i think i'm smarter than the market here i think the market is wrong i think i am right so it takes that arrogance in order to be willing to put on a trade and i've seen people just get paralyzed where they just say they're so concerned about the downside and of being wrong that they can't do anything so you have to be arrogant but you can be too arrogant and that's been the destroyer of many trading careers is if you stick with it i am right the market is wrong then you're gonna blow up and so it's how do you have the right level where it's like i'm confident in my view on this but i know i might be wrong that's amazing when we get to talking about the second half of your career professionally which is now your full-time work in philanthropy especially the type of bets that you make and the scope and magnitude of problems that you go after i think those two traits that made you i think most people would argue the greatest natural gas trader of all time probably serve you just as well in your philanthropy would you agree i think you said that well the notion of going in saying i think we're right about this but it might not work or we might be wrong it's going to write down our theory and test it along the way and see if it's playing out the way it should and not get wedded to this theory that everything we're doing in the foundation is evidence-based but the evidence is never perfect so we're taking the best available information and saying how much risk should society be willing to take to test a different idea so bringing the enron chapter of your career to a close help me understand how you and your colleagues under your direction are making so much money and yet by 2001 enron is going bankrupt how are those things happening simultaneously i don't have the right answer for that i knew things in the company in other divisions i had friends that worked in other divisions we would go to have a beer after work i would hear their stories about some crazy deal that their division was doing that they thought was stupid i would hear stories about this but our day to in the trading group was just so focused on the one activity that we didn't have firsthand knowledge of any of that it was always kind of hearsay but the trading group was making so much money that there was a thought i think that could actually see this whenever earnings would get released that the trading group would could support the other divisions until they stopped making the dumb mistakes and became profitable on their own i can't speak exactly about why the trading group was making so much money there were some really dumb ideas in retrospect when you look at the documentaries i mean i remember reading the book the smartest guys in the room in 2006 or whenever it came out and being like completely fixated on this thing but the whole broadband water idea the indian power plant that didn't seem to make any sense i mean there were a lot of ideas that and again i'm not saying this like i would have known at the time these were dumb ideas i'm sure i wouldn't have um so hindsight of course offers that luxury but i mean these were really really half baked at best right it's always easy in retrospect yeah i think the disintermediation which not only anyone was doing but was a broad theme in the business world at the time was real and the investment community was valuing companies who were disintermediating in the same way that they do today in the tech sector there's a lot of value to be created if you can just intermediate a business chain i think enron trying to approach it from the commodity side and trying to do it with water trying to do it with the electricity doing it globally when places where the quality of law and of intellectual protections isn't what it was in america and then having the culture of never being able to admit failure that existed not only in enron but again in many other companies at the time as well meant that whenever mistakes were made there wasn't the admittance to wall street that this was a mistake and were going to change it was swept under the rug and enron the process of bankruptcy kind of happened so quickly because all these financial businesses which at the time enron had morphed into a financial business is completely contingent upon having the faith of your creditors having the faith of wall street and once wall street loses faith in you and refuses to fund you on a day the business is toast and that's what happened and it happened as you said precipitously i mean i could certainly sit here for another four hours and talk to you about mark to market and all of that but i think we'll let the listeners who are really interested in that go back and either read the books watch the documentaries or go deeper on that let's bring it back to you which is at what point do you realize your career at enron is going to be cut short so despite the fact that you've had your head down you've been i think you could make the case the single most profitable human at that company if the company goes under you're out of a job when was that apparent to you and then what were your next moves and how did you consider the decisions you had to make it happened so quickly that there was damage control that i could see from my perspective in the company and my perspective was sitting at a desk with two phones in my ear for most a day didn't get a much of a sense of what was going on outside of what natural gas prices were ticking up so it happened so quickly that there wasn't much to be done from the trading side perspective this was all kind of all those decisions end up in the finance side you know cfo's office of how do we raise money and so when it finally kind of november of 2001 was kind of shortly after 9 11 and that caused some havoc in the financial markets and then that's when wall street was not going to give you a second chance in that environment and enron arguably didn't deserve one and so it all happened so fast that whenever enron lost credit worthiness in the business then it just it was over business over there was some time spent trying to find a credit worthy jv partner to come in and no one would contribute the intellectual assets and someone would contribute new money and keep the trading operation going because it had been so profitable if it was just swept away in bankruptcy it was a loss of a lot of potential value to what was then the estate of enron the creditors of enron and so there was a lot of focus on trying to cut that deal and a deal was eventually cut with the new york bank and i looked around and i looked at the deal and kind of for the first time stepped back and started thinking what do i want to do with my life and that's where the decision was i don't want to go with this entity i have different views on how this business should proceed in the future and i want to go try it somewhere else so you take your bonus check you take some money from a few other folks and you set up your own hedge fund in early o2 right yeah mid mid 2002 again you're the perfect guy to do it because you're not too stressed about it you've got a proven track record i guess you're somewhat toxic because even though you come from the part of enron that is fully legitimate you still have that name on your back did that hurt you when you were i mean were you trying to raise capital how did that factor into your hedge fund so it was an interesting time to say the least so right after enron declared in the first quarter 2002 i was getting calls by a lot of people people i didn't know saying if you are going to do your own thing i have interest in investing with you and my intent was to try to raise 50 million dollars of day one capital and just start there and let it grow organically and increase over time and i thought i'd be cutting people back i thought fundraising would be very easy i was there's going to be 200 million dollars of interest and i was going to cut everybody you can invest 25 of what you want to second quarter 2002 dramatic change this is when a lot of the investigations into enron start to bear fruit if you will and the headlines come out and the headlines are let's say every week there's a new scandal that's coming out and now the people who had called me one they don't know if the prophets that were posted in the new york times whether those are real or not whether i was going to jail or not all these questions and so everybody who was banging on my door to invest pulls back but meanwhile i've rented office space i've hired employees i've bought computers and telecom systems and i i got to move forward i have almost no money to do this now i ended up starting in august of o2 with eight million dollars of capital some of which was mine and i had two outside investors so talk about pressure 8 million of assets under management is not exactly what you had in mind as far as you know basically the only way you're going to grow your fund at this point is by organic returns you're going to have to return your way into more money you're not going to be out there fundraising right so one of the things after n11 bankrupt is wall street started looking at all the copycat enrons so all the other pipeline companies and electric utilities who had started out these merchant businesses or trading businesses and wall street essentially says we're not funding those businesses anymore there's too much risk and so what happened was that there is great need for risk intermediation and for risk warehousing in the business and half of the largest players are out of that business over the first six months of 2002 and so the market became incredibly inefficient and was willing to pay for the task of intermediation at a very high rate and so just by setting up the computer there was going back to the arbitrage it was very low risk or arbitrage type trades that shouldn't exist in a normal functioning market that existed for that next year just because the market players had been so decimated so the first month it was up 36 on a percentage basis is high on an actual dollar basis and made three million dollars but also to put a point on what you just said a second ago you're up 36 in a month at a very low risk so it's not just the value it's the value at risk here that matters exactly value at risk i like the term well i was a mckinsey guy remember right so we think a lot about var as well so yeah so then second month i'm up 33 third month i'm up 38 and i'm sending the notes out the investor notes out to everybody that was in my rolodex that expressed interest and all of a sudden three months in i'm up what's the compound rate price 150 percent in three months and so some of the people start calling me back and saying hey maybe i'll send you some money and so those first few years it was doing a lot of the low risk trading to create the base and this upward trend in profitability and then layering on some speculative trading on top of that and i was able to play bigger than my asset size because i had this upward trend in profitability if i was wrong on my market call i wouldn't be decimated because i'm still making money on the market making arbitrage side of the business your spec market initially was actually quite small you switched those 10 years later you're basically doing the opposite but at the beginning it was an amazing you described it to me in the past as i think the perfect time to be a natural gas yes based on that inefficiency yeah it was just risk reward it was don't even bother about taking risk yeah there's so much free money in the market by providing that service just do that you can think about the business as a bundled product one was the market making providing liquidity and getting paid for that service warehousing some risk and the second was trying to make a call on where natural gas prices were going next there's some synergy of having those together there's a lot of synergy in having those together but that's the two strands of the business and most people myself included when they think about gas trading are only thinking about the speculative business which is my former countryman brian hunter very very famously blew up in fall of 2006 a hedge fund called america at the time was probably one of the biggest blow ups in all of energy we'll come to that because you were on the other side of that trade if i recall but it's those stories that get most people thinking about that's how you make or lose money in natural gas trading but you were doing something you know i always talk about risk to people i sort of explain it as a 2x2 are you picking up bitcoins are you picking up pennies and are you doing it in front of a bulldozer are you doing it in front of a tricycle you want to think through that two by two very clearly it might be worth picking up a bitcoin in front of a bulldozer but it is not worth picking up a penny in front of a bulldozer or a bullet train or something like that and so you sort of have to understand that's this idea of risk and return so at what point i mean i just want to kind of go back to john the guy who's on this ride that seems hard to believe but anybody who's made the type of money you've made in life goes from being i mean i guess i'm asking this question in a weird way is there a moment at which you realize you're not going to have to worry about money anymore i don't know what that dollar amount is and i'm guessing for different people it's a different amount i've had people tell me that this is going to sound ridiculous to but i've had people explain to me that until you have 600 million dollars in your bank you will never feel totally secure which i find that ridiculous and i disagree with that idea though i will never have 600 million in my bank but there must be some number at which you realize oh my life and the life of my family is going to be very different do you remember that occurring for you yeah so that first year was remarkable and for many reasons but one of the things that happened was that the gas market ended up being very tight that demand was high and supply wasn't keeping up and so the outright level of inventories was okay but the trend was that we were drawing inventories or not putting gas in the ground like we should have been doing and again had the market been more efficient than i think other traders other traders did notice this and others put it on but there were some trades that were i thought were very misvalued from a risk award perspective and that was that if we were to have a cold winter that first went 2002 2003 if that winter was cold the gas market could experience some significant shortages and the price spikes that would correspond to those shortages now the weather event was maybe a one out of five probability but i think the bets were pricing them at that it was one out of fifty and so as i'm making money on market making and providing liquidity i was putting on some of these trades just putting a little bit of money into this trade at various points and that winner ended up being the one in five weather event and there was the two-day stretch in late february february oh three right that's like three yeah one of the three highest gas prices we've had in the last 20 years right i think so yeah it all starts to blur together now but you had this massive spike in price i guess i think approximately doubled in if two days and that was the day the fund also kind of more than doubled in those two days in terms of of assets and that was the day was like i feel rich for the first time i am set for life today did you call anybody i remember calling my mom pretty much saying those words that we're set we have financial security now forever regardless of what happens so doing the math you're in your late 20s at this point did you have any sense at that moment that you were going to be out of the game in 10 years and full time working as a philanthropist or was that not a clear part of your vision yet i always recognized the limited social value of trading i think there is a need for someone to provide risk warehousing and liquidity to markets but trying to tell the story about how i was adding value or contributing to society was hard and that always bothered me so when i first started getting my first hundred thousand dollar bonus back when i was at enron i shortly thereafter was at a supermarket and i see a magazine that says top 50 non-profits in america and i pick it up and throw it into my my grocery basket and take it home and immediately turn to the education section i think a lot of younger philanthropists a lot of people from the finance industry get drawn to k-12 education one of the organizations was based in houston it was kip hip charter schools and so i called them up and got scheduled to go do a tour went did a tour they had no idea who i was at the time i was i wasn't a rich guy back then but i came home and and wrote them a check a five figure check and i get a call from the founder who had not met on the on that original tour a couple days later and this was back when kind of five figures was really significant to the organization and he said thank you and who are you and i need to cultivate this relationship and that was the start of my very long journey thinking about k-12 education in the country and so in this time 2002-2003 i was getting more interested in it and my check size was going up but it was something i thought about one percent of the time so as your hedge fund is growing and growing and growing at what point are you now getting the attention of basically everybody who wants to come in and you're doing the opposite you're probably starting to force distributions at some point there was a trading magazine that came up with a list of highest paid traders and that was from specifically from the hedge fund world where most of the highest paid traders existed and it was not only what was their return on your investment in the fund but what was your incentive fees and kind of trying to estimate that and they would create these lists of top 100 for the year and i don't remember what year it was but somehow they got a hold of my returns and started doing the math on it and figured out that i was not only won the top 100 but i think top five that year and that was the first time on a broadcast to the world that i was making big money but also was a broadcast to the rest of the industry that something's going on in natural gas and all the other hedge funds should it was a signal to them go figure out what's going on over there how's he making this much money and see if there's something for us to do so during that time as will happen in any market whenever there's kind of above market returns going on in a field new entrants come in and that's certainly what happened during that time i made a very deliberate decision that i was going to keep the focus of the business narrow which i wanted to be the best in the world at north american natural gas and power trading that was the business didn't want to trade oil didn't want to trade natural gas stocks or natural gas bonds didn't want to trade agriculture stick to our expertise don't try to build an empire here just do this one thing and i think by doing so i think it by keeping focus and it allowed us to achieve that mission of being the best in the field i think it also started it put a natural limit as to the amount of assets that we could manage so we just couldn't be too big relative to the market and the amount of money that we were making was significant and so we started sending back money to investors what was the greatest you allowed your aum to swell to to allow yourself to stay so narrowly focused at the peak it got to about six billion dollars that's a staggering sum of money there are lots of hedge funds that have ballooned to 20 and 30 billion in assets under management and your point is yeah that sounds great and you're going to collect a lot of fees on that if you're the fund manager but you may be spreading yourself too thin into areas that you don't have the deepest deepest domain expertise right from very shortly after i started i was the largest investor in the fund and i was in it for the return on my money that's how i manage the fund and that's how i would pitch it to central investors was i think this is a great investment opportunity this is where i want my money this is the risk where i am on the risk spectrum for my money and if you want to join on that journey i'd be happy to have you but i'm going to run a risky business and you have to be prepared for that going on because i wasn't in it to make the management fees that's not how i wanted to that wasn't my business right right if you're more than 50 of the aum you can't make money on yourself you can't make fees on your own money right right so it was it was always driven by how do i want my money managed what do i think is a good investment for me and then if other people want to put money alongside that's great so by the way i want to go back to one thing talking about the o6 amaranth trade explain for people that given the historical significance of that was pretty significant and the fallout of that has reverberated for many years as far as the amount of money that was lost in things who was brian hunter what did he do so well in 2005 how did that speculation sort of go the other way in o6 2005. i hope i get all these facts right my memory gets a little bit cloudy from those days but 2005 was hurricane katrina it came in and caused significant damage on the offshore natural gas production as well as the processing natural gas processing facilities that were onshore louisiana and because of that the price of gas spiked significantly people were short supplies i looked this up yesterday john that is both unadjusted and adjusted for inflation the greatest peak in natural gas pricing of the last i think 30 years that's september 05 right after katrina yeah and after that time i think two things happened first was as ocean temperatures were rising there started to be a belief the number of hurricanes and the intensity of hurricanes and thus the damage from hurricanes to the energy sector and natural gas sector was structurally increasing and second that there would be a great fear amongst any trader to be short during that time period in the hurricane season and if august and september and peak hurricane season so he had done very well in 2005 he was this is brian hunter ryan hunter in 2005 he was long during that time and made a lot of money for his fund and at the time he worked for a fund amaranth advisors which was a macro hedge fund meaning they do everything they trade stocks they trade bonds brian hunter was the natural gas trader for them now in 2005 as i understand it he was by far the most profitable trading desk and trader at a large hedge fund and so he was given a lot more position size or capital to trade with and i think he had the belief that something similar would happen or at least a big scare would happen next year and would cause the same type of move the difference was partially in reaction to the spike in prices that we saw in 2005 it sent the signal to every producer to increase supplies so every producer gets that pricing or every producer puts more money into drilling for gas you start to see that in 2006 that supplies are ramping up and talked about earlier that the supply demand was tight in 2002 supply demand got very loose in 2006 and so the market was just over supplied it was a very bearish market but brian hunter kept this trade on there's a very bullish trade on and kept the prices supported even though the fundamental picture was deteriorating by continuing to buy more and more and more of this one product and put a long story short he distorted the relative values in that market so much it gets told now that the trade was me versus him and that's very not much the case it was the whole market versus him because he was such a large position in this as he started to get into the first the very early part of hurricane season and there was no hurricane and then prices were starting to collapse and he couldn't hold it anymore so he kind of single-handedly that position bankrupted this macro hedge fund and i did well during that trade i think i i may have had on 25 of the opposing position i was very cognizant that it is possible that a hurricane comes and has a short-term price spike and i don't want to blow up if and when that happens so i need to size this appropriately and i don't think he had sized it appropriately given the alternative scenario and that's an interesting thing because it wasn't just that you guys were betting against each other in terms of climate or weather for which i would say three months out that becomes an unwinnable bet nobody can have more or better information on that it's the second order bet that's interesting to me which is okay he's taking a position on climate or weather but it's really you're taking a position on the more important question which is supply and you're saying even if we are hit with a demand shock i believe the market is better able to bear this now than it was in 2005. and ultimately that's really what the bet comes down to it's true a hurricane didn't hit that year and the price collapsed but it's also possible that if a more mild hurricane than katrina had come we probably wouldn't have seen the price shock we saw in 2005. right right the market was was so scared and so people were hesitant people were only going to put on that short trade if they thought the market had already priced that in and i used to think about it as you have this unknown weather event how cold is the winter going to be what's the hurricane situation going to be and you can think about it you have this probability distribution function of the possible outcomes and then think about okay under each outcome how would i think about what fair value is of the commodity at that time and then did your simple math and you come to expected value and that really simplifies you know the process down much too simplistically but that was the type of thought process that would go in is okay if it's 80th percentile hurricane damage what is that if it's 90th percent off it's 99th percentile what if it's 10th percentile right and think about all these and then how's the market price today certainly at that time there were people who weren't allowed to be short there were people who were only going to be short if it was way mispriced relative to expected value and i think that's what got him was that it was already so mispriced to expected value that even had you had this apply shock happen what's the upside now we're already priced for that yep when you explain it that way it's a much sadder story than just two guys betting against weather and one guy's gotta be right and one guy's gotta be wrong you realize that it was probably a bit more of a an error in hubris as well which goes back to your point about maybe being a little too confident in your ability to predict what's going to happen you spent a lot of your time doing research i mean again we've already talked about you having two superpowers but having known you for a while i would add to that list maybe a third superpower which i believe also has come to serve you very well in your philanthropy which is you have an insatiable bordering on pathological obsession for knowing everything and i say that in the kindest way as someone who shares part of that affliction and i remember once you explaining to me some of the details you would study about natural gas pipelines it's like look if i'm going to be the best trader in this commodity i have to know everything i have to know exactly what this pipeline looks like how does it cross this type of part of the country what type of bolt are they using in it here and what happens to it during this type of weather i mean how much of your time went into understanding every piece of the minutia of how this system worked that you were basically going to dominate in terms of arbitrage and speculation so by being a hedge fund structure and not being in the physical business not dealing with customers and dealing with pipelines we were at an information disadvantage going in when we were thinking think about whenever i trade against a counterparty and they're putting on the opposite trade i am what are they thinking what do they know can i replicate as best i can the knowledge that they have so that i can make an educated and confident decision do i want to be on the other side of this bet and to do so we were at an information handicap just in terms of bp had more information that would come through their shop than we did so we had to make it up by having better analysis and knowing where to get third party information and how to analyze that information how to craft better models that described what the past was and thus what the future's going to be and then try to overlay some good smart trading and structuring of trades on top of that to get the above average returns but i think we were always fundamentally focused it was and this came from the days at enron which was the largest physical mover shipper of gas was count the molecules try to count as many molecules as you can where did it come from where did it travel how was it consumed and so you can build a molecule about if you know how every molecule behaved yesterday you can model how those molecules gonna behave tomorrow and how those molecules can behave in six months now you know your confidence level is not as good in the six month model but you can start doing that and then you can start doing the speculative trading on top of it and so i think we probably had the biggest fundamental research department of any competitor in this space at centaurus and that was really what i thought our advantage was was that we're going to invest in the fundamentals more than anybody else is and then overlay that with some good trading you just alluded to something which i i guess i hadn't picked up on before which or at least it just occurred to me now when you said that earlier you said natural gas was easier than oil when you just gave that explanation you talked about being able to count every molecule of gas i suspect that that's what allows an island like north america to be easier to trade gas than oil because we have more insight into where gas is coming from lng was not a big part of gas so gas was being locally produced and consumed it's not like with oil where my god it's coming from everywhere and it's going everywhere right is that a fundamental difference between natural gas and oil trading at least at that time i mean i know natural gas is more complicated now with shale with with liquefied natural gas that can go offshore but is that part of why you made that statement earlier yeah i think there's three main differences that made natural gas a great product to trade one was it was this closed system that you described that the molecules for the most part were just stayed in north america there was a little bit of lng business it was mostly base load so it was easy to predict what those flows were going to be in the future that wasn't a big variable that was going to cause price moves in the future and because it was this closed system you can model it with much better accuracy second was that the deregulation that got the pipelines out of the business and the pipelines had to be third parties that couldn't take ownership of the gas the only service that they could provide was transportation and by doing so they didn't have the pipelines which had the most fundamental information about where the gas came from and where it was going they had to publish all this information in a way that was publicly accessible and they couldn't trade on it so there had to be the chinese wall between the trading group and when you compare that versus oil exxon can own the oil platform in the gulf of mexico stick it on on an excellent ship take it to an exxon owned refinery and put it in exon gas stations and so as an outsider trying to figure out and track those molecules it's impossible and that's why the best most profitable oil traders have to be in the physical business have to be moving molecules and the third is that natural gas because it was a seasonal product you store it during the summer getting ready for the peak winter demand that there was a window of storage that the industry almost required when you go into the winter and there was a window of what it should be when you exit the winter and so twice a year there was a mechanism to get you back close to fair value and if you compare that to a tech stock today have all these debates about some stock there's nothing that necessarily has to get that tech stock back to one's belief of fair value there's not that forcing mechanism and if you're talking about gold there's no forcing mechanism in gold if you have a surplus of gold you're gonna stick it in a safe someplace but with limited storage in natural gas and the need to have a certain amount of storage when you enter the winter it caused that forcing mechanism which got you back to fair value so while price could deviate from fundamental value for parts of the time of the year twice a year it kind of had to go back to that which was great as a fundamental trader there's a lot of commodities where they don't necessarily have to go back to that fair value so the country is entering a recession 2008 2009 you are still staggeringly profitable where at this point in time is your head with respect to philanthropy so we've established the fact that when you were making a hundred thousand dollar bonus as an early trader at enron even before you became head trader you're already spending one percent of your energy thinking about how you want to utilize your wealth down the line but now let's talk 2009 2010 you're almost a decade into running your own fund which will probably go down in time as one of the most profitable hedge funds of all time certainly in this space are you what are you ten percent now thinking about philanthropy i mean how are you now thinking about chapter two of your career yeah so i met my wife in early 2006 and she had moved to houston she was a mergers and acquisitions lawyer and had moved to houston to help start an energy company and spent i forget exactly how long but call it 18 months on that job she and i had started in the meantime we'd gotten married and we're starting to think about what should we do with our lives now this momentous event of marriage what does she want to be doing what do i want to be doing we have the financial resources to do what we want with our time and so she answered that question by saying i don't want to work at the energy company anymore i want to focus on our philanthropic activities which we had both been doing a little bit on the side at this point you know call it 2006 i was spending maybe three percent of my energy on philanthropy and she the same and by 2008 she had gone full-time with our nascent foundation we started hiring a few people and i was starting to spend more of my energy call it 10 15 of my energy on the foundation which became troubling a little bit because it's obviously markets are efficient in the long term the markets are smart the competitors are smart competitors entered you had to keep finding new ways to stay above the competition and one of those was you have to be 100 focused on this job it's too competitive to not be 100 focused and when i went 90 then it got harder when i and if as the preceding years happened and i started thinking more about giving the money away than making more of it that was really the signal to me that i want to be spending my time on the other side of the table and i'm physically and mentally emotionally exhausted with trading natural gas is the only thing i had done as a professional again from a few days after graduating college and here i am 17 years later i'm still doing pretty much the same thing and i want to do something else with my life and so that was 2012 and that's when i decided it's time to shut this down i'm guessing that i mean i've spoken with some of the greatest scientists in the world and not everybody says this but there are some that do that they say they can't stop thinking about what it is they're working on any time they get to a stoplight that's where their mind wanders when they're in the shower that's where their mind wanders is to the problem it's to the questions that they're trying to ask is the problem they're trying to solve is it safe to say that you probably felt the same way until you hit that inflection point absolutely it was was spent more than a decade living breathing every after work go out with other people in the industry and talk about natural gas dream about natural gas i would wake up in the morning first thing you do is check the prices get in the shower think about it what could go wrong what do i want to do today what's the plan and it was just all-encompassing in life i think to be successful in these competitive fields whether it's in health research or in trading you have to give it that 100 focus and if you don't you're going to see it in the results it's just too competitive so was it a hard decision for you then to shut your fun down return the capital to people and become a full-time philanthropist or was it actually quite easy once you accepted i'm no longer giving a hundred percent of my brain power to this other thing it was hard that's who i was as certainly a professional and who i was largely defined as a person as well was as a natural gas trader had been the place where i'd had the most success of anything i had tried to do in my life and so starting in about 2010 i knew this was the decision i needed to make it was hard it was a hard decision to make it got easier because things had changed in the market so if you look at the graph of natural gas prices you see them peaking about july of 2008 maybe late june 2008 and just being on a steady decline and the volatility starts to change as well the shell revolution took the market from one that was ever increasing demand and harder and harder to get the next molecule of gas out of the ground so having to try to balance that through price which becomes very volatile and leads to booms and busts to one that was in perpetual oversupply and kind of bouncing around marginal cost to produce and so the opportunity had changed and so i had given back three billion dollars back to investors and i was at the point where by 2012 i was at i need to give back another 50 down to a billion and a half just the market opportunity is not there and it's hard when you've been playing in vegas with at the 25 table to go back down to the five dollar table it's just like not as emotionally interesting and so that happened i got married we had kids the regulation in the business partially maybe largely due to the brian hunter episodes that had when the price distortions that wasn't good for the market had just become harder and i just lost the focus and my interest in the foundation side and so all these things came together and it still took me two years to really figure out to make that call that it's time it's time to close us up and go find happiness somewhere else i think part of that struggle was i had seen many other people in the industry who had who had had similar thoughts along the years that they wanted to go do something else and a lot of times those people left and couldn't find what to do or couldn't find satisfaction in their lives doing something else and so even though that they were unhappy in the trading business they ended up back in the trading business because they were even more unhappy what the other thing that they had tried to go do and so that was my fear was that a year from when i close up i'm gonna miss it and i'm not gonna find satisfaction in this other thing and then what what do i do then do i am i really to go start it up again and like it took me those 24 months to really get the confidence to say i can find happiness here i can find other things to do and to close it down so talk me through some of those early days then laura has obviously been well up and running she's been on this full time for several years now you both have a great number of interests at the time how do you begin to make that transformation we've already talked a little bit about what the skills are that you brought to bear and again i'd reiterate them as kind of an emotional temperament for it to not let your feelings get in the way of what you're doing the second one being kind of the right amount of confidence to say yeah this is a huge and hard problem but we should go after it but maybe not too much confidence to say we're going to solve this problem no matter what and then i think the third one being probably one that gets overlooked a bit but basically an ability to become an expert in something in a relatively short period of time i mean i think people who are familiar with bill gates just watched the documentary about him and not read much about him you'll realize he's not just a guy that revolutionized the computer industry but when you look at the voracious appetite with which he has explored other topics i mean i've only met bill in person once and i'll share that the subject matter that we were speaking on which was something in my wheelhouse and not his it only took me about 10 minutes to realize i was talking to someone who knew as much about this topic as almost anyone i had spoken with and that's saying something because this is not something you would assume that a person would know a lot about i mean this was at the beginning of discussion i'm using terms that i would use with a lay person and he's like yep yep yep he's like no no you just go straight to shorthand for me and i was like but he wasn't doing it from a place that was anything other than totally genuine you knew that this is a guy who really knew the subject matter again you share that trait which is i don't know that's that allows people i think to have a bigger impact in their philanthropy well i appreciate the comparison but it's not close i agree with i've gotten to know bill over the years and agree with your assessment of him that his breadth and depth of knowledge is something that i have never seen in somebody else and incredibly impressive in that he knows the background and knows the issues of almost anything you can think of in a way that is scary and i am certainly not that way well i will agree to disagree on that john so talk me about the first problem that you decided to turn your attention to once you became a full-time philanthropist as i said i got gotten my start in giving with k-12 education and kind of over the years i've just gotten deeper and deeper into those questions of why does one school have different results from a school down the street serving the very similar population of kids and what's the theory of change in k-12 it is such a massive system that's broken down at the school level and how can we as a country try to get results that we're happier with knowing all the hurdles that go into that and all the factors that go into education and behavior so how does that scale how does those small gems that you see how can you scale that and this is a question i think the education reform movement's been struggling with for decades and and watched that journey and was on the journey along with many other philanthropists of is it small schools is it better principles is it better teachers is it the curriculum is it technology all these things kind of bouncing from one idea to the next trying to find what's the idea that skills and create structural change and so we're still involved in k-12 i think it's it's just the most fundamental issue facing long-term health and viability of this country and when you talk to almost any social service provider they always refer back to education and so i think it's one that we've spent a lot of time thinking about and happy to get into that if you want but it was the first and continues to be a major effort of the foundation and i know that you've worked with as you said others i think city fund has sort of largely a lot of your efforts have morphed into that correct right so i guess i'll give you the theory of change that drives our work of late in k-12 and that's that strong and robust systems of any kind have the attributes of biological evolution right and so in living organisms that's the phenotypic variation you have variants amongst the organisms the differential fitness is there a different rate of survival and reproduction and then the heritability of fitness and i think this is true of any organization is true of businesses it's true of any system and it's true the healthcare system the criminal justice system is true of the school system so you need to have a strong robust system that's getting better over time you need those three traits and the traditional public school system does not have them so if you think of a school district that is a monopoly in its area it doesn't have much variance it might have a school that's spanish emerging and might have a school that's for the talent and gifted it might have another school that's a magnet or something but generally it's same curriculum the same process the same way of hiring of training of trying to develop teachers how your principal development is right you don't have that variation the differential fitness of do things that are working do they grow or do they go away yeah there's no pressure the good stuff in public education there's no natural mechanism for them for that to grow and there's no mechanism that really works in the public school system for it to go away for the things that aren't working to stop and then the readability of traits you need the learning organization aspect of it which anybody will tell you as a school system is not good at and any government monopoly is not good at quality control it's not good at innovation to provide that variance and so the theory with city fund and the theory of our k-12 work is that the school system needs to become a system of schools that the natural role for government is not to be the service provider the natural role should be the regulator and right now those two functions are bundled together into one and no system can regulate itself and too often today i think those systems are structured to regulate themselves and so you don't get that innovation you don't get the quality control and so the vision is and what we saw in in new orleans after katrina was this change of going from the school system to the system of third-party non-profit operators that are given the chance to have the resources and responsibility to educate kids k-12 kids and the theory again if it works well that the parents the kids have real choice get to choose what type of model they want whether it is a immersion program whether they want high discipline or regular discipline whether they want an art school et cetera that demand if you're giving real choice to the kids to the parents that that's the best quality control that can happen and then the government as the regulator needs to make sure that all kids are served because we need to make sure that ideal that every kid is properly served but is largely out of the business of providing the service of education so let's put some numbers to this john more broadly so maybe think of it in terms of gdp how much is private how much is public slash government how much is non-profit what's the approximate breakdown of the dollars that get allocated in the world or in the country i'm sorry along those three divisions of the total economy the private sector is approximately 60 governments approximately 40 percent the philanthropic sector is about two percent now when you take out giving to museums to religious organizations and to the arts in general and religious organizations you get down to about one percent of the economy is philanthropy for social services or social goods okay so you're stripping out basically what i used to call maybe erroneously brick and mortar philanthropy and you're saying sort of 50 of it the 50 that remains is this type of philanthropy that people like you work on people like bill gates works on no it's your it's not just the brick and mortar no so some including like gifts to food banks gifts to the hospital system to build a building oh okay okay this is about one percent of the economy right so one of the things we thought about is what's the role of philanthropy because the government is giving a benefit to people who give money to nonprofits there's a tax deduction and so there is a stake there is a some type of tie that i think exists between the donor and what that money should be going for and so we've thought about how should that one percent of philanthropic funds what's the best use of that and you can think about or we think about it can either supplement government services so by providing more money to the homeless shelter a service that the government already provides but you can supplement that with more resources and that's typically described as charity trying to solve today's problems and then there's the what some would describe as strategic philanthropy of trying to get at the core roots of issues to prevent those problems from developing tomorrow both are really important there's not a priority or hierarchy between those two we give some charitable dollars you give money to the food bank we give money to the homeless shelter in town you do have to meet those needs but there is a role for how does the philanthropic money complement government services to make them better what is the market failure as to why government is not working as well as many people believe it should how can the school system be better while the school system now is so focused on is already budget constrained and so focused on just providing the day-to-day activities and the same of all these non-profit social providers is that they're so focused on the day-to-day job that they don't get to experiment like they should and so there is this rule for strategic philanthropy to come in and say how can these actors and these systems perform better and i think that's where we've largely focused on our giving is looking at systems change it's structural and it's scalable to a way that just providing another dollar for a program largely is not there's different roles for different types of givers anybody can write the check to the food bank and again we write the check to the food bank but the smallest giver can also write the check to the food bank looking at the strategic side which is requires a lot of manpower and expertise and hiring experts and getting access to experts and thinking about here are the ideas that have been tried in the past what's worked what hasn't here are the current ideas was the theoretical framework for those ideas and why they could work what are the potential second order effects of those and making those decisions it's really it's hard for the small donor to do that it's really geared towards the large national foundations and so that's really where we see our role were you humbled by how difficult that is how difficult it is to someone could easily listen to this and say how hard is it to give away 400 million dollars a year you're just you're writing big checks but the way you just described that actually it sounds very difficult to give away a lot of money if it's trying to mostly be philanthropic and not charity driven because as you said the philanthropic one is the one that's strategic it's the one that you're trying to scale and be maximally leveraged in the silo of another agent for example in the case of what the government's already doing or what the private sector is already doing it just strikes me as very difficult how long did it take a do you agree with that and then b how long did it take you to come to that realization that your second career is probably harder than your first we have about 120 employees at the foundation today we had no desire or interest to have 120 employees 10 years ago that was not by design we thought giving would be easy i remember very specifically thinking our giving was going to be find the five highest social return projects or organizations and just write those five big checks every year make it easy make it fairly passive we started down this route and i started pulling the research i had kind of metrics background and college smart enough to read the papers i could figure out what they were saying and so start with a topic like preschool you see three papers that say preschool is amazing it generates all these outcomes later in life and then you see one evaluation of the head start program that shows it doesn't really have an effect and then as you dig deeper in start seeing there's huge battles within this research sector about what the evidence really shows what it demonstrates and the quality of the evidence that's going into all these claims about success and i think in every area that we thought of you know look at work training programs the first scan through everything works it's all great writing checks there is a great way to invest money and then you dig deeper and start getting into okay the problems with those research that organizations are holding up saying here's our evidence that we're successful and it got very frustrating because the more we would study the less we knew about what worked what didn't one of the learnings was very few programs worked or new programs so the things that work are generally already part of the fabric of society like k-12 education we know that works what works these programs that have clear evidence of success or are generally already funded by government already part of fabric of society so what's our role are we just going to supplement with a few extra dollars on the side i didn't want to do that so where could our dollars go the best and that really led us down this issue of how do you change and improve the system and the incentives and the rules of a system rather than what's the next program we can fund because the frustration of trying to find that program just became immense so speaking of a system that i think almost anybody who spent any length of time thinking about it will pretty quickly come to the conclusion is broken is the criminal justice system when did that system come to your and laura's radar laura really drove us entering this field she was a lawyer by training although on the corporate side i think she was just from having the legal background you see the world in a different way and one of the first organizations that we started sending some checks to was the innocence project and we had met the head of the innocence project barry checked at some event and start hearing the stories that will just tear your heart someone who's been wrongfully convicted and was going to die except for the actions of the essence project and we've started funding that just because it was the right thing to do it was a way to help save a life that was going to be terminated without that i have great respect for the innocence project because as they started building up dozens and into hundreds of examples of people that they got off death row or out of prison for wrongful convictions they started looking at the policy angle as well so it wasn't just about the one person or the hundred people that they were saving although massively important they started thinking more strategically about how do we change the system so that the wrong forward convictions don't happen in the first place right because you have to believe that for the amount of effort it takes to take one person off death row one wrongly convicted person off death row having followed a few of these cases it can take decades and i mean it can consume the effort of tens of people tens of thousands of hours and you would say well it's wonderful that we've saved that life what if we put an equal amount of resources on the other side of the equation which is getting few of these people into the system in other words you start to think about where's the asymmetry on this one and it seems a lot of it's on the front end right i mean you could have a hundred innocence projects you will still never fully be able to rectify the situation notwithstanding the fact that you can't undo retroactively all the harm that is done by the time the person is set free exactly a couple examples like that really led us again to okay the systems change the policy focus is where we want to spend the time that there's higher potential reward it is harder work the chance of success is lower but the impact if successful is so much higher if you can improve how the system works and so we started looking at kind of a number of areas of the criminal justice system where i guess first we spent a year i hired someone to leave that work we spent a year just thinking about all the ways the inefficiencies in the system that lead to bad outcomes that don't promote public safety that destroy neighborhoods that aren't fair and equitable for those that are charged or convicted of a crime etc and where could we as a foundation where could we be effective let's pause on that for a moment because again i think that's just a very interesting approach that is a bit counter-intuitive you decide this is something you're passionate about but you don't go right into it both guns blazing there's a humility that says why don't we bring an internal team in that we'll hire that'll spend a year helping us get up to speed on this and identify the specific targets that we can focus on do you find that to be a period of impatience for you or do you find that to be a period of great enjoyment as you are on the upswing of another learning curve it's certainly impatience we have all this money sitting in the account the goal is to do good with it and we'd rather figure out how to do the most good today rather than waiting until tomorrow so there's this natural impatience but i think we've been smart enough to realize that it's smarter to invest wisely tomorrow than do something that's unlikely to have impact today and so that's just kind of a necessary function of it is bring in some experts but really study where is the leverage that a foundation can have on the problem well this is very different from the other actors that are already in the system it's different from what politicians can do or government policy makers or judges or police or everybody has a role and the question is how can a philanthropy or a foundation that is not a natural actor in the system but has a checkbook how can that create some leverage to try to steer the system and improve it now in your first version of the foundation there were two versions right there was a c3 and a c4 and i believe currently the entire foundation is a c3 is that correct we've always realized that the goal is not to just do research or just do idea generation the goal is to have real positive policy change and policy change requires some advocacy political action it just does and so we used to have those the c4 which is the advocacy arm is a separate tax vehicle and there had to be a chinese wall between the c3 and c4 but the c3 being the traditional philanthropic vehicle and we realized was that having that chinese wall really was harming our ability to have positive impact and so we combined the two entities into an llc so that the same employee who was the expert in fines and fees and the options on how to change fines and fees to make them more equitable and just could also go sit there and talk to a legislator about why the problem existed and what the optimal solutions were so what were some of the things that you and the team learned when it came to understanding how the criminal justice system could be so broken and i say that again not knowing much about it but knowing a little bit about it right which is there seems to be an enormous racial disparity that exists they're also certainly by state certainly there seems to be great difficulties in appealing even in the presence of evidence that the first trial may not have been a great trial the amount of coercion that goes into convictions that turn out to be i mean there's so you could just rattle off you don't have to know anything as clearly i don't to still rattle off five or six structural problems how did you decide which ones were the most important and or which were the ones that you could have the greatest impact in i think it was important to figure out how we got to the current system and in this world of real partisanship was a bipartisan response to the growing violent crime that was happening starting post-world war ii and then really peaked late 80s early 90s that got everybody all politicians concerned and scared and they felt they were being elected based upon crime rates based upon the amount of violent crime and trying to get a handle on that so the violent crime was also destroying communities and so you had democrats republicans whites blacks hispanics all come together and start this tough on crime mantra which was we're going to jack up our number of police we're going to jack up the penalties for any criminal act have it severely intensify the war on drugs and then all the second and third order effects that came with it happened now crime ended up peaking in the early 90s and some of it was because of some of the policies past but a lot of it wasn't so you can see different areas that adopted policies at different times and it seems like the drop in crime was relatively independent of when communities both across america as well as globally adopted some of these policies so why did crime go down over the past 30 years is still a mystery to some and some great researchers have looked at this and tried to figure it out and it's a lot of like okay a small piece of it's this small piece of it's this et cetera but the times have changed so we still had on the books the reaction from an environment that was very different and the question is we've seen what those policies did to neighborhoods and we've seen the financial costs of those policies and the trade-offs associated with some of those policies and i think you saw both republicans and democrats coming together trying to rethink what's the right way to structure the criminal justice system all aspects from policing and courts and prisons and re-entry what's the right way that we should do given the environment that we're in right now now thinking back to those late 80s early 90s when everybody came together and said we just can't handle this amount of violent crime we're going to get tough on crime we're going to create more prison beds we're going to put more police officers in the street etc etc was it sort of a combination of things that led to where we are now was it basically more police more arrests stiffer sentences less leniency around parole lower tolerance on pearl violations like was there any one thing or even three things that stood out as the most damning factors that led to mass incarceration what is your assessment of that and i would be curious to hear your thoughts because i think your thoughts would be more informed than mine or just the average person on what other factors could have accounted for the reduction in crime if not the increase in incarceration yeah i'll take the latter question first the best report i've seen on this is from the brennan center that really looked and spent significant amount of time trying to piece together what were different responses and how much of it was just kind of demographic trends how much of it was economic growth and drop in better education better skilled police tactics all these different avenues and i'm doing a short shift on all the things that they've assigned some causation to i think the summary is it's hard to see any one of them being really causal in the shift in crime it was most tellingly you saw this same trends happening globally different countries had different reactions to this and they all had that move up in crime over time into the 90s and then this downward trend and so people are scratching their head trying to say well what caused it and part of it i'm not sure we'll ever know and then to the first question about which i'll reiterate just in case you forgot is basically of all the mechanisms or tactics that would lead to an increase in incarceration do you have a sense of which of those were perhaps most responsible i don't want to get too far my ski tips on this and misrepresent the research i think part of it has been longer sentences part of it has been the conviction rate so once you're arrested we can get convicted what percent of the people are done so and it leads into the system is built to demand a plea bargain we just don't have the court resources the defense attorneys the prosecutors the judges the court systems to hear a vast majority of cases and so it ends up being less than five percent of cases actually go in front of a judge most of them just get pled out and for a long time because those resources don't exist there's been incentives that have been built into the system that almost coerce people to plead guilty to crimes that they may not have committed because just from a risk reward it is i didn't commit this crime but there's a 20 chance i get found guilty i get a 20-year sentence or i can serve i can plead down to a lesser charge and get six months of which i've already been here for three months so three more months and i'm out or my life's over going back to your days of trading that's a no-brainer calculation yeah and it's really hard to see how you've solved that problem without a massive infusion of resources into the courts and into prosecutors and defense attorneys which is not where we want to be spending money we'd rather spend money on preventing crime on social services to not have that problem to begin with and so how do you get rid of this culture where the system can't handle everybody going to trial one of the biggest challenges that nobody has a great answer for now i don't know if this has been a focus at all of your foundation within criminal justice work but obviously in the last few months it's quite topical with respect to the relationship between the police and race and the role of systemic racism within law enforcement how much does that factor in to the economics of it beyond the obvious which is disproportionately arresting presumably disproportionately convicting just based on what you just said the stats you just laid out i mean i would have never guessed that 95 percent of cases would be pled and if that's the case then yeah i just answered my own question which is if you're going to arrest disproportionately minorities then you're going to convict or at least put in prison disproportionately minorities and certainly the few times i have visited prison it's disproportionately minorities take all of that and try to package it into a question what is the role for philanthropy if there is one to try to address the questions of racism within law enforcement does that factor into a tool for criminal justice reform there's obviously been a lot of debate or discussion this year on that very topic and there's no doubt the disproportionate nature of the criminal justice system on minorities and particularly on the black community for so long the political incentive and so much of the focus has been just on crime rates with no regard for the secondary effects that the criminal justice system causes on these communities and on families and i think that's one of the things that we as a society are trying to grapple with now not for the first time but for the first time this has gone into a mainstream discussion sorry just to make sure you're saying we all acknowledge and have acknowledged historically that it's disproportionately black men that go to prison but we're now taking a more broad look at the implication on for example children that are now left without a father is that what you mean is an example of the impact on the family right and the psychological effects of being a black man in america especially in a low-income neighborhood that has and especially if it's an aggressive police force there i think one of the dilemmas has been that minority communities have felt both over-policed and under-policed at the same time they feel over-policed with the techniques that the police are using in their neighborhood so the random stops certainly back in the era stop and frisk the and a presumption of guilt and they and that people especially young black men are likely to be up to something bad however there is still a crime problem most crime is committed in one's own community we're in the very near geographic area around the community and there is a huge cost to society of violent crime so nobody wants the police to leave entirely there still has to be that function of deterrence and trying to clear cases that have been committed so how do you create a policing system that tries to address both of those that treats people more equitably more justly it recognizes their constitutional rights while protecting those communities because the cost of policing on communities is high the cost of violent crime on communities is high as well and that's the struggle with the policing reforms and there's things that we absolutely should do a lot of those are getting enacted now or at least being discussed now but it's not just problem doesn't get solved just by passing one new policy these problems got created over decades over centuries over decades of policing techniques over centuries of disinvestment in these communities and the question is kind of how do you both provide the public safety while not causing the damage that some policing techniques caused today so then shifting gears a little bit within the criminal justice system how much of your effort has focused on the other side which is recidivism i mean one of the things that i was most struck with when i visited prison was the lack of what appeared to be logic around why somebody was in prison so again maybe i'm being overly simplistic but the way i would view it is there are sort of not that many reasons to put someone in prison one reason to put somebody in prison is to protect the public from them another reason to put someone in prison is to punish them for something they have done and yet a final reason to put somebody into prison that would factor into the first two should they be released again is to provide them with a set of skills to reintegrate into society in a better way so you've got these call it two pillars and then a foundation and i was very surprised admittedly i was in a maximum security prison but nevertheless at least half the men that were there were going to be out of jail in their lifetime i was very surprised at how there was virtually no effort into the rehabilitative part so even if you took a long view on protection and punishment the lack of rehabilitation almost guaranteed recidivism again going to your point if 95 of people are pleading out of something many of which are things they didn't do what they don't realize in that var calculation is yeah i'm going to be out of jail in three months but i'm going to have a very difficult path to getting a job i've now moved off the track of non-felon to i am a felon and that's a very different path so is there an opportunity for strategic philanthropy to play a role in the rehabilitative side of incarceration yes i agree with everything you said it's very hard to design effective recidivism programs after someone's come out they just we've tried this as a society in many different forms and shapes for a long time and the evidence is very poor that they have you study it in a diligent way that these programs work it's a very tough problem and so there's a theory which i believe and kind of going on what you said that the nature of prisons has to change that if you wait until the day someone's released that's way too late it's like if you wait until someone drops out of school to step in with some more social services it's too late and so we have a couple projects trying to reimagine prisons think about exactly what you said about what's the role of prisons what do we want society to do the struggle is that states and cities states and counties that fund this are often constrained financially and so they're trying to figure out how do i meet today's problem which is i got a lot of people in prison versus how can i make investments to improve outcomes over the long term and how much of the budget can go to improving outcomes over the long term while we have to meet today's needs and anytime that there's a financial shock you stop investing in the investments because you try to meet today's needs and so i think so much of the public money has gone to the day-to-day work of it that not enough is trying to step back and think how could a system be redesigned what should people who are stuck behind the bars what should they be doing with their day how can we try to maximize the percent chance that they don't come back here when they're released because the recidivism rate is incredibly high and again we just haven't found ways to lower that through programs that reach people when they are released so part of the problem with that i think is you could certainly make an roi case that if you invest more now you'll save much more tomorrow but so in other words if you have 100 people in prison that are going to get out every year and ordinarily 80 of them are going to be back within five years and you can make it 20 of them are going to be back within five years oh my god the cost saving you could almost invest anything you wanted to make that happen and it would pay itself off the problem is it won't pay itself off for five years is that a fair statement right so in the private sector they would make that investment every day but in the public sector it's on a cash accounting you have to balance the books this year and you have a fixed amount of money we can raise taxes and raise revenues but it's hard nobody likes to raise taxes and so you have a fixed amount of money so how much money goes to the investment even if it has a strong roi and i think that's where the philanthropic sector can be a active player or actor in this system is by providing the funds to experiment with different ideas different programs in prison and then funding the high quality evaluation to see what is the roi can we get good data so we can go to the state and say look this program has a very positive roi i know it's hard in the short term to deviate money away from just the way we're doing it now and it's gonna be hard to find the funds today to make that investment but there's great evidence if you can find those funds that five years from now everybody's gonna be better off the state's gonna be better off society's gonna be better off the person entering society is gonna be better off and so you gotta make that argument but you have to be able to provide that high quality evidence of effectiveness because everybody shows up saying my program works my program works is that exactly the type of work you guys are doing in this space which is basically trying to design the best quote-unquote trials or experiments that could at least allow for an evidence-based decision with respect to how to handle these things that's certainly a line of the work some of it is more about values and it's should we keep someone detained in jail before they've gone to their court date because they don't have the money to pay bill i think that's just a value so the criminal justices has this mix of things that you can talk to rois on some things other things it's just is this how our society should be functioning is that a right thing is that balance the interests of the system i think a lot of times when you sit down with people and like is this an american value is this an american ideal that the system works this way they'll say no okay then how do we fix it more closely represents american values without while minimizing any potential second-order effects negative second-order effects so let's pivot to another area that is enormous for the foundation which is health policy this might be i don't know this is easily one of the most complicated systems in this country how are you thinking about it and where are you trying to apply yourself because it's just too big this strikes me as sort of the hedge fund problem you alluded to earlier you could potentially try to spread yourself too thin try to play in every area of it and get nothing done so knowing you though i don't know where you've chosen to invest your time lately i'm guessing you have some clarity about the precision with which you want to think about that yeah and you're right it's just such a big issue complex the number of things that one could work on and health policy is immense and so i did the same thing we're thinking about where in health policy should we be focused we started working in this area about eight years ago and after doing that same type of canvassing that we did in criminal justice work we realized that our first area should be on drug prices and i've identified that as an area where i had very obvious flaws in the existing system that there were ideas that were one could conceive of being enacted on how to fix it and that the political window might open in the future such that there was demand by the public and thus by politicians to actually adopt some of this stuff and so now using those three criteria we ended up with how do we create a more rational system to price pharmaceuticals that balances interest balances incentives that are necessary for the private sector to do the innovation that they're doing it balances the financial interests of the state and the federal government that's largely paying for a lot of this stuff and that maximizes access for the patient so if i understood you correctly you're basically saying look let's look at what solutions could look like even though if today the political will to make changes isn't there this is going to take us a while to figure out what to do and maybe in 10 years the water's gotten hot enough that the frog is willing to jump out will at least have something in place is that kind of how you went about thinking about it was taking a long-term view yes it was that the political window wasn't open eight years ago when we started the work we could see cracks in it you can see cracks in that window and i think that's one thing that we've been good at at a foundation is trying to identify where's the political window going to open up in the future whether it's in changing the bill system whether that's in doing pension reform or in pharmaceutical prices we've gone to these areas and we were early and so when the window opened we had evidence-based ideas that we could present to policymakers and could properly document the problem there was a whole effort on communications to both individuals like to society about what the abuses in the system are in any of these areas including in drug pricing but then also had ideas that you could go to them and say here are the three things you need to do now the pharmaceutical industry is perhaps the most complex industry of any and so there aren't the three things that should be done there's the 20 things that should be done because it is just such a broad and complex system with so many loopholes and bad incentives that's driving bad behavior that to get at it is not okay here's the one thing it's here's the 20 things the downside is you start to lose policymakers when you hit number four because they only want to speak in lists of three so how optimistic are you because this is an area where i know a little bit i've had marty macri on the podcast before i know you know marty and we've spoken about this we have an entire episode on this topic i've had catherine eben on before to talk about a different angle here which is basically just the difference between the basically the corruption within the generic drug industry which is a totally different problem from the one you're addressing for as much as i know about this i feel like i still don't understand it which i think speaks to exactly what you just said if a problem has 21 bullet points to fix it it's a complicated problem what is your level of optimism i mean to be blunt do you feel like you are spinning your wheels for eight years and this is a problem that will only get fixed when we are on the verge of bankruptcy in this country because as you said this is largely a government spend problem this is my view by the way this is my little rant on the united states so we basically carry two enormous burdens for the world there are two things we disproportionately pay that our taxes disproportionately go to on some levels subsidize things in the world and one is military spend and the other is health care spend and you might say well gosh why would health care spend in the united states be a subsidy for the world but it's effectively that we pay so much more for drugs here than our neighbors do that we in effect subsidize the cost of r d to the point where the incentives are to make the drugs here to distribute them here and elsewhere but we disproportionately pay do you agree with that assessment or is it overly simplistic right we're three percent of the world's population united states three percent of the world's population we pay 50 percent of the pharmaceutical revenues of the world so there's no doubt that the prices that we're paying is helping in creating incentive for more medicines that others then get to benefit from but one of the talking points i have in this is the nih spends so much money on the basic science that's required to get these drugs started and in return the pharmaceutical companies charge us 2x 3x the prices of other countries we should be getting a discount because the united states taxpayer is funding some of the basic science much of the basic science but some of the total cost of developing these drugs but rather than we don't get the discount we don't even get the same prices we get the highest prices in the world by a large measure so it comes back to this notion of you'll hear people say things all the time like this is not sustainable our cost of health care is not sustainable blah blah blah and i remember hearing somebody say something once and i don't remember who it was but i really agreed with the point he made which was nonsense it's totally sustainable because we're still doing it i mean it's going to be sustainable until it's no longer sustainable until we default on our debt as the largest sovereign default this ridiculous system is totally sustainable so then my question is what will it take to change this given the complexity of it given all of the bad incentives given everything that you and i just said what would it take for us to not be spending 15 16 17 of our gdp on health care at a clip that's probably increasing at five percent per year in relative growth right we spoke earlier about the downsides of the state having to balance the budget and that's that it can't make the high roi investments that it should the upside is that it forces the states to consider trade-offs they can spend a dollar on health care or a dollar on roads or a dollar in education or a dollar in social services and they have to decide where's the highest value and they look to save money the federal government without that constraint at least in today's environment doesn't have to make that trade-off so any proposed legislation where somebody gets harmed unless it's only or concentrated mostly in the other party's constituency that will not pass because no hard decisions want to get made and so the ramification of that is enormous budget deficits today and an enormous debt that has had a lot of people sounding alarms for decades now those alarms and those concerns about the debt and what it's going to lead to have not come true today it doesn't mean they're not going to come true in the future and i think that's the greatest concern is that the united states is not going to default on the debt we can just print the money but what can happen is high inflation and again people have been talking about this for years and i don't know if it ever comes true or not but we in this country now have a fiscal or monetary response to every problem and the one problem you can't solve from fiscal and monetary tools is inflation and in fact you have to go the other way and that's when things get really bad is when you have to be cutting fiscal spending when you have to be increasing interest rates to try to combat inflation and so i don't know if the inflation comes i don't know if it ever comes as someone who thought a lot about risk in their career i'm very concerned about the downside should it come we just don't have a political environment now where tough decisions can get made and so what happens if we start seeing high inflation then forces up interest rates that causes all the repercussions negative repercussions of that because we have the system now so levered with debt at the household level at the business level at cities and states at the federal level so what would we do john help me understand that so right now we can get away with printing money because the interest rate that the government pays is very low if inflation hits and the interest rate goes up i mean as it stands now the united states government's debt service is a staggering number you probably know it i certainly don't i try to block numbers i really really hate out of my mind by the way so i think at one point i knew how much the united states paid per day in debt and i quickly buried it somewhere in i don't know somewhere in my spinal cord it's not even in my brain anymore but at some point as you said if inflation hits and interest rates rise that debt service could overwhelm our gdp yes yeah it could the debt people argue we should do more deficit spending today because interest rates are low we can borrow for 10 years at very low rates reality is we borrow generally short term but even if we put all the borrowing at 10 years or 30 years we never actually pay off the debt it's just accumulating so as long as gdp is growing faster than real inflation it's okay because on a real basis it declines but that's not what happens debt's increasing much faster than real gdp and so the real debt is increasing and we never pay it off and we're not sure whether the low interest rates are going to be around forever or not just 2007 when interest rates were close to five percent just imagine that now if interest rates went back to five percent what it would do to stock prices to businesses who are so levered to cities and states to everybody to households if you raise the cost of borrowing historically five percent is not astronomical either no we've certainly seen double digits and they've got to go back 40 years now but we've seen double-digit interest rates before in this country and the decimation that would take place if that happened again is immense and so i always think about i want to help the world i want to solve problems but if the answer is just shovel more money at it that's not a sustainable answer in my mind so everything becomes how do we improve the system without spending more money or how do we prove the allocation of resources today and that gets us back to pharma is that a dollar spent on pharma which some portion of that goes to innovation and creates incentive for innovation well innovation's great in a world of no trade-offs there's no problem with that and if you believe that there are no trade-offs with how we spend our resources then farmer prices are fine in fact double them triple them there'll be more incentive for innovation in that world but that's not the world that i believe we live in i believe there is a trade-off and that a dollar put into pharma innovation is a dollar or less for everything else it could be other healthcare innovation or healthcare services that aren't getting provided today or it could be an education it could be in making our prisons better so that there's less recidivism in all these ways and that somehow the pharma industry has been able to create this island every other industry has to fight for the dollars and try to convince the state and federal government give me an extra dollar here's why and the pharma system has just been able to create this island where they don't have to compete with anybody they got their own rules and it's a messed up set of rules that incentivizes the wrong thing so even within that we're not getting the drugs that we should be getting we get a lot of marginal oncology drugs that probably don't provide any real benefit versus the current drugs and we're not investing in the antibiotics we're not investing in vaccines because the financial incentive isn't there for lows so we're spending tons of money as a society and not even getting good returns for it sorry that's my rant it's very disheartening to see just how low that roi is i mean i think again it comes back to this question of where does the crack finally have to occur i love this expression i don't know who it's attributed to and i'm probably paraphrasing it but it's like change happens very slowly and then it happens very quickly it's like the stone mason that is banging banging banging away on the stone for hours and hours and hours and to the outside world nothing is happening and then with one more strike it splits and i feel like a lot of your philanthropy is like that it is years of banging away at something that seems unchangeable and there's a belief there has to be a belief that at some point that nth strike is going to split that rock is this a skill that you because that seems like the opposite of trading in some ways trading was in a relatively short period of time you're going to find out if you were right or wrong again you always had the advantage of being able to adjust your positions in the presence of new information but at least you had a feedback loop that was relatively short here your feedback loop is much longer does that pose a challenge for you emotionally absolutely and you're right that the trading world has that instantaneous feedback about whether you're right or not and you used to have the p l marker up in the corner of the computer screen that would tell you at every moment in time what the market was telling you about your position and a lot of these efforts that were involved and on policy change number one it'd take a long time and second as you described you don't know if you're making progress often because it feels like you're just have the hammer against the wall have the hammer against the wall and driving yourself crazy and wasting money and then all of a sudden it happens there's a this great book i read it was written by an advocate who was trying to get rid of the don't ask don't tell policy in the military and allow gays to openly serve and this turned out to be close to a 20-year campaign for him in the first decade his wins were so small his advances in it was like he was trying to get invited to give a talk at a class at the military academy was a step forward and you could see like at any given time he could have spent five years with very little visible progress and just stopped and said pushing this rock i've been hitting the wall i'm not making any progress this is a waste of my time i should be doing something else and god had done something else and not achieved success but he stuck with it and the second decade he ended up getting the policy reversed and it led the effort and i think about that story a lot of it's hard to know during that time like five years in are we wasting our time and this is never going to pass or is the wall gonna crack tomorrow and you just don't have that feedback mechanism in this work that you had in the market and the complete opposite end of the spectrum and i guess that's why the research that you do the time that you take the amount of deliberation that goes into your philanthropy at least gives you a greater foundation of confidence i interviewed someone by the name of rick doblin who's been singularly focused on the legalization of mdma since about 1986. again it's staggering to me to think 34 years he has worked on the exact same problem and i just had a call with rick yesterday and i guess i i don't know if i'm i got to be careful what i am allowed to say or not say but i think i can say with some confidence that he is probably closer than ever to achieving that goal through his organization maps the multi-disciplinary association for psychedelic studies and again i just think that people who can do what you can do who can do what rick doblin can do who can do what a lot of great philanthropists can do it's not just writing the check that's amazing that is unbelievable to be able to write the check it's equally amazing to be able to stick on a problem speaking of problems there's one problem you and i have never discussed but it seems so up your alley i wonder if you have evaluated it and decided it's not worth you don't have the assets you don't have sort of the problem-solving asset to go after it or you think enough people are on it but i'm very curious as to what thought you guys have given to climate change again given your understanding of energy which is you know at least a third of the problem tell me how that's come across your radar yeah we do a little bit on climate change i think as a trader and again someone who thinks about risk it's a problem where the downside possibilities are so enormous that it makes sense as a society for us to make the investments today to try to decrease the probability of those downside scenarios i don't know what probability it is of those downside scenarios that are truly catastrophic from an economic standpoint from a life standpoint that changed how humans really live but it's greater than zero it's less than a hundred percent it's somewhere in there but the downside is so great that society needs to make that investment so we typically get drawn to the areas where i'd call them orphaned areas where there's not much focus especially philanthropic focus things like public pension reform or changing how elections are conducted or the pharmaceutical pricing or surprise billing things where the day we enter it we probably have committed the most money of of any other philanthropic actor in the system already what strikes me about the climate field is that there are remarkable people there's brilliant people who are working on this today who are very thoughtful philanthropists who are working on this today who often times either make this their single issue or one of two or three issues that they'll be working on so always think about what's our additionality into the problem and one of them is that i think because we work with both the left and the right and we're not a political organization and many of those who are both the researchers the advocates the funders in the climate space do come from the left that i think we can try to support those efforts those organizations and politicians that are on the right who want to start taking the steps because this has to be a bipartisan effort to solve it's hard to imagine today how that happens but republican party is moving slowly very slowly but you start to see some people with real credibility within the republican party and they are thought highly of start to think about there's acknowledgment that there's a problem there is dispute about what level of investment is merited to deal with it and i think that democrats don't help republicans get there when you put the whole democratic platform into a climate change bill i don't think it helps republicans talk about the issue and be a productive partner and i think it's going to have to be again it has to be bipartisan for it to be sustainable perhaps democrats win the white house to perhaps democrats win the senate for 2021 they might take down the filibuster but what happens when that changes and julo's rules and laws stay enacted or do they get repealed and so that's why i think all these things that we work on need to be done in a bipartisan way including the pharma we got a bill passed in the through senate finance committee republicans democrats come together get this close and we just can't get it onto the floor that's where we are so john your kids are i'm guessing they probably don't even your oldest probably doesn't remember you being a traitor so your kids are going to grow up and they're going to think of mom and dad's job is philanthropy what's the impact that that has on them i mean i suspect it's pretty profound they see how seriously their parents think about this stuff do they come to you with questions about the work that you have do they have their own interests they're obviously not that young anymore and they're obviously very smart kids they must be thinking about hey mom and dad why aren't you guys working on this problem or what do you think about this problem i mean how does your curiosity for the world trickle down to them and how deliberate a part of that of raising your kids is that they certainly understand and having high principles about what we do we're philanthropists they know what that means they know that we give money trying to make the world a better place but we do have those conversations when we walk past a homeless individual who's asking for a dollar and my daughter says we need to give him a dollar right and like having those conversations about okay do we give this dollar here or do we give it to the someone trying in a more philanthropy or more strategic way to try to get at the root of the problem right do we give the dollar here do we give it to the food bank down the street that hopefully he can go to and get the same meal that we would want him to get or something like that right right and it ends up being both i think you need to teach kids about humanity about the love of the individual so we can't say no every time but also have to teach them about not going to give all the money away dollar by dollar to somebody on the street we've thought a lot about what's the kids role in this going forward and laura and i are very much on the same page here where we don't want their lives to be defined by their parents so we don't want them working at the foundation we don't want them at least when they're in their 20s and probably in their 30s to be working at the foundation if it's still open then we want them to go have their own life experiences define their own create their own life and then after they've done that if they want to come join the work here that's great but it's really important that they're not part of the foundation at a young age because there's a downside and and it's whenever you have that checkbook people look at you differently and treat you differently your jokes are funnier and people have a sense of they're on best behavior around you because there's always something that they want funded or that they're involved in and are going to come with an ask at some point and we minimize this largely because of the types of things we fund and we've made it very clear about what we do fund but if somebody's growing up in their teens in their 20s and is looked at by the rest of the world as a checkbook first i think that's a very damaging way to grow up it's not reality like the 20s is the time when you need to be kissing somebody else's butt you need to be going to get the lunches for everybody else not vice versa you need to be trying to climb up to the organization not be gifted the checkbook on day one so what advice would you give to people who were where you were 25 years ago which is they're going to be writing three figure checks or maybe a four-figure a five-figure check to an organization they're not going to be able to set up their own foundation they have the same tug that you have which is hey whatever stage in my life i'm at whatever my means are at i know that giving away some of my money makes the world a better place i just want to make sure i do it as intelligently as possible yeah in many ways what we're doing is not remarkable so many people in this world or especially in the united states are very generous with time with resources relative to what they have relative to the time that they have relative to the money that they have so it can just be done at a different scale but i think there are some people who are much more altruistic than we are there's people who give away ten percent of their money when they're making a hundred thousand dollars or fifty thousand dollars that changes their quality of life there's a sacrifice a trade-off by doing that and they still do it and there's a small movement called further pledge where you pledged to give everything above a relatively small salary like 30 000 maybe up to 50 000 to charity and knowing that that dollar you're giving is creating more total good than you spending it and that's huge and i think we as a society benefit when our community around us is stronger and that's why people do it whenever we have the needs of our family whenever our family is secure then i think it's natural it's human nature to start thinking about your community and however you define your community whether it's your group of friends your city your country might be shared experiences but everybody kind of goes through that process of defining his or her own community and then uses the resources of time and money to try to help that community and to the best extent they have there's no right answer in how you define your community there's no right answer as to how you improve your community but it is remarkable just this culture of giving and philanthropy that exists in this nation i think largely because we are a wealthy nation right we're more people are more secure here people have more likely to have the needs of their family set aside or in line of sight and so they're able to do these things and that's one of the reasons that make this country so great i don't know if i answered your question no you really did actually i mean certainly what i took away from that was you pointed out something that i think doesn't get enough appreciation which is you're absolutely right for you to give away 400 million dollars a year is less i mean i'm not minimizing that at all but you're right it's less of a sacrifice than someone who makes fifty thousand dollars a year giving away five thousand the incremental five thousand making fifty thousand is staggering if you're trying to raise a family or do anything else and the other thing i took away was this idea of giving locally i think the way you define locally is very important it doesn't mean necessarily if i live in this city i only give to this city i can broaden my definition of local local could mean i'm a veteran and therefore my giving back to veterans affairs or other vets is what i define my community as i think that's an elegant way to think about it i think the other thing that comes with that is frankly giving to your community means you can probably make a more informed gift you have a better sense of potentially what the needs are of your own community absolutely john i'm gonna be honest with you man we've been talking here for like over two and a half hours i took a bunch of notes before we spoke we haven't got through half what i want to talk about but i also can't keep one of the world's busiest philanthropists wasting any more of his time talking with me so i'm going to honor my commitment to you to keep this relatively short not make it a separate discussion i'm going to let you go we might have to do a part two at some point but i want to thank you very much for first and foremost just set aside the time today but more importantly just for the work that you do i know personally how seriously you take this work and the world is definitely a better place for having the best natural gas trader of all time no longer
