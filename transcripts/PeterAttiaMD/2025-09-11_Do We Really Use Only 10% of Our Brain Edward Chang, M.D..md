This clip is from episode  #363 ‒ A new frontier in neurosurgery: restoring brain function with brain-computer interfaces, advancing glioblastoma care, and new hope for devastating brain diseases | Edward Chang, M.D.

In this clip, they discuss:

- The 10% Brain Myth – Clarifies that we don’t “only use 10%” of our brain
- Essential Brain Functions – Roughly 10–15% is critical for survival functions like movement, speech, and vision
- Redundancy in the Brain – Some regions, like the frontal lobes, have overlapping functions
- Frontal Lobe Plasticity – Even large portions of one frontal lobe can be removed without major deficits if the brain has adapted
- Slow Growth and Reorganization – Slow-growing lesions allow time for the brain to rewire itself

## AI Summary

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features a discussion with Dr. Edward Chang about brain function, neurosurgery, and neuroplasticity. The conversation primarily focuses on debunking the myth that humans only use 10% of their brain and explores how the brain can adapt to injury or surgery. Dr. Chang explains how different areas of the brain can compensate for damaged regions, particularly in cases of slow-growing lesions or tumors.

The discussion delves into the technical aspects of brain surgery, particularly focusing on the frontal lobe and its functions, and the concept of brain plasticity. There's particular emphasis on how the brain's hemispheres communicate through the corpus callosum and how the brain can reorganize itself when faced with damage or surgical intervention.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- The "10% of brain usage" myth is explained as referring to critical functions requiring about 10-15% of brain tissue [01:29]
- Brain regions have redundant functions, particularly in the frontal lobe [02:08]
- Patients can sometimes tolerate removal of an entire frontal lobe on one side [02:44]
- Neuroplasticity allows brain functions to reorganize over time [03:22]
- The corpus callosum serves as an information highway between brain hemispheres [04:43]
- Synaptic plasticity involves the weighting of neural connections [03:43]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Understanding that brain function is highly adaptable [03:22]
- Recognition that brain healing and reorganization takes time [03:43]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
No specific supplements or medications were discussed in the provided transcript.

5. **Exercise & Movement**:
No specific exercise protocols were discussed in the provided transcript.

6. **Nutrition & Diet**:
No specific dietary recommendations were discussed in the provided transcript.

7. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
No specific biomarkers or testing protocols were discussed in the provided transcript.

8. **References & Resources**:
- Reference to Roger Sperry's Nobel Prize work on split-brain research [04:43]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"What it really means is that there is maybe about 10 or 15% that is very critical for our basic functions, our ability to move, to talk, you know, to see etc." [01:29]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
- What are the long-term effects of frontal lobe removal?
- How does age affect neuroplasticity and recovery from brain surgery?
- What are the specific functions that can and cannot be compensated for by other brain regions?
- What is the full extent of Roger Sperry's split-brain research and its modern implications?

Note: The transcript appears to be incomplete, cutting off during a discussion about corpus callosum surgery. A full analysis would require the complete transcript.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] I think the thing that struck me the most the first time I saw neurosurgery was how the hell do they know what they're doing? Like how how many billion cells did we just lop off there? And obviously this speaks to what you're talking about from a functional standpoint. But um but a lot of times you're not doing that, right? So if a patient has a meningioma or or some other tumor um how how do you bracket that tradeoff? So do you do you s just sort of say look there are places where you never want to have a tumor for example right above my left ear that would be a really difficult place to have to resect because the real estate is so precious and that's where we're going to probably recommend doing an open awake procedure to help guide us. Is that kind of how you're using that?

[00:00:46] That's exactly right. And so um the real estate is critical. That's an understatement. Um, but that being said, there is some really expensive real estate in there and there's also some cheaper real estate. But that's I guess that's my point, Eddie. It's like that's sort of like telling me about Manhattan. Yeah.

[00:01:08] Like there's no cheap real estate in Manhattan. There happen to be areas that are $10,000 a square foot, but there's probably nothing less than 4,000 a square foot. So, so there's this like popular idea that we only need 10% of our brain. I'm sure you've heard this. I I've heard this and I don't know what it means. It sounds like malarkey to me, right? So, that might mean to stay alive.

[00:01:29] Okay. To to to respire, you might only need 10% of your brain. So what what it really means is that there is maybe about 10 or 15% that um is very critical for our basic functions, our ability to move, to talk, you know, to see etc. It's actually a lot more than that. But um it's also referring to this point that there are parts of our brain actually that are extremely redundant with other parts of the brain. So the frontal loes for example um we do surgeries there routinely and oftentimes people really have no effect even in terms of judgment even in terms of

[00:02:08] Absolutely. Yeah. So because we always think of the frontal lobe as where we have sort of executive function and where we have the ability we always joke like one of my friends in med school we said he had no frontal lobe. Exactly. He just couldn't stop saying the most inappropriate things. And don't get me wrong, uh the frontal lobe actually has a lot of critical function for executive decision making, you know, impulse control, etc. But um my point is that it's redundant, meaning that um different parts of the frontal lobe actually have similar purposes and similar role. And so um for the most part, a lot of our patients can accommodate a fairly large surgery.

[00:02:44] Sometimes even removing the entire frontal lobe, both sides. No, not both sides really. Uh usually these pathologies are only on one side and so so if you took the entire frontal lobe from the left or right side would there would there be a sub a substantial difference? Uh I've done that many times just so you know and um it really depends on the case and scenario. If someone's been having something that's slower growing there and there's been time for the brain to reorganize, what we call plasticity, a lot of those functions will essentially no longer be in that right frontal lobe and they've moved to the left side. Wow.

[00:03:22] And people can tolerate. What is the mechanism by which that happens? Well, um time and function meaning like these things don't happen overnight. They take you know sometimes weeks and years. But basically what happens is some neurons get lost over time and then others will compensate in in in terms of that function.

[00:03:43] But how does that actually happen? So let's posit that we have a slow growing lesion in the left frontal lobe. What is the left frontal lobe doing to communicate with the right frontal lobe to say hey these neurons are being compromised. Their function is deteriorating. You guys need to pick up the slack. How is that message being transmitted? Well, part of it is that both parts of the frontal lobe for people, most people are are both doing the function most of the time. So, it's not like it's just transferring the information. It's that both sides were originally, you know, involved in those functions and then one side gets weaker and the other one has to pick up that slack. Um, at a cellular level, this is what we call synaptic plasticity. uh the weights that you know essentially make up who we are. These are just the weights that neurons use to communicate with one another. All of our learning is towards shaping that waiting of synapses that occur where neurons touch each other and um that that can that can happen that can change you know throughout our life. Every time we learn a new word, those are new synapses that have formed that were never there, new connections. Um, precisely from the left to the right side, there is this structure that we call the corpus colossum. It's an information highway that connects the left part of our brain. from the right side. Um there was a Nobel Prize Roger Sperry who done a really incredible early experiments describing patients who had surgeries where you split that and in certain instances you have this phenomena where people essentially like have two functioning brains but they're not communicating to each other. Um so it does require that there is this connection between the two areas where they're being reorganized.

[00:05:33] Now outside of epilepsy, why else would the corpus be severed? That's really the main one that we use it for. Can you describe how patients that uh undergo that procedure behave? It's very fascinating. I'm Peter Atia. This podcast relies exclusively on premium subscribers for support, which allows us to provide all our content without taking a single penny from advertisers.
