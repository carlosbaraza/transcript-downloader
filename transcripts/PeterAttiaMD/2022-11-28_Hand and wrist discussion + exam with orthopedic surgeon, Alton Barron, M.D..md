## AI Summary

Here's my analysis of the discussion between Dr. Peter Attia and Dr. Alton Barron about hand and wrist conditions:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focused on hand and wrist anatomy, common injuries, and surgical interventions. Dr. Barron, an orthopedic surgeon specializing in hand surgery, provided detailed insights into the complex biomechanics of the hand, evolutionary aspects of thumb opposition, and modern surgical approaches. The discussion covered both acute traumatic injuries and chronic degenerative conditions, with particular emphasis on the importance of hand function for human independence and cognitive development.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- The scaphoid bone has the highest non-union rate in the body due to its unique retrograde blood supply [10:14]
- Approximately 50% of people will develop thumb base arthritis in their lifetime [50:20]
- About 25% of people presenting with thumb pain will require surgery [49:45]
- 15% of people lack the palmaris longus tendon, showing evolutionary adaptation [50:45]
- Hand function involves over 60% of higher cortical neurons [19:05]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Maintain hand mobility through regular use [1:03:34]
- Don't immobilize sprains too long as ligaments heal better with motion [1:03:34]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Seek immediate evaluation for suspected scaphoid injuries [11:34]
- Consider ergonomic positioning for keyboard work [53:20]

4. **Exercise & Movement**:
- Grip strength training should consider ulnar vs median nerve distribution [40:02]
- Three-finger pull-ups may be more effective than four-finger variations [41:21]
- Rock climbing can cause pulley injuries in fingers [54:20]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"Using meaningful hand use is so important for cognitive development and well-being" [19:05]

"As soon as we lose our hand function, we become dependent on others" [45:25]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are the long-term outcomes of thumb basal joint reconstructions?
2. How does hand therapy protocol differ between acute trauma and chronic conditions?
3. What is the role of preventive exercises in maintaining hand function?

The discussion provides valuable insights into hand and wrist conditions, emphasizing both the complexity of hand anatomy and the importance of maintaining hand function for overall quality of life. The evolutionary perspective adds depth to understanding why certain conditions occur and how modern surgical techniques have evolved to address them.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] all right so we've got the shoulder and the elbow behind us yeah that leaves us with the the hand and the wrist which is effectively how we mediate contact with the outside world and our extremities yeah um I I would say this to me is like a black box like you know I didn't actually do a rotation in Orthopedics or plastic so uh no exposure to that now in general surgery you do you cross cover plastic sometimes so you know new enough to know what not to do when someone came in with hand trauma right but it's obviously a highly specialized field uh you've done a fellowship just in hand right right it basically seems anybody who wants to operate on the hand has to not only complete the Orthopedics program or Plastics program but then go completely do that dedicated program that's right yeah I mean it's it's I suppose you could pick it up but to be able to do that in a certainly a a big city or a dense metropolitan area you would need to have Fellowship training and it's just there's so much as we've talked about before just like in the shoulder just like in biologics just like in everything you do there's such an explosion of information and it's hard to keep track of everything what before we get into the hand what do we know today about the hand in terms of repair or injury that you didn't know when you finished residency or what and I don't mean you personally but I just mean wasn't known then that is known today you know that's that's a fascinating topic because before well before I started starting in the 50s and 60s they had developed microvascular techniques and that's really the that was the Holy Grail of so much in the hand you could have a a laceration or a war injury or something and there really wasn't much to do for many of those injuries especially nerve and blood vessel related so you would do a lot of amputations you do it just were not reconstructable and so the the war experience actually did develop that and one of my forebearers J William littler who was one of the most famous if not the most famous living hand surgeon for for a few decades in the world was exposed to that at Valley Forge and elsewhere during the war and that's how they that he and other really luminaries in the field develop these techniques said that brought us where we are today

[00:02:19] I'd say the most significant advancement since I uh graduated and went into private practice has been the hand transplantation the complete hand transplantation which is a very very as you know it involves general surgeons it involves hand surgeons that involves um so many a huge team to be able to do that and to achieve that and and the results are mixed but how many have been done I don't even know now uh but it what as recently as five years ago only a few had been done so it's all been in these last uh several years that that these teams have been built up at the larger institutions to be able to handle that but even there it's fraught um with Peril in that uh you have to have a perfect patient physiologically speaking and you know comorbidities greatly decrease the likelihood of success there and and it requires a huge investment for the patients themselves and so even a single hand amputation is not nearly as um reasonable of an indication as a bilateral hand amputee those are the ones that generally can qualify and they have to meet all the physiologic parameters and so forth so it's it's you know I don't even know that much about it when my partners has been on one of those teams and he knows much more about it Lou Catalano and where is the where is the are they joined at the generally midpoint of the wrist right is that the distance I'm sorry for distal forearm right where you can get that you're beyond that transition zone and you can link up tendon to tendon usually and then of course the the nerves can be linked as well and so it's yeah it's fascinating so that's the biggest and it's the same immunologic process you have to HLA match these things because they're all categoric exactly exactly and that's as you well know and you know way more about that than I do because of the general surgical background but obviously the immuno immunological suppression to allow these things to not be graph versus host uh disease and it's it's it's a wild wild time real really and and we will get better I think the other thing the only other thing that's changed a lot is that relates so much to the hand as you mentioned it's how we interact with the world is the you know spinal implants and the various types of full muscle transfers that can that can restore function in the hand for someone who previously had no ability to control even a prosthesis these Electro electrical prosthesis now that are linked to the brain and so it's it's cool and so what type of injuries does someone have in the forearm that are are there injuries where they will take a muscle from the leg or something like a

[00:05:06] Sartorius and attach it there absolutely yeah yeah and it's really intended to just give some primitive function back to be able to flex the elbow for instance or extend the elbow or Flex the wrist and so it's really more the elbow more than anything because most of these injuries that people patients can still control their shoulder can position the arm somewhere but as you know I mean if you just even forget about a very devastating injury but if you just have an elbow uh extension contracture where you cannot Flex better than 90 degrees you can't get your hand to your mouth to your hair to your face you can't do a lot yeah there's many many limitations to that so um and that's just to get through an average day not anything specialized such as playing an instrument or throwing a football or something so when we talked about the shoulder and the elbow um do you have a sense of what fraction of those injuries that require surgical intervention are the result of an acute trauma versus uh chronic injury wear and tear now obviously a lot of The Chronic stuff is on top of an acute event like a subluxation that happened you know that over and over and over again leads to for example my injury but um do you have a sense of like what that division is yes and the division I do but it it also varies depending on where you are in my practice now I took trauma call for a couple of decades but I no longer take so I see cold trauma that still needs plenty of surgery but it's not that um it's not acute it's sub-acute and it needs to be fixed in a delayed fashion so if you are in a practice such as a county hospital where there's trauma coming in from the hot the the whether it's Hunters whether it's highways and

[00:06:54] Etc then and you're doing a lot you're a much higher percentage of your day and your week is spent repairing acute traumatic often poly trauma injuries and I've been there and done that but the um in someone who has a a mature Metropolitan type practice that's it's more in the area 50 50. there's plenty of of arthritic conditions of wear and tear conditions of of uh whether it's from you know any sort of gem work or you know getting back into various forms of exercise or the weekend warrior phenomenon and those are sometimes injuries but they're not dramatic uh traumatic injuries and then there are the people that are falling off the scooters and the and water skiing dislocating their shoulders also all that Spectrum but the actual the the actual acute uh any and something as mundane as as cutting avocados I see tons of nerve injuries and tendon injuries in the

[00:07:58] Palms the Sunday morning Bagel injury yeah and so so but but it's usually spread pretty evenly between uh arthritic and sort of sports related ruptures and injuries and then fractures and dislocations and ruptures due to traumatic events well if the Bony anatomy of the shoulder is a little more straightforward it starts to get a little more complicated in the elbow and it gets a little more rigid I mean the hand is really complex so how do you how do you even go about beginning to explain the anatomy of the hand which has how many bones does the hand have well you know that that even varies but if you think about it you have you have five fingers and you have in those each finger has three bones except for the thumb which has two so you there you've got the twelve plus two is Fourteen and then you have the the next layer which are the metacarpals and that's of course five of those and then the carpal bones which are all these small bones we we had a resident that used to make fun of wearing hand surgeons who would say uh never operate on a bone you can swallow and uh so he was just in a fun way pillaring the the fine um sort of smaller caliber things that we're dealing with in the hand and wrist region and and the wrist has the bones that are held tightly together and there are there are multiple bones there some they're often what are called coalitions where they're fused together so that's why I mean that it varies but the uh the wrist owns the one bone that is the hardest to heal in the body and that's the scaphoid bone because it's it's like a carob coated cashew it's almost all in encompassed by cartilage so there's only a couple of little areas where tiny blood vessels can get into that bone and unlike almost all the other if not all the other bones in our body the we don't have what we call anti-grade flow into that bone it leaving the heart going down through the arteries and the capillaries and going into the bone from a point A distally to point B it goes in retrograde so if you if you crack that bone in the middle at

[00:10:14] Baseline it has very little blood supply then you crack it and you probably disrupt the Bloods exactly and so there's a high risk of non-union it takes the average bone in the body in an adult takes um six weeks to heal and these generally take 10 12 weeks to heal the skateboard and what's the common injury that breaks

[00:10:34] Escape way yeah there's there it's mainly a hard fall with the just the right position of the wrist where it's leveraging on that and it's that scaphoid spans the two rows of bones in the wrist that we call the the distal row and the proximal row of these arcs of Bones and um and it spans that so it gets leveraged on in a certain way with certain positions and then a directed

[00:10:58] Force usually it's a wrist extension Force and does that patient typically present with a lot of pain or that's a great question so no often they know they injured their wrist and they'll get some swelling there but it's not that bad and there's nothing there's no great Distortion of the wrist so that's not when you when you fracture your distal radius and it swells up like it swells up and it looks like a dinner fork and you know something's wrong and you you know you you sometimes people get lightheaded and pass out and they just look at their wrist yeah this doesn't happen with the scaphoid and and it's often young athletes right so they don't they are you taking off they Shake It

[00:11:34] Off they're used to pain and then they come in often they'll come in at six weeks they can't lift weights they can't do a clean and jerk they can't shuck somebody you know on the offensive line and then that then they get evaluated and and we find the skateboard fracture and we've already lost six weeks there and if am I remembering correctly is the scaphoid fracture the one that's really easy to miss on an X-ray you kind of need the MRI to see it yeah yeah or is it a CT which one is the Mr odellity

[00:12:02] MRIs is where we detect occult hidden um fractures of the scaphoid and and why is that by the way because normally CT is the Imaging of choice for bone great question it's just that you don't have enough but it's not big enough yeah and so we can see so you're looking for the signal yeah yeah you're looking for the fat signal yeah um yeah that that's and I and I've I've seen a number of people who have had that issue missed and a lot of times they don't even necessarily tie it back to the fall right right it's been long enough so so what is the treatment plan for that patient so it's evolved a little historically we treated all of these non-operatively and then there was a period uh when actually an Australian fellow named Herbert came up with a really ingenious screw that was had two sets of threads on it and they were different pitch so when you'd screw it down the middle of the bone and turn it and when it engaged both bones it would actually compress them together because they were different pitch and that was called the

[00:13:07] Herbert's crew and that was a game changer for us to be able to treat especially athletes and show folks where this bone is and where you access it operatively right so the um there are different schools of thought on that when I was coming out of training uh everybody made an incision down here to fix these in a full incision to expose everything you had jigs that you can put those screws down

[00:13:31] I do almost all of mine percutaneously through it I mean literally an incision this big and I'll go either retrograde often or anti-grade it's just a it's it's really a 3D effort to just get it in the right position get a central core guide wire down and then and then you use a little um a little drill hand drilled to drill out that and then put the screw down over the wire and it's really great because patients already hardly feel that they've had any surgery they heal very quickly faster and you can even start movement earlier so that when it is healed you already have your movement back so you're not stiff and then having to do a lot of physical therapy on top of that so what are there scenarios when you would not operate on a scaphoid fracture there are many if they're non-displaced then we can expect them to heal would you put a cast on or would you put at least a splint we know that you can just basically as long as you immobilize the wrist even if you leave the thumb thumb and fingers free that these will heal then you look at comorbidities and you look at life um life needs so the athletes often get a screw because they just can get back faster even with protection the um surgeons often want to have them fixed I fixed a number because they just want to get back to blo operate which they can do and what the time course to recovery if you let's just say you're in that lucky camp where the day it falls you're smart enough to to you know know that it's the skate void and you go and get the MRI confirm it you have surgery the next day how long until you're um catching a ball again yeah catching a ball generally about six weeks okay operating if you're a surgeon a week oh wow yeah it's really fast as long as it's not contact you're doing it within a week right and that's the nice that's the that's the game changer really that we have now um you I'm going to go alluded to something that is one of the few things

[00:15:26] I do remember from residency which was the position to make this blend what is it about having the wrist in this position that you know for US general surgeons would be basically let's just let the hand guys look at this tomorrow morning we don't have to call them at two o'clock in the morning if this is a non-operative or non-urgent issue but let's at least put them in this safe position what is it about that position let's say so the essentially neutral position which looks like actually as you've shown some wrist extension but it's really neutral in terms of the carpus what that does is that um one of the important things it does is when we are in too much flexion and we see this occasionally where people just aren't thinking about it they just slap a splint on and don't really know that what you're talking about is uh too much flexion or too much extension then that increases the pressure on the median nerve and the carpal tunnel so people can get especially with some extra swelling from the injury they can get actually a acute carpal tunnel syndrome that can be quite substantial in those more extreme positions so a neutral position is great for that it's also best for function in terms of just if you're in a split but at least trying to get some finger movement maybe typing at a keyboard or something then that's a good neutral position I will on occasion if I have to mobilize someone I will uh and they have a unique a musician for example I will immobilize them in the position they need for instance to be able to at least play their electric bass I just had a patient the other day who plays both upright bass and electric bass and so he asked me I said well how are you we're just playing electric bass he said fine I said then show me the position of your hand I'll put you in that Splat in that position so so he's able to keep playing and even doing gigs that way so um you know it's everybody's different um but it's an important consideration all right so what do we need to understand about the anatomy of the radial bone the ulnar bone and these two big nerves I'm guessing the median nerve if I recall runs there in the ulnar nerve runs yes on the pinky side correct that's right and we'll we'll go we'll see that in our exam shortly but yes and then the third nerve which is completes the hand is the radial nerve and that's purely sensory along here but it is important and provides sensory on the back side of the hand and the thumb and most of the back side of the hand but the ulnar nerve your right and both of those are at risk for lacerations um for um and they're at risk even when you distort the anatomy with through a fracture and so those are the two big ones I I kind of remember the median nerve being bigger than I expected what's the approximate size of the median nerve yeah so it's it's a it's an oval shape and cross section and it it varies obviously like it's about three or four millimeters wide two millimeters deep right even even bigger that would be you know a smaller petite person would have about that size and I've seen them as large as almost a centimeter wide and four or five millimeters thick in a large hand oh yeah I mean just insane which I guess speaks to the innervation right of this unbelievable part of our body that occupies so much of our homunculus right yes yeah so I've always said this because uh you and I've talked about this that I've in terms of using meaningful hand use is so important for cognitive development and well-being and sick over 60 percent of our higher cortical neurons are devoted just to our hand through the homunculus and you know you've seen that homunculus

[00:19:05] I know you and I've seen it many times but it's yeah we'll link to a picture of that big ears um and you know big eyes but huge hands and then a tiny torso you know a little shriveled up tiny torso and so that's what's super cool so yes I mean we we need to keep using our hands to keep our minds vital in whatever form we're doing and actually some great Studies have been done on that to show what's the effect of just typing at a keyboard and it doesn't stimulate our our cortex very much at all uh typing nor does texting handwriting which is an art form even though it doesn't feel like it for for many of us but handwriting still does stimulate our brain they did a study a long time ago at University of uh I believe it's in

[00:19:56] Virginia I think or maybe Indiana and they looked at kids who were asked to hand write versus type the answers to essay questions and the kids who were handwriting used longer sentences bigger words more ideas and and produce it faster than the kids who were typing and there and they were measuring their cortical activity in their Court activity was way more with the handwriting that's digression but it's important to your point that that there's so many nerve endings concentrated in our hands that we really need to to keep them functioning and get them back to function as quickly as possible so you mentioned already the carpal tunnel let's talk about what this carpal tunnel syndrome is it's come up a couple of times and obviously there's there's technically what's carpal tunnel syndrome and then there's the symptoms of it which can be produced by compression or injury elsewhere but what creates the tunnel per se yeah so it's great it's super cool when you look and cross-section if you if you took a cross section through the hand right here the the carpal tunnel is created by a Roman arch of Bones just like the Roman arches where that Central core I can't remember the name of the bone Keystone maybe it wedges in and keeps that Arch intact and that's exactly what we have in the reverse then we have a tie bar across the top which is a very thick transverse carpal ligament and it holds that together and that creates a a just a a

[00:21:25] U-shaped parabolic inverted Parabola tunnel through which the nine flexor tendons and the median nerve pass in a k occasionally a medium-sized artery now explain why there are nine flexor tendons right so there's two to each finger lesser finger and then there's only one to the thumb and uh and those are it's it's fascinating to to look into that and see it just so happens that position wise if we look at our hip Palm up the median nerve is running down almost the center of the wrist and it is the most superficial so that if we then

[00:22:06] Flex our wrist down and those flexor tendons are trying to bow string down they will press that median nerve up against that rigid transverse carpal ligament if we have swelling edema inflammatory tissue such as in rheumatoid arthritis where that builds up that becomes a space occupying lesion in a fixed confined cross-sectional area and then it compresses that nerve the nerve the tendons aren't really vulnerable in that way but the nerve is very vulnerable to compression that's why it's such a ubiquitous problem and so from a motor standpoint the median nerve controls which function versus the ulnar nerve great so important of a question and and by the way there is some confusion people very often come to me and say I think I have median nerve I mean I think I have uh carpal carpal tunnel syndrome and and the thing they don't you know just because it's such a ubiquitous Band-Aid about term but you must have numbness and tingling in the median nerve distribution which is the Palm side of the thumb index middle and usually half of the ring finger if you don't have numbness and tingling there you you're very unlikely to have carpal tunnel syndrome however if you have an arthritic process you can without having as much numbness and tingling you can have isolated atrophy of the muscles the thenar the thumb muscles here that give us our opposable thumb you can have atrophy that looks like an indentation right there and some people can have that quietly it can be just a very gradual just from the encroachment on that nerve of the bone spurs that grow through the arthritic process so that's the exception where sometimes you can have isolated motor and very rarely in a younger person I will see where they have an odd motor brand which is the nerve that comes off the median nerve that goes to those muscles they'll have a weird compression of just that so a younger person who doesn't have any numbness and tingling and then has isolated uh atrophy so that needs to be addressed surgically as well but the the thing that fits with the carpal tunnel is that if you're pregnant there's a lot often in the third trimester when women are dealing this is just because of swelling just because of swelling the fluid imbalances that are going on there that's a possibility people who use Jack hammers or people who are cyclists and they're always pressing down and putting extra pressure on that area can get carpal tunnel syndrome only when they're cycling so it's a dynamic situation weight lifters can get it depending on what the style of what they're doing but the stereotype is people who are typing a lot isn't it yeah that is um is that a true carpal tunnel syndrome so generally speaking most people don't get carpal tunnel just from typing there was a massive class action lawsuit against IBM hundred years ago I don't know how long and they lost because they couldn't prove I mean IBM didn't lose yeah they lost the case because they couldn't prove that it was caused there was no data to suggest that it was caused by uh just using a keyboard however if you already have it absolutely that activity will exacerbate it and and er that's why ergonomics are so important you know sitting there how you're sitting I mean during covet everybody went back home and and worked from home and worked at a sometimes random the kitchen table or their bed with their laptop and their kind of odd angles so a lot more of these both wrist tendonitis and carpal tunnel syndrome after that which you don't that doesn't affect the ulnar nerve which is the other nerve that we're talking about the ulnar nerve is so important because while our opposable thumb is critically important that's governed mostly by the by the median nerve the ulnar nerve supplies almost all the rest of the muscles small muscles of the hand and those we call the intrinsic muscles of the hand which are basically what allow us to spread our fingers apart pull our fingers together do these weird funky positions that we do like the intrinsic plus position there that that position being able to do that with your hand is almost all ulnar nerve and if you cut the ulnar nerve right here at the wrist your hand will do just that and you will not be able to do anything but but a little bit of that you can't so the so the flexors of each finger are all ulnar well the the intrinsic flexors or ulnar the extra forensics are split between the median more approximately in the form or split between the median but lifting a finger this way is intrinsic yeah lifting yes this way at the sort of the this knuckle level isn't all intrinsic and we don't have extenders extensors we or we do we do but not intrinsically we have well and not for the these level the MP joints that's extrinsic extension but what I mean the the I'd love to draw a picture of the finger mechanism I I it's made so it just I I just find it so cool it's so much more complicated than biomechanically than the flexors the flexors are pretty simple and what's fascinating about the hand is despite you know being able to play Rachmaninoff or um a violent concerto or be able to do so many um build a watch yeah [Music] um the hand is actually more primitive of a strike it's it's still it's pretty much unchanged except for the opposable thumb it's a pretty primitive structure in the sense of evolutionarily speaking our foot is a is a fantastically um adapted and modified over Evolution to walk we were talking about that before when we started walking on all fours our I mean when we stood up and became biped it's our foot completely changed right so the is I mean I know we joke about it but is the opposable thumb the primary difference between us and a primate yes well it depends on high we're we're part of the higher Prime yeah between the lower the lower primates exactly that's really and that's why you know we're not orb or once we were no longer arboreal where our thumb was in the plane of the palm and we would hang from you know tree limbs yeah then when we came around we could start making tools and developing our I mean and that's that's the thing our brains grew when we started using our hands and making tools that's when our brains our heads enlarged so I mean it's just so cool yeah so I I mean I consider and talk about the hand all day especially given how little I I understand it um so what are some of the other injuries that are pretty common um either again the the the injury you'll see more commonly in the 60 70 year old versus in the athlete the the kind of the wear and tear injuries uh what are the most common fractures yeah so yeah I think we would break it up into the acute traumatic events which are most often fractures but can be also dislocations and then we then we would say the wear and tear type injuries which are usually start in middle age and go on into older age and then the um and then the actual um what was the third that we were talking about um we said that for oh oh and then and then the um the absolute degenerative arthritic types of problems that are inevitable for many of us and they vary among individuals based on genetics and lifestyle and so forth and so the fractures uh the most common by far is the distal radius fracture that's just the big bone of the radius now the radius the form is super cool because we already talked about the elbow we looked at that really complex weird undulating structure there the ulna that we talked about is the the elbow bone that we feel the prominence of our elbow and that's a straight bone and that goes down and forms the the bump here that we see on the back of our wrist and that's the ulna the radius is is is a curved arcing bone that is curved so it can get around the radius as we pronate and supinate so the radius is flared and provides the biggest structure at the risk level and but it's much smaller at the elbow level and so it rotates around through a fixed ulna the ulna never moves uh it I mean it moves this way but it doesn't move rotation relatively and and the radius just rotates back and forth so any disruption of that can dramatically alter our ability to hold a a bowl of soup or to to pronate and type and write and so and that can be disrupted in many ways the fractures the radius is is super common uh to fall and have a bending moment on that and it and it fractures and displaces and but then you can often you know something Falls hard on you uh you fall I mean we see them commonly and kids who are falling off the jungle gyms they'll have a both bone forearm fracture in the mid forearm and that's just another bending moment those bones break them half or sometimes they Bend one of them breaks one of them bends if they're the kids are young enough and so that very can very much disrupt the function there and so at any different point along the form depending on the mechanism these bones can break and when they do if they're displaced we have to often fix them except in very young kids that reminds me by the way I don't know what it is I I vaguely remember this from from medical school and I never saw them in residency although I told it was very common but I guess I just didn't do enough to to see it where a parent grabs a kid by the arm the yank him across the road and what what is that injury that's supposed to be pretty common that's nursemaid's elbow and that is a subluxation of that yeah that round radial head at the elbow and I had the um I guess interesting and informative experience to create one in my own daughter I wish you would like to be my first first daughter I would spin her around you know like you see people yeah and I remember spinning her around she was giggling and so forth and then I felt just the tiniest little weird movement in her elbow it kind of threw her hand and I saw her face start to scrunch up I set her down her face and then I just had this Vision I knew what it was I quickly did the reduction maneuver so fast that she hadn't even started crying and then it just immediately stopped hurting and she wanted I could tell she was getting ready to start crying but then she had no reason to because it didn't hurt so it was kind of we were in that that and remind me what that reduction is again so what's happening so the radius which is on this side the outer side exactly when you pronate and you pull and kind of give a various moment it will cause that radial head just to slip out this way a little bit Yeah so the easy maneuver because the stable position is just you supinate and you put a little pressure on that you supinate and then Flex the elbow up so this is the most stable position of that bone it'll pop right back in yeah every time now if you if there's stay out and then you go sit in an emergency room for eight hours harder and harder to get back in you often have to do it under anesthesia to this day I am still paranoid anytime I have to grab one of my boys yeah but I'm gonna do it and I'm always like trying to figure out if you're ready you're ready now I'm ready to reduce it if I ever screw it up um so yeah I've seen I've seen a lot of radial fractures in in friends and kids and um it doesn't it really seems like one of those awful luck things sometimes like if you fall out of a tree you fall out of a tree and if you're if you slip on Ice That You Don't See and you're totally not ready for that fall it can happen to the best person I guess there's yeah and then the older we get of course if we have a little osteoporosis osteopenia on x-ray and osteoporosis then it takes less and less

[00:34:15] Force to fracture those bones and yeah what breaks the ulnar bone does it ever break on its own so there's the most common one is a direct blow via it can be in football it can be a weight falling it can be um a door smashing into you is a what's called a night stick fracture and it's named for that because especially the the billy clubs in in the UK where you know that that would you know strike you when your hand was up and it cracks the ulna along there that's the most common and but it can often be fractured also in association with the distal radius the styloid part can come off it's attached to a ligament or that just they can just both snap same time and that complicates the treatment but it's so those are the most common ones and then the other one which is really more of an elbow fracture but it's the ulna is the olecranon and that's a common common fracture and that's really simple I see those in very that's when you're you fall in your exactly you fall on your elbow the only other way you can kind of pull that bone off is if you fall really hard say snow skiing you're falling hard and eccentric load the triceps pulls it right off and um yeah I mean you're the expert on e-centric loading and I love the fact that you educate so many people about that because it's way more um injurious in a way what about the chronic sort of injuries of the hand and wrist that ultimately require surgical care yeah so there's there's you can break them down into sort of overuse patterns which are more tendonitis and if you have a long enough standing tendonitis you can start to it the tendonitis is antinosynovitis so those are subtle differences a tendonitis is just inflammation in the tendon and if it's beginning to wear and tear and degenerate you'll get some longitudinal fissuring in those those collagen fibers and then it fills in with some inflammatory tissue and then that can envelop the tendon and so you're getting kind of a constant rubbing and further degeneration of that you get chronic pain you can inject it with cortisone but then ultimately they can rupture and and depending on how much and how much force they're being subjected to and for how long it's been there so that's one then the tinosynovitis is a subset of that where we have these effectively watertight tubes specifically in our flexor tendons and those tendons are gliding beautifully in there there's a little bit of fluid our body produces to keep them gliding smoothly and a little bit of what we call Tina synovium which is just a filmy structure that gives them some lubricating tefloni feel if that gets inflamed from overuse whether you're a violinist or a heavy weight lifter doing all sorts of things over and over again you can develop inflammation there and then that becomes trapped in there and it really hurts it can eliminate mobility and it can even cause them sometimes to lock down and those are super common and we can often cure them with just cortisone shots or rest or both but then ultimately a subset of them because they're so ubiquitous requires surgery which is very minor but it's important because the hand function if you have one finger that's really stiff whether you dislocated it or even just sprained it the other fingers they're all linked so indelibly together that actually it will make your whole hand feel stiff yeah so it's funny you say that so as you know

[00:37:44] I'm really obsessed with grip strength and all sorts of crazy Shenanigans and um um uh maybe about a year ago I started experimenting kind of like training sort of the way that rock climbers do where you're using only finger strength and um what blew me away was how much weaker I felt all the way through my lats when

[00:38:10] I would restrict the amount of fingers I could use to pull up wow yeah so if if you just said do pull-ups yeah right you can use your whole hand do pull-ups no problem yeah you just barely notice that I feel like you know I'm perfectly connected from the bar to my last yes and now you say Okay Peter you're not going to get to use your whole hand or your thumb just use your four fingers yeah actually that gets a little harder it took me a while to work up to 10 finger four finger pull-ups well that's impressive that you can do that because yeah I know exactly what it took a long time I mean it took it took a couple months yeah then I moved to three finger Pull-Ups

[00:38:48] I mean it's an order of magnitude harder it's crazy right and I don't think I've been able to I don't know I don't know that I even got to try two finger because I was still really nowhere near getting to ten three finger pull-ups and and so why is that because is I'm no less strong in my lats in my biceps and all these other muscles why is it that simply take and by the way it was the pinky that I was removing of all fingers right you'd think it does nothing why when I can only have these three fingers does all of my strength Fade Away I've never been asked that directly but I have a couple of theories on that one is and it applies to sort of the weakness I feel and detect asymmetrically in in um let's say a rotator cuff if you have a small partial thickness rotator cuff tear well that's tiny it's mechanically not relevant yeah and yet you can be quite weak your brain is the smart is so smart it knows it doesn't want to over stress that area so I my instinct is that the first reaction especially when you've never done that before is for your brain to say whoa that's putting way too much tension on the other one so

[00:40:02] I'm going to relax everything I'm not going to give you what you need because I may rupture interesting right I think that's probably the biggest explanation for that but specifically when you're talking about grip strength what's ironic is that the the ulnar nerve which is only these two fingers is much more important for grip strength than these interesting so if you have these if you have let's say you have an ulnar nerve that's completely in and a median nerve that's out you're going to be pretty strong still whereas if you have a ulnar nerve out and a median nerve that's still in you're going to be much weaker wow so just for people listening to us which hopefully nobody's just listening to this podcast because it's hard to but you're saying pinky and ring finger matter more to grit to grip than middle finger forefinger thumb which is under the median distribution um

[00:40:56] I don't I I agree with I mean that that even just feel I feel like I can engage my forearms much more yeah with my pinky and ring finger oh yeah for sure absolutely why is that I mean it's Evolution I guess that's insane yeah yeah you know what it makes me wonder I should be doing these three fingers that's what I think that's what happened because I was doing yeah yeah oh that's

[00:41:21] I'm gonna try that today good report back to me I'll let you just learn that rather than me having to learn it that is amazing I I just you know I'm endlessly fascinated by what our hands are capable of and I think of it as such a um well such a force multiplier for our species right right right it's it's an unbelievable asset and our ability to carry things oh yeah is you know Michael

[00:41:46] Easter has written about this at length in his book The Comfort crisis which of course is what has introduced us all to rucking um but you know other animals can carry a lot if they're domesticated and you put it on their back but in terms of like you know we can carry our body weight and our hands it's crazy and no that that is mind-boggling and and it speaks to kind of remarkable engineering and to think that a lot of that is is made possible by this opposable thumb as well is is pretty is pretty cool and even going back to the Elbow anatomically when you look at the Vitruvian man and and when you look at the the the the standard anatomic position of of uh in medicine the elbow has a carrying angle built into it to get what to get it away away from our body yeah so we can carry more so we have a 12 to 15 degree natural built-in what's called valgus or away from our bodies to give us more area to carry heavy things with it's super cool so let's talk about the final category of these which are the arthritics and um here you have really two you have this rheumatoid or autoimmune form of arthritis which you know I think anybody who's seen patients with that recognize it is is just looks like an awful Affliction yes um where it's it's not only functionally uh impeding but also physically deforming of of the fingers and the joints yes uh versus the much more common Osteo arthritic which I assume is is more a wear and tear than just a you know it doesn't have that autoimmune component so first of all what's the distribution and breakdown of those and which one of those ultimately can can require surgical interventions so historically in just in my Orthopedic lifetime

[00:43:26] I see very few now rheumatoid arthritic and what we would call the the um an RA negative where the testing we know they have the the visible yeah the phenotype they don't necessarily have all the lab stories to uh lab uh um abnormalities to back them up but I see way more now less than I ever saw before because because the medical therapy they're so amazing they have been absolute game changers and keep people normal for such a long time so that's one thing but in general I mean when I started practice I would see

[00:44:05] I would have to operate as often in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis and those deformities that happen and you're trying to beat them beat the body to addressing the deformities so they don't get bad enough to where they really require joint Replacements and much more complicated recoveries and so forth so it's always it was always a battle and kind of like you racing a car you know you're just trying to get get just a little bit ahead and just do whatever you can do to to win that and now I mean

[00:44:37] I would say I probably see maybe one a month okay that needs surgery and it's pretty rare So and the surgery is because of such a significant functional limitation yes yeah it's always uh in the case I mean it can be in the elbow can be in the shoulder but usually in the hand and it's a tendon subluxation joint deviation that then weakens their hand and decreases their ability to remain independent the goal obviously and to the point of what our hands do for us if we maintain reasonably good hand function we can remain independent as soon as we leave our hand lose our hand function we become dependent on others period and so that's what our whole goal is to maintain that that

[00:45:25] Fierce Independence um so yeah that's that but then on the other hand then we have uh the uh the wear and tear osteoarthritis concept and and that varies among individuals some people have really good hands till the very end um and they have I liken it to a paint job you know on a car a cheap one we talked about that before and versus a very nice thick paint job that that holds up but there is a big genetic component I see patients come in that'll maybe be you know only 50 very young they'll come in and they'll already have a lot of the visible alterations not terrible functionally but they're getting the knobbiness they're getting a little bit of inflammation in the the joints out here maybe down at the thumb base and they'll say hey so what can you do my hands look exactly like my moms did or my my dads did and there's there's there's real evidence to support that some people are more predisposed than others now the one exception is the ubiquitous about 50 of all of us will develop arthritis at the base of our thumb and that's that opposable thumb and that's the problem with that is it's all about biomechanics it has to do too much there's six degrees of freedom it's just this biconcave saddle joint that in order to come back and forth this way radial and ulnar deviation then straight up Palmer abduction that way and then rotating around and pronating in order to oppose the thumb tip to the fingertips it's doing three different directional movements and and this joint is doing this and this and this and it just wears out and so it's just subjected to so many odd stresses and it's unstable like the shoulder by definition it gives it that amazing Mobility yeah and so so what do we so 50 percent of people in their lifetime if I'm hearing it correctly will experience osteoarthritis of that joint yes in what fraction of those people will it pose a functional limitation that is you know not something that's just treatable with some Aleve here and there so we we know that obviously we don't know what percentage of the population that all of us as a group are treating but we do know uh what we do know is that we don't know the exact subset we know there's many people walking around with basal arthritis that never have pain they have some stiffness some deformity and they don't hurt we know that we don't know that exact number however what we do know that and we've published papers on this is that of the people that present with some pain about 25 of those which would be I guess 12 and a half percent of the overall population potentially are are going to need surgery on that at some point so that's four remember one-fourth of the people that present with pain and the thumb are going to need surgery and what is the surgical procedure it varies depending on what stage they present at and we've done staging systems and so forth but it's some form of reconstruction unlike the hips and knees that are so ubiquitous and so wonderful they've kept people back to their fully active lives by by doing them we don't have those kind of great implants for this that just doesn't they don't work there's very high failure rates if if a if a hip replacement or knee replacement has a five percent failure rate at five or ten years the thumbs are 70 failure rate of all the previous uh so what we do and was invented by my forbearers and we've modified them over time but it's basically doing a reconstruction using your own tissue and that's what's super cool which we didn't mention is because of the way our limbs evolved we have so much protective redundancy we have so many tendons like all of the flexor tendons that Flex the fingers also Flex the wrist and give us strength just like you were talking about with the pull-ups well you have wrist flexors that only attach right here that also give you that flexion and we and those all are housed in the forearm and then you have the extensors that do that and then you have some that are just we have multiple tendons that pull the thumb out they do subtle differences but we can use those and we do use those to transfer and to use them as tendon grafts now a cool thing that goes back to the evolution is if you look at your hand hold your hands out and and Pull and flex your wrist a little bit and let me see

[00:50:11] I can't tell from yours you can see here you can look on yourself you can see here I have this big tendon that comes up when I yes yeah so on this side I don't have one it's just missing oh I have huge ones yeah okay so evolutionarily that's the that's the palmaris longus right those are hugely developed in quadrupeds and horses and so forth a big important muscle well don't do anything in us they don't do anything so we use that as a tendon graft all the time we just take it I mean just it's attached a little whipped I'm closer to the horses closer

[00:50:45] I I knew that about you and uh so mine we're evolving away 15 of people don't so does that mean you're not actually addressing the surface of the saddle joint which is arthritic in this procedure Point you're not recreating some artificial joint what we're creating is a pseudoarthrosis we stabilize it get it stabilized back on top in my case I take a little bit of the bone off to create a space and then

[00:51:11] I roll up the rest of tendon and put it in there and that relieves the pain and restores function yes so there's a high success operation very high success yeah very high I don't know how I didn't realize you could make a case that roughly five to ten percent of the population will require this at some point in their life yeah if their activity obviously a subset are a very sedentary and don't do much and they're not going to need it and they'll wear a splint for the rest of their days but wow but if they're presenting with the pain that's the point we don't know what the in is but other than being the general population as a whole but people who present with pain yeah are active enough so would you say this is the single most common non-traumatic surgical repair of the hand um non-traumatic other than a well and even a trigger finger you could attribute to um so of the major surgery done in the hand yes by far okay by far so you mentioned trigger finger what's that well trigger finger is what we were talking about before where the inflammation of the sheath uh and then right in the middle here there's a series of pulleys and these are super cool I'm going to draw a picture if I may yeah okay so we're looking at the side of the hand yeah so we're looking and let's just say this is the middle finger um it's the longest and this is the metacarpal this is the first of the three bones of the finger proper and what I've drawn here this black line coming underneath is the flexor tendon and that's the one that does curls all our curl allows you to do all your pull-ups and so there's four bones there just so people can see you know I don't want them to miss the one this one is kind of hidden within the hand because that's through here yeah and so then there's the three successive and so if you just if you had a muscle attached to this and you pulled on it and didn't have those blue structures then this would bow string just like a fishing pole if you don't have if you don't put your the fishing line through the eyelets then it just stays way away yeah and it's actually stronger that way but you lose all the mobility so you you lose the capacity to really curl your fingers tightly so that's what they're gliding through and those are fibro osseous tunnels um and just fibrous tissue very strong and which you were mentioned rock climbing they can rupture because you're putting so much force on those in such funky positions and isolating two fingers one finger and so forth so I see that a lot in rock climbers but the the point here is that as you're rubbing constantly going back and forth whether you're playing a concerto or you're rock climbing you can get inflamed along that sheath this particular pulley here is down in the palm and that's the most common sight to have inflammation to where you can even get some nodular swelling in the tendon and that thickening up of that pulley and then it just actually catches and we call it a trigger finger because it's like a pulling a trigger on a gun it it it has that feeling so so that's and we frequently have to inject those with

[00:54:20] Cortisone and frequently have to operate on their ubiquitous and about half of them recover with just a cortisone injection yeah I always say actually more in the order depending on how if we get to them if you take someone who presents within say six weeks of onset there's about a 75 cure rate with one or two injections okay so the longer you wait the more likely potential damage you cause and the more chronic inflammation that ensures correct but we don't and this applies kind of a general consensus something we talked about this before when we were talking about cortisone shots is in these types of soft tissue procedures we don't keep injecting cortisone cortisone cortisone because it can lead to soft tissue degradation and ultimately even tendon ruptures I've never seen one in my practice but we know they can exist and what do you use as a rule of thumb for how many times you'll put three three at three in the lifetime of the joint three in the lifetime of that tendon sheath unless it's very very broad usually you don't see someone back 10 years later who needs another injection but if I did I'd be willing to do that again because everything has normalized physiologically at that point now the other cool thing that I was talking about before when we were talking about the you ask about the extensors versus the flexors so if we look at the red but this is the extrinsic extensor tendon that will straighten up the knuckles but then we look further out and we see well that only stops that tendon stops at the middle knuckle but what allows what pulls the whole finger straight and it's actually this intrinsic muscle here that's tapering down and has a very thin tendon it turns into a lateral band and it travels from the Palm side up above the middle knuckle above that axis of rotation and then it goes all the way out and attaches to the tip and so it's a super cool mechanism that through a series of mechanical placements it's able to extend the finger even though by Contracting Yeah by Contracting it's crazy I mean most people wouldn't immediately get that you have great biomechanical sense because yes by Contracting it's straightening up the finger it's super cool yeah and so but but it doesn't take much like if you take a a direct blow to that knuckle right there and that tendon just slips because you've disrupted some soft tissue it can slip below the axis of rotation then it becomes a flexor and you get a boot near deformity which looks like that you cannot straighten your finger up because those those lateral bands that are used to extending the finger have slipped down now they become a flexor just like you said yeah so it's super cool and and just so into circuit and I vaguely remember one sort of surgical emergency in the hand where where that sheath would become infected yes very good yes it's one of the few um really Orthopedic emergencies in the hand which is uh yes Tina synovitis and then it becomes separative or or infected and pus in there and those people I mean there's so many nerves in our hand anyway when you get even a few drops of purulent pus in the finger sheath it hurts like crazy and you your posture is down like this you can't straighten your finger up at all and it's exquisitely tender and it looks swollen just along that sheath and yeah it's an operative urgency or emergency and how does how does a person get that infection it usually an open injury or yeah sometimes just a little it can even be a pin prick it's sometimes an insect bite uh you know with a stinger um and often just a tiny little you know you can be like a um a graph if you're using sports equipment you get a little graphite tiny stiff graphite puncture how often how many times a year do you see one of those I don't see them as much but they they're ubiquitous I mean they're coming all the time well year round okay so we do an exam of the hand and wrist no let's do it let's do it great

[00:58:30] okay so now um you know we've we've been talking a lot about the kind of a forearm wrist and hand and so we can go through some of the common diagnoses of those um again inspection is so important we look for swelling if you have what's called de queer veins tennis synovitis you'll see swelling here if you have basal drone arthritis you'll see bulging here if you have a a torn or radio collateral ligament then you'll see a resting deviation of the thumb and and it's very prominent um if you have some arthritis or tenosynovitis of the big extensor tendon through here on the owner's side that'll be prominent a ganglion cyst of course sticks out like a big you know well goose egg there on top usually most commonly right here um we look for atrophy very important we were talking about that before so if I look at your hand there's three places that look for atrophy I look over here and I see that that's plump and not flattened out and what it'll do is it'll look like a gaunt um you know face and then over here I look here this also can develop a an atrophy there I had a young woman a long time ago had never been reported who had traumatically very active athletic person who had dramatically torn off that first dorsaloneurosius muscle so she didn't have a nerve problem she tore the insertion right off of there which is what gives you that strength there and so she had just already atrophying this was at four weeks it was already atrophy so I reattached it and it came back it's fine then and very importantly looking at the thenar muscles we want to see a nice plump convex surface if it starts to flatten or even just be soft when you palpate it then we worry about the nerve not enough nerve signal going to that and developing the early atrophy so we look at that we look at the rotation so again we've been we've inspected I'm not going to test strength yet I'm going to look at rotation I mean a wrist and finger motion so we look at the full pronation full supination very subtly between individuals but more or less we're looking for 90 90 of pronation supination and then we look at the wrist and we want to see that you have roughly that can vary a lot but somewhere between 70 and 90 of extension and 70 and 90 of flexion we want to know if that hurts or if we feel crepitus that crunchy feeling that can indicate inflammation in the joint similarly when we're pronating supinating we're feeling for inflammation there if you walk in and you have a very prominent distal ulna especially asymmetrically that's important to me because and especially if you had a traumatic accident these are commonly missed there's a some thick ligaments here the druj ligaments and those can allow the ulna to rise and the radius to fall away from that and it's it's very disabling especially for athletes and so I see it in hockey players who take the slam and so I'm checking that and looking for that stability there as I as I rotate and watch it um then so we we've we've looked at uh range of motion now that for the thumb this joint right here the mCP joint uh where you have a skiers thumb for the ulnar collateral ligament and a radio collateral ligament tear though that's the most variable joint in the body in terms of varying among individuals so you have a minus 30 passively and you

[01:02:03] Flex nicely down to about 70 we look at my thumb I hyper extend a lot more but I only Flex down to about 40. and that's just everybody's different so we want to compare the 2 and c and especially on laxity even side to side if I'm testing this and you have a tear it'll go way over sometimes to 60 degrees 70 degrees either direction we know that's asymmetric and that's not going to withstand and need to be repaired fingers you know we we want to just simply see if you can make a tight fist which you can you can really nicely curl those fingers down if you've had various injuries that's going to be altered when you straighten them back up if one of them stays stuck down then you probably have a locked trigger finger and I have to pry that open and then I feel and palpate I feel a nodule I feel the swelling and the tendon the tenderness and then we know that's what you have it's very easy now next we we need to remember that for a lot of overuse strain whether you're a professional musician or working out in a in a gym regularly or irregularly more commonly there's two sites where you can get the most common injury and you know this in

[01:03:09] Spades is the musculotendinous junction you talked about The Eccentric loading and as there's two spots for that there's one right here and there's one right here there's these short tendons that attach to the bones up here and you can get the muscle tendonjunction injured there and you can get where the tendons become the long tendons and the muscle that that um that transition zone and those are the two places so we're going to test those a lot of patients come in and say

[01:03:34] I'm having pain here every time I try to work out or play tennis or whatever or here and so that's what we're feeling for now I can test this you pull up against me heart as Rock Solid pull down against me down this way hard and that's great we have your thumb pull up this way as super strong have you spread your fingers out real stiff that's beaut that very strong now that is overlaying into the nerve exam that we look for and that those are the intrinsic muscles that's the ulnar nerve if you have a bad ulnar nerve from here to here it's going to give way and just fall away and they'll be weak similarly I want to look at your thenar strength and have you come bring your thumb right up out of the Palm like you're a good higher primate and then push against me and that's Rock Solid and that's we see this bulb bulge up there and so that tells us that your thenar muscle and your median nerve are working fine um let's see what other common things you know something is simple we we didn't talk about this too much but so common and ubiquitous are just sprained fingers people Jam their fingers baseball softball working out whatever and what's crazy is you sprain these these joints and we can palpate those those and we can test them some people tear them but we test them they feel fine they're strong but they're swollen they're bulbous they tender and that can take months and months to go away so you just have to counsel people your patients my patients to just be patient with it keep using them there's no harm in using them the cool thing about ligaments is they heal with motion so we don't want to immobilize them too long that's a common misper perception I see patients who have had bad sprains even dislocations and they they they're put into a splint they come see me three weeks later they're already stiff I would move those immediately maybe one to two days to rest them a little bit and then get a movie Okay so we've done we've done and and remember and well you know this and not remember but we were talking about the fact that we have the extrinsic tendons both the extensors and the flexors and those are muscles through here and then tendons through here all the way out to the fingertips so we we can isolate and find let's say you have a little you're cutting an avocado and you poke right in there you have maybe numbness along here we know you cut the digital nerve there and this finger when you make a fist this one just stays up like that and that that tells me that there's something wrong with the tendon then I I try to isolate that say what can you bend the tip and you say oh yeah I can bend the tip but then I say and that isolates the long flexor but then I do this and you and you can't bend it then that says okay you cut the superficial one of the two tendons there so it's really easy anatomically to figure these things out um and um I think that's about it if you have it we talked about the dinner Fork deformity if you have a distal radius fracture across here it comes up here and goes this way I mean there's a true notable deformity and so we're you know the the population with your help is becoming younger and younger and so we are more and more aggressive because there are 70 80 90 year olds who are working out who are playing sports and we want to keep them going as long as possible because I'm getting close to that and so uh you know so we we fix those we get them back my mom was 80 82 and she broke her wrist put a titanium plate on there and she was she right you didn't even know that she had it and she was using it the you know two weeks later so [Music]
