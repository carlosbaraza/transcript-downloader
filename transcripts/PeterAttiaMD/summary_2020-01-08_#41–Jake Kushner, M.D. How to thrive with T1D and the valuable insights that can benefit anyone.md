## Description

Original release date: 2/18/19

In this episode, Jake Kushner, pediatric endocrinologist specializing in helping people with type 1 diabetes and Medical Director of McNair Interests, discusses the best strategies to live and thrive with T1D, especially as it relates to diet and exercise. We also discuss why many patients who control their blood sugar with high amounts of exogenous insulin are at a substantially higher risk than people who can control their blood sugar at lower levels of insulin. This concept has great implications for non-diabetics as well considering the increasing prevalence of diseases related to insulin resistance. We also cover some of the basics, the history, the increasing prevalence of type 1 diabetes, and more importantly, what we can do to help kids with this disease, and their families.

We discuss:
-How Jake became interested in type 1 diabetes [5:30];
-The pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes, the increase in prevalence, and the role of beta cells [17:00];
-The role of body weight and BMI in the risk of developing T1D [27:00];
-Genetics of T1D and the risk of inheritance [32:00];
-Hemoglobin A1c [36:15];
-Insulin: the amazing story of its discovery, its effect on cellular metabolism and IGF-1, and why the hell it’s so expensive [39:15];
-Diabetes Control and Complication Trial: blood glucose and the complications associated with diabetes [54:45];
-Cognitive impairment, epigenetic changes, and other dangers associated with high, peak blood glucose, and big swings in blood glucose levels [1:09:15];
-Depression, anxiety, and other challenges of living with T1D [1:15:30];
-Jake’s realization that the current standard of care of T1D is inadequate [1:26:15];
-Managing diabetes with exercise [1:30:15];
-The Bernstein method, and protein’s impact on glucose and insulin [1:36:15];
-Jake radically changes his approach to treating patients [1:45:00];
-What other tools are there for controlling T1D? [1:49:45];
-Is the ketogenic diet appropriate for those with T1D? [1:52:45];
-The most important lessons that can be applied by the non-diabetic population [1:59:00];
-The two dream measurements Peter wishes were available [2:04:00]; and
-More.

## AI Summary

Here's my structured analysis of this episode of The Drive with Dr. Jake Kushner:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focuses on Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) management, featuring pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Jake Kushner. The discussion covers the history of insulin discovery, modern treatment approaches, and the importance of low-carbohydrate diets in managing T1D. Key themes include the psychological burden of T1D management and the relationship between insulin levels and cardiovascular disease.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- T1D affects approximately 1 in 300 people [00:15:22]
- About 30% of children still present with DKA at diagnosis [00:12:13]
- Hemoglobin A1c of 9% associated with 6-fold increased risk of death [01:03:02]
- Protein converts to glucose at roughly 10g protein to 6g carbohydrate ratio [01:46:36]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) is essential for T1D management [01:50:31]
- Lower carbohydrate intake reduces insulin requirements [01:38:11]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Regular insulin better for protein coverage than rapid-acting analogs [01:50:36]
- Exercise can reduce insulin requirements by up to two-thirds [01:03:02]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Medications mentioned:
- Regular human insulin vs. rapid-acting analogs [01:50:36]
- SGLT2 inhibitors (discussed regarding risks) [01:56:04]

5. **Exercise & Movement**:
- Distance running more effective than strength training for glucose control [01:34:35]
- Exercise can reduce insulin requirements dramatically through AMPK pathway [01:33:16]

6. **Nutrition & Diet**:
- Low-carb approach recommended for T1D management [01:44:17]
- Protein requires insulin coverage but with different timing than carbs [01:46:36]

7. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Hemoglobin A1c target of 5.7-5.9% possible with proper management [00:37:57]
- CGM standard deviation goals discussed [01:12:23]

8. **References & Resources**:
- Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution book [01:38:11]
- Type 1 Grit Facebook group [01:45:39]
- Low Carb Down Under organization [01:51:49]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"The cognitive load in some ways is probably a really pivotal factor in the anxiety and depression that's associated with type 1 diabetes" [01:19:50]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
- Long-term effects of nutritional ketosis in T1D patients
- Future developments in artificial pancreas technology
- Role of insulin in cardiovascular disease independent of glucose levels
