## Description

Original release date: 7/2/2018

In this episode, Tim talks both experientially and from his own deep dive into the literature of psychedelics and mental health. Tim is shifting his focus from investing in startups to funding experiments that he hopes will establish more reliable knowledge and therapeutic options for those suffering from anxiety, depression, and addiction. If this topic even remotely interests you, I can’t recommend Tim’s podcast with Michael Pollan, author of How to Change Your Mind, enough. (You should definitely read Pollan’s book as well.) Even if you’ve never had any exposure to psychedelics or their potential applications, I think you’ll find this subject matter really interesting, and I was very grateful for Tim to be so open and honest about his experiences. Tim also shared his short list of acquired wisdom he returns to most reliably, which might be worth the price of admission alone. 

We discuss: 
- Tim’s history of depression and his TED Talk on his close call with suicide; 
- The type of thinking that triggers Tim’s downward spirals;
- Tim’s transformative experience with ayahuasca; 
- How Tim’s experience and research has led him to focus on furthering the science of psychedelics and mental health; 
- What some of the meditation modalities, and meditation apps, are out there, 
- Why can meditation be so hard to do, but also worthwhile to stick with; 
- Why Tim made a big commitment (more than $1 million) to funding scientific research, and to psilocybin and MDMA research, in particular; 
- From all the habits and tools that Tim has learned, the five things that he returns to most reliably; and 
- More.
