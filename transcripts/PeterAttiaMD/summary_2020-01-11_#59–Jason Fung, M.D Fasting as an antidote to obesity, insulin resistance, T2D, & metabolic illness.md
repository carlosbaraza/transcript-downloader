Full title: #59 – Jason Fung, M.D.: Fasting as a potent antidote to obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and the many symptoms of metabolic illness

Original release date: 6/24/19

In this episode, Jason Fung, nephrologist and best-selling author, shares his experiences utilizing an individualized approach to fasting to successfully treat thousands of overweight, metabolically ill, and diabetic patients, and why being a doctor who specializes in kidney disease gives him a unique insight into early indications of metabolic disease. We also have a great discussion on insulin resistance where Jason makes the case that we should actually think of hyperinsulinemia as the underlying problem. We also discuss the difference between time-restricted feeding, intermittent fasting, and dietary restriction (e.g., low-carb) and how they can be used to attack the root cause of T2D, metabolic syndrome, and obesity. We also have a fascinating discussion about the limitations of evidence-based medicine which leads to a conversation where we compare and contrast the scientific disciplines of medicine and biology to theoretical physics.

We discuss:
-Comparing scientific disciplines: Medicine and biology versus physics [7:25];
-The limitations of evidence-based medicine [12:30];
-Early signs of metabolic disease: How specializing kidney disease gives -Jason a unique insight into early indications of illness [20:50]
-Insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and the overflow paradigm [29:30];
-Why the common treatments for type 2 diabetes seem to make things worse [42:30];
-How hyperinsulinemia (not insulin resistance) drives metabolic syndrome [53:15];
-Insulin and weight gain, and using fasting to empty the cells of glucose [59:30];
-The two step process of developing type 2 diabetes and how they are both manifestations of hyperinsulinemia [1:03:15];
-NAFLD and hyperinsulinemia: A vicious cycle [1:08:30];
-Are the features and symptoms of diabetes actually protective? [1:12:15];
-Is obesity causing insulin resistance or is it the other way around? [1:17:30];
-What role does inflammation play in obesity? [1:21:45];
-CVD and cancer: Diseases of too much growth? [1:27:30];
-How to reduce proliferation with rapamycin, nutrition, exercise, fasting, and manipulating hormones [1:32:45];
-Getting patients to fast: How Jason and Peter utilize fasting in their practice, and how their approach differs [1:40:15];
-Comparing bariatric surgery to fasting as a treatment for type 2 diabetes [1:48:00];
-Why people think that fasting is bad for you [1:55:15];
-Time-restricted feeding and intermittent fasting: Defining terms, and how Jason applies them in his practice [1:58:30];
-A fasting case study: A diabetic patient with a non-healing foot ulcer [2:04:00];
-Keys to a successful fast [2:12:45];
-Muscle loss during fasting, and why Jason isn’t worried  [2:24:45];
-Will fasting help a healthy person live longer? [2:31:30];
-Does fasting cause gallstones? [2:38:45]; and
-More.

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the episode:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Jason Fung, a nephrologist specializing in using fasting protocols to treat type 2 diabetes and metabolic disorders. The discussion centers on two main themes: a new paradigm for understanding insulin resistance (reframing it as hyperinsulinemia) and the clinical application of fasting protocols. Dr. Fung challenges conventional medical wisdom about treating type 2 diabetes and presents evidence for why fasting might be one of the most effective interventions for metabolic disease.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Hyperinsulinemia is proposed as a better framework than insulin resistance [1:01:36]
- Fatty liver drives insulin resistance and fatty pancreas leads to beta cell dysfunction [1:07:00]
- Type 2 diabetes reversal is possible through fasting protocols [2:04:32]
- Bariatric surgery results can be replicated through "medical bariatrics" (fasting) [1:52:26]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Consider time-restricted feeding as an entry point to fasting [2:00:14]
- Monitor electrolytes during extended fasts [2:22:36]
- Start with shorter fasting windows before attempting longer fasts [2:08:06]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- Phosphatidylserine for sleep during fasting [1:20:48]
- Magnesium supplementation during fasting [2:28:31]
- Bone broth for electrolyte support [2:28:31]

5. **Nutrition & Diet**:
- Time-restricted feeding (16/8 protocol) as entry point [2:00:14]
- Extended fasting protocols (3-7 days) for severe cases [2:03:36]
- Importance of breaking cultural eating patterns [1:45:44]

6. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Albumin-to-creatinine ratio for early warning [1:27:04]
- Insulin levels more important than glucose levels [1:04:14]
- GFR monitoring for kidney function [1:28:41]

7. **Notable Quotes**:
"The problem is not insulin resistance per se, it's actually the hyperinsulinemia" [1:13:42]

8. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What is the optimal protocol for transitioning from time-restricted feeding to extended fasting?
2. How does fasting affect various inflammatory markers?
3. What role does cortisol play in fasting success/failure?
