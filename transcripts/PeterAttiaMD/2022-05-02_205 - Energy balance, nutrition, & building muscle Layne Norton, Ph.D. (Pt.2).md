Layne Norton holds a Ph.D. in nutritional sciences and is a physique coach, natural bodybuilder, and previous guest on The Drive. In the first half of this episode, Layne dives deep into the topic of energy balance, including the role that macronutrients and calories play in weight loss. He describes how many people struggle with tracking food and calories on their own across a variety of diets and how all of this can impact nutritional habits and behaviors. In the second half of the episode, Layne discusses the importance of protein and weightlifting for improving one’s body composition and increasing muscle mass. He explains how he would prescribe different training and nutrition programs for two hypothetical clients—a 50-year-old female who is entering menopause and wants to improve her health, and a 40-to-50-year-old male who wants to maximize muscle mass. Additionally, Layne discusses a number of supplements that could potentially benefit a training program including whey protein, branch chain amino acids, creatine, nitric oxide boosters, and more.

## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter AA hey Lane good to see you again man yeah I'm happy to be back I'm stoked for this I know we had our we had the marathon session the first time and I think we got through like a third of the topics that you were interested in so we'll see how we do this time yeah yeah well and of course a lot of people had a bunch of follow-up questions so it's sort of some combination of all the things we didn't get to talk about the first time plus some new things I thought about and that you and I have had a bunch of emails exchanged over the last few months um coupled with you know some of that residual stuff um but one of the topics that people really want to hear you and I talk about because I think there's this belief that we are going to be so orthogonal in our views and we will have not a single thing in common although I'm pretty sure this isn't going to be the case is on energy balance and the role of calories in weight gain so why don't we just lead with the fireworks that everyone is hoping for so talk to me about energy balance calories and weight gain so I think one of the big misunderstandings is people don't really understand what energy balance truly is so if we look at what the what most people think it is is well I track my calories and I my calories in I track my calories out therefore if I am you know burning 2500 calories a day and I'm eating I'm tracking 2,000 calories a day

[00:01:32] I should lose one pound of body weight per week linearly and and that's just how it should go perfect math and when that doesn't happen they go we'll see this does this doesn't work and there's a lot of different reasons for that but before we get into that let's talk about what energy balance actually is so you have it is calories in versus calories out or the energy you consume versus the energy you expend and it's worth talking about real quick before we get into that what do we mean by energy a lot of people say well calories you they don't even exist you can't look at them on a under a microscope no you can't look at them under a microscope what we're talking about is the chem the the energy stored in the chemical bonds of food and when you break that food down when that when those molecules go through metabolism and they go through glycolysis the kreb cycle that energy is liberated but captured ultimately as mostly ATP which is our high energy phosphate uh but you can't just store a bunch of ATP it's not practical for the body and ATP is very unstable molecule so we evolve to have fat stores or adapost tissue basically to store excess energy now you can store some in glycogen um I would argue that you really can't store some as protein some people will say well you can break down you know lean tissue to me that's kind of like saying let's build a house so it's a res reservoir for wood I I don't really think that that's a that's a great analogy I've built this amazing teak table such that if I need firewood I've got it right there right like in in practicality are you right sure yeah you could but that's not why you built the table right yeah that's the that's the nuclear option yeah right for for sure uh but and if you look at the the contribution of glycogen to your relative energy stores it's actually really small I mean you're talking about you know 15 00 to 2,000 calories of energy um so your adapost is by far the biggest store and you store it that way because one it's it's it's economical for space because you can fit a large amount of lipid in a small area um and it's energy dense and it's relatively easy to convert to ATP and it's an hydrous so therefore it's you know incredibly well packed as you said right that's a glycogen has to track with all that water it's it's it's not a very efficient way to store energy correct you would be 800 lb if you were trying to store the same amount of energy as glycogen so um there's a lot of really practical reasons why the body evolved that way now when we say calories calories are literally a measurement of energy and so this is really important to understand when people say well are all calories created equal that's like saying are different notches on your speedometer different no this is just a this is just a unit of measurement literally all that is and you you you truly have to think of it as energy so if we think of it as the energy stored in the chemical bonds that can be transferred uh throughout these various metabolic processes and that's what metabolism really is is trying to capture that energy when we look at what the energy inside of things is that is essentially the metabolizable energy in food now there's a couple important caveats to that notice I said metabolizable energy because not everything in food is metabolized able especially with regards to fiber and specifically insoluble fiber um it used to be thought that insoluble fiber is completely you can't digest it at all um it's absolutely zero calories and I wouldn't say that there's good evidence but there's starting to be some evidence that suggests that our gut microbiome can actually extract some calories from the insoluble fiber you eat um that's coming from a friend of mine Suzanne devota who's one of the premier got microbiome experts in the world um she actually did her Masters at the same lab I was doing my PhD and very smart person has been to like the Nobel ceremony you know like incredibly well-respected scientist so there is some evidence of that and then when you come to soluble fiber it's pretty pretty variable it's like anywhere from 1 to four calories per gram so anywhere from a normal carbohydrate amount to one calorie and it also probably depends on your individual gut microbiome right so even before we get to the calories outside of thing we see that there is some variability and probably some individual variability and how many calories one person can consume and then actually have available as energy Lane I like that you started with this I'm just going to add a couple of points so that we can build off this together so um let's even give people the definition of a calorie and I think we should remind people that when you and I and most people are talking about calories we're really talking about kilo calories um and some people will get those confused so a Big C calorie is equal to a th000 little C calories or a k calorie but regardless of that nomenclature I think most people when they're saying I eat 2,000 calories or of course referring to kilo calories each of these one of those if I'm not mistaken and you're going to be probably remembering this better than me Lane one calorie I believe is the energy required to heat 1 G of water from 14.5 to 15.5 de C at at one atmosphere correct that sound about right Bingo yeah yeah about right I I I actually have specifically forgotten the exact definition but it's basically the amount to um increase the degree of

[00:07:19] Water by 1 degree celsius yeah so so again to your point it's simply a unit of energy just as we would think of a jewel as a unit of energy and I also want to highlight something you said which I um I think is a very important thing for people to understand which is when we talk about the conservation of energy that also implies when you change forms of energy so when you eat food the energy as you said is stored within the bonds it is chemical energy we turn that into electrical energy via the electron transport chain and then we turn it right back into chemical energy both in the immediate sense of ATP where you again now create the energy and the phosphate Bond but more importantly as you said when you're storing it you're putting it right back into a hydrocarbon and it's those carbon carbon carbon hydrogen bonds that if my memory serves me correctly are the most energy dense bonds within our body much more than say a carbon oxygen Bond would be correct and and that's why you know we see fatty acids have much more calories or much more energy per gram compared to carbohydrate because carbohydrate has more oxygen um whereas fats through bed oxidation where you're having loing off two carbons with hydrogens you can pretty much I mean it's not direct but you can pretty much create acetyl COA right from that which go which then goes in directly into the KB cycle whereas glucose there's a lot more um more involved in getting the uh ATP or generating ATP from that um now glucose does have benefits in terms of amount of oxygen required to generate the same ATP it just depends on the metric you're looking at right and and then of course the the final point you make there Lane

[00:09:00] I think is worth restating because it is so important which is and this will come up later I think when we talk about genetic differences in toolerance to amounts of macronutrients and things like that but you can really liberate different amounts of energy from the same Foods depending on many things but presumably based on your gut microbiome that's probably one of the things that's going to create a pretty sizable Delta when it when it comes to how much food you're capturing in other words how much of that chemical energy you're able to recoup and repurpose into electrical energy yeah I mean there there is evidence for example that obesity prone people um that they have a flora of gut microbiome or sorry a gut microflora that is better able to extract energy from the foods ate now that could be reverse causation as well it could be that obese people eat a diet that causes this kind of gut microflora to bloom you know so on and so forth so we got to be careful about establishing you know correlation versus ation um and I will say that when they look at because they can actually assess how much energy is lost in in feal matter um it's it's usually around 5 to 10% depending on people and and most of your 95% of your gussian distribution Falls in there right so it it is a significant difference but what I would tell people is be cautious about saying well this is why we see huge differences between individuals it pro Maybe for certain individuals but I think for the vast majority of people unless you're literally an outlier uh it's probably going to be somewhere relatively close right uh so I think establishing that okay we've we already we understand that there is some variability in how much energy you can extract from the food you eat and I'm going to come back to that as well because there's another aspect the tracking portion that we need to talk about as well that confuses people now let's talk about the energy outside of things because this is way more complicated so there's different ways people have broken it down but essentially you have your your your BMR which is your basil metabolic rate and what that that's usually about 50 to 70% of the energy people expend per day and it the way I tell it is it's basically the cost of keeping the lights on and we would determine that if you were putting somebody in a metabolic chamber I believe that we don't require them to be sleeping but it's laying laying there but being awake correct and that's slightly different from your energy expenditure while sleeping yep and there are some like you have RMR and you have BMR and there are some subtle differences between the two but I mean essentially it's it's very similar um

[00:11:42] I've had my RMR assessed which is basically you go into a lab you lay down they make sure you're stable for 20 minutes you don't talk you don't listen to music you don't do anything you just sit there and breath or you lay there and breathe um and I mean RMR and BMR are going to be very similar I'm going to simplify it for our audience just CU it's an already complicated subject but um those are that's basically you know the cost of keeping the lights on so what the other way to think about is if you were in like a coma per se um where you're awake having some brain activity that sort of thing um but you're not you're not moving you're not physically moving that's still about 50 to 70% of people's total daily energy expenditure and that's what we refer refer to as metabolic rate and when you had yours measured Lane did you have it done using indirect calorimetry yeah so mine was when I had it done I'm anywhere between 1,900 and 1950 calories per day pretty consistently tell folks how that works because I think when most people say I just had my BMR measured uh it's usually not the rigorous way that we're talking about using indirect Petry it's usually relying on heart rate and respiratory rate which you know can probably give some approximation but um it's probably important for people to understand that there's an enormous error that's introduced when you make so what's the rigorous way to determine energy expenditure so direct ketry is the most rigorous way and that is literally um you know kind of in a bomb cimeter right you're you're you're in a metabolic chamber and they are looking at um you know how much heat you're generating essentially and from that heat that you generate they're able to determine your total daily energy expenditure and then using an equation based on your oxygen consumption versus your CO2 production they can determine what from that is your BMR which is actually the same way they they do it for IND indirect chetry so you're wearing you're inside this like hood and you're breathing into a tube essentially and basically your metabolic rate is very closely associated with how much oxygen you consume so how much oxygen you consume versus how much CO2 you expire will one give you a really good idea of your metabolic rate because the in products of metabolism are CO2 and water so so when everything goes through this process of breaking down carbohydrates and fats it all if if you talk about like what happens to body fat it ends up as CO2 in water okay so if they know that and you can use a constant for water if they know that it's also why they can use doubly labeled water to estimate energy expenditure we'll get to that later um but if you know that and you know these constants and you make several assumptions I mean again this isn't direct you're making assumptions you're making assumptions about how much is being generated um you can come up with a relatively accurate um estimation of your uh metabolic rate and for reasons that I can't explain this is something I can never forget which is the coefficients for that equation uh the

[00:14:47] Weir coefficients right so energy expenditure is 3.94 time VC V2 plus 1.11 * vco2 so as you said it's heavily weighted to oxygen consumption it's nearly four times the consumption of Oxygen Plus about one times the production of carbon dioxide and that gives you that and for anybody listening to this who's ever had a V2

[00:15:10] Max test I would encourage you to ask the lab that does it for you to give you the raw data because what they'll spit out for you usually in 15-second intervals is V2 vco2 and while the purpose of that test might be to determine your maximal V2 you can also plug in these two variables to the Weir equation and get how many calories per minute you're consuming or requiring to maintain that energy output all the way to your max it's actually quite remarkable when you consider that a highly trained individual will easily get to 20 calories per minute of energy demand yeah I mean if you think about you know we say lean mass is by far the biggest correlate with uh total daily energy expend and resting metabolic rate um lean mass requires quite a bit of oxygen uh compared to like adapost tissue which is relatively nonvascular so it makes a lot of sense that you would see that and then if you think about activity obviously if you start doing activity requires a lot of oxygen so we have our

[00:16:17] BMR which is about in terms of the energy outside of things and I guess I should Define that energy out is your total daily energy expenditure so all the energy you expend in a day that's your TDE we call it and the biggest portion of that is your BMR for most people now if you're an elite athlete who trains like 68 hours a day you can get to the point where your physical activity is actually greater than your

[00:16:40] BMR so don't don't be those listening don't be dogmatic about these numbers but for most people uh 50 to 70% is a relatively accurate representation for me it's probably about 55 to 60% of my total daily energy expenditure because I do train like two two and a half hours a day so that is a significant contributor so we have that then we have what's called TEF which is the thermic effect of food or Diet induced thermogenesis and this is anywhere from 5 to 10% of your total daily energy expenditure for most people very very hard to measure um usually it's expressed in terms of you know calories per minute uh because they're only looking at it in the short term and when we do studies of total daily energy expenditure I mean usually what they're doing is using a constant for TEF they're they're making an assumption because it's just so hard to measure unless you're just measuring that over like the course of a couple of hours or maybe a day at most but we feel relatively confident based on the the studies out there that it's about 5 to 10% of your total daily energy expenditure so not a not a big contributor but still but it also seems to be macronutrient dependent correct it is it is so that's one of the things we'll come back to that when we get to yeah yeah and then if we look at kind of the last component we have our physical activity and this encompasses all physical activity so people hear this and they think exercise but actually the biggest for a lot of people their biggest component of physical activity is actually what's called meat which is non- exercise activity thermogenesis and that is something that's actually extremely modifiable and and we see it in terms of one people who are obese resistant what we what we term obese resistant they tend to fidget a lot they tend to move a lot I was like this as a as a kid

[00:18:33] I still am uh whereas people who are obes prone tend to have very low neat and in fact there was a study done by liel in 1995 where they overfed people by I want to say a th000 calories per day and they determined this they they looked at their total energy expenditure in a metabolic Ward so very accurate and then they took that number and added 1,000 calories on top of it and they looked at how much weight people gain somebody some people gain more than they expected one person did not even have significant weight gain and what they found was this individual's neat their spontaneous physical activity went up so much it just compensated for that for that extra calories and so I think this is what people really don't understand as well

[00:19:19] Is We I want to be very purposeful about how we Define meat because when it comes to meat versus exercise exercise is purposeful so something I'll hear a lot is well I'm going to go do a walk and get my kneat up no you're doing exercise maybe I'm being a little bit pedantic but it's important because neat is what I'm talking about fidgeting it's what like with my like not right now because now

[00:19:43] I'm thinking about it but like I'm waving my hands around I'm kind of like you know moving from one foot to the next you know I've seen Peter that like you kind of move your fingers and you'll kind of you know twitch your neck that s all that stuff even though it seems like nothing thousands of those movements over the course of a day actually add up so then I have people say well I'm just going to like tap my foot you know to to get knad up or fidget well guess what's going to happen whenever you try to do something that Al also requires your brain you're going to stop doing that because you actually can't really do two things at once in terms of like thinking about it so This truly is spontaneous energy expenditure and appears to be modifiable by about 5 to 600 calories per day and we do see this with overfeed and underfeeding so people who are and we'll get into talking about metabolic adaptation and how this affects things but people who lose like 10% of their body weight they've seen up to a 500 calorie reduction in meat so that's a big portion of it and then obviously you have your purposeful exercise so if we look at energy out or energy in metabolizable energy energy out BMR TEF neat and exercise I'm simplifying this equation a little little bit but that's essentially it um so when people if people want to invalidate energy balance what I always say is listen you ate those carbons something must happen to them you you cannot just they don't flutter off into

[00:21:13] Oblivion and you don't create them out of nothing right something has to happen to them and we have a lot of metabolic Tracer studies to pretty much know what happens to them I think the confusion becomes well I tracked my calories I ate in a 5 calorie deficit and I didn't lose weight first off if we look at where these mistakes come in people weigh themselves sporadically and if you only weighed yourself once a week I would say it's virtually meaningless um when we are trying to get data on people we're very regimented with how we do it so it's you in first thing in the morning after voiding voiding your bladder and bowel if possible fasted first thing you do as soon as your feet Hit the Floor after you've gone to the bathroom you weigh in and then we take that weight every single day and then we look at the average and then we compare week to week averages because anybody who's ever tracked their weight and I don't know

[00:22:10] I'm sure you've had this experience Peter where you're you're eating very consistently you're tracking your weight and it'll easily fluctuate by 1 to 2% per day so if you're 200 lb you could be 204 you could be 196 and I always tell people it's like the stock market sometimes there's a good explanation for why it goes up and down like that but other times there's no good explanation whatsoever and you don't just want to take like one isolated data point and this is also with people who get dexas done and they go they freak out because

[00:22:39] I lost a pound of lean body mass no you went and had it done at a different time where you were less hydrated or or on a different machine or with softw tech yeah yeah it's I tell people I don't want to tell them not to get dexas done but unless you're going to do it same Tech same machine same conditions it's

[00:22:57] I'm like cool it doesn't really mean anything but you have it so when you look at when you look at that so you could have somebody theoretically and i' I've shown this example with clients where I've said your average weight is down by a pound but if I had weighed you on this day last week and this day this week you would think you were up by 2 and a half pounds so people will start doing a calorie deficit diet and they'll say well see I gained weight so this doesn't work no that was a fluid shift from day day-to-day changes in weight are much more dictated by fluid shifts than they are at aost tissue levels but your weekly and monthly changes in weight are much more dictated by your actual body mass so that's one thing that confuses people the other thing that really will kind of confus people is thinking that they can track their energy expenditure accurately so these watches there was a a recent study done in 2018 I guess some people might not consider that recent I do because the years tend to blend together for me now but they they looked at about 20 different devices and found that these overestimate your exercise energy expenditure by 23 or sorry 28 to 93% so if it says you burn 500 calories you probably actually burn more like 260 to 400 calories right and so again people say well I you know I burned a th000 calories on the treadmill today like you know and I always tell people what do you think is more likely that you have found a way to violate the laws of thermodynamics or that this watch might not be accurate because I'm going to go with the latter so there there's that it's very funny how like people are very distrustful of certain things and then other things they're just like oh yeah I totally trust this thing um so there's that and then there's also the fact that we can't completely accurately track calories in either because there is up to a 20% error label that's allowed in

[00:25:01] Foods so I think that's where some of the confusion comes in the other thing I will say that's worth saying that will really upset some people is people are horrible estimators of their energy intake horrible there was a study done um I think it was back in the 90s where they took self-report people who were self-reportedly resistant to weight loss these were people who said I I 1,200 calories a day I can't lose weight they put them in a in a metabolic Ward and they also had them do um doubly labeled water which is is basically a free living way of determining energy expenditure plus they had the direct ketry and they said to them we we want you to track your food and report it to us but we will know if you're if you're incorrect like we will we will know so the average Under reporting was by 50% % so they were Under reporting their energy intake by 50% on average um and that's right in line with a lot of the other studies most if we look at people who are overweight and obese most of them under report by 30 to 70% um the demographic of obese women tend to be at the higher end of that uh obese men tend to be at the lower end of that and then even even lean people I was about to say for lean people would the same uh bias I mean bias might be the wrong word but would the same uh error in reporting still exists uh there so there there is an error it's less it's I think it's around 18% but even dietitians under report by about 10% now that's kind of amazing that they could be within 10% yeah so the what the some of the subjects actually argued with the researchers about it which is funny um but people don't they don't like that kind of self-accountability sort of thing um and what I'll tell people is now the message people will hear when they hear that is you're saying I'm a liar and I don't think that people were necessarily lying I think people are horrible estimators of their food intake because if I put a salad in front of you and I dump 50 grams of oil on it versus 20 grams of oil you will have absolutely no idea of the difference you might be able to taste like a little bit of difference in mouth feel but most people go Ah that's a salad it's got some dressing on it it's probably 200 300 calories meanwhile it's got nuts it's got bacon eggs it's got oil you know all that kind of stuff and I'm not saying any of those things are inherently bad

[00:27:38] I'm just saying it's all energy right so I think that's another big component is people are just horrible estimators of their food intake and and what I'll tell people is if you really believe that you are not able to eat in the calorie deficit lose weight I want you to just for one week track every single piece of food you put in your mouth like no no licks no bites no snacks not on account for I'm not saying you got to do this for the rest of your life but just do this for one week and usually I'll come back with people who are mind blown they'll say well I thought I was eating 600 calories I was eating 2700 because they didn't realize that like they grabb that handful of nuts or they grab a handful of potato chips or or whatever it is or they take a a bite of a candy bar you know and yeah in isolation none of that stuff is a big deal but you know when you accumulate it throughout the course of a day it can be a big deal yeah about about um eight years ago um I when I was really really interested in this topic I had the the the luxury of being able to spend a couple of day probably about a total of six days in total inside a metabolic chamber in two-day block so so three two-day blocks or four two-day blocks inside a metabolic chamber probably wasn't actually very much fun at the time but actually it was the most fun thing ever

[00:28:51] Lan because it was everything I love first of all I got to be in a room nobody could bug me and we had arranged it so that I could do all my exercising so I had my bike on a fluid trainer I had tons of Weights in there plyometric box a bed like it was a dream like it was literally a vacation um and so and I had this amazing food being prepared by a metabolic kitchen like you've got this staff that is making to the gram everything that we had agreed at the outset we were going to be testing and then after the fact I went and did the 10day doubly labeled water experience which I guess we could explain for people what that is right so you you so water everybody knows is H2O hydrogen 2 oxygen one but it turns out there's a heavy form of hydrogen called detarium and there's another form of oxygen that doesn't have 16 I'm so bad in my chemistry now is it 16 protons or is it neutrons neutrons 16 neutrons so instead they have one with 18 neutrons and so you drink a D2 regular o and then an H to heavy o when you drink this you basically get to exploit a trick which is by collecting your urine you're measuring the hydrogen that's coming out without measuring the carbon that's coming out so you can impute what your vco2 is effectively and you collect urine serially and over the course of 10 or 12 days you get an estimate and so the only instruction to me when doing this was try to be weight stable for that period of time which was able to do um and it was interesting that was a time in my life when I was really tracking ins and outs pretty well um mostly just out of curiosity not because

[00:30:38] I was trying to lose weight or gain weight I wasn't um and by my calculations I was about 4400 calories in which would imply about 4,400 calories of energy expenditure the the dlw ended up being 4200 um so I was surprised it was pretty close cuz I agree I expected it to be way far off um but it was such an amazing experience and it it's like I almost wish stuff like that could be done commercially because of course I had to do this with a an awesome guy named Erin Eric Ravis at the Pennington biomedical research institute and Eric staff had done this for me so it was you know I was able to do this in a research lab not but this would be an amazing thing that I wish you could order a home kit drink this stuff down run it out for 10 days and truly get a sense of your energy expenditure right what I would say is most so since you're supposed to be weight stable most people could actually do it just by default because at the end of the day if your weight stable within you know a reasonable amount then whatever you're eating is actually for all intensive purposes your total daily energy expenditure oh yes yes I'm just saying it's so hard for people to me to your point like that's that is a hard thing for someone to do unless they're going to have a food scale with them everywhere and they're yeah yeah and then the other thing is it becomes a little bit of an artificial exercise because even if somebody says

[00:31:56] I'm willing to for 10 days measure everything then you get this sort of hothorn effect of they won't take that extra bite of the candy bar because a they don't want to measure it and be and they won't grab the handful of nuts and they won't do this that and the other thing whereas if you say look I'm just going to eat the way I normally eat for a week and not measure anything all I have to do is maintain my weight which means if I get on that and do what you're saying right every morning you get on that scale and you kind of tweak it up and down then you can say okay in a truly free living environment without the Hawthorn effect this is my energy intake so it's so funny you say that in science we know that right down to individual particules When You observe it it changes its Behavior absolutely and that's true for just on the atomic level um and it's true for people and in fact that's we have a coaching team called team biolane where we do we do one-on-one coaching um and we have a team of uh seven coaches and one of the big things that we train our coaches on is like hey if somebody's like really resistant to something just see if they'll just track what they're already doing right like just just to Enlighten them right and we'll tell them like listen we want the the raw data we don't don't change anything and almost every time just by them doing that for a week wow you know I lost half a kilo or a kilo this week and it's like yeah like you said it's you didn't take that extra bite of snacks we have that problem actually in our practice with our patients because we for at least half the patients once we do our intake we realize nutrition is going to be an important thing to modify and a lot of times we want to see what the Baseline is and so we go one step further which is we do exactly that which is you know we don't want to see you do anything different but we really go out of our way to say please do not change anything in other words eat that candy bar and grab that handful of nuts and take that extra you know pour that glass of wine a little taller than you think it should be like do everything naturally and even still to your point it's almost impossible to get a true

[00:34:01] Baseline once you apply those constraints yeah we can go over like how that just shows you how inaccurate 24-hour food recalls can be and all that kind of stuff so um yeah so I think those are some of the biggest misunderstandings now I do want to address the whole is a calorie a calorie thing yes all calories are equal because again calories are just a unit of measurement all sources of calories are not equal in terms of their effects on energy expenditure and metabolizable energy we already talked about soluble fiber and insoluble fiber uh and then if we look at the TEF of various Foods um prot so let's start with fat fat fat has the lowest TEF so if we talk about TEF is basically the amount of energy the system has to put in to extract the chemical energy out of food so you can't just put it in and then boom you have the energy you your body has to do work to get it now it's always a higher net even on stuff like you know people say well celery is a negative calorie food because your body has to put more no no no no they're they're unless we're talking about tree bark there is no energy negative food right um even celery has like 50 calories I think it's or might be five calories per 100 gram so very very low but still not negative we would not have lived long as a species if we had energy negative

[00:35:21] Foods so if we think about how much energy has to go in to get energy out we have you know how many calories you consume and present as metabolizable energy and then how many calories we net out of that after the energy expenditure required to get the chemical energy out is done so if we look at fats fats are the lowest and they're about 0 to three calories meaning if you eat 100 calories from fat you net about 97 to 100 calories uh and then we have carbohydrates carbohydrates are about 5 to 10% so if you eat 100 calories of carbohydrate you net about 90 to 95 calories protein is is around 20 to 30% so if you 100 calories from protein you net about 70 to 80 calories now people will hear that and they make a much bigger deal of it than it actually is because when you consider how much of a proportion of your overall energy expenditure it is and I do this example where I'm like let's double your protein and see how much more TEF you get it ends up being like 150 calories if you double your protein right and we're talking about people already eating like you know a standard amount of protein to a really high amount of protein so yeah it helps but it's probably not the cure for the Obesity crisis right so it is important it's important to talk about although I mean to push back on that for a second L I've never thought about this until you said that um one of the challenges when thinking about weight loss sustainable weight loss over a long enough period of time is how much is enough on a daily basis before an adaptation would take place that would correct it so for example if we were you're asking the right questions you're asking the right question so if we were talking about let's just say one of your dietitians came to and said Lane I've got this idea I've got this patient who is truly by every metric 50 pounds overweight like you know we could do it on lean body mass body fat whatever but this if this guy's 50 pounds lighter in a year everything about his life has gotten better from a health perspective and this person said look

[00:37:21] I'm going to double their protein intake and let's not make it the extreme example of where you're getting an extra 150 let's just say it's 100 calories or 75 calories if you could create an energy deficit and this again assumes that you can change nothing else and I mean there's so many silly assumptions but think of this almost more as a thought experiment if you could create an energy debt of 75 calories per day by a macronutrient shift to more protein over a long enough period of time could it be relevant it could however what we're neglecting to talk about is is something I ly mentioned which is metabolic adaptation and so I think this is the other big thing that confuses people they think energy in energy out these are static things that do not affect each other and the reality is they are intrinsically tied to each other so anybody who's ever tried to lose weight if you win on a let's say a 500 calorie deficit per day which is a a pretty significant deficit um do you just lose linearly one pound per week until you no longer exist you die because there's no more body weight no we all know that eventually like that plateaus right now part of that is just because you have less body mass so your body has to expend less energy in order to just you know maintain upright posture and those sorts of things but then there's also the neat component as you lose weight you become spontaneously less active we see this in animals all the way up to humans then not just that voluntary exercise tends to go down past a certain point like if you're very obese and you start to lose weight it's not really going to affect this that much because you have such an energy Surplus um but especially people who are going average to lean your Vol like your will to exercise will go down um I've definitely experienced that during contest preps getting very lean you know just having to like will myself to get up off the couch um and then if you look at their

[00:39:21] BMR you actually get a reduction in BMR above what you would expect based on the loss of lean tissue and fat tissue because fat tissue is Rel somewhat metabolically active there's actually up to like on average a 15% reduction in BMR so almost at every level of energy expenditure your body is kind of fighting you to get back to homeostasis to reestablish homeostasis and so we see this in people who lose weight so if we take people with the same lean body mass and fat

[00:39:57] Mass people who have never been obese people who have been obese and weight reduced the weight reduced people will have a lower BMR than the people that have never had to lose fat and so it's like this evolutionary uh John Speakman had a really good uh paper on this thinking about this is kind of getting into set point theory that we have this kind of native set point that the body likes to be at and the idea is kind of okay what are what are what's regulating the of that set point so we understand that if we get too lean lose too much fat Mass we die that's a really negative outcome for evolution right you can't pass on your DNA if you're dead um at the higher ends because there are there are things that work against obesity like like we already talked about that neat goes up if you overfeed your BMR also goes up if you overfeed but obviously based on what's happening in society with this shift towards osity the the regulations on the going up are not as strong as going down and so if you think about it from an evolutionary perspective the the risk of getting too overweight in the short term because obesity is not going to kill you when you're 40 you know it's going to it's going to be the difference between you dying at 80 versus 70 that that's what the research tends to suggest the the risk in the short ter the risk in the short term is predation or or you know fighting or or that some sort of physical altercation where you can't defend yourself very well or you can't run away the risk of predation after man learned how to use tools pretty much went to zero I mean yes you have shark attacks and you have these things but I mean they're essentially lightning strikes when humans get killed by animals or even other people I mean it's very very rare but then we look at the risk of starvation it's very real even now in some parts of the world and was very real in this country until the 1900s I mean even into probably the early 1900s and so it makes sense that the regulatory mechanisms were more powerful on that bottom end to prevent people from becoming too lean than they are on the top end and so bringing this back to energy balance you have to think of energy balance like a car that changes its gas efficiency based on how full the tank is so think about if you had a car that when you have the gas tank filled all the way up it gets horrible gas mileage but as that gas tank starts to go down and think about your gas tank is your your body's out of poost stores your energy stores as that gas tank starts to go down you become more and more and more efficient to buy the time there's very little gas left it's just sipping gas it really is kind of a dramatic comparison but it it is an apt comparison and I think the the biggest thing to take away is we cannot know at a SN we can know at a snapshot in Time what your energy expenditure probably is but it's likely to change and it's a sliding scale and it depends on a lot of variables and so that's also LED people to say well see we can't accurately track calories in we can't accurately track calories out there's no point in tracking calories and what I I would say is that you're kind of throwing the baby out with a bath water I'm not saying you have to track calories to lose weight because obviously you don't because there's all kinds of methodology that people use to lose weight that doesn't involve tracking calories but it would be like saying well keeping a budget is worthless because I have multiple streams of

[00:43:46] Revenue and I have Investments and so I can't know exactly how much income I'm getting and also you know things pop up like your car breaks down you know you have repairs to your house so you can't exactly know what you're are going to be so therefore keeping a budget is is is worthless what always so the comparison

[00:44:03] I make is you don't have to keep a budget to save money but it's a useful tool it it gets you in the ballpark and it gets you a Baseline and I would say the same thing about tracking calories and it might be that the act of keeping a budget alone is what enables you to think twice before a frivolous purchase as as one example right and we know this too when people try so what's so funny is the parallels here so did you know that the average person I I'm kind of a finance nerd average person under reports their debt by about 155% um and again it may not even be a lying thing it might just be they have really horrible ideas about how much debt they actually have um and so same thing when you when you have people track their budget well now all of a sudden they're on their best behavior because not only do they not want to admit to anybody else they don't want to admit to their themselves where they're actually spending their money and so I I use that comparison a lot when it comes to tracking calories and we use it a lot with our clients is hey look at this thing like a budget so

[00:45:05] Peter you made the example that you were maintaining your body weight on 4,400 calories a day and and by the way for the listener wondering I was training a heck of a lot more than I train now that's when I was I mean truthfully probably exercising three hours a day so you had a very large budget right now if you have a large budget if I'm talking monetary can I is it is a sports car a good purchase I mean you know if it brings you happiness and joy sure but not if you can't afford it right but if you can if you make a if you have a large enough budget that you can pay your mortgage and you can pay your utilities and you can you know do all the the responsibilities that you need to and you still have some left over to buy that sports car and it brings you happiness I would say go for it right by the same token if you make you know 50,000 a year and you're going to buy a $70,000 $100,000 sports car I would say that's probably a really bad idea right unless you've got a ton of money sucked away in the bank so by the same token when people see you know kind of like you know what I what I really tend to utilize flexible dieting for myself and a lot of our clients people say well that they're just eating junk food all the time no no what you're seeing is people are posting this because they're so shocked that they can eat some junk food and lose weight um that they tend to post post that stuff and people will say well you know that can't be good for them and my response is know everything is on a Continuum here you know there's a big difference between somebody having like a small bowl of ice cream that they fit into their budget for the day um that allows them to kind of feel less restricted and feel like they're they're not missing out that prevents them from having a huge binge session you know down the road when their willpower eventually breaks and it doesn't work for everybody but it works for some people if they can have that bow ice cream but they're still getting enough dietary fiber they're still hitting their protein they're not going over calories they're getting micronutrients in I would say what's the problem with that right this is probably the question

[00:47:08] I actually get asked the most Lan from patients and I'm guessing you do a lot which is Peter do you think it is better to be completely restrictive uh or to have frequent cheat meals like one meal a we week or one day a week where you go completely off the rails or just to have a little bit of stuff that is an Indulgence every single day and I actually I don't have a great answer for them other than there there is no right answer here and even for an individual that might change and I'll use always my example which was for three years I was on a ketogenic diet with the exception of one day so in one in whatever 365 time 3 is for that many days I never deviated from a ketogenic diet except for one meal when I had about seven pieces of cake at my wife's birthday and I said that was really interesting like I'm amazed I was able to do it I look back at that period which was 2011 to 2014 and I think I don't know how you did it I could never do it again it' be very hard for me to go on a ketogenic diet for more than two weeks now um so and if I did if I try if

[00:48:23] I if someone put a gun to my head and said you I really want you to do this for a year I just can't imagine I could I mean the reality of it is like that would be a very difficult thing to do and um so for me like I I don't know what the word is but like I can definitely get away with a daily Indulgence or a weekly

[00:48:43] Indulgence and it's very easy for me to get right back on program because I basically follow a very simple rule which is never do two bad things back to back like if you ever if you ever miss a workout the which sometimes is going to happen the single most important thing is making sure the next day you out yeah getting back on the horse yeah if and if you ever have like a complete blowout meal the single most important meal is the next one so so that works for me but

[00:49:09] I also realize in working with so many people there are some people who do very well in a highly highly restricted environment and when they deviate from that restricted environment it it sets them off on on a path that doesn't make sense so I mean do you have any insights for helping some someone predict where they're going to be or did you just say no you know what just try them all out try all of these approaches and let's revisit in a month I think part of it depends on person's personality and their individual psychology what we know is that if you want to lose weight specifically you are going to have to use some form of restriction right whether it's calorie counting points uh carb restriction fat restriction you know unprocessed food whatever you're going to have to use fasting you're going to have to use some form of restriction right either some form of dietary restriction calorie restriction or time restriction you have to do something there and and all of them when we say calorie restriction we talk about counting calories and actively but all of these things work because they restrict calories that's that's also important to note I want to come back to that by the way because this is to me the Crux of where I think people will assume you and I don't agree but I'm pretty sure we do agree but let's go with that thread and then I'm going to come back to the jugular question around that very simple you have to have some form of restriction but you should pick the form of restriction that feels least restrictive to you as an individual and this is where people get really crossed up and

[00:50:36] I'll give you an example people find will find that form of restriction that felt really unrestrictive to them and you hear it all the times I tried intermittent fasting it felt like I wasn't even dieting I lost 50 pounds and it wasn't even hard then they will assume that this is the right one that this is the right approach for everyone because it was the right approach for them and we tend to retroactively then try to justify why physiologically that also is the best approach and this is why you hear people make kind of crazy claims about whether it's low carb or intermittent fasting or or or any one of these diets which are all excellent tools uh you know people think that I don't like ketogenic diets or that I don't like intermittent fasting or anything like that and that's not true I just am not a fan of insane claims about those particular diets and

[00:51:28] I think part of the problem is people will say something like well I went on I tried restricting calories that didn't work I went on a ketogenic diet and I was eating more in lost weight you probably felt like you were eating more but unless you were weighing out again you were weighing out and the other thing that we should talk about is when you go to a ketogenic diet where you have really you know limited food choices there's not a whole lot of options for snacking like there's not really like you're you're mostly eating kind of like defined meal Foods right intermittent fasting you're not really snacking right you're you're having defined Meals by the way that is a very very very vigorously present characteristic of people who lose weight and keep it off is They

[00:52:13] Don't Really snack they have defined meals and there is I realize I'm going on a tangent here but there is something to be said for snacks do not appear to be as satiating not just because of the food but because of the mindset because when you snack s you tend to do it like not being mindful about it and it doesn't have the same satiety effect so one of the things we tell our clients is hey stop snacking not that again if you like snacks and they work for you and you can fit them in your calories it's fine but if you're having trouble try stop stop snacking and they oh my gosh like I didn't even really feel like I was that less hungry and all of a sudden I'm losing weight again and cut three 400 calories out yeah I'll add one point to that lane which is um when so I I agree just empirically that if you can absolutely eliminate what you eat between defined meals and that could be two or three meals per day um most people will have not just an improvement of body weight and body composition but biomarkers get better I mean you it you tend to not be snacking on the best things to begin with and actually this is where one of the things where I have found fasting to be a valuable tool because if you put somebody through a three five or even longer day fast I'm talking water only fast even once in their life they learn a very important lesson which is I'm not going to die if I'm hungry acutely um if I made you fast for 40 days you might die but I pretty much don't think there's a human being on this planet outside of the most you know sick you know individual who couldn't go 5 days without food and you you know subsiding only on water and and minerals and something about doing that even if you do it once for no other reason it teaches you a couple of things one you can do it that's a big aha moment two hunger comes in waves so that 5 day period of eating nothing you will have periods of time when you literally want to eat your arm and you will have periods during that 5 days when you have forgotten that you're fasting and so when you take that mindset into okay Lane I just put you through this five days of you know very difficult fasting now we're going to go to a regimen where I just don't want you to eat any snacks and that means from noon till 6 I don't want you eating anything and now all of a sudden you're like at 3:00 I'm really hungry but you now anchor that to something that was so much more severe which is wait a minute I'm really hungry because I haven't eaten in 3 hours I'm going to eat in 3 hours I think I can make it and uh at least for me and for a number of patients that I've used this sort of method with it's a very powerful tool and you don't need to become a fasting Guru to do this right you don't have to do a quarterly fast to experience this I think just one fast will teach a person this lesson and I I certainly remember the first time I really had that aha moment when I did my first really long fast and realized everything that I knew intellectually but all of a sudden it emotionally made sense as well well people confuse hunger and appetite a lot so there's a here here's the other big thing is people say well you don't get as hungry on the ketogenic diet or you don't get as hungry on the plant a plant-based diet you don't get as hungry on XYZ I say that's true but there's a lot more reasons people eat other than hunger in fact I would argue that some of the major reasons people eat has nothing to do with physical hunger that it's actually societal cues um stress various other things and so one of the things we'll we'll tell our clients boredom is a big one for me absolutely one of the reasons that exercise people one of the reasons exercise works so well is one it sensitizes you to satiety signals that's actually the most powerful effect it has on weight loss you actually become more sensitive to your satiety hormones but two you're spending an hour doing something physical where you you're you're not bored and eating right so so it it it makes a difference uh but one of the things we tell our clients is like listen if you want to lose weight you're going to be hungry at some point like this is just something like physically hungry you you will be and I like this is coming from somebody who has been stage lean as a bodybuilder with absolutely minimal amounts of body fat when I talk about the level of discomfort it is an all consuming you cannot think about anything else other than when you're going to eat next when you finish your meal you're hungry 5 minutes later and already thinking about your next meal and the level of fatigue is so high that the best way I can describe standing up off a chair is a Monumental effort I I there's no other way to describe it and and we talked about this in the first podcast but just because I find it's so amazing can we can we relive a few minutes of that lane so going into a show we're obviously referring to your bodybuilding stuff not your powerlifting stuff um you'll be what 4% roughly on stage it depends on what the metric you

[00:57:25] I mean I've I've calipered at 2% um in dexa is the gold standard but again it's still I tell people unless you're a cadaver and they're excising your adapost tissue you'll never know exactly what your adapost tissue is because all these measurements make assumptions on dexa I was probably five or 6% that's where a lot of stage lean bodybuilders end up end up being so how many days leading to that moment on stage are you really in the throws of this type of discomfort that you're describing I will tell you that on calipers I can get to about 7% come down from like 14 or 15 which is where if I'm up to like 230 lbs I'll be 14 or 15 probably more like 15 on calipers get to Seven no problem like that doesn't even hardly F me I've done it so many times from seven to 2 or 3% is exponentially more difficult that that'll take you how many weeks uh probably 12 to 16 to go for those from 7 to two um you know because again it's not just losing the weight it's also maintain the lean mass too maintaining the lean mass as a drug-free athlete is extremely difficult that's conversations

[00:58:38] I have with you know our client our team Bing clients all the time if they want to do a show is 12 weeks is not going to do it if you're drug free unless you're already extremely lean um the the best natural bodybilder ever coached his name was Brian Whitaker and he won the wnbf lightweight World title six times and is only man to win the wnbf overall World title and the ifpa overall World title which were the two biggest federations the only man to ever unify them um and this guy at 12 weeks out you would say he's ready and then he would lose 10 more pounds from that and of those 10 pounds how many would be fat probably six or seven this is this is the problem is is the loss of body fat and lean mass what we see in I realize we're going off of the tangent but this is really interesting yeah is when you're looking at people who are like overweight and obese it's they they can lose Almost 100% fat tissue now what people don't realize is atap POS is actually about 133% lean tissue so it is very normal to see about a 13 to 20% loss of lean tissue uh when dieting because even if you lost just adapost tissue you would lose some lean mass you mean lean mass in terms of some of the water loss water and atap POS also has protein in it as well and and part of that is lost during the during the remodeling of the tissue so you have that but then as a drug-free bodybuilder again it's important to make that distinction because if you're on steroids that obviously changes the physiology and and tilts things much more towards retention of lean mass if not building some um as you get leaner and leaner you are going to have a progressive shift of more and more lean body Mass loss for a few reasons one because your atpo stores are lower your your body is sending out hormones to to try and conserve fat tissue so think about it from this perspective if you are 200 lb and 90 of that is lean body mass because you're you're just little bit that last little bit of body fat now guess where the biggest reservoir of energy is it's the wood table yeah now right so now we're in emergency mode and okay well now we can start to tear the house down because it's more important to keep this fat tissue than it is to keep this massive amount of lean tissue right so it really is interesting um so so for him people might look at that and say well he lost 10 pounds and almost half of it was lean mass yes but one of the fundamental things that people do not understand is the best way to look as muscular ular as possible is to be as lean as humanly possible and I would encourage your your listeners to go look up a guy named

[01:01:33] Brian Whitaker he's actually a professor of Economics at Oklahoma State one of the greatest natural bodybuilders of all time and also a very smart guy lovely person too like his his gluteous muscles he's are so he's so lean that he has veins in his glutes and striations that look like fingers I mean it's really incredible right which is something you typically I remember the first bodybuilder I ever saw that in which is not to say it was the first bodybuilder it appeared in but I remember as a kid seeing that in Samir benu who was the 1983 uh Mr Olympia and I was like I remember as a kid like you know I'm maybe 13 years old seeing him and looking at the striations in his lower back and in his glutes and it was exactly that that look that you describe um yeah and yeah to think that one could achieve that without steroids and diuretics is is pretty amazing yeah and so um like Brian was about 160 to 165 lbs on stage and he's 5'9 but if you would see picture if you saw him in his shirt you would go oh he's a nothing he looks athletic you know but then if you if you see him in um you know with his clothes off you would say oh he's 200 lb at least and soorry you said he's 5'9 and was 165 yep yep actually that's you can't hardly see it but the uh photo right there wow we did a we did a three times body weight deadlift challenge at his at

[01:03:01] Oklahoma State years ago and because Brian's also very strong um that's him there and he would walk around at what in his off season 185 you know 180 something like that and still looked very lean right so again when you're talking about bodybuilding and I realized probably lost about 90% of the audience talking about this but we'll bring it back to the other stuff in a second but I think bodybuilders can really teach important lessons about physiology you know in terms of you know energy metabolism I think it I agree with you I think it is such an underappreciated discipline because it's very easy to dismiss bodybuilders as you know drug using whatever and everything you're saying applies to the steroid using and the natural it's just that in the natural it's a bigger lever but it's still a huge lever if you're a if you're a drug competing bodybuilder like they can't they are I mean whenever I interact with these guys

[01:04:00] I am blown away at how dialed in they are on their nutrition insane and so one of the things we tell our clients and one of the things I've heard so many times from different competitors is you have to learn to sit with your discomfort and that that can apply to many things I mean even in like business

[01:04:20] I'm sitting with my discomfort right now because uh We've expanded our businesses and our expenses are way higher now now we're making good Revenue but the the the 20-year-old Lane in me goes it would just take one bad month and these expenses will crush us you know like that like that that kind of voice is in there so it's you know talking yourself through and sitting with that discomfort when it comes to food it's really asking yourself okay am

[01:04:49] I actually hungry or am I just queued up to eat right now and then if the answer is yes if it truly is physical hunger it's really talking yourself through this and saying okay what are my goals what's important to me do I could I eat sure is it going to make it more difficult later like for example if you're hungry at 11:00 a.m. okay well if I eat a a big meal now I'll feel better now but then what's it going to be like later you know all these things weigh in and again there's no right or wrong answer to this but what I would say is most people can handle a lot more discomfort than they think they can and just because you're uncomfortable doesn't mean you have to do anything about it you can you can sit with that and I think a lot of people really haven't done that um and even that like internal conversation like and that again this is why obesity is so difficult uh when we talk about people because it it's not people want to make it about the X's and O's it's not about the x's and o's it's not about eat this protein carbs fats it's not about any of that that that stuff is I I remember when I first got into coaching people you know 15 years ago I was like well if

[01:06:04] I just tell them to eat this they're going to lose weight and then you realize that like stress and Trauma and hardwired habits and behaviors are so difficult to change and it really is if you look at the research data it really is more I know my cat's making a special appearance you love it he's the best cat um it really is more about changing people's habits and behaviors than it is about the X's and O's and I mean even right down to like sports I I'll use this comparison X's and O's matter but you know what really matters for a head coach leadership that's what really matters being able to get communicate and get everybody on the same page and changing you know what do they what do they call it in the NFL they call it changing the culture this person came in and they changed the culture of this team that's not X's and O's that's habits and behaviors there was a really great um systematic review by a gal named marish breckley um she's doing her

[01:07:14] PhD over in England and humble brag she actually messaged me and said that reading my book is what inspired her to go do her PhD and now she's done this great systematic review so that's always like the most cool thing when I hear that um she did a systematic review and looked at people specifically who lost weight and kept it off what did they have in common what were their what were the things they identified as being really difficult and what were the things that they identified as being really motivating and the things that came up weren't dietary really it was their environment it was their habits their behaviors you know one of the big things that came up was support either good or bad that that support made a big difference um and specifically support in terms of like I believe in you I know you can do this how can I help you know those those sorts of things versus like the criticism micromanaging type of support right and then also uh you know stress was a big one drama was a big one binge eating was a big one that's a really underappreciated part of this is the binge eating component I I I think a lot more people struggle with that than would like to admit because if you look at people I always say Monday through

[01:08:39] Friday a lot of people do great and they get to the weekend and they you know they get the pancakes in the morning they're drinking throughout the day by the way everyone alcohol has calories and it's really calorie dense it also causes you to make not so great food choices and so a lot of people eat 1,500 calories for the week and then they'll easily go 4,000 calories on the weekends so a lot of this is just reprogramming habits and behaviors and that's what really came up in that systematic review was it was not hey this diet came out as this was what these people were using no there was no one diet that came up as being superior to the others what came up repeatedly was these series of habits and behaviors that people had that helped them do this yeah and I think you know bringing it back now to the energy balance question I think today we know a lot more than we did 10 years ago I think 10 years ago at least for me personally there was still an open question about the impact of different macronutrients on energy expenditure both deliberate and non-deliberate so um but I think when you look at the body of literature and and there you know I to declare my conflict here right so I used to be part of an organization that actually funded two of the you know really big studies in this space one out of Boston

[01:10:06] Children's Hospital by David lwig and then one was a Consortium of people that included Rudy liel who you mentioned a moment ago Kevin Hall was the pi Eric Rison Steve Smith Etc that's like the Heavy Hitters name of metabolism right there this was the six pis on this study were six of the biggest names in in all of this space and this was a very rigorously done study and look was it a perfect study no it was a pilot study it was really designed to be the study to work out the Kinks to do the enormous study that actually never got funded but it was still a very good study and it still answered an important question which was at least comparing a relatively clean standard American diet to a ketogenic diet it'd be hard to make the case that there was more than 50 to 150 calorie difference in energy expenditure at an isocaloric swap now there's different ways to interpret that some would say that's huge if you have a 50k which is what the difference was in the chamber versus 150 or 160 which is what the W labeled water showed that could still be very significant over a long enough period of time there has been a significant debate about the validity of doubly labeled water in a ketogenic diet you mentioned

[01:11:24] John Speakman he and Kevin H wrote a review about this suggesting that W labeled water really doesn't apply there's an artifact in a ketogenic diet um so if you just look at the chamber data and say well you know 50 k Cal per day does that really matter not sure but regardless it wasn't 250 or 500 K Cal per day and to me that was a very important Insight because prior to that point I didn't really know because if you look back at you know the Vermont study from the 19 60s if you look back at anel Keys stuff where they didn't have metabolic Chambers they're on Wards but it wasn't quite the same it was really unclear to me I would say today the evidence has to be overwhelming that if for example a ketogenic diet produces remarkable weight loss it has to be doing it through intake reduction not through an increase in energy expenditure I think that you're 100% right and I'm going to take that kind of piece meal so the first thing I will say is let's throw out the energy expenditure stuff for now and I know we just spent a lot of time talking about energy balance it's important but we're assuming that these measures are accurate there's even error in direct ketry because you can only measure as accurately as your equipment that you have to measure it that's right and and that those numbers I just touted

[01:12:48] You could argue that were they were at the limit of detection at least for the indirect calorimeter AB the 57k Cal day was probably right at the detection so it could have been zero it could have been 100 it's we're we're really you know we're really on a on a Razor's Edge of of detection and I think the the point you made was that you know the carbohydrate insulin model of obesity would predict a much bigger change in energy expenditure so therefore at least that version of it it has to be falsified based on that and even with the 150 calories that would not explain the difference and again if if we look at studies that assess loss of body fat under controlled environments we just don't see differences between low carbon and low fat when calories are controlled calories and protein are controlled we we don't see it in fact there's actually a very small favoritism towards low fat but again I think that that's probably a data artifact and not actually a real difference um there was you mentioned

[01:13:50] David lwig there was a re or more recent um meta analysis he did that got a lot of Buzz because basically his his assertion was that well if you look at the shortterm data yes there there doesn't appear to be much difference but if you look at after 17 days there appears to be you know a large difference in the energy expenditure anywhere from like 150 to 300 calories per day favoring low carb was that with doubly labeled water again that's it so that's so the issue was and I went through this with a fine

[01:14:26] Toth comb and again the metaanalysis itself was very well done the statistics were very good um but when there was metabolic chamber data available or doubly labeled water they use doubly labeled water now what I would tell you is that's like saying I've got caliper data available and dexa data available but I'm going to use the caliper data well that's fine but keep in mind that dexa is what calipers are validated against so you're talking about a primary measure versus a second secondary measure by the way I I I've already forgotten Kevin and um Kevin

[01:15:00] Hall and John span's primary um criticism of dlw in a in a KD do you remember the the the gist of the thesis where the artifact comes from yes so basically um there's more CO2 produced than is accounted for in the constant of the equation the 1.11 is probably too low a number yeah so you overproduce co to compared to what the prediction would be based on that equation and so basically what that means is that in a low carb setting you're probably getting an artificial increase in energy expenditure oh so the 1.11 would actually be too too big it's probably too big a coefficient what I went back to is I said okay you know what let's say that this isn't an artifact or effect of the of the um the differences in measures and again it Direct ketry if you're on a standard diet the association with double aable water is an R of point8 which is pretty good for for um for like free living stuff yeah but it but it ain't it ain't 0 N9 either like8 is good but not exceptional and then a low carb is 0. five which is a pretty big difference from a point8 but it basically just means it's not as tightly correlated let's throw all that out I went through every single one of those studies that was that lwig looked at and they looked at did they measure body composition and what did the body composition stuff say because what do we really care about do we care about what energy expenditure says on a on a readout or do we care about losing body fat right I mean that I think most people would say we care about losing body fat not one study saw a difference between the low carb conditions or the low fat or St or balanced diet when calories and protein were equated so to me that's truly the metric and that's what we care about so to me that's actually great news because what it says is hey do do what whatever diet you prefer if you like low carb heck yeah it's it's not it's certainly not any worse than doing a lowfat diet if you don't like low carb there's other options by the way you can just do a balance diet too there there's nothing wrong with that um I think balanced diet sometimes can be a little bit harder for people to moderate um you know unless you're doing some kind of portion control um but yeah it says that pretty much you can do what you want and and still lose body fat so um you know and that's not I'm not trying to throw shade at David lwig even though I I have on

[01:17:28] Twitter before but um you know it's just it just goes to show you that if you change the inputs for a study and this is one of the really fundamental problems I think is out there is people and even like some doctors and scientists just aren't equipped to understand studies to interpret studies correctly and people have asked me like how can I get better at reading this stuff and I hate to be somebody who sits in an ivory Tower but I'll tell them like if you really feel so passionately go to grad school because that's I can tell you sitting down with my Pi Don

[01:18:04] Layman who I'm sure you're very familiar with um and just talking about studies and having him like literally not not in a nasty way but just crush me so many times based on my hypotheses and everything and and say well have you considered this that was so enl for me I mean the best part of grad school was just sitting around a table with graduate students and my and and Dawn and just rapping back and forth and and doing these studies and you just really get a good idea for how to like look critically at this stuff and now I'm to the point where I tell people I'm like I don't get excited about one study wake wake me up when there's 10 you know what

[01:18:45] I mean Wake Me Up When there's 10 and even then I'm going to look at the how it was done and and make sure and I tell people I hear this a lot you know I don't trust science because this study says this thing and this study says that thing I said if you truly understand what you're looking at you understand statistics you understand research design when you go into the methods and you look at the results don't read the conclusions of the authors look at the actual results look at the methods and you can usually understand why they seemingly found different results yeah

[01:19:19] I'll put in one Shameless plug for something we did we have a a series on the blog called studying studies where we we go through all of this methodology but I agree with you it's not a substitute for getting reps on the field in other words that's sort of like reading everything about playing a sport but you actually have to play um and and one of the things we've done internally and we we've toyed with the idea of if we should just put them out there is

[01:19:45] Journal Club so what you describe is basically Journal Club that's really how you learn how to read studies you sit around with a bunch of people and it's formal right you know you you we had every Monday morning I think or maybe Thursday afternoon I can't remember but you know twice a year depending on the size of the lab or four times a year you present a paper for an hour and everybody else's job is to see how you've maybe missed something or misunderstood something and really poke and pry and so every single week you're getting those reps on the field and you get pretty darn good at reading the fine print um so we we do this once a month internally with our team um in part because it's just such a fun experience and two it gives us a chance to pick a paper a month and and really dissect it so you maybe at some point we'll we'll put those out there just so people can at least watch it's one step closer I guess to to doing the Reps but yeah you kind of have to do it yeah it's tough there's there's no substitute for that experience now that being said like one of so understanding this I started thinking about how can I help people with this and so we're actually going to have like a a a periodical a research review coming out uh monthly through our website that's going to be subscription based um that we're going to take there are other you know research reviews out there but we're really going to try and make this like for the Layman for somebody who has no we're going to say here's what they looked at here's what they found here's what we think they found if we disagreed here's what they because I've read studies where I'm like

[01:21:18] I read the author's conclusion I'm like well that's not what you found you actually found this you know um and we're going to we're going to say here's here's what it means for you practically so that's that's funny that we've both kind of like seen that need you know because and again a lot of this is also media driven um because it's it's about what's the most Punchy headline we can get out there you know and I remember a great example was like um this happen so much with mechanistic stuff it's like there was uh an article and it it was something to the effect of smelling your partner's farts might help prevent cancer and what the research study actually showed was that one of the volatile uh fatty acids that's produced by the gut microbiome in response to fiber may have a protective effect on breast cancer when they gave it to animals in a high dose and it's like that's a long way from you you know like taking a sniff of your partner's fart and pre preventing cancer like but that's what confuses people all right let's let's pivot it to another application of this everything we've talked about so far has really set the stage for understanding the role that macronutrients but more specifically calories uh and energy intake and expenditure play in weight loss let's now talk about a very specific macronutrient which is protein and its importance in yeah exactly its importance in muscle acquisition so um I have a saying that I'm sure many others have said and I'm sure I'm paraphrasing it from somebody but never in the history of civilization I will assert has a 90-year-old person said I wish I had less muscle like it can't they can't that can't be uttered right if you want to be metabolically healthy the best thing you can do is have lots of lean body mass it is a metabolic snc is the best way to describe it you if you look at people who are even like obese who are powerlifters they might have like some elevations in like blood lipids and whatnot but usually their insulin sensitivity and blood glucose is still okay um if you if you look at people who train really hard even with excess atopos I I mean they see this with people who are obese who they start them just exercising without exercise is one of the only things that we know of that without even weight l loss improves metabolic health and substantially really substantially and I think I was actually on the Rogan podcast and one of the points I I I made a few years ago was I said this was the one with d yes so I said you know a lot of people get real caught up in carbs and fats and all this and they're not even exercising like you're literally you you are stepping over dollars to pick up fractions of pennies right now like if you just got active and it it's not even a high dose that's required it's not I mean a high dose is great but just going and being sedentary and walking you will see improvements in in health markers for you know 100 minutes a week that's it and then obviously there's there can be a linear effect um but you know people will look at me and I remember I I had my blood work done a while back now I do have familiar hypocholesterolemia so my

[01:24:47] LDL tensun a little bit high but you know people were speculating that I would have like really high inflammation because I talk about you know I still will eat you know um probably around 70 to 80 grams of sugar a day but I'm also getting you know 60 70 grams of fiber along with that oh your CRP is going to beev my CRP wasn't hardly detectable it was on the low ends of detection and again that just speaks the fact that there is a big difference between somebody who is a athlete training hard who has a lot of muscle mass versus somebody who's sedentary with excess at a it's just it's not even comparable when you talk about like food choices and whatnot you have a lot more you can get away with with with a lot of muscle mass and you your point that being older and frail people don't think about this this is something that you know everybody's kind of like w the funniest thing I get Peter is people say oh you do all that heavy lifting you're going to be in pain when you're older you're going to be in pain when you're older regardless you might as well be in pain and strong versus in pain and weak I have members of my family who I love dearly who have been sedentary for a long time who have all kinds of sciatica and back issues I mean

[01:26:07] I have had back issues from heavy lifting but they come and they go and you know I'm still here I'm still able to lift and honestly I find most people who have experienced activity and inactivity will almost always tell you if they're being deliberate in how they recall it you're generally in more discomfort when you're inactive oh for sure sitting down I I again I don't remember where these zingers came from but none of them are mine but this is one of my favorites right sitting is to lower back pain what bourbon is to alcoholism hell yeah um the the the worst thing you can do is be a mobile I say as I'm sitting here right I know it's your standing yeah so part of

[01:26:50] Journal Club in grad school we had uh seminars every week where people would either present their exit seminars for their PHD or we'd have outside speakers come in and one of them interestingly was a lower back pain specialist and this would have been circle like 20072 2008 and one of the interesting things he said was if we which is now kind of common knowledge if we

[01:27:13] MRI an elite athlete a lot of times I'll look at their MRI and go oh my God you must be in horrible discomfort and they go really not feel fine you know they've got all these disc bulges and herniations and whatnot and they're completely asymptomatic and then he'll he said we'll have sedentary people come in and they'll be in excruciating pain and I'll pull up their MRI and they've just got a little tiny dis bulge there is probably no more diagnostic test that is uncorrelated from Clinical outcome than an MRI of the lumbar spine again not a specialist but I you know I've spoken with lumbar Specialists like Stu

[01:27:49] McGill um you know they say you know it's it's data it's kind of like a dexa it's like its data but you know it shouldn't really dictate treatment treatment should be based on pain and what triggers your pain and that's a whole another Rabbit Hole the pain the pain world is a whole another Rabbit Hole the idea that people think the human body is like a a bag of meat that's just connected to your brain and now we know that pain is more like an emotion than anything but I digress so let's talk about it now through this lens though right so I want to talk about it whether we're dealing with a 50-year-old woman who comes to you who's never lifted a weight in her life okay so she's the mom of three has never touched a weight um she going through menopause so now she's actually starting to put on a little bit of weight maybe for the first time in her life so she's actually starting to get a little chubby and you know you wouldn't she's not overweight but she just feels she's you know her clothes are getting a little bit snug and her assumption is I need to do more cardio I need to be more active and it probably needs to be disproportionately cardio and so so you look at her and you make the diagnosis ma'am we can do some cardio we got to put some muscle on you so you do aexa on her and she comes back 30% body fat but it's kind of skinny fat her almi is six right so meaning it puts her at the tenth percentile of muscle mass um what are you going to do with her and what are you going to make her eat yeah so I think the first thing to say is that muscle is a lot like bone in that you want to lay down as much as possible because eventually it's going to start receding uh but it is still possible to add muscle so people will hear that and go well I'm 50 I as well not yeah no the in fact right across the street from my lab at the University of Illinois sorry not my lab the lab I was in uh right across the street uh at the exercise physiology building they did a study an 80-year-old frail elderly well they basically had them start where they would squat to a high chair and come up gradually they put the chair down this was like a 16we study and I don't have the citation but I just remember talking to the other grad student about it so please forgive me everyone out there but they said they were amazed Because by the end of it one these people as a percentage of their body weight increased their lean body mass pretty much the same amount that a year old does okay so the the relative increase was similar now they're they're less overall they had less overall Mass they put on because their weight was lower to start M and then he said by the end some of them were actually able to add weight like squat with weight weight and squat all the way down to a parallel chair which the people in the study were completely mind-blown that this was possible for them and it's 16 weeks it's not even a long time you know and we're talking about people who like probably think that they're heading for a wheelchair you know like it is never too late to get active so that's the first thing right and and let's bring it back to your Finance example it's never too late to start saving Abol true that you're better off if if you can if you can be one of the fortunate people who right out of college or who doesn't even go to college and goes straight to work out of high school or whatever and you can start saving right away well that's fantastic but just because you've made it to 40 and you've been scrapping by and you haven't been able to save but now you come into a little bit of disposable income and you can start saving there is zero downside to that better late than never absolutely that's a great comparison I actually never thought about that before so I'm going to steal that for later take it so I'll give correct attribution um and then as far as diet wise so give me a typical because I I can tell you what when I see that woman in my practice which I see all the time I'll tell you what she looks like and I want you to compare it to your version of that but when I see that woman she looks exactly as I've said right so she's 50 she's going through menopause she still looks normal but the composition of her body is really changing you do that dexa she's 30 35% body fat very little muscle mass um you take a close close scrutiny of what she's eating she's getting 50 to 60 grams of protein a day on a good day um and when you do a strength metric assessment on her she is incredibly weak even as even if you were to compare her to you know another female at an appropriate age adjustment and and you know I have a very Stark conversation with her and I pull up something called the death bars so the death bars are this analysis that Bob Kaplan did for me

[01:32:43] God probably about six months ago a year ago which is basically just causes of death by decade and um I double click on accid accidental deaths so I have a we we you this this death bars is so cool because you can double click on it all over the place and once once you call out accidental deaths you realize something really interesting unlike cardiovascular disease cancer Alzheimer's disease which are very aged dependent meaning the older you get the more the incidence goes up generally with cancer it actually comes down a little bit in the last decade accidental deaths are basically the same forever once you are reach the age of 10 so from 10 year olds to 20y olds and 80y olds to 90y olds they all have the same number of accidental deaths per year more or less what differs dramatically is the type of accident so in young people it is disproportionately sadly overdoses that are the Lion's Share followed by

[01:33:44] Automotive accidents in the oldest subset of the population it becomes almost entirely accidental Falls it is and when you show somebody this graph cuz it's so pronounced I've I've never seen a person who doesn't just stop in their tracks because they cannot believe how much morbidity and mortality results from falling and Frailty once you reach about the age of 7075 I mean the data is there to back it up the the I believe I may butcher this citation but I believe there was a study by Bob wolf that was kind of a review that showed essentially after age 65 you could tie the majority of deaths to some kind of lack of muscular strength or lack of muscle and if you look at they've done these um metaanalyses of mortality showing that your lean body mass is inversely inversely proportional to your uh risk of mortality after age like 50 and by the way strength is even slightly higher

[01:34:52] Coral so so the haard ratio for being strong to not strong is about 3.2 for all cause mortality think about that which is a big Hazard ratio it's a freaking staggering Hazard ratio you're talking about on the level of smoking right there no it's higher than smoking actually smoking is about two so to put that in perspective right um endstage renal disease is about three and the only thing that's higher and I talked about this on another podcast is Elite meaning top two per top 2.5 percentile of V2 Max compared to bottom 25th percentile of V2 Max that has a Delta of five 5.1 is the hazard ratio and of course these are not mutually exclusive so why not have remarkable cardiorespiratory Fitness muscle mass and strength yep so I think one of the big barriers especially with the type of client you're talking about is well I don't want to get too bulky or too muscular can you dispel the myth of accidental muscle please yeah so as someone who's spent their entire adult life trying to get too muscular and basically just looks really fit in a t-shirt um yeah don't don't worry about that you're going to be okay and if you do start to get too muscular you can always just back off that's it's pretty easy that's like saying I mean literally let's use a finan financial comparison I'm worried about getting too rich I might get too rich and you know like okay well if you're worried about that you know we've got some great enthropy that we can introduce you to yeah yes exactly so it's like getting in a car and worried about becoming a

[01:36:30] NASCAR driver spontaneously you know the the just the amount of benefit you will get from three times a week 30 to 40 minutes of resistance training not even crazy intense resistance training just an amount that forces your body to adapt will be unbelievable in terms of your level of fitness and your ability to live a long healthy life so tell me what you would do so let's use this again this generic but rather very specific example of this 50-year-old woman who um is not completely unfit so let's even give it to her that she's she still does yoga walks does some stuff but she's never lifted weights before tell me what her first 4mon program looks like from you probably going to see what first off what's reasonable for her lifestyle like what can she actually do so let's say she says Lane I'm willing to commit to 45 minutes three times a week in the in the waight room great I think that probably lower body strength is a little bit more important than upper body strength in terms of preventing Falls I mean we always think about falls from a bone density perspective we don't want people to fall and break their hip because that that specific fall is pretty much a death sentence if you're over the age of 65 um so but people worry about the bone density well if they didn't fall in the first place if they had the muscle mass to to catch themselves um you wouldn't have to worry about that and also by the way bone density is increased by lifting weights much more than anything you'd ever get through your diet so I would say let's just see what you can do and then I would probably do two lower body days one upper body day could even flip-flop it on alternating weeks if you wanted to even it out uh and it would mostly be honestly uh just some machine stuff that's very easy for her to do to get in there because honestly she's never trained before everything's going to cause an adaptation and that's what we're looking to get like I'm not going to have her come in and try and free squat or deadlift or anything like that like that's a really horrible idea it's just going to frustrate her and and and not actually apply the load where we want it because she's not going to be able to balance it very well so when you say machines would you be thinking like look you'd be happy with her doing a leg extension a leg curl a leg press yeah would you have her do anything that's a little more compounded and complicated for example holding dumbbells and stepping up onto a bench where now she has to manage grip strength with a bit of balance and also getting the leg load or is that not first cycle I probably wouldn't do that in the initial weeks just because the soreness is going to be so high it's going to impede a lot of that movement you know well and people tend to think about soreness in the wrong way it's correlated with muscle growth and strength but it is not causitive and so what I'll tell people is if you're sore all the time you're probably training incorrectly if you're never sore you're also probably training incorrectly so it's something that if you're doing an appropriate amount of volume and intensity there probably should be some soreness from time to time but if you're getting sore all the time then your programming is pretty bad so what I'm trying to do in the initial stages is just actually get enough to adapt and not cause like enormous amounts of soreness because one it's going to be can discourage her as well it can be discouraging that's it I mean and you if you can't go about like everybody's known that like feeling after their first like hard squat day like good luck doing anything you know um and so that's going to be a discouraging thing especially if somebody's got life like not all of us are Meatheads who love that feeling and also it's going to impede her subsequent sessions right so she's not especially if you're talking about something like a step up that requires more coordination if you're overly sore that's going to be really really difficult so I'm probably going to try and get her through like four to six weeks which if we look at the data on muscle protein turnover I think we talked about this last time a little bit um you don't really see increases in hypertrophy during the six weeks the first six weeks of resistance training what you're getting is actually a remodeling of the tissue to be stronger more resist resiliant uh and it starts protecting itself against damage and so that seems to be where muscle protein synthesis goes up but muscle protein degradation also goes up and so basically you're kind of in this feudal cycle where it's just turning over the tissue after about six weeks muscle protein degradation tends to go down muscle protein synthesis stays up and that's where you start seeing those those those increases in hypertrophy and lean mass now does a train athlete also go through that or have you long since passed through that and are you now generally at the point where degradation is not having this disproportionate rise relative to synthesis so it's great question and I actually have a I thought you might ask this so I actually have a paper from Damas at all pulled up which is really interesting so if we look at myofibrillar protein synthesis in response to resistance exercise we see what tends to happen is the amplitude of muscle protein synthesis in trained people is a little bit lower than untrained so you don't have quite the same response um the it depends on when you measure if you measure at 16 hours post you're they're about the same they're about a 40% increase if you measure at four hours post there's about a trained is still about 40% untrained is about 70% so you've got a little bit of difference in amplitude but what really is the difference is the duration so in trained people it's back down to

[01:42:26] Baseline about 10 to 20 hours after the initial resistance training bout whereas the untrained people still have elevated rates of protein synthesis even like 3 days or even like two three days later and sorry Lane this is just synthesis or this is net accumulation this is just synthesis got it so it could be offset by degradation it could be and degradation is much more difficult to measure unfortunately we we we do have some so that if we get into the techniques that are used to measure this what you find is you really can't measure all three things at one time unfortunately so you can measure kind of the net balance we do that with what's called an AV balance so you're looking at you take a labeled amino acid you're infusing it and you're looking you're sampling in the arterial of a muscle bed and then the Venus of the muscle bed and so basically depending on how much of that label shows up in the vein versus the artery we know how much is being retained in muscle so that we know what the net is you can Infuse a second label to presumably get synthesis as well and then you can figure out the difference of degradation but the problem with this is it requires a steady state you can't do it when you've trained or had a meal or anything like that it's pretty much exclusively fasted because there's too many assumptions you have to make about the rate of appearance versus rate of disappearance and those sorts of things um you can measure synthesis very easily well I wouldn't very easily but much easier than um degradation and you can measure degradation but the problem with degradation is how you're measuring it because it's we know that for example out of every amino acid that's used for protein synthesis seven out of eight of them are actually from degradation so it's amino acids being recycled yeah I this of all the things we talked about in our first episode Lane this was the most novel to me and it's the one thing that I lit naturally find myself thinking about every day when I finish a workout and go and get a protein shake is I wonder how many of these amino acids in said Shake versus these amino acids that I've just eviscerated from deadlifting are actually going to be the ones that formate you know that that form through the summation of new myofibril synthesis well I would say is don't think about it that way what I would say is if you want to maximize muscle mass you want to maximize protein synthesis obviously and maximize deposition and so kind of the theory at first was all right if it's only one out of every eight and you can only really deposit about 5 to 10 grams per day net in muscle overall of amino acids I mean that's that's kind of the max say that again yeah so so about 5 to 10 grams a day um now think about if you do that over the course of a year every single day I've done this calculation before so

[01:45:23] I don't remember it exactly so I'm going to estimate that that that that would be about look if you do the math on 10 gram a day that's 8 and2 PB but what do we know about muscle tissue it's about 70% water yep so we're just talking about the actual protein content so if you take that you know 8 pounds and we divide it by point or take yeah three take uh 26 about 26 that's a lot of lean body mass right so I would say that's a lot of lean body mass even for a novice trainer so we know that it's like the max is probably about 5 to 10 grams per day in in terms of drug free do you know how much that can go up to with anabolic steroids I'm not sure quite honestly um there's just a dir of information about that just because it's hard to get um

[01:46:13] IRB approval for doing research on steroids yeah I mean it would simply be basically the anecdotal evidence of looking at a professional bodybuilder and asking you know for I would even yeah yeah I I think the magazines exaggerate a lot of stuff and I would even say 30 lbs of of actual skeletal muscle wet tissue would still be a ton for someone on drugs I mean that's a lot of skeletal muscle tissue think about go to the store and look at 30 pounds of beef oh yeah yeah no no it's insane I mean look we just had a female patient in our practice who went from being not very active to getting very active and she had aexa scan separated by five months which I generally don't like doing dexas that close together but the cardinal sin was just through circumstances we're done at different facilities the dexa suggested she gained six pounds of lean tissue I just said I can't I one of these dexas was wrong that's six pounds of lean tissue in five months um I don't know for a woman who maybe I mean is that possible it might she probably did gain some but I mean consider also so like is that would that be expected to I mean we'll know I guess when we repeat it at the one-ear mark from the beginning cuz maybe it'll plateau and this would be this remarkable adaptation out of the gate but it struck me as a lot of lean tissue but I mean if you want to gain eight pounds of lean tissue lean tissue on a dexa take a dexa it could be a lot of water yeah take a dexa jump off drink a gallon of water and jump back on and you'll have gained 8 pounds of tissue that's my point there's the hydration artifact and all these other things that could be doing yeah but she probably she probably did gain some most people's life Styles aren't that volatile that you see that difference um so she probably did gain some but in terms of muscle protein synthesis and how much you deposit muscle people say well if you only need 50 grams to meet your requirement in terms of being a positive nitrogen balance because that's how that's determined is nitrogen balance you mean the the rdas are based on just that correct yeah which are I mean let can we dismantle the RDA in a minute we we'll come back to that it'll kind of get to that so people say well just throw grams of amino acids on top of that that's or just goow 10 G protein on top of that because you're I mean you're there right that's that's not how it works you're you're assuming that every single amino acid after that just goes straight to lean tissue you've already mentioned the the thermogenic effect how much of that correct how much of that is actually coming from the protein itself being inefficiently metabolized versus a stored energy source do we know that I would say it's more about the oxidation of the protein M and where it's going but I'll I'll get to that in a moment um the the thing to keep in mind is that in order to maximize your deposition to get that 5 to 10 gram you need to maximize protein synthesis but to maximize protein synthesis requires a disproportionate amount of total protein so in order for you to maximize protein synthesis we we think it's around 1.6 to 2.4 G per kilogram of body weight so we say that again 1.6 to 2.4 G per kilogram of lean body weight or total body weight uh The Meta analysis on this was total body weight but if you want to say lean body mass then you could pump it up to like 2 to 2.8 gr per kilogram of lean body mass and you're pretty much at the same number unless you're like obese or super lean and people will like quibble about that and

[01:49:39] I like listen just just get in the just get in the ballark right um which which kind of winds up with that old like one gram per pound of body weight number right so you you need a disproportionate amount of protein to maximize the deposition and so yeah it's just kind of an interesting fact and the other thing people will say is we have this um one of the ways that protein is assessed or needs are assessed is What's called the uh um indicator amino acid method or U they also look at direct amino acid oxidation but usually the indicator is kind of the one that's the the gold standard um but if you look at direct amino acid oxidation so I I did this I I pulled up a bar of direct amino acid oxidation which basically is like if you feed a certain amount of protein if you're feeding increasing levels of protein and you look at the oxidation levels of a specific amino acid it'll be kind of flat and then you'll hit an inflection point and it'll kind of go up linearly and they've said okay that inflection point right there where you start increasing amino acid oxidation that's obviously wasteful right that that that's extra protein you don't need anym than where that inflection point is and then if you look at what actually increases muscle protein synthesis it's right at where amino acids start getting oxidized and do you think that that's just in a Association or do you think thereo you don't think that that's causitive no I don't think it's positive

[01:50:58] I I think it's more if you think about it from a theological perspective of evolution it would to me and this is one thing Don Layman was great about he would always ask me why do you think this is happening you know from an evolutionary perspective it would make sense that at the same amount of protein that you can start using it for energy that you could also start building extra tissue that to me that actually kind of makes sense you've got such a surplus that now you can begin to build more lean tissue and did you say that on average that was going to occur at roughly 2 gram per kilo well that's that's going to be the like the higher end of that linear bar

[01:51:39] I'd say probably you're probably going to see amino acid oxidation I I I don't know the exact number I could find it if I dug through enough stuff but you know probably around 1 G per kilogram of body weight protein intake something around there oh oh I see so you even start to see that at such a low level so basically at the Rd once you pass the

[01:51:59] RDA you'll probably just start to oxidize amino acids right so you really got to think about protein as you've got to throw in a lot more to get out what you want it's kind of like so it's just a very inefficient system correct which works to your advantage because again like that wasteful feudal cycle is is wasting energy you know you're expending more energy and is that all through glucan Genesis Lane all of that oxidation is it going to the liver to make glucose it's been a while so forgive me

[01:52:29] I could be wrong there is I believe some direct amino acid oxidation in terms of you have to deaminate it first but after that there's some pretty quick ways to oxidize some of those intermediates um and some of them can enter the kreb cycle directly that's right yes yes yes I we do see some paths for amino acids about y think about klate y exactly so that's a a direct um

[01:52:58] I I believe from glutamate so yeah there are these places and and I I think it's like 60% of protein is glucogenic that's right not all of it is yeah right and there there is some specific ketogenic amino acids um see this is like if I was still in grad school I would know this this is a Dom dasty no question he would know this right I think one of the branch chains is actually ketogenic um so so you can there are Pathways to both um but that's the beautiful thing about metabolism is like nothing is actually wasted you know if it's given off as heat or something like that it's because there was a reason for it you know if it's if it's metabolized in the glucose it's because there was a reason for it it's it's one of the beautiful things in fact one of the pieces of artwork I want to get in my office is the the chart of metabolism you know it's just such a cool thing to look at and you know you almost as a scientist I could look at that and go you know I could believe there's a God just just from like how beautiful that is you know what I mean sorry I realize I'm digressing here but no no no this is actually great background so let's go back to our woman she is now you got her in the gym she's there three days a week 45 minutes at a time we're doing kind of two days lower body one day upper body to start for the first six weeks the goal is don't don't get hurt don't get too sore build up the build up the habit of doing this thing find some enjoy resence get the tissue resilience you're probably overly degrading muscle and not so much synthesizing so don't expect to actually add lean mass when you do your intake assessment on her you find out she so let's say she weighs 135 pounds um so that's what 60 is kilos and you find out she's eating 50 grams of protein a day so um she says uh and and I don't you can probably think better through how many calories she probably getting on average but let's say she's getting 2300 calories per day of which only 200 is coming from her protein how do you change her macros with obviously the most important being the protein yeah so I think the one of the biggest things that I really work on people who they say well you know I you know if I can't I especially with like our our our app carbon diet coach um a lot of the people are like man these prot tell me what the app is again I've seen it on Instagram yeah it's called carbon diet coach so basically it's it's for if people feel like they have a little bit more Independence or uh they can't afford a one-on-one coach so basically the app is a nutrition coaching app if you put in your metrics it will give you macros to follow has a food tracker and then every week you check in with the coach which is an algorithm and it will adjust your Macros based on your progress so we have like we've had thousands of awesome testimonials so it's pretty cool to see but one of the big things we'll get especially from like gin pop is how do I hit these protein recommendations and when I go in most of their protein sources are really fatty cuts of meat that's that's one thing and so I'll say okay one pump up your portion size but let's select leaner cuts of meat right because you're not necessarily trying to increase their calories you're trying to basically keep them almost isocaloric but shift more to protein absolutely and and sometimes even like in her case I wouldn't necessarily recommend it cuz she's already kind of small but if people do have a little bit of excess body fat especially if they're new to training they can recm they they ABS absolutely can recomp lose fat and gain muscle at the same time and in that case that might be a place where I would do it just because it sounds like she has a little bit more body fat than she probably should for her body weight that's right she's probably by BMI let's assume her height is such that by BMI she's totally fine she's at bmia 25 um but we we would love to see her be at 22% body fat in 2 years instead of 35% body fat and we would in two years I'd like to see her have you know 10 more pounds of muscle Y and that's pretty reasonable goals um and so one of the things I would say is okay let's look at the portions of if you are eating meat let's look at the portions of meat you are eating and and sorry what's your what's your protein Target for her you know a lot of it's going to be one what can I get her to eat right like if I I can throw but starting from starting from theoretically exceptional and then yeah I would probably say if we could get you at like 120 gram okay so about about about a gram per pound almost yeah and and it probably could be a little bit less 110 you know because she she isn't doesn't have a lot of lean body mass so probably 100 110 is going to be just fine anywhere in that range is going to be just fine okay and then and then your strategy is what how do you how much in Shake how much in yeah first thing is breakfast okay so breakfast is where most Americans are very low in protein because most breakfast foods either don't eat breakfast or it's a banana or it's cereal or it's oatmeal or whatever oh and sorry I'm going to just keep making up to be funny she says but Lane the thing that has been so helpful for me is I do time-restricted eating so I I do just two meals a day uh lunch and dinner first thing I would say is okay why are you doing Tim restricted eating and she'll say because it really helps me maintain my weight the thing I would say is okay you can probably still get the vast majority of the benefits of time-restricted eating just throwing down a lean protein Source or a shake in the morning right and now you're you're getting in boom another 25 or 30 grams of protein you're stimulating protein synthesis and protein itself I mean high protein diets actually mimic some of the the things that go up during fasting so

[01:58:43] I would say that protein acts a little bit differently and one of the things I said to people if they are you know trying to increase or maximize lean body mass but they want to do you know time-restricted eating for the benefits of satiety and like lifestyle cool do that but throw in a protein shake in the morning just because it's it's not going to mess up you know any of those things and it's going to help with lean body mess what about mtor right I mean mtor is responsive to amino acids and of course I'm going to argue you're not getting much mtor suppression with an overnight fast and skipping breakfast but you know where does you know but what about low igf and all of these other things that are aren't these the important pillars of longevity isn't all this extra protein you're making me eat at odds with that let me answer that question after I get to how I'd add more protein because that's really really I was talking about somebody about this the other day and it it's a great question and so many people mess it up so the next thing I would do is okay let's look at lunch where can we get more protein um if it's not a if it's not a shake or anything like that let's pump up you know some lean protein in the sandwich or or let's add it to your a salad or you know whatever it is is whatever I don't want to like fundamentally change how she's eating if the calorie amount is okay I want to make small changes that aren't going to feel disruptive to our current Lifestyle the minimal disruption of the current lifestyle in fact the research shows that in terms of dietary adherence the less you can change the better they will do because it's already close to their current lifestyle so then if we get to dinner which is where most people get about 65% of their protein again assuming we've gotten you know 20 30 grams of breakfast 20 30 grams at lunch and again people say well how many shakes can I have hey if you like having shakes there's nothing wrong with shakes absolutely nothing wrong go go ham like there's nothing wrong with it I want to make sure we come back and talk about shakes and proteins and the different types so between the two of us let's remember that because that's I think that's another question down shakes and then we got to talk about mtor yep first and then at dinner obviously okay if they've been having fattier cuts of meat which a lot of people they have a RI eye they have and again I'm not saying you can't have those things but again if calories are a consideration um ribey

[02:00:58] T-Bone those sorts of things okay well let's move to like a sirloin or a filet or a chicken breast or like even like you can get pork chops that are really lean too that are very tasty so or you know venison or just just some sort of by the way I had a uh I was at a place called um steelbach here in Tampa and they had a a venison um ribeye or something like that

[02:01:21] I think it was a ven is in ribey amazing it was like four gram of fat per serving amazing so you can really just by simply changing the cuts of meat you can pump up the protein reduce the fat your calories kind of stay about the same and then again I I like to use shakes wherever somebody just says Hey I just don't have especially as people get older they they tend to consume less protein and have less of an appetite for protein especially like the mastication as as people get older they they just don't like having to chew as much um and so shakes can be a really really useful tool and even if like somebody's having like carb heavy breakfast typically like a cereal or something like that there's such good like ready to drink shakes out there right now instead of milk on your cereal just put a protein shake a vanilla protein shake and boom you've got 30 grams of protein instead of eight you know so the really I mean now I mean

[02:02:15] Peter I'm sure you can speak to this compared to when I started like in the late '90s early 2000s I mean literally I got a can of unflavored protein from GNC one time I was like oh I can do this you know cuz it was cheap and I was a college student and I could not do it was like chalk it was literally like chalk my first when I was in high school there was this brand called sheckley I think um yep yeah it was it was pretty bad but boy we would and the protein bars which again not the best tool but again what are we replacing it with right so if you're having a protein bar instead of like a really you know a burger or something like that that great great alternate substitute and there's some great tasting ones out there now now your question about intor and igf-1 oh sorry just going before we wrap up her so the biggest change you've made is you've doubled her protein intake which in reality is almost an isocaloric switch like you're it's a rounding error in terms of how many additional calories you've add are you paying attention to what percentage carb versus fat in this woman given that our primary goal is going to be hyper trophy over the next couple of years so the research on hypertrophy leads me to think as far as carbs and fats go it mostly doesn't matter as long as you're not at the extreme of either so if you are very very lowfat it can impair testosterone levels um now they've never not really shown like an impairment of lean Massac crule but they haven't really measured it either and I would say that if impairs testosterone enough you may get an impairment of lean body mass as far as how much t as far as how much fat that is it's very difficult question because they've done it as a percentage of calories which to me is almost useless because obviously if you know 10% of calories if you're eating 5,000 calories is still probably enough fat and as you have more calories you can also create fat or spare fat from oxidation by using more carbohydrates so first off it's a it's a calorie amount issue as well but I would say if you're getting at least 20% of your calories from fat you're probably safe and as an absolute floor you know like 40 grams of fat

[02:04:22] I'm again I'm guessing so please don't be dogmatic about these numbers to those who are listening but then also like a ketogenic diet does appear to impair lean body mass acrel probably through a few different mechanisms um even though carbohydrates aren't stimulatory for muscle protein synthesis they do inhibit muscle protein degradation and um fat doesn't appear to have the same effect it's probably an insulin effect insulin doesn't inhibit muscle protein degradation and it's also a bit of a it's almost impossible to be on a ketogenic diet if you're actually generating sufficient ketones and that's your metric for saying you're ketogenic with the amount of protein that we were talking about anyway because for someone your size it would be very difficult for you to get high levels of beta hydroxy berate with the amount of protein that you would need to be in that positive nitrogen balance anyway so correct so I think um the the other way that it probably impairs lean body mass AC cruel is through just effect on training because you know resistance training is anerobic uh for the most part right so her glycolytic capacity goes down yeah and that requires glucose yeah yep so it's you know the the research shows that if we're talking about Ultra endurance or even endurance in terms of like under 65 70% of a V2 Max ketogenic compares to be just fine but once you start getting over that 65% V2 Max there does seem to be a significant impairment um in in in performance and and that could also be so there was a couple of 12we studies looking at lean body mass acrel and showing an impairment with the ketogenic diet my guess is it's one through not inhibiting muscle protein degradation as much and two just through not performing as well and they do they did show lower strength acrel as well in the ketogenic diet group so so your fat to carb ratio in her given that we're not going to go to any extreme end um I notice in your programming um because you know some of the stuff that you've you've written about you talk about look here is where you kind of customize it based on how you respond to carbs so some people carbs really increase their appetite they you know create brain fog all sorts of things if you're in that camp you're going to push to a lower carb variant here if you're someone who tolerates carbohydrates very well you could easily be on a higher version there and that becomes the secondary fill after the primary bucket of protein is established absolutely protein calories most important two things how you distribute your carbohydrates and fat should be based on what you could adhere to and what you enjoy and you know whether it's I I could argue that like brain fog or appetite that it depends on the the type of carbohydrate a lot of it might be possibly Placebo as well just based on things that have been said in the media regardless if you know that you just prefer a lower carb diet then there's absolutely nothing wrong with doing it as long as you're not getting to the extreme end of a low carb diet um and even then it's a it's a it's a balancing act right it's it's okay you know what I really really enjoy the ketogenic diet I

[02:07:25] UND but my goal isn't to be the biggest most muscular person I possibly can be well you can still gain lean body mass on a ketogenic diet and so this is where like nutrition communication really requires Nuance yeah because what somebody might hear what I just said is L saying you can't gain muscle on a ketogenic diet no I'm I'm just saying you can't gain as much but you can absolutely gain muscle same thing with intermittent fasting you can absolutely gain muscle on intermittent fasting are you going to build as much probably not quite but again it depends on what your goal is if your goal is my primary focus is muscle mass then I would say Okay protein calories and making sure you have enough carbohydrate as well but if your primary goal is maintaining body composition if you put on a little bit less muscle mass but you like being low carb then then do it right so it's really going to boil down to for this individual lady hey what do you what do you what do you like best and then even for some people when you know if they get overwhelmed by like protein carbs and fats I'll say hey hey just track your calories and track your protein that that's it right like those are the big buckets and then and then if you want to get more granular you can right like I get granular because I want to make sure I'm I'm kind of getting a consistent amount of carbohydrates and fats because I don't want my performance to fluctuate very much and I also don't want my body weight to fluctuate a ton because I use that to to track various metrics in our app um but I you know for most people calories and protein two huge buckets and you're getting 90 99% of the benefits now I want to come back to your your what this person might say about mtor and igf-1 I've heard these things are bad you know what what what what would you say and there's been a lot of

[02:09:02] I know David Sinclair has has brought out a lot of stuff and saying you know I really try to limit mtor and igf1 and it will never cease to amaze me how many scientists do not understand the difference between a short-term truncated acute response to a stressor versus disregulated signaling that persists indefinitely and what I mean is when you look at mtor elevations that that lead to cancer and whatnot those originate at what I would say mostly insulin resistance so you're having elevations in insulin you're having elevations in insulin signaling through akt which which can then transmit to mtor and so it's like this chronic kind of lowlevel pushing that button right as opposed to a pulsatile that is a big difference between a a dose of protein that causes in to to rise go back down in a natural

[02:10:05] Rhythm okay also tissue specific we're talking about in skeletal muscle not liver not brain necessarily those sorts of things igf-1 same deal and what I will say is where are all the resistance trained people that are getting cancer by the droves because if you want to talk about amplitude of response from mtor resistance training dwarfs what protein does if we look at the metaanalyses on cancer incidents amongst resistance trainers and there's getting to be some now we see lower levels of cancer in people who resistance train so what that tells me is there's a difference between these two signals and

[02:10:46] I want to point out something there because I think it would be very quick to say but laye there's a healthy user bias there blah blah blah blah blah I don't think what you're saying is that that proves that lifting makes you live longer I think what you're actually saying is no it's the contrapositive it demonstrates that lifting doesn't increase mtor to the point of it being detrimental to your health that can be asserted I think from that observation or that it's tissue also tissue specific um that that's part of it um let's let's let's use a different example so let's look at exercise and General so if you were Peter if you got educated in medical school but knew nothing about exercise yeah I love this yeah this is one of my favorite discussion you know where I'm going with this I I and I told you I'm going to do something that's going to make you elevate your heart rate elevate your inflammatory markers elevate your reactive oxygen species glucose outut output yeah what what would you say to me about that yeah of course I'd say yeah this is this can't be good for you don't do that yeah and what is exercise it does all those things right so why is exercise good for us because that is a shortterm stressor

[02:11:58] I mean we use the term hormesis if you want um that the body responds to and it actually acts kind of like a vaccine I realize that's like a really triggering term for a lot of people right now but it's like it's like a vaccine right it's a controlled dose of a stressor that your body can handle and I kind of look at protein this I wouldn't say protein is a stressor necessarily but again it's this acute response versus a chronic hum right your inflammatory markers like people who deal with like elevated inflammation it's not actually super high elevations but it's just all the time that chronic pulse on that that is the problem that is the issue and again you you set they might say well there's healthy user bias there and I would say so what okay um so you're saying that people who have high rates of igf-1 and mtor who are healthy okay well show me them getting higher incidents of cancer you can't you can't because all these things are tied together because people who have high levels of mtor activation in igf-1 typically have insulin resistance they have poor dietary habits and poor lifestyle habits so I would say that it okay that's a a fair point there there's confounding variables but all these things are tied up together you can't really separate them um and again am am I saying that inor plays absolutely no role no but you know you're kind again it can be cart before the horse sort of thing like um people say well rapamycin is an mtor inhibitor and that's a cancer treatment drug and I would say yes but do you think it's a good idea to take do chemotherapy to prevent cancer I don't think so I don't think radiation is a idea it's not even really true because rapy is not really I mean it's never really been a particularly successful cancer therapeutic it used constitutively which is how it would be used uh obviously I'm I think rapy does have significant longevity benefits in basically all models that aren't humans so the extrapolation would be pulsatile rapamycin is probably beneficial but it's in that application it's not really being taken to constantly suppress mtor because remember if you took it all the time you're suppressing mtor complex 2 and mtor complex one so um yeah no I I agree with that point actually completely which is that tissue specificity and time course are very difficult things to um infer from the outside which is sort of the

[02:14:48] The Meta view of all things equal you know igf levels have a J curve with mortality and therefore very very high levels of igf must be problematic and high protein increases igf and therefore must be bad and I think it's important to also understand the following and that is I think we have this idea I think I might have missed this on the last show but I think we have this idea that like there's this perfect diet out there it's going to be the one diet that's going to you know help you know reduce cancer and cardiovascular disease and mortality and all and the fact is that the there's probably trade-offs for everything right I I'm not I know there's people out there that will say that protein increases cancer well there's a ton of confounders to that like somebody's saying well there's healthy user bias sure but there's ton of confounders to people who eat high protein most protein in these meta analyses looking at cancer

[02:15:40] I mean you're talking about high protein is above you know 70 grams of protein per day or 1.2 gr per kilogram of body weight okay well where do most people most Americans eat high protein by definition of the RDA but where is it from it's from burgers and hot dogs and like a bunch of processed meat so what what does the cancer incident say about people who have high protein but an overall healthy diet and there was a really interesting cohort study out of Alberto and 100,000 people where they said okay we're going to look at meat intake and I think even red meat intake specifically we're going to look at low low medium and high levels of red meat intake but also with low medium and high levels of fruit and vegetable intake and because here's the big the big uh thing is most people who eat high levels of meat and protein eat low levels of fruits and vegetables what they found was that at the highest levels of meat intake but also with the highest levels of fruit and vegetable intake there was no difference in cancer incidence between the lowest level of fruit or of the lowest level of meat intake and even with the highest level of fruit and vegetable intake it's not an issue so other words it's a marker for overall diet quality is bingo so and I again I don't want to extrapolate too much out of one study even though it was a large study um but what that would seem to suggest is that overall diet quality is the big rock that we're looking at here and you can achieve good diet quality on a whole host of different diets I mean you can have a ketogenic diet that's very poor quality diet you can have a ketogenic diet that's very high quality diet you can have a plant-based diet that's very low quality and you can have a plant-based that's very high quality you can have intermittent fasting that's low quality and so on and so forth a lot of it boils down to like what are the food choices you're making on balance you know are you getting enough fruits and vegetables and minerals and and and micronutrients and even then you know it's so interesting every time we try to say okay well fruits and vegetables have these you know these benefits on health that we see pretty consistently so let's try and take out these isolated micronutrients and give them in a supplement we just we're always disappointed with the results and it just seems to be a little bit of Mother

[02:18:07] Nature's kitchen you know what I mean that you kind of have to eat the whole food to really get those benefits um but yeah I I think again if the intour story were true in ter terms of dietary protein we would have expected in that study to see a linear increase in cancer reg especially at each level of fruit and vegetable intake but we didn't what we saw was more of a linear inverse association with fruit and vegetable intake is what we saw so let's now talk about a different example of a person who comes to you so now let's just use a male instead of a female last one and let's talk about kind of a a 40 50y old male who's trained so they have a training background um but you know they are also realizing what you said earlier which is hey I'm going to start losing muscle mass as a at a pretty good clip once I'm in my 50s and certainly by the time I'm 65 it really starts to nose dive so the aha moment is I need to build up as much of a reservoir as possible so there's a person who says look I've always been an athlete I've always done x y and z but I've never really thought about muscle mass I want to start thinking about it now maybe

[02:19:24] I've got a decade to pack as much on as possible before I'll go into that just maintain it as long as I can mode okay so this is a person who they're lifting weights three days a week an hour at a time they even do some you know they squat they deadlift they do a whole body sort of let's say they do a whole body split every day for those three days um and let's say their dexa scan is 20% fat so they're probably middle of the pack maybe they're probably 20% fat would probably be 25th percentile actually for a 50-year-old um and now they come to and they say Lane okay I want to go Allin like I want to know can I be 10% body fat so they're not trying to be a bodybuilder but they they want to be 10% body fat in two years and uh let's just assume that their BMI is 25 as well no let's say it's not let's actually say their BMI is 27 so they're technically a little bit overweight and they've got a little extra body fat um how are you going to change their training how are you going to prescribe nutrition yeah so let me ask a question back have have they been training consistently up to this point yeah they've been training relatively consistently but when you look at it you realize they're not really in a progressive overload mindset right like they they've become a little comfortable in their training um if you if you if you dig under you know you'll you'll notice that they haven't really increased the weight in anything they're doing in five years the first thing is looking at the resistance training is okay just what you said all right you're doing three sets of 10 on everything right and you slap a plate on or you slap two plates on and you do the same thing you've been doing adaptation is never comfortable so what you're trying to do to grow muscle you're trying to induce adaptation it hyper muscular hypertrophy is an adaptation to a stressor placed on the body in this case the stressor is volume and mechanical load right so either you need to increase the weight the repetitions or the number of sets and doing so is going to be uncomfortable your body is going to tell you it's uncomfortable um and I've had this even my own coach who I you know is coaching me for for Nationals this year for powerlifting it so funny I was like you know starting to kind of have this linear effect coming back from these injuries I've had and uh then one week you know I kind of had a dip in performance and I also um also was feeling really beat up and he just responded one line said adaptation is never comfortable and uh it's so true it really is and and we talked about this sort of thing so just um mentally gearing this person up for the idea that hey you know you've been comfortable we're going to go start doing some things that are uncomfortable and whether it's it's those particular exercises he's been doing it sounds like he's been doing big compound movements so probably going to keep him on that um I would like to get you know video feedback to see what his form is like especially with you know injury considerations as we age uh and pain so getting some feedback on those making sure that you know he is getting the requisite amount of load Progressive overload and also at this age and with trying to push now it's also about knowing when do we build in some tapers so that he can actualize those gains and recover as well because here's the thing about adaptation at a certain point if you've been training for long enough and you're old enough the amount that you need to cause adaptation versus what is going to cause you to overreach is going to become closer and closer and closer right when you first start when you first get into training you need almost nothing to adapt right like you come in and do one set of leg extensions you will get an adaptation from that right if you do it consistently for several weeks been training five years one set of leg extensions is going to do absolutely nothing it might maintain what you have that's it and so if you want to push adaptation you have to push harder which is going to create more of a recovery deficit and so while your recovery is going your recovery recovery capacity is going to increase as you get older and have a greater training experience it's not going to increase as much as the amount of stress that you're going to have to apply to adapt so again

[02:24:01] I think having builtin tapers is really important and whether you do them responsively in terms of okay this this person has been getting like week to week we've seen he's adding five pounds oh this week we had a dip in performance now maybe we reactively do a taper that's possible or whether you build in systematically to try and get ahead of that curve either way can work in in the lad Lane what is the typical uh duration of a of a build cycle taper cycle it's probably going to get progressively closer together the more advanced you get so I I'll give you my Situation's kind of unique so I'll get my I get my kids week on week off and we have notice that the weeks I get my kids I get less sleep I have a little more stress and

[02:24:49] I'm uh my performance goes down a little bit and we see that and I also I track bar velocity as well so how do how do you do that what what equipment do you use for that I use a device called rep one which is a um uh accelerometer uh it's available for purchase by private individuals it's about $400 so it's it's really honestly it's nerd stuff if you're really dialed in but I like to use it because I if I don't push the weight I can try and look at the speed and see you know comparatively okay compared to last time did I move the same weight faster or slower and so when we look at my performance in terms of strength rpe um speed all those measures consistently show that on typically on weeks that the kids are with me I'm I'm just not quite as good I'm about 90 to 95% as good so we've actually built in micro cycles of tapering so it's sort of a push week a slightly back off week at one week at a time yeah now overall through the micro Cycles we're trying to walk up the volume and the progressive overload and then after you know probably four to eight weeks we'll do a much bigger taper where we pull back on everything but we do micro tapers in between now so for this guy for this guy probably four four to eight weeks okay so you'd say look I'm going to guesstimate that call split the difference for six weeks I'm going to push you how and then you're going to back off how much and for how long so I like to back off the volume and also the intensity a little bit so whereas maybe we're up to you know a 789 RP on most sets and when

[02:26:31] I say RP we're talking about rate of perceived exertion and an easy way to think about it is if it's a 7even RP on a set then that person could have done three more reps before they hit absolute failure um so most rpes to me for advanced people should be close to seven or eight with a few sets pushing into a nine and very rarely should you push to a 10 there's quite a bit of literature out there to show that you get a you get basically the same hypertrophy training close to failure that you do going to

[02:27:04] Absolute failure and the it's not necessarily that failure is bad it's just the amount of recovery deficit it creates the amount of Taxation it creates uh is disproportionate to the stimulus so what we really want to do is maximize hypertrophy while and stimulus while minimizing fatigue because if you're yes sure you can get a similar um stimulus by going to failure and maybe even just a little bit more but if it then causes you to have performance decrements the following week or not be able to push as hard overall we have to think about this as an overall training program and not just isolated workouts and that's I'm very purposeful when I tell people I go into train I don't go in to workout right like working out is just an isolated workout and I've had so many people with big egos who say well I couldn't possibly not train to failure first of all I've watched them they're not actually training to failure like I know what actual muscular failure feels like on a squat for example a free bar squat so people I've seen this on Dr

[02:28:20] Mike Israel's Instagram too because he talks about training Shia failure a lot as well and people will say something like oh you train like a wuss you know this isn't that hard and what I want to say to them is I have done so probably one of my most impressive squat sets is I did 480 pounds for 14 reps and I've done uh 405 pounds for 21 reps before I couldn't move afterwards it probably took me first off it probably took me five minutes just to get my breath back just to breathe enough to like be a functional human after that then as far as like going to do another set first off when I hit that 480 and I grinded out that last rep that 14th rep I was so fatigued I couldn't rack the right side of the barbell because for whatever reason I'm a little bit lops side and it sits just a hair lower there I could not fully lock out my glutes and lower back and I could couldn't rack it and there was actually somebody had to run over from across the gym to help me rack it even though normally it's no problem and then I laid down for five minutes just trying to get my breath back and then when I got up if you told me I had to go squat 480 again

[02:29:36] I I I'm telling you I couldn't have gotten a single rep even after resting 101 15 minutes there's not a chance in hell so this idea so you're telling me if I stopped too rep shy of that that that would have felt easy or or that it would have f failed to produce Bing and actually with uh compound movement specifically we you don't have to get as close to failure to get the benefits with compound movements by the way I feel so much better hearing this today um uh today was a deadlift day and uh this cycle I'm doing trap bar which I actually don't like very much but I did sort of my trap bars and then I supposed to go to hip thrusters after and I was not feeling great on it in a really it just didn't feel like it was going so I was like you know what I really missed doing Sumo deadlifts so I went and did

[02:30:22] Sumo deadlifts and they felt great but on the very last set I added a bunch more weight on and at the sixth rap or eighth rep I was like I feel really good but something tells me if I try to get to 10 today I'm going to push just a little too much so I sort of bagged it at 8 and afterwards I was like I'm really proud of myself like I didn't do something stupid CU today's one of those days cuz you know to deadlift two different deadlifts on one day and it's at the end of the workout like that those are the moments when you make mistakes yeah um but but I like knowing that and that was probably truthfully I think I probably had four reps in me left so that might have only been a six or a seven

[02:31:02] RP um but you still get benefit absolutely and the research shows that so what was popular a few years ago was kind of the effective reps hypothesis I don't know if you've heard of this what's that so basically the idea is that the majority of the stimulus that you get the for muscle grow is in the the last five reps before failure so whether you're doing 20 reps means you need to get to at least 15 reps to really get a similar stimulus y um and in terms of volume and Progressive overload you really need to think about volume in terms of just number of hard sets within like a five

[02:31:36] RP but the research shows that that's much more accurate for isolation stuff than it is for compound so compound lifts are kind of a their own Beast you you can train at a sub five RP and still get like maximal um EMG Recruitment and quite a bit of hypertrophy whereas with isolation you pretty much have to take it close to failure and then the other thing I would say is that you know exercises are not equivalent you know that that's a big thing is like all right let's do a five

[02:32:08] RP on a squat and then a nine RP on a on a leg extension I'll tell you the 9 RP on leg extens I can do that all day I I'll take that all I was just about to say that is infinite less painful exactly versus a big compound movement that requires core and stabilization and breathing and creating intraabdominal pressure you know all that kind of stuff you know factors into fatigue so you know for for this individual yeah so tell me about sets and Reps here so um again let's prese let's assume he's much more interested in hypertrophy than strength uh he's not he's he's he's not going to power power lift um what's the rep range you're going to keep him in for compound movements and for isolated movements variety is the spice of life and um the research shows that from one rep to 30 reps you can build very similar amounts of muscle so this is amazing right because the conventional wisdom says oh my God if you're doing fewer than I don't know what the number is that they would say if you're doing fewer than six reps there's no hypertrophy it's all strength right that's what that's what conventional thinking would say and what I will say is there you know there are benefits to being in that hypertrophy rep range of you know six to 15 reps that's kind of like traditional um so here here's here's the benefits and downsides one of the nice things about the 6 to 15 reps is you can accumulate quite a bit of metabolic fatigue you can use relatively heavy loads and you can get quite a bit of volume in that rep range if you're doing like really heavy weights for low reps say under five reps you functionally would have to double your number of sets just to get the volume right probably not because it's it's more about the number of hard sets Okay but doing a hard set of five is not the same thing as doing a hard set of 10 you have fewer of them in you presumably right probably there's probably a greater fatigue effect but some people again like me if you told me I couldn't train you know under five reps I'd be like a I'm just going to be bored you know I don't like doing High Reps it's just uh I get bored so for me and it's the same thing with clients again adherence is number one right so if he says oh I'm not worried about creating strength but I really like lifting heavy weights okay we're going to find a way to incorporate that but it might be where hey we're touching one set that's under five reps and the rest are going to be you know six to 10 on these compound exercises and then on the isolation exercises you know we go 1520 um you know just for some variety and whatnot but really the research at least in the short term and when I say short term I mean like 12 weeks we don't see differences in hypertrophy um be between anywhere from you know Low Reps to up to 30 reps as long as the number of hard sets are equated so really it says do what you like do what you enjoy and what is that what is that sweet spot for hard sets if we just pick 10 reps so then we can do the math and go up or down so the sweet spot is what maximizes per body part is probably about six to 10 sets in a session okay so they don't really they don't really see in you know improvements above 10 sets now here's where this gets a little bit complicated because um if you rest longer each set actually becomes more effective as a stimulus for hypertrophy presumably because you perform better and you can use more weight and do more reps on that individual set so the number based on the meta regressions out there and I think James creger did a really good one the number seems to be like if you're resting kind of like you know more than three minutes between sets six sets if you're resting like one to two minutes it might be more like 10 sets wow um but again the other thing to keep in mind is you don't have to just jump to like 10 sets immediately you know per body part you know whatnot that that's a lot of sets um you should probably use what is ever allowing you to adapt at the time if you're somebody who is you know relatively new to training you start doing 10 sets per body part like one what's going to happen once you plateau that's a lot more sets you're going to have to add on top of that and two you're probably going to outpace your recovery capabilities right you you like when people tell me they're going to do

[02:36:45] I know you you talked about covering uh squatting and deadlifting every day um what I would say is you better be in a re you better be in very good physical condition to do that um and even then there is an expiry date on that and and I've talked to people who have done this uh to be clear I've never done this I I

[02:37:08] I look at the people who have tried it in awe but I I just I'm not willing to give up so many of the other things I do exercise wise to just make sure I squat in deadlift every single day but what I notice that they're doing is they're being very clever in that they're not every day is not a crushing set of that right I mean yeah some of those days it's a very very low volume uh low intensity that functions effectively as a recovery day where they're basically working on the muscle memory and the form um yeah but so for example in the case of this guy if he says Lane I'm willing to train as much as you need to tell me to so even though currently I'm doing three 60-minute workouts a week um if you tell me I need to be in there five days a week with two rest days and that should be two hours a day I'm willing to do it um yeah where would you say again let's assume that his form is decent you're not concerned about overuse uh where would you want to put him if he's not looking to powerlift and he you know if he says I don't really care about exercise selection just pick whatever I'm probably not going to be doing a lot of free squatting and deadlifting even though that's my personal love y um because th those do create a very high recovery debt um and not just that it's very mentally taxing I remember when um my wife Holly moved over and she's a phenomenal athlete like went to the junior World Games as a track athlete um like won the natural Olympia two years after she started lifting weights I mean just incredibly genetically gifted and hardworking person but she would look at me doing like triples on squats and then resting 10 minutes between sets and say why why are you resting so long that can't possibly be that difficult meanwhile she's over there doing sets of 10 resting you know she's slapping a plate on each side doing sets of 10 and resting you know couple minutes and I said well you'd have to really do a powerlifting meat to understand and then she did one and then she was like yeah the amount of intense mental focus it requires when you have that much weight on your back and you know it like this could literally kill you yeah um now obviously you have safeties and spotters and whatnot but just you know strapping 600 lb across your back I mean there's a reason your adrenaline spikes so after that she understood but that's a lot of Rec recovery debt to create for something that you could get a similar stimulus by doing a hack squad or a leg press or that sort of thing as long as you're working through a full range of motion and that's the other thing very important to work a muscle at a long muscle length in fact there was actually a recent metaanalysis that came out looking at partial range of motion but partial range of motion at different muscle lengths and found that while partial range of motion at shorten muscle lengths does not produce the same hypertrophy as full range of motion partial range of motion at lengthened muscle lengths produce similar hypertrophy as full range of motion so let me make sure I understand that lane so let's just use a bicep because it's easy at the lengthened part of the bicep when you are straight armed you're saying a partial rep from straight to say 90 degrees is more effective than if you just do the top of the bicep so even and let's assume you do the same range but because at the shorter um at the shorter range you're not seeing um presumably as much adaptation or recruitment by the muscle presumably although the bicep might be a little bit different because you would actually have to be on like an incline bench to truly get the stretched range of motion because otherwise in a traditional dumbbell curl that the top end is actually the more difficult component of the rep whereas if you kind of pre- stretch it now you can make that bottom part a little more difficult so but if we think about something like a squat right like a partial range of motion squat if you're doing a partial range of motion in the bottom half that is not going to be easy right so I think it's more about working the muscle in the difficult regions but the stretch component does seem to be important so what I would say is like I would really I really am a big fan of like something like a hack squat for leg development if you don't care about you know being strong on free squats um because if you get a good machine you can take it through a really full range of motion um you can really get a good stimulus for the quadriceps and some of the rest of the leg muscles and it's not crazy fatiguing so something like that a leg press there's also like really good pendulum squats I really like a good pendulum squat nobody's ever tried that so it's kind of like you sit in a seat and it's on an arm so where you're kind of going so if there's a pivot here and the weight is loaded here and you get in here hopefully I'm displaying this yeah and then as you go down the weights here basically as you get lower are your hands loading in front or are you loading yeah yeah they're right here so as you're getting lower it gets a little bit easier because of the pendulum Y and then as you get higher it gets harder which actually works on your strength curve because the hardest part of the squat is near the bottom and the easiest part is near the top so I really like those two because those are exercises you can really work through a nice full range of motion and create a lot of stimulus and like I said I think full range of motion or training in that that stretched position is very very important and so you know I usually like to have kind of like two main exercises for a big muscle group like that you probably don't need it you probably could just do hack squats for five or six sets you know that sort of thing but people like variety and then I would do you know and

[02:43:15] I would keep those between you know a six and an eight RP most like and then you know go to a leg extension and leg curl and those sorts of things and or well I'd probably do an RDL some sort of RDL um because it's not as fatiguing as a deadlift but you're still activating similar muscles um once again keeping that between a 68 RP and are you going to are you going to coach that with like obviously one leg are you going to do

[02:43:39] Ipsy or ISO grab on the kettle bell I would probably do a barbell honestly and do both legs and then if you know if we felt like there was some imbalance or something like that or they just want some variety you could do single leg um it is going to if if muscular hypertrophy is the primary goal you can create more stimulus using you know both legs at the same time um and then with then doing some like isolation stuff low rest periods higher reps you know 10 to 20 repetitions going to a little bit higher RP you know like a nine an eight or nine RP I think those are fine and then if somebody said you know I just I've got to take a set to failure it's you know part of My Credo I came from the 80s bodybuilding I said great take the last ex last set of the last exercise of an isolation to failure and go nuts right like do something like that um and that might be How I build out a leg session you know like the the the bigger compound exercises a little bit lower reps you know maybe 5 to 10 then as we progress through you know more isolation going into the higher end of the rep range and maybe taking some a little bit closer to failure and is he going to do this two or three times a week so frequency interestingly I think that the men analyses so far haven't been sensitive enough to pick it up but what it says is that for legs it doesn't matter one time a week is enough but for upper body two times a week I think probably multiple times a week for both is beneficial your ph3 program is about 5 days a week right of total but so was five days it was five days a week um three days of lower body three days of three days of squatting two days of deadlifting three days of bench pressing and also accessory on those days as well uh what

[02:45:27] I will say is for the most part frequency is more of a tool to distribute volume than it is an individual hypertrophy stimulus but it does seem to me that it would make sense and again a lot of people scientists have gotten in trouble saying well this just makes sense um but it would seem to me that if you have a a muscle protein synthesis response especially in trained individuals that's only you know 16 20 24 hours that that multiple doses of that are probably better than just doing one dose and and thinking you got it all um so again I think part of that's just we don't have enough studies yet and we don't have the sensitivity to detect that and also the studies are so heterogeneous in terms of the population that's used their training status the type of exercises that are used how RP is measured how intensity is measured measured how volume is measured it's really hard to get good metaanalyses of these sorts of things I do think in the next 5 to 10 years there's going to be like the amount of hypertrophy research that's come out in the last 5 to 10 years is literally an explosion compared to pre 2010 I think I read one metaanalysis on hypertrophy from resistance training in the entire time I was in graduate school are there a couple that we should link to in the show notes here that are just the the if if if someone's going to say look I'm willing to Wade through two meta analyses on this are there a couple you'd recommend yeah there there's a few

[02:46:54] I'd recommend and I'll I'll send an email to you guys yeah so there's like some of that would be um some of the stuff that's been done by James creger and and some other folks that really kind of looks at all right like set number and volume and and those sorts of things so U but for this guy I mean really if I had to like putting out like an actual program day-to-day is difficult just because it's a lot of it boils down to personal preference in terms of how I'm program it and and presumably you'll get feedback right so you might say like this is what we'll start with but we're going to modify it after this first cycle so let's talk about his nutrition now so so so uh let's pretend that you you you assess him so I forget what I said he weighs uh let's make up a weight he's 175 pounds he's 180 PBS I don't know whatever um and I think we said he's 20ish per by dexa low 20s um and let's say he's eating 120 gram of protein a day so right off the bat you're going to say hey you're a little light on protein this guy is going to be willing to eat anything you say so if where do you want him do you want this guy at 180 grams a day 200 grams a day what was his body W again let's say 180 yeah I mean I would if he likes protein I would say you know you're not miss you're not having any downsides to having 200 grams a day and that's a nice number to shoot for so I would probably start somewhere around there um making sure his calories are adequate as well for facilitating recovery and enough carbohydrate and whatnot so in this in this guy's case he um because he really wants to gain lean mass how do you think about cycling him in terms of making him hypercaloric I mean where where are you trying to put his energy balance how much weight do you want him gaining since he's been training for a long time and he's older the likelihood that he's going to be able to gain lean mass without at least some body fat is probably pretty low um and I get this all the time from people

[02:48:46] I want to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time well if you're our our subject a the lady who'd never trained before absolutely I mean you heard me I was like yeah we can recm her no problem she's going to gain some muscle lose some some body fat when you've been training for a long period of time the you have to have everything lined up just to gain ounces of lean body mass and so part of lining that up is also a slight caloric

[02:49:16] Surplus there we there is a new meta analysis that came out that showed that an energy deficit it's not quite the same thing but they did show an energy deficit impaires lean body mass acrel so it's not enough just to eat protein it makes sense because we do see in an energy deficit uh decreased rates of

[02:49:36] Basil protein synthesis so it makes sense I mean if you earn an energy deficit from mechanistic perspective it activates amp kinas which inh which is an inhibitor intor um so it it it makes it also makes sense from a teic perspective that if you don't have excess energy you know this remodeling is extremely energy expensive why would we want to create more of it if we don't have the energy to support it so a protein sparing fast isn't necessarily going to save you from losing uh lean mass if it because again if it's it's it's I mean it might be better than a carb fast you know in other words if you're going to eat 1,000 calories a day you're probably better off having them be as much protein as possible but just because you have 200 gram of protein in your diet if the calories are exceptionally low you're you're probably losing lean mass is that my is that how

[02:50:31] I'm hearing it what I would say is a day of an energy deficit is not something I'd really be worried about no no but I'm saying let's say somebody took this approach and said look for two weeks I'm going to go 1,000 calories a day virtually all protein in an effort to get as lean as possible without losing lean m you might be able to not lose lean mass but the likelihood you would gain lean mass is very very low for for somebody who's been training for a while um and so yeah it's one of those things that the the more advanced you get the more things you have to have lined up correctly to to continue to push especially if you're drug free so yeah for me like I've and you can do it in

[02:51:16] Sprints you can do it in in in different sections you know so I'll like I've I went from I was in the 230 lb class um back in 2019 and I just started to drop back down to my original weight class of 205 pounds I did that over the course of about a year but um that was taken in Sprints so I I would do fat loss Sprints for example so I would do like two or three weeks of like a pretty aggressive deficit like 750 to 1,000 calories I'm s this is for powerlifting yeah that was for powerlifting body fat is your performance at its best how because you obviously don't want to be powerlifting at 7% body fat I'm still pretty good at seven really I still maintain pretty well yeah I still maintain pretty well maybe not quite as good I I will let me put it this way I can still perform well at 7 but if I have a couple days where

[02:52:06] I'm not dialed in I'll start to feel it so I've got I've got I'm right on that edge I'm teetering on that edge at seven on calipers that is um so I did it over the course of the year and I did it in Sprint so I would do three weeks lose like Target trying to lose 5 six pounds and then I would go to maintenance for like at least as long and I kind of built that into my lifestyle you know I really like that for a lot of clients actually a lot of our team biolin coaches use a lot of what we call diet breaks where the people are eating at maintenance so it's like okay vacation coming up diet break for two weeks everything looks like it's going to be normal for three four weeks boom let's do a fat loss Sprint so coming back to building muscle I'll do sections of okay

[02:52:46] I'm overfeeding in this slight caloric Surplus Plus for about 8 weeks okay we gained you know three lbs of body weight I'm going to maintain for a little while just to make sure it doesn't get too out of hand in terms of body fat level now I've kind of got adjusted this now I'm going to do another you know six to eight weeks what I'll tell people is if fat loss should be slow at least for people who are well trained if fat loss should be slow to retain lean body mass then weight gain should be snails pace so what's a rule of thumb for this guy then if you if if he's going to gain five pounds of total body weight of which we're going to Hope three is lean two is fat is that a good goal um how long would you want him to take to gain five pounds probably at least 12 weeks okay so he's doing that once a quarter but it might be something more like where it's six months but there's you know 12 weeks where we get them up 5 lbs and then we say okay let's trim a little bit of this fat back off that we we put on we lose three lbs then we do another gaining cycle put on five pound and what tends to happen is the composition gets a little better each time and again this is now this is completely anecdotal my coaching experience but when you put on weight and we see this in studies it's for trained people it really depends but it's somewhere around 5050 lean mass to Fat Mass sometimes even 40 60 if you're really well trained so 40 lean um 60 fat wow so the implication by the way is when you're gaining weight you're getting fatter by B by by body composition because you're presumably starting out at a yes less than 50% body fat well it dep it depends on the training status and a whole host of other factors so that's an important thing for you to tell this guy which is hey if you're going to be rigorously following body comp don't be disappointed if your body fat goes up in that cycle we're playing the long game here right it's like investing let me put it that way so it's like investing you're you're taking money away from you now in this immediate moment that you could have so hopefully you have more money later right so the good thing is that when we lose body fat we tend to lose Mo if we're if we're resistance training we tend to lose mostly from body fat right y so if we're doing this cycle over time time hopefully each time it gets a little better now there are there are limits to this eventually you bought up against your genetic limit of or probably your genetic limit what I always say is you never really know if you're at your genetic limit what I always tell people is I I show them this picture of me at at 21 years old where

[02:55:36] I'd been resistance training hard for you know three and a half four years where most people say you hit your genetic limit you know somewhere around there and I show that picture and I show a picture of me now at Age 4 and I mean the difference in my leg musculature and my overall musculature is enormous but if you had just gone year by year you would have seen very little difference right and so what I'll tell people is you know you might think you're at your genetic limit but you're probably not it's probably more like an asmt you're familiar with an as ASM ASM to yeah so you never you never really hit like a hard cap limit but the gains become so minimal that it's almost not measurable so um yeah I think when it comes to you know these like this kind of person one really focusing on okay making sure that they can do a lot of resistance trading because it is going to take quite a big of a stimulus to to get them there focusing on stimulus versus fatigue so doing High stimulus low fatigue movements so that they can accumulate enough volume without overreaching all the time uh because if they can train for 12 weeks without needing a taper versus 6 weeks I mean that's more stimulus right and then putting them in a very slight caloric Surplus and when I say slight caloric Surplus I'm talking about 100 to 200 calories a day and over their maintenance and now what does that look like well that means that you're going to have weeks where you don't gain anything anybody I don't know if you've ever done this Peter like doing where people have like Tred to do a super lean gaining phase what tends to happen is people get really frustrated because the weight comes on so slow that they end up just throwing down a bunch of calories so that they can say they gain the weight and it doesn't go well um and what tends to happen is weight gain comes on in chunks just like weight loss tends to happen in chunks um weight gain tends to happen in chunks you can be stable stable stable even though you're in a calorie Surplus and all a sudden boom your weight's up two pounds you know just randomly and it sticks and we don't have all the explanations for why it happens that way but just know that that's normal for those listening and again don't look at oh I gained two pounds from the past three days and it's it's not going down it's staying look at the fact that you've been doing this for four weeks now and you gain two pounds on average so you're right in line with kind of what the goal was so you want to look at that monthly that really that monthly month-to-month average in a gaining phase and say okay am I hitting my milestones in terms of like the overall rate of progress and try to not worry too much about those those little things so there I don't know how we did this again we're at this point where I've got through about a third of what I wanted to talk about but nevertheless there is one other thing I wanted to kind of talk about and it actually feeds really nicely into this sort of case study of this man and this woman which is that of like kind of the most important supplements or the supplements we most hear about and what is their utility for the purpose of hypertrophy training um so let's start with the most common of these which is protein we talked about it already you alluded to the fact that this woman might not be able to get enough protein in actual food so you might talk about shakes so where does w protein stack up in the hierarchy of of of proteins and and you know should we be looking at other sources top of the list um weight protein high in Lucine high in branching amino acids high in essential amino acids generally tastes good generally well tolerated um I will say uh if it's a straightway concentrate a lot of people have difficulty tolerating a straightway concentrate but a blend of concentrate and isolate is usually but is what most proteins out there are and most people can tolerate them well what's the source of protein in way where does it actually come from in terms of so basically from from cow's milk if you centrifuge off the the fat so if you cuse off the fat and then you take that what's what's left over and you add um you precipitate out the cian which is the the nonsoluble fraction of cow's milk the soluble portion that's left over is whey it's what's called whey and mostly consists of proteins called lactalbumin and it's just a very high quality easy digestible um very bioavailable source of protein um it in terms of muscle protein synthesis it's the tip tops it it always scores the highest u in our research it was always the highest um it was no no statistical difference from egg but when we did it versus egg it was always just like a little bit better um so my guess is if you had a high enough subject number you could maybe pick out some statistical difference is there a brand that you favor or are there brands that you think are the the Best Brands to go for incoming Shameless plug so I actually have my own Su line called outwork nutrition and we have a what's it called outwork nutrition outwork outwork okay Y and uh we have a way Protein Isolate and the reason we didn't isolate it isolet are a little bit more um a little bit more expensive than like a concentrate isolate blend but there are you know people with lactose intolerance there are people with an a sensitivity to the lacal abans um and so an isolate is generally well tolerated some people with really high sensitivity to lacal abans can't tolerate an isolate and if that's the case they could probably do a hydrate uh which is a little more expensive and doesn't taste as good but still a good option for for those that have really sensitive GIS uh but like I said an isolate is generally tolerated tolerated well by people and ours is called outward nutrition build so it's just it's low carbohydrate low lactose low fat high protein High Lucine so I think our Lucine contents over 11 I think it's actually 12% which is very high um and then the carbohydrate content depending on vanilla or chocolate is like 1 to four grams and then the fat content is less than a gram of fat in fact the vanilla is zero are there any other brands that you would say hey I trust that brand because one of the things that I think as we talk about supplements you always got to be careful yeah what would be three other brands that you would you would put in your body yeah I mean Legion they make good stuff um and I think you know some of the the big companies you know like um Optimum has doing been doing protein for years um and and most companies are sourcing the same stuff to me I a good company is somebody that markets responsibly um but then another one you know EAS has been making stuff for years and and they make stuff that's you know very very um you know third party tested all that kind of stuff there's a bunch of good companies out there what I would say is make sure nobody's using a proprietary blend you know proprietary

[03:02:26] Blends are are usually just a way for people to hide stuff to make sure that nobody is doing what's called nitrogen spiking so what you can do to pump up the protein and nitrogen content of some of these proteins is ADD individual amino acids that have nitrogen that are actually um lower cost than just the protein itself uh and actually creatin is like they they actually put creatin in some of these not that creatin isn't good creatine does work but you're not taking away protein necessarily to get creatin you take creatin to get creatin um and they do that because it's actually cheaper and it it pumps up the protein content and how would you know that when looking at the label oh it's on the label so they you know like for example like I think they Spike with glycine too so like if you look on the label it might say you know whey protein um and then sweetener preservative oh glycine well that's nitrogen spiking right okay um so I would make sure that you know the companies aren't doing that and to me personally I mean even if company makes a good product if they make insane claims I mean listen I would love to say that our protein is the most anabolic protein on the market but the fact of the matter is it's a it's a high quality wayy protein isolet at a competitive price point that tastes really good and you could get another way Protein Isolate that would build just as much muscle so I'm not going to claim that so I would say just the ethical side of me says just look for something that's promoted responsibly right so um yeah those other companies are are just fine and and I would recommend them all right so let's look at a subset of that is there is there utility in using Branch chain amino acids specifically in workouts where these are typically coming as far lower doses right there you know there's only three branch hom acids and they're typically giving you five grams per serving any utility in the inw workout BCA baa so this was something that I've changed my mind on and I will tell people like I'm a BCA like I my PhD specifically is on Lucine

[03:04:26] I mean it's right it's right back there it says Lucine right on the cover you know is one of the words um and I used to you know say hey I think supplemental Branch chains are are useful and I just I can't I can't support that anymore it just doesn't if you're getting enough total protein in it doesn't seem to be a benefit to supplemental Branch te amino acids the only thing I would say that there might be something is they may reduce muscle soreness uh but it's never been compared straight up with like a comparable amount of weight protein so it's possible that that's just like a a total a protein effect um and if you're the only the only case I could really make besides maybe soreness is also uh for people who just cannot get high quality protein in so for example if you're um a vegan and you say you know I don't want to take whey protein and I can't take XYZ and my stomach doesn't tolerate these proteins and I'm I want to pump up the quality of my meal then supplemental Branch chains could make an impact and we actually did a study in our lab where we looked at whey protein versus wheat protein we saw that whey protein obviously had a much bigger response in muscle protein synthesis compared to wheat sorry and that's that's obviously gram per gram right gram per gram yeah we Ison nitrogen yes but when we added Lucine to match the

[03:05:46] Lucine content of the way we actually got the exact same response so if you're somebody who's plant-based and you're concerned that you're not getting enough a enough high quality protein you could actually add supplemental Branch amino acids to your meals or your protein and you would pump up the protein quality doing that but obviously the best the best outcome is just getting it through diet or shakes and and then if you have to add supplemental Branch change you can't but any role for for supplementing

[03:06:11] Lucine specifically so if someone says Lane I'm buying your your uh you know your your brand I'm consuming it I'm just going to add five grams of Lucine every time and by the way Lucine tastes horrible horrible it's literally one of the worst tasting things in the planet yeah um no I just don't think there's a benefit to it I wish there was I mean I went into I did my PhD thinking I'm gonna find the the secret anabolic you know trigger and and just get enough protein okay let's talk you mentioned it already creatine monohydrate yeah very popular uh back in the day when I was a kid it was 30 gram a day loading and then a maintenance phase I think these days people are kind of just doing five grams a day every day right yeah I mean loading will get you so really what you're looking to do is saturate your phosphor creatin stores in your muscle cell and you can do that through loading or you can do it through maintenance phase if you do it through loading it'll saturate in five to seven days if you do it through maintenance it'll take about 3 to four weeks downside to loading more uh GI discomfort uh more bloating um more just overall discomfort but you get saturated faster downside to maintenance just takes a little bit longer to to get the benefits that's all what are the main benefits of creatin are they on the strength side the hypertrophy side the recovery side all all above um so yeah it it it increases lean body mass uh increases strength exercise performance and we're actually there's possibility that there's cognitive benefits as well interestingly we're finding out um but I would tell people do not get caught up in the hype of these other forms of creatin creatin monohydrate has been known to saturate the muscle cell 100% you cannot get more than 100% and the other forms of creatine are simply in existence to remove more money from your wallet and here's this is kind of like I use the comparison of big screen TVs right like remember when big my first big screen TV I bought it was 42 inches big screen LCD screen I bought it in 2008 and it was $1,000 right what would that go for now you could probably get it for yeah yeah like here here's a stick of gum can I have that 42in screen TV sure why because everyone makes them and there's such a competitive market that the margins are this big right so what does everybody have everybody has creatin in their supplement line so the mar so the margins are so thin nobody makes money on straight so they have to come up with other forms of it to justify charging you more and you hear things like well AR creatin doesn't bloat you or ar creatin doesn't cause water retention well I would tell you that the water retention a hydrated cell is an anabolic cell the water retention from creatin is inside the muscle cell which is a good thing and there's research studies to show this that it does not increase extracellular water that it's actually intracellular water so are you saying that your creatin is not anabolic then and then you have things like buffered creatin you don't need a buffer creatin creatin is stable in stomach acid uh and then there's creatin ethylester which has actually been shown so there's just a ton of marketing nonsense yeah Tre creatine triallate do you make a creatine supplement yeah so our recovery supplement so we have a supplement called recovery and creatin is one of the ingredients there so there's five grams of creatin monohydrate and do you think that is that a daily thing someone should have even on their non-lifting days probably don't need to take it on your off days from lifting um if you're doing cardio on a non-lifting day do you benefit at all from creatine there there's no real studies to know what I would say is that it's very cheap you're not really missing out on anything by having an extra dose um so I would say take it daily if your budget is really rail thin then take it on the days you train any other brands that you respect and just trust that they're not doing any non sensors is basically the same look for the look for the no claims in The

[03:10:06] Trusted Brands yeah and no crazy claims no no you know pushing other forms of creatin is better um and and no no proprietary Blends those that's that's one of the the best ways to know but the great thing is there are a lot of good companies out there that are are are marketing more responsibly now okay last one nitric oxide or these nitric oxide boosters uh the I remember this was one of the things that got so much attention

[03:10:33] I want to say like 10 15 years ago truthfully I don't know how much attention it's got now but I did see a paper about it recently which is what made me think about it again yeah so nitrates um and nitrites uh do appear to enhance exercise performance so like um you know beetroot juice and those sorts of things and sources of nitrit so um there was a recent meta analyses looking at this and the effect size was actually pretty impressive for power it was like 5% or something it was huge wasn't it yeah yeah yeah yeah really impressive 5% which I mean like that's the difference between first and last if you're talking about the Olympics you know um and the effect size was a042 which isn't considered a large effect size but it's approaching a modest effect size which for supplements is really impressive I mean that's on the order I I don't know offhand creatin effect size in the metaanalysis but it's got to be close to that and um what I will say is a lot of supplements appear to not have in them what they say they have in them in terms of these nitrates the other thing I will say is like something like citrine malate which is a it can be recycled into Arginine and then into nitric oxide so citrine malate or or citrine specifically actually increases blood nitrate levels more than

[03:11:56] Arginine itself so it actually increases nitric oxide more than Arginine and arginine is the direct substrate that's because citrine is actually much more bioavailable whereas arginine is mostly extracted by the splank neck tissues the gut and liver so you're actually better off taking citrine which is in our pre-workout of course so there's another Shameless plug um but really if you're looking at citrine specifically like 6 to8 grams you know at a at a dose and this is more to increase performance than hypertrophy is this going to yeah I mean presumably if your performance goes up you have more stimulus you might see that there is some evidence that citrine can actually stimulate mtor but I'm not sure it's enough to actually create like hypertrophy on its own so were you consuming something besides water or electrolytes in the workout you've obviously got a pre-workout um are drinking your so the citrine would be before obviously the whe would probably be after where's the creatine falling post or pre so the timing doesn't seem to be real important there does seem to be a little bit better response to after not sure why because it really to me with the mechanism it shouldn't matter because it's a long-term thing but that's actually why we included the creatin in our recovery product and not the Pre-Workout for a couple of reasons one it doesn't seem to matter when you take take or it doesn't you don't not it's not an immediate effect from creatin so you might as well take it post might be a little bit better effect post so you know there you go and then in the Pre-Workout specifically there's a couple of things in there that are already semi gut irritants for some people and creatin can be a gut irritant for people we didn't want to compound those too much so I that's why we kind of separated it from our pre-workout but there's a lot of pre-workouts that do have creatin in it and especially when you pair it with a large dose of caffeine it can just really give people a lot of GI discomfort if you're not careful so then in workout are you drinking something I usually just like people are going to laugh but I'll like a Gatorade zero or something like that you know in water yeah um I just you know I've looked at the intro workout stuff I mean you know if you're working out for two three hours at a time maybe it's useful to get some glucose and carbohydrate in to maintain performance but you know I think bodybuilders or weightlifters tend to overestimate like how difficult their workouts actually are um you know really you only need to worry about glycogen resynthesis you know the the speed of which if you're somebody doing multiple events per day yeah like if you're a bodybuilder you're going to be 24 hours to your training in any way like you're going to resynthesize that glycogen as long as you get enough total carbohydrates so

[03:14:35] I'm not real huge on int workout um nutrition as long as we're not talking about really long workouts or we're not talking about multiple sessions per day well Lane have taken us way past our time but uh as always super enjoyable can't wait to do it again um there's a lot of stuff to follow up on here so the show notes will will have a ton of the detail we've talked about in offline you and I can connect and make sure we've got the the links to some of the things we spoke about so thanks again man appreciate it and congrats on uh being by the water thanks Peter I appreciate it man really enjoyed it thank you for listening to this week's episode of the drive if you're interested in diving deeper into any topics we discuss we've created a membership program that allows us to bring you more in-depth exclusive content without relying on paid ads it's our goal to ensure members get back much more than the price of the subscription now to that end membership benefits include a bunch of things one totally
