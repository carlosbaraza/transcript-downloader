## Description

Josh Spitalnick is a clinical & research psychologist with expertise in treating a variety of anxiety conditions with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) & other evidence-based approaches. In this episode, Josh unpacks the four layers of anxiety—psychological, emotional, cognitive, & behavioral—highlighting why avoidance is the key feature that transforms ordinary worry into disorder. He explains why he continues to treat OCD & PTSD as anxiety conditions despite their DSM-5 reclassification, & he draws important distinctions between worries versus worrying & thoughts versus thinking. The discussion explores health anxiety, illness anxiety, & the impact of modern contributors such as wearables, social media, & the COVID era, while weaving in real-world case studies & Josh’s structured assessment approach. Josh also breaks down evidence-based treatments, from exposure therapy & cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to acceptance & commitment therapy (ACT), along with the role of medication, lifestyle factors, & how shifting from avoidance to committed action can build long-term resilience.
