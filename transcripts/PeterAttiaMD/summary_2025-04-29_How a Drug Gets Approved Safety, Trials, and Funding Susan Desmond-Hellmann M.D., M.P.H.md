This clip is from episode 346 - Scaling biotech and improving global health: lessons from an extraordinary career in medicine | Susan Desmond-Hellmann, M.D., M.P.H.

In this clip, they discuss:

-  Understanding The Phases in Trials – What each phase is meant to prove, how long they take, and how much they cost
-  What’s an IND, and Why Does It Matter? – The milestone that allows an unapproved drug to begin human testing
- Avastin’s Development Story – From failed breast cancer trials to breakthrough results in colon cancer
- When a Drug Works but Costs Too Much – Exploring the controversy over Avastin's pricing and its rejection by the NHS despite extending survival
- How Drug Development Really Works – From identifying a target to designing the first human trial, it's more complex (and expensive) than it seems

## AI Summary

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Susan Desmond-Hellmann discussing the drug development and approval process, focusing particularly on the journey from discovery to market. The conversation centers heavily on the differences between small molecule drugs and antibodies, using examples like statins vs. PCSK9 inhibitors, and the development of Avastin (anti-VEGF therapy). The discussion covers the various phases of clinical trials, associated costs, and the economic implications of drug pricing.

The episode provides detailed insights into the complexities of drug development, including the challenges of preclinical testing, the importance of proper study design, and the significant financial investments required. A particular emphasis is placed on the different phases of clinical trials and their specific purposes.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Distinction between small molecule (chemistry-based) and antibody (biology-based) drugs [00:01:19]
- Small molecules tend to have more off-target effects than antibodies [00:02:07]
- Phase 1 trials focus solely on safety, despite researchers often looking for efficacy signals [00:06:31]
- Phase 2 trials typically cost between $20-40 million [00:08:15]
- Avastin trial in colon cancer showed approximately 8 months median survival benefit [00:10:45]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- No specific universal recommendations provided in this excerpt

Context-specific Recommendations:
