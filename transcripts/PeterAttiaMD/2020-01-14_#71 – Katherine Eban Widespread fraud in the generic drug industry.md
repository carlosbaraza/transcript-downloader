## Description

Original release date: 9/16/19

In this episode, Katherine Eban, investigative journalist and author of Bottle of Lies, illuminates the prevalence of fraud in generic drug manufacturing which brings into question the idea that generics are identical to brand-name drug as we are lead to believe. Katherine walks us through how this widespread corruption came to be, including the shocking story of one particularly egregious (and unfortunately not uncommon) example of an Indian drug company, Ranbaxy, whose business model was completely dependent on falsifying data in their drug applications to the FDA. We then discuss the subsequent investigation into Indian and Chinese drug manufacturing plants which revealed that nearly 80% of them are tainted with fraud. We conclude this discussion on a positive note with i) how individuals can investigate their own drugs to protect themselves ii) an innovative pharmacy attempting to disrupt the market and iii) some ideas on how to reform to the regulations around generic drugs, the FDA, and more.

We discuss:
-How Peter found Katherine’s book, and what convinced her to investigate the generic drug industry [5:45];
-Branded vs. generic drugs: Why they aren’t the same thing [11:15];
-The Food and Drug Administration: Why it was originally created and what it does today [20:45];

## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter Tiye m.d. calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic

[00:01:04] I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming

[00:01:23] I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and that feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our show's members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:28] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription my guest this week is Catherine eben Catherine is an investigative journalist Fortune magazine contributor and an Andrew

[00:04:19] Carnegie fellow she has written quite a lot about pharmaceutical counterfeiting gun trafficking coercive interrogations by the CIA at cetera but what we focus on today very specifically is her most recent book called bottle of lies this book is a really interesting and truthfully at times infuriating look at the culture of incredible deceit and fraudulence that exists in the generic drug manufacturing industry

[00:04:49] I think Katherine does a great job in the book and I think we do so in the podcast as well walking you through basically how the stage is set in other words what are the regulatory environmental cultural factors that allowed this type of practice to flourish and then we dive really deep into one specific and infuriating example I think I'll leave it at that

[00:05:16] I'm half tempted to say more but I realize everything that we have to say on this topic is covered nicely this is not a technical podcast meaning you will you don't have to know anything about how drugs work and I think you'll get through this pretty clear and the only thing I'll say before closing is if you find yourself throughout this podcast getting sort of frustrated don't worry at the end we offer some semblance of things that you can do to at least protect yourself it's not a magic bullet but it's better than flying completely blind so without further delay please enjoy my discussion with Katherine eben

[00:05:53] Katherine thank you so much for coming up here today it's great to be here for the listener within about thirty seconds of meeting I was already pedaling topo Chico to you when you let it be known that you love bubbly water I couldn't resist it's good stuff I like it that's great feedback for the listener because

[00:06:08] I'm sort of an unabashed and totally not sponsored by them have no financial affiliation but I never waste an opportunity to talk about it so feel free to say you don't like it because I want people to know this is a legitimate Topo experience I'm a bubbly water junkie I'm adding it to my list awesome well Katherine I don't even know if I mentioned this in the initial communication we had over email if I did also be helpful for the listener for context a couple of months ago I was talking with a friend of mine named Sam

[00:06:36] Harris do you know Sam yeah yeah and we were talking talking about something and the discussion shifted to something had really upset me the day before and I had just gotten super pissed off about something and in some ways Sam is kind of like my spiritual guidance leader guy he's the one I turned to when I need sort of help and I said Sam do you even know what it's like to get pissed off anymore I mean are you so far past this is your practice of mindfulness so devolved that you are able to constantly distance yourself from your thoughts and not find yourself in a state of outrage even if it's not prolonged but just momentary and he said no not at all like I still get really upset and he goes in fact I just read this book yesterday and I can't tell you how angry I am and I was like well say more and he said it's this book about generic drugs and the total Shiki Nuri that goes on along with it and then he said you know in fact you really need to interview the author of this book she is the perfect person for your audience and

[00:07:44] I think you could have the right discussion with her a very detailed and he wants discussion and so I mean I was literally sitting here in my office and I looked it up and I did a quick read and I was like I wonder how this is sort of escaped my radar and I think just on that moment's notice I must have just sent you a direct message on Twitter and it all went from there so in advance

[00:08:03] I'll thank Sam for putting this on my right all right well I'm sure it would have got there eventually but he put it there in a moment and I guess for the listener who doesn't know Sam that something could make Sam that upset probably speaks to what you are in store for in the next I don't know how long I want to start with the story but I'd love a little bit of the motivation you've written about health care before how did you dip your toe into this very muddy disgusting cesspool so before I started with this project I thought about generics the way I think most people do which is we need them they're affordable nobody can afford their brand-name drugs and they're sort of an engine that makes government health programs run I mean how would we prescribe to the VA Medicare Affordable Care Act without these affordable life-saving drugs so that was you know there are a public good but in 2008 I got a phone call from a radio show host named Joe

[00:09:05] Graydon who runs an NPR program called the people's pharmacy and he said I'm deluged with these phone calls and emails from listeners who are complaining about side effects from their generic drugs they were stabilized than they were switched to a drug it doesn't work the complaints are similar in nature and so he took these complaints to the FDA and FDA senior officials their reaction was basically well it's psychosomatic because if they patients get switched the pills look different it's different color but the drugs are fine so Joe graden really didn't believe that and he said to me we need somebody with investigative firepower to look into this he knew of my work I'd been on his program before and that's really where it started I mean it was an unusual phone call and I just started digging now you must have had a pretty high quotient of belief for

[00:10:03] Joe because I'm sure someone like you would be brought ideas like this pretty often for you to say I'm gonna stop what I'm doing and do some digging I mean you by definition you can't really do a little surface scratching digging is digging was it just Joe's reputation or was there something that also personally resonated where you thought well this is more than just plausible I've been an investigative journalist now for about 20 years and you really begin to get a sense something sort of tingles inside you I get tips all the time I get tips from whistleblowers all kinds of people but you know when there's somebody with certain amount of credibility he's very legitimate he was asking a big question it was intriguing to me I mean what were all the complaints about why were these patients having problems it just seemed to me that it was something where there was some depth there I just felt that it was going to be a pretty deep well to go down

[00:11:05] I just had that sense and so I began well I'm gonna resist every sort of temptation in my body right now which is to let you naturally go into this story which you so eloquently written about but I think given the format we have and assuming that the listeners don't necessarily have some of the background let's take a step back and put a few things in place so you've already alluded to this idea of generics versus branded can you say a little bit more about what that distinction means yeah so generics a lot of people will you go to the supermarket and you can buy a

[00:11:44] Costco brand cling-wrap which is a version of saran wrap or Kleenex versus tissue paper right and the idea that most people have about generics and they have it because the FDA has told them this is that they are identical to the brand name but just at a lower price point so a great organ if everything is working well the truth is a little different so a generic is a version of a brand-name drug that is made either after a brand-name drug has gone off patent it's no longer legally protected or if the generic company has successfully challenged the brand patent in court and then the FDA gives them permission to make a generic so the FDA recognizes just to take a step back if you make two batches of drugs in the same manufacturing plant using the same ingredients those two batches will be a little bit different there'll be a little variation so now if you take a generic where a company has reverse engineered the brand sort of broken it down in a lab tried to figure out how to put it together maybe with a different set of manufacturing steps but then concocted it maybe they've used different excipient switch is additional ingredients but you have the sort of central molecule which has already been tested for safety and efficacy then they have to present data to the FDA the FDA req there's going to be differences so they've provided a range which is a range of the absorption of the drug into the blood and basically the generic has to present data to the FDA showing through their testing that they've hit within that range and that the drug is essentially clinically equivalent in the body which is called bioequivalent now I think for some people it might come as a surprise that the company that makes the branded version of the drug would be anything but cooperative with the generic because the only thing the patent really discloses is the actual molecular composition and the little bit that I know about pharmacology which is to say truly just a little bit is that the methods by which one creates the compound are often where some of the secret sauce lies in other words there's lots of value within the manufacturing process that is usually deliberately not put into the patent application is that generally correct or do the methods typically try to capture that I mean I guess maybe I'll explain for the listener what we're talking about here when you want a patent on something you have to fully disclose it so in exchange for fully disclosing something you have protection the downside is when that patent is expired you no longer have any protection so for example coca-cola chooses to not patent its formula instead it is a trade secret because they never want to have the expiration so technically if you could wave a magic wand and figure out how to make coca-cola you could do so legally you would not be infringing on their patent but of course the people at coca-cola would that secret is guarded apparently very heavily and so my understanding is that in pharma yes they'll disclose the molecule because they sort of have to to get that protection but a lot of the know-how is in how you went about making it so when the generic manufacturer comes along and says well this drug is now off patent we're gonna go ahead and make it just because we know what it looks like in its final final state we might not realize the 47 steps or acquired to make it and that's sort of this reverse engineering you're talking about right so generic reaches the market through a process of really warfare which is that the brand name company surrounds its drugs with patents all different aspects of the drug are patented so the time release formula might have a different patent and the process of manufacturing each manufacturing step may be under a patent so they surround the drug with these protections and then what a generic company does is gets a sample of the drug they try to break it down in the laboratory and figure out reversing the steps how do you get to formulate this drug one way to get around a patent is instead of ABCDE manufacturing steps it's a EDC B you reverse the steps which is by the way legal to do in India which is where I know we'll get there in this interview but that's where some of the best reverse engineers in the world come from in India but then they have to figure out well how do they make the time-release formula and what sort of excipient sore additional ingredients do they add and how do they get the drug to dissolve properly and is it stable under various temperature conditions and those are all kinds of manufacturing secrets which the brand name companies put in something that's called a drug master file and that's like their cookbook and that is proprietary that is not disclosed so any generic company that wants to propose to make a drug they're sort of going their own way in the laboratory yeah they're using the same molecule they have to prove that it absorbs similarly in the body it has to be same route of administration so is it a pill is it an injection but otherwise it can vary in significant ways so when

[00:17:35] I make my favorite sort of lamb shank which is of 12 hour cooking process with seven steps and call it 13 ingredients the analogy here would be once my lamb goes off patent anybody can taste the final product do anything they want with it stick it into an analyser look at every element of that final lamb shank but shy of knowing I started with a lamb somewhere back there they don't necessarily know the other ingredients that's right they don't know the temperature of the oven they don't know what else I added how I change the temperature because of course in my cool lamb recipe it's actually multi temperature that I use so it's very complicated they don't know any of that stuff and they're expected to produce something that is plus or minus a little bit almost identical to the finished product in flavor firmness texture everything without knowing how I actually made it yes and I'll add one more thing to your analogy which is they have to follow a set of rules that are imposed to use your analogy in every kitchen so this is the same set of rules all these good cooking procedures let's do listener you'll get the reference there right exactly so it's in theory the same very stringent set of rules the same central active ingredient and the same route of administration within a range yeah now another kind of topic a little off the beaten path but just to set the stage for people anybody knows that they can go in and buy drugs off the shelf that are not prescription based such as

[00:19:19] Tylenol aspirin advil that also come in generics so you can also buy acetaminophen so every drugstore has their own branded acetaminophen but there's only one tylenol everyone has their own ibuprofen but there's only one Advil only Bayer makes true aspirin but you can buy generic anywhere these compounds these drugs are in a different regulatory schema because they do not require a prescription but is everything else that we're going to talk about today and that you've talked about already still applicable to the difference between a generic acetaminophen and the tylenol acetaminophen well I'd even say I mean over-the-counter are less regulated but some of the issues we're going to talk about today really do apply to this drugstore brands that you're talking about the drugstore generic brands got it so if you're listening to this and you buy anything that is a drug that is over-the-counter or with a prescription what you're about to talk about probably applies on some level and one of the things I've been trying to understand going through your book is the average magnitude of the problem as we'll talk about today you make a case for what the extreme examples of this look like I still don't and hopefully by through our discussion today we'll be able to sort of tease out some of these things but with that said

[00:20:50] I think that's a pretty good background for most people to now understand what we're about to talk about so let's go back and talk about the FDA so you've already made reference to this organization a number of times where did they come from how were they created and why were they created so the FDA really has its origin in a series of public health disasters that have taken place over the years it was first formed in the 1930s and this was after numerous children died from taking cough syrup that had been tainted with I think it was arsenic but all of this had galvanized public sentiment around the need for food and drug safety and so the FDA was born in 1930 out of history of tragedies around this but the sort of modern day FDA as we know it really has stemmed from a crucial moment in US history there was a reviewer at the fledgling

[00:21:53] FDA who refused to approve a drug called thalidomide so this is now 30 years after yeah yeah this is early 60s yeah which was being widely dispensed in Europe to help pregnant women who were having trouble sleeping sickness morning sickness and she basically held firm they basically saying that she didn't have enough information on the drug and of course it turned out she was correct

[00:22:20] America dodged a bullet because that drug was associated with children who were born with flipper like arms so it was associated with horrible birth defects and it was really sort of on the basis of that and other do you remember her name by the way I don't remember her name yeah but I love this story yeah Frances Kelsey Frances Kelsey who really became a hero she's sort of the one that as you said took the FDA from being sort of I guess FDR had sort of it was created under FDR but kind of limped along until the hero moment which was the thalidomide story right right well it's interesting is that in the beginning of the FDA there was not this idea to focus on the manufacturing process the idea was well you can't market something with absolutely no basis in fact but then the question is well how our investigators empowered to figure out what is true and what is not and really the evolution of the FDA was around a focus on the process of manufacturing because the idea was it's impossible to test every single pill in every batch but what became sort of vital and sort of underpins the modern

[00:23:41] FDA is this idea that the process is the product that was right the key change in how public health enforcement evolved that basically you have to be able to document and prove that your process is under control that there's a control in there in the process that's sort of I mean again I don't know it's not even like I'm hungry by the way but I'm just keep coming up with these dumb food analogies but McDonald's can't test every Big Mac or french fry but it's much easier at the centralized level to create procedures and then decentralized locally to be able to enforce the procedures around where we buy our feedstock how we manufacture in the store what the temperature is of the oven how long a piece of food can sit here etc and if you put all those things in place you have much greater faith that every French fry every Big Mac is going to meet the safety requirement right so one of my sources early on gave me this analogy and we were sitting at a lunch table at a restaurant he said a good FDA investigator is not just gonna come in here and say is there a glass on the table is there a fork is there a knife that's a kind of checklist inspection but a good FDA investigator is going to say what is the temperature of the dishwasher and what is the procedure in the kitchen for bringing out these dishes it's a very different sort of a mode of inspection than most people think of now using your analogy which seems to largely stop at the border of the restaurant inclusive of the kitchen right so what's the temperature of the dishwasher what are the temperature of the heaters on the food behind the thing that in that analogy does the inspector also have the liberty to say where is the meat coming from how far to the potatoes travel and how were they planted absolutely so anything anything that enters that restaurant is under the purview of the

[00:25:45] FDA that's correct and so for people like me most of the time and I suspect this is probably I don't know we'll see maybe this is not how everybody thinks about it when I think about the FDA I normally think about it through the lens of approving new drugs so going from this standpoint of what's called an investigational new drug an IND application through to a phase one phase two and a phase three approval and embedded within those processes are two things that are absolutely necessary you can't approve a drug unless you can confirm that it is safe and that's done primarily in Phase one but the safety monitoring continues into phase 2 and phase 3 and even beyond into post marketing and then the second thing that becomes more important by phase 2 and then again in phase 3 is efficacy does it work and it's those two things that go hand-in-hand and the FDA seems to have a very heavy role in saying the this thing do what it's supposed to do and does it not hurt people were those mandates equally important at the time

[00:26:47] I mean clearly the thalidomide case brings the safety piece to light was efficacy also front and center on their radar throughout this evolution well no it actually it wasn't always in fact proving the efficacy of a drug was a somewhat new idea I mean I think that that was one of the things that Francis

[00:27:09] Kelsey was asking of these solid amide manufacturers is what are the studies around the efficacy of this drug now I mean it's interesting fast forward when Trump was elected president and there were sort of names being floated well who would his FDA Commissioner be and some of the names that were floated as possible commissioners were people who had made crazy public statements basically saying well manufacturers shouldn't have to prove that their drugs are effective in order to market them and let the market take care of and sift out all those questions which basically was impossible for the industry to even comprehend because our whole system is based on the idea that the drugs that you're taking have been proven to work right I mean how would an insurance company even decide what to cover you for if we're all potentially taking drugs that are not effective so effectiveness is like key to the modern concept of drug approvals yeah and luckily Scott Gottlieb became the Commissioner although he is at the time of this recording no longer the

[00:28:16] Commission ranked which I didn't know Scott I don't know Scott but I know many people who do and fortunately everything I've ever heard about him is that he was the right person for the job so it's in the sixties the FDA kind of gets a second wind on the basis of this as you put it eloquently they dodged a bullet I mean the United States

[00:28:34] I remember this was in Canada as well if Canada dodge the thalidomide bullet but certainly United States the bullet was dodged so you've already alluded to this idea of there being branded drugs so pharmaceutical companies are pretty smart when they create a drug the branded name is really easy to remember the generic name is really hard to remember it's a design choice I remember learning this in medical school class in pharmacology which was you show up and you only learn the generic names that's the way you're taught every drug and I remember thinking god these are so complicated names I just come up with something normal and their professor sort of look idiot they don't want the public to know these names they want you to think Lipitor not a torva statin they want you to think viagra not sildenafil right these are very deliberate choices so up until about the early to mid 80s you could make the case it was almost impossible for a generic company to compete with a branded pharma company based on the regulatory environment is that a safe statement well that is because basically anybody applying to market a drug had to prove safety and efficacy so the branded companies were required to do these huge clinical trials create these enormous new drug applications and so really what was the point of a generic which was supposed to be a lower-cost version doing all these studies all over again yeah the only advantage they have going for them is the risk of failure goes down so I don't know what the numbers would have been in the mid 80s and truth I don't know what the numbers are today but about a decade ago when I was paying more attention to this particular issue it was about 1 billion dollars to do what you described to go from an IND to a phase 3 approval cost of billion dollars and so there aren't that many companies that have deep enough pockets to spend roughly a decade navigating that to then have about a decade to sell their drug without competition so if you want to open up your own generic drug company and you know that viagra is about to come off patent what advantage do you have that Pfizer didn't that's a bad example because of how viagra was discovered but drug X whatever you at least know it should work you know you're not in store for a phase 1 phase 2 or phase 3 disaster all things equal but there's no denying the cost of doing all of that and to your point how can you do it so of course this brings us into the question of how the generic industry really got its start in the United

[00:31:16] States and so wasn't Orrin Hatch half of this law or might make mistaken that with another one no no so what happened was actually the generic industry owes a lot to a crusading investigative journalist named William Haddad and he did an investigative series on a cartel like pricing practices in the antibiotic market of branded companies and sort of in the wake of that he became very interested in generic drugs and also interested in the fact that there was no good pathway for generic drug makers to market their drugs so to be clear up until this point generics existed they were created and largely consumed outside of the US though right and they existed within the US but Sir they were few and far between there were many many drugs that had come off patent years earlier and there was no generic substitute for them so he ended up walking the halls of Congress with a couple of like-minded colleagues and his efforts led to what was called the hatch-waxman Act of 1984 which Reagan signed into law and basically what that said is it created a pathway at the FDA for generic drug makers to apply for approval and said the safety and efficacy of these molecules has already been established so you don't have to reprove that you don't have to do clinical trials on thousands of people what you do need to do is prove that your drug is bio equivalent to the branded product so you have to submit data from your tests which shows that your drug falls into that range we talked about of absorption into the blood and that it remains stable at certain temperatures that it dissolves properly in the body and then we're going to review your data and see if we're going to give you approval but the generic drugmakers still faced a significant risk with they would almost certainly have to litigate against the brand name companies and they might not end up getting approved by the FDA so there was a really crucial little deal sweetener in hatch-waxman what it said was if you are first to file your application and you get approved you will get six months of exclusivity on the market without any generic competitors and what that meant for generic makers is they could price their drug at about 80% of the brand-name drug price so they would get this six month window where they could make big money and that was a big incentive at the time was there an understanding of what the price would collapse to after six months with multiple entrance was the idea that the steady-state ultimate price is going to be it was there an expectation at least baked into hatch-waxman that said look by the time it's an all-hands-on-deck open field running generic market for drug X with 10 generics out there they're making 30 cents on the dollar I just wonder how the six months came about as the period of time because truthfully that doesn't strike me as very long when you consider how much protected time the branded person got for the risk they took six months seems a little short it shouldn't have been 20 years but it struck me is that that was always a bit short that created a bit of a prefers incentive in my mind I mean as we saw it created a perverse incentive yeah I mean there's no question about that but it actually I mean it really was the difference between as I have said making a fortune and making a living I mean you look at generic lipitor the first generic lipitor that came on the market six months was worth about six hundred million dollars yeah which is staggering when you realize how much is saved in not having to run a billion dollars worth of clinical trials right right wasn't it our friend that actually came up with the first generic wasn't atorvastatin it was Ranbaxy there you go well we're gonna hear a lot more about those that's charitable when you're not on NPR you can just come out and say bozos uh-huh so I want to plant a question with you now that I'm gonna ask you at the very end but it's a question that I've been mulling over for a long time without a great answer and therefore I don't think it's fair to ask you in a moment and the question is this knowing what you know now everything that happened the best of intentions the best laid plans falling if you could go back in time to hatch-waxman how would you rewrite that reg because truthfully I think at least one aspect of hatch-waxman made sense I think it was reasonable to get rid of the efficacy safety huge clinical trial

[00:36:09] I think that was fair I think everything that came after it in the reg fell short but I haven't got a great answer for what I would do different I have a whole bunch of little answers and so I want to plant that seed with you because not that there's huge value in looking through the retrospective scope but it is an interesting philosophical question if nothing else and it might actually offer an insight into part of the way out of this problem going forward so we'll come back to that in a little while so I guess there are a couple of other interesting historical things I guess the last piece I want to bring into it Before we jump into this story is this use of taxpayer dollars and the internal culture meaning internal to this country the internal culture toward generics took another big shift during the presidency of George W Bush based on the program in Africa at PEPFAR correct

[00:37:02] PEPFAR yeah so talk a little bit about that program which I think does factor into this story in the broad arc so PEPFAR was really born of the best of intentions and was sort of maybe one of the most sort of brilliant innovative globalization ideas which is that the developed nations of the world and us the US could use taxpayer dollars to buy low-cost generics from India and send it to Africa to address the AIDS crisis so in that it was really remarkably innovative so

[00:37:48] George W Bush announced the intention of PEPFAR during a 203 and this creates a little bit of attention within the administration right because how are you gonna fund well the question isn't how you're going to fund it it's what are you going to buy right so it was the low cost of Indian generics that made PEPFAR possible I was based on that concept that the price of the AIDS drugs had fallen down to about a dollar a day which allowed a taxpayer-funded program to send these AIDS drugs to Africa which was reeling from the AIDS crisis you had basically an entire continent under a death sentence but then the question inside the administration was how do you guarantee the quality and you know Scott

[00:38:36] Gottlieb at that point was in the Bush White House a great line in your book about how he referred to generics he refused to call them generics he refer to them as counterfeits right and there were people on the other side of the aisle who were saying the World Health Organization they can come in and inspect these plants and certify them and those are going to be fine and the view of Gottlieb and other people was what's who gonna do that's just like some guy in a back room in Yugoslavia with a couple of people helping him who are gonna go into these plants and verify the quality so the idea was created that the FDA would do expedited review of these drugs and approve these companies and then they'd be cleared to sell drugs under the PEPFAR program but with the FDA suddenly in the business of approving these Indian companies it created this idea well if these Indian drugs are good enough for our regulators to approve shouldn't Americans be taking them too and this of course is in the backdrop of even though at the time I think the thing that was on most people's mind was foreign affairs the

[00:39:51] Iraq war had reached sort of its peak or I shouldn't say it reached his peak but probably reached its peak attention maybe but clearly in the backdrop was the rising cost of health care and a big component of health care is drug cost so this became well if PEPFAR is making a very strong compelling case that we can be using Indian manufactured drugs to pay for a program in Africa shouldn't we be looking at the same drugs here in the

[00:40:20] United States absolutely and you had Indian companies who had long been regarded as just fakers and counterfeiters who were suddenly cleared by the US FDA which was a huge point of pride for those companies so they wanted to get into our market because if you make drugs we're the market you want to sell to we're the biggest most profitable market so it was really a convergence of these two things and so everything that we've just talked about sort of sets the stage for the listener to now really understand the story about one company that you use as I don't think anybody would believe that they're the only company that's out there at the depths they just happen to be the one for which a set of circumstances which you'll explain allowed us to be able to do the post-mortem at the level that it's been done so tell us about this company so Ranbaxy was India's largest drug company and in India that meant it was a generic drug company I mean India by and large was not innovating creating molecules what they were doing is they had become master reverse engineers and

[00:41:28] Ranbaxy was one of the sort of handful of companies that was a true multinational it was out there in world markets and it was one of the first companies Indian drug companies to get approved under the PEPFAR program so Ranbaxy was closing in on a billion dollars in global sales and had its eye on becoming one of the world's top drug companies in short order it was very ambitious it had a lot of what are called the first files so it had been approved by the FDA to be first to launch various high profile drugs in this market including generic lipitor and in 2003 the company and recruiting a young engineer named Dinesh

[00:42:14] Tocker he had been working at bristol-myers Squibb which was a highly regimented corporate culture he moves his whole family to Gurgaon in India which is outside of New Delhi was he working at BMS in Europe or no in New Jersey okay so he was working at BMS in New Jersey and the environment just so your listeners understand the environment of a Western drug company which is so heavily regulated it's hard to move an inch without a stack of paperwork everything is documented the controls are really rigorous that said obviously we know there are scandals all the time but the atmosphere is one of real control so let's use the food analogy right you're walking into the cleanest most pristine kitchen that looks like you could eat off the floor if one crumb is left on the counter it is swept up three times it is cleaned it is disinfected on any given day the kitchen looks as it looked any day before and will look any day in the future you picture it being white you picture it having sort of a stainless steel sort of clean conveyor atmosphere and let's contrast that with where Dinesh went yeah I mean and just say Dinesh it was a senior Indian colleague of his at bristol-myers Squibb who was leaving for Ranbaxy and made a job offer to him they were walking around the lake on the bristol-myers campus in New Jersey so I went to that campus so I could recreate it in the book as it's in the opening chapter I mean that campus there's not a blade of grass out of place there's safety poles emergency phones every hundred feet even the turtles in the pond have a special crossing lane that they're supposed to use I don't know how they know you know in every blade of grass is just perfect it's an environment of total control without variation and that is like the goal for any drug company so Dinesh moves his family took her and didn't f grew up in India he grew up in India and at this point in time do you get the sense I know it's the story will get so much more complicated that the answer might change but do you think he thinks of himself here as more

[00:44:39] American or more Indian as he's about to leave New Jersey for a return to India well that's an interesting question because so many of the Indians who work in the u.s. who I interviewed for this book you know a number of whom went to go back to India they really saw it as such an important homecoming I mean it's a moment in time where India is emerging onto the world stage and they saw it as such a sort of patriotic act to help bring there it's a reverse brain drain yeah yeah so the return to India there was a lot of pride for them in it they imagined themselves as creating a kind of pfizer of the 21st century for India so I think that was really significant for them anyway so he gets to India and he finds complete chaos at this company

[00:45:34] I mean there is just active ingredients that are in the employee refrigerator next to the half-and-half there's fistfights in the boardroom there's orders to just delete documents that are required for regulation they don't even have the same sort of format or font for any of these presentations I mean one of the first so his job was to help standardize and track all the information in this company

[00:46:02] I mean his job was to sort of collate information about the global pipeline of this company I mean they didn't even have any standardized financial reporting in their presentations and in their bookkeeping are they keeping track in rupees or in dollars nothing was standardized so he senses from the chaos that he is needed and he's built a team to sort of be information architects to keep track of the company's records is he hiring people under him from India or is he inheriting people he hired his team so he hires some people from India he hires some people from bristol-myers Squibb who had the same vision of the job as he did to help bring this company into the 21st century remind me what year this is so this was in 2003 he ends up going over there

[00:46:57] Wow so true true and unrelated but remarkable timing with the PEPFAR discussion that we had in terms of being there right at the gnew of this thing about to explode absolutely he and his colleagues were basically saying everything is becoming generic that's where all the growth is that's where all the energy is foreign manufacturers are flooding into our market by 2005 the FDA has more companies to inspect overseas more plants to inspect overseas than it does within US borders and I know we'll talk about that a little bit later I was actually just about to go there for a second but we'll come back to it give us a sense of how the FDA could exercise its authority again thinking about this through the sort of kludgy analogy of a chain restaurant or something or something so basically the reason I use that example is cuz it's like making your commodity product like a Big Mac as a Big Mac as a Big Mac do they just get to show up at McDonald's and inspect the

[00:47:52] McDonald's in India I mean how do they have to give advance warning or notice before they come is it done remotely is it done in person how does this process work so the FDA basically has two sets of tools to figure out whether a generic drug should be on the market one is the review of all this data which the companies submit in what's called an a NDA an abbreviated new drug application the other thing they do is a pre approval inspection so you submit your application to market a generic drug and wherever it is whether it's in Mumbai or in Memphis the FDA wants to come and inspect your plant to make sure you're not gonna be manufacturing these drugs in your garage or in an outhouse and at a minimum to be clear this happens at least once because after I submit all of the data that back up my claims that I basically have a bioidentical drug so it is the same chemical composition it has this distribution within the body it reaches the same concentrations in the same periods of time etc etc etc assuming those data are righteous in your mind you still have to at least once come in lay eyes on my facility right and ideally you come to do a pre-approval inspection can you make the drug in question and then under regulation the FDA would come back in two years and how is it going in that plan are you still making decent drugs or are you just running a pharmaceutical slaughterhouse and following no rules so they will come back and check that but some of their techniques changed because of a massive scandal that hit the generic drug industry in the late 1980s so once hatch-waxman passed and then you had this first file incentive and every generic drug company wanted to be first you write something very funny in the book about how when that first mover advantage clause was still in existence you literally had generic companies camping out in parking lots waiting to petition the FDA on the nano second the patent expired right which is what led to these street fights like it was true mayhem it was true mayhem so it wasn't just about who was first on what day it was what second so you would have generic companies sending in representatives in stretch limos into the FDA parking lot sleeping in the back of the limos queuing online I mean I even described one company executive pushing another one out of the way just before the doors of the FDA open so they can be first so there were actually fistfights in the parking lot and so the

[00:50:36] FDA ended up changing that requirement a little but suffice it to say that first a file was like rocket fuel for the generic drug industry and what you saw very quickly was a massive scandal it started with a company called Milan which was a West Virginia generic company and they noticed that they were not getting drug approvals anymore and that there were other companies that didn't seem to really merit it but they were getting approved before they were and they hired some private detectives who started going through the trash of

[00:51:10] FDA reviewers and found that they were being bribed by these companies to get online first and that led to a huge scandal congressional hearings and the result of that was more stringent inspections by the FDA that was where the pre approval inspection came in and that was also where something called an application integrity policy came in it was a new tool for the FDA to say you know what if you're faking your data in applications which some of these companies were we have the right to basically remove your applications from the queue to shut down your pipeline to not review your applications because we don't trust you in it and was that a durable response or was that for just that compound in other words if the company was caught falsifying data was that just disqualifying them from that drug or were they then disqualified as a producer of generics in general they could be disqualified as a producer of generics generally and did the FDA exercise that much muscle on any company very infrequently it became a very very rare enforcement tool and what was the was this sort of net effect of the bribery within the FDA were those individuals prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law there were huge prosecutions I mean it was there were details like literally company executives who were roaming the halls of

[00:52:37] FDA and dropping envelopes of cash on people's desks so in the congressional hearings that followed the question was who's clean how do we trust any of these companies and so these enforcement mechanisms were added to the FDA's arsenal so supposedly everything was fine after that I mean the whole thing just you got it like I'm only laughing because the alternative is just to scream and sometimes laughing just feels better than screaming and raging but it really speaks to on some level the worst of human nature which if you're a cynic is like look in the end entropy always wins gravity always

[00:53:18] Wynn's chicanery always wins create a rule the scum of the earth will always even if they start out with well intentions the scummiest of the scum will always figure out a way to cheat the system and if you haven't read it I can't resist I cannot resist a chance to always plug her amazing work mistakes were made but not by me by Carole

[00:53:42] Tavarez have you read this book I haven't so it's a must read and in fact I've already interviewed Carol on the podcast along with Avram Blooming who's a partner of hers on a totally different topic which is around hormone replacement therapy I will be interviewing Carol subsequently on this book which she has written so many years ago and told me she will never again do a podcast on because she's so sick of talking about it but as a favor to me she is going to do a podcast and we'll talk about it but it talks about this sort of very slippery moral slope and I realize that's not really front and center to what we're talking about but we do have the luxury of time and we can pause for a moment because it is a question that comes up a lot when a person would read a book like yours right which is how can there be so much moral corruption and we myself included and perhaps myself first and foremost we're so quick to put ourselves on the pedestal the moral high ground you know

[00:54:29] I could never have been that FDA officer that would have been corrupted by the bribe I could never have been that executive that would have pushed the other guy out of the way to get in line or that would have dropped the cash in the situation or bla bla bla bla bla bla but the way Carol writes about this you realize that the first infractions are never these big ones they're very minor infractions and they often come with a reasonable rationalization she uses a great example among many which is the cop who plants evidence on the suspect in the end you see what it looks like when it's mark

[00:55:04] Fuhrman and everybody knows how that story ends but was that the first time he would have done that no the first he did it is probably more like this there's a suspect who is absolutely the drug dealer of the town you barricade the house just as you break in he manages to lock himself in the bathroom and is flushing down barrels of cocaine and heroin and as you finally break the door open you see the last of the cocaine and heroin go down the toilet and in theory he walks away free but you're not gonna have it not this day not on your watch you're gonna take a little bit of cocaine you're gonna throw it down you've planted it you arrest him and you can live with that because in fact you actually saw it with your own eyes you knew he flushed it down the toilet and this is simply justice but now you're on the wrong side of morality for a moment albeit very briefly and now you have a choice which is you continue to rationalize your behavior or you walk back from it and most of us can't and we take one step further and further and further and so I couldn't help but wonder as I read your book what were those first infractions like for all of these actors that you've talked about and will continue to talk about because you're showing us the most extreme state of these behaviors which at the individual level I think probably follow an arc like that described by

[00:56:32] Carroll and I think frankly at the population level just follow the laws of nature which is you create a weakness it will be exploited I think we'll get into this a little more but what's interesting is you take that example that you gave of the cop and the suspect but now put seven thousand miles between them so there is this whole question about integrity in a globalized world and different actors in different cultures who are supposed to be following one set of rules and it becomes like way more complicated yeah I want to come back to this point about the cultural differences between them

[00:57:17] I've already sort of derailed you enough let's go back to the point of basically there's a congressional hearing in the late 80s early 90s that finds out the FDA is not entirely clean right so you've got a bunch of bad actors the belief is the bad actors are now out and how does that change the FDA going forward and what are the implications for these inspections so the FDA is this agency that never has enough funding never has enough resources and never has enough authority there's not a cabinet member from the FDA who sits at the table with the president so the FDA ultimately reports up to HS HHS right so it's sort of a stepchild as an agency it's a kind of under-resourced agency which is in charge of safeguarding like a quarter of our economy I mean anybody who has had a meal they haven't died from or taken a pill that hasn't killed them we're all relying on the FDA to save us so it's an incredibly important agency it's been lacking in authority so there's always a question of whether it has been an effective policeman but in theory after the big generic drug scandal of the late 80s we were off to the races the generic drug industry recovered from the scandal it became as we've talked about a crucial player in

[00:58:39] PEPFAR sort of life-saving player has brand name drug prices rose and rose generic drug industry was ever more important until it came to be 90 percent of our drug supply and you also write that we're kind of at the mercy of non-us suppliers for the feedstock for branded drugs as well I think is it forty percent so eighty percent so basically what happened was starting in around 2005 as generic drugs are growing in our market the FDA is hit by this wave of globalization suddenly it's got way more plants to inspect overseas than it does within the US we've got many more applications for drugs coming in from overseas than in from the US so the

[00:59:32] FDA is tasks suddenly with becoming a global agency almost overnight and then fast forward to where we are now which is 80 percent of the active ingredients in all our drugs brand or generic are coming from overseas ninety percent of our drug supply is generic and the majority of those drugs are being made overseas now 40% of our generics alone coming from India we make almost none of our own antibiotics anymore which means if you go to a pharmacy and fill an antibiotic prescription for your kid it's coming from India or China so suddenly we're in this whole new world where the FDA which has in the past struggled to inspect plants that are like driving distance from their headquarters is now having to send inspectors 7,000 miles away which brings us back to Dinesh right when does Dinesh start to figure out that okay I acknowledge I've gone from the pristine campus of bristol-myers Squibb to rural

[01:00:38] India it's going to be different but when does he realize it's different in an unethical way or in a way that isn't what he signed up for the mentor from bristol-myers Squibb who recruited him to come to Ranbaxy Rashmi Barr bhaiyya oh this is not Kumar Kumar was his boss there well just so start with Rashmi

[01:00:56] Barbra Barbra says to him I'm leaving and he's disgusted with the company and he won't really say why so Dinesh is upset he moved his whole family over there but now his boss is leaving but he gets a new boss Raj Kumar he's a kind of blue chip professional who came from GlaxoSmithKline in London and he comes in as the head of research and development and he's been on the job about six weeks where he summons Dinesh to his office early in the morning and he says to him we have a big problem it turned out that the World Health

[01:01:33] Organization when and inspected this contract research organization that was doing some testing for Ranbaxy and it turned out that the tests were fake like the patients that they were testing the drugs on wait I'm sorry so the CRO was themselves fraudulent the CRO was fraudulent okay and the quote-unquote patients that they were testing the drug on didn't really exist and they were just sort of xeroxing blood test results but raj kumar his new boss had learned that that might not be the only problem that Ranbaxy has he's beginning to get suspicious in he's very ethical so he gives Dinesh an assignment he says I want you to take your team and I want you to research all of the global drug filings of Ranbaxy so all the applications that the company is submitted to regulators around the world

[01:02:28] I want you to research them figure out is the date of real is the date of fake where does the company's liabilities lie and so that's what Dinesh begins to do it's hard to sort of understand what you just said I mean I understand the words you said and because I know the story this isn't the first time I'm hearing said words it's quite another thing to try to actually put yourselves in the shoes of for example Kumar and the people who are there seeing this for the first time because your thinking is wait a second this isn't a mistake a mistake is the wrong batch of the drug got shipped to this study and the patients are receiving something incorrect or there was a contaminant in this batch we didn't know about it in fact even if you go into next level mistakes like there's a contaminant that's there we saw the data now we are trying to cover it up and pretend it didn't happen well we repeat the experiment like you can come up with lots of shades of dark grey this is as black as it gets I mean this is sort of make-believe let me put it this way if you're going to the level where you are fabricating data to this extent at best you're shipping a placebo pill that would be the best scenario at worst you're not even taking the time to ensure you're shipping a placebo so at that point Raj Kumar dr. Raj Kumar did not know what he was looking at he'd heard murmurings about some falsification he'd gotten this letter from the World Health Organization saying that the CRO was submitting fake data was the CRO an Indian company or a non-indian it was an Indian company so at that point Kumar is coming to Ranbaxy with a mindset from his time at

[01:04:21] GlaxoSmithKline where anybody who saw off on a regulatory filing is certifying that it's all legit yes so this is a failure of imagination at this point he can't even imagine what's going right he's not sure what's going on but he's saying to Tucker I want you to take your team and tell me what's going on because I don't know now

[01:04:44] I have questions about the legitimacy of some of these filings okay does Dinesh ever go back and talk to his original boss and find out because if if six weeks or eight weeks on the job your new boss drops this bombshell on you do you go back and think wait a minute does this have anything to do with why my old boss left who's the guy who recruited me here in the first place well you know at this point Tucker is wondering that his boss left with a great deal of bitterness there were some murmurings about some huge settlement he got he had said cryptic things to him like I was trying to change the tires on a car that was going 80 miles an hour but he never said what he knew he just left so Tucker begins this crazy research project which is to do research on every single global filing that the company has made going back 20 years so the questions were what was the data that was filed with different countries what was the raw data connected to that data did the raw data exist how were the studies done where were the studies done at what manufacturing plan what were the processes and procedures that led to the creation of that data I mean this is this sort of vast undertaking that tocker's team began on and you know because of just a word about Dinesh

[01:06:09] Tucker I mean he was this kind of single-minded very ethical and somewhat sorta blinkered individual who was like given a task and he was gonna do that task and he didn't step back and say well wait a minute here folks I'm investigating my own company so what are the possible ramifications of that I mean he didn't really stop and think of that he was just intent on getting the right answers so of the filings that he investigated going back to the early 80s what did he find so his team begins to uncover

[01:06:49] Ranbaxy secret which is that they have basically fabricated data for more than 200 drug products in 40 countries some of the data they just completely made up some of it they manipulated or altered in some cases they were using brand-name drugs which they would just crush up and test in order to generate data that of course made the drugs look bioequivalent because they were testing the brand-name drugs and representing them as their own and then presumably when approved they would then ship what I mean if you're gonna go through the trouble of testing on a brand you're not gonna ship a brand that would be too expensive so what were they actually selling so they were making generic drugs in their laboratory but in many cases these generic drugs were either totally untested or did not meet specifications I mean for example you're supposed to do stability testing on drugs which means you put them in these special chambers that replicate conditions of heat and cold and you're supposed to test three months six months nine months 18 months these are various stability stations that you test to see does the drug remain stable so if you're selling a drug into Mozambique where it's very hot you have to be able to reflect that those drugs will remain stable at very hot temperatures you know he discovered they were testing all of these different periods of stability they would test them all on the same day and they would alter the data and then make it appear as though it was 3 months what's the denominator on this you said 200 drugs falsified across 40 countries is this 200 out of 200 thousand I'm being facetious 200 drug products so that would be like much of their inventory in other words had he found any evidence they did anything correctly no in other words that 200 is the denominator and the numerator

[01:08:49] I am NOT certain but it looked like it that basically it's unlikely that they did five of them right and then they be asked their way through 200 of them right so that basically this was this was their business model the business model was fraud right their business model was fraud and everyone in the company was in on it in that people were given orders to swap out ingredients to replace higher quality ingredients with lower quality to do all the stability testing on the same day to use the brand name drugs and that was just how the whole company rolled so a little

[01:09:27] PowerPoint presentation gets whipped together I tell you something do you have a copy of that PowerPoint presentation I do and a lot of people want it and I haven't posted I posted one slide of it online in a Twitter thread yeah are you permitted to is there a legal reason or is there a reason you haven't been able to post the whole PowerPoint presentation maybe because I don't want to crash the Internet I was once approached by the Atlantic magazine as a they went to a group of investigative journalists what is the biggest fraud what is the most remarkable fraud in the history of the world and I given them an example this was before I did this book but I will say that it is hard to imagine a more incriminating document than this PowerPoint which basically says we have falsified data in every market where we sell drugs in every product that we sell we have done it simply for the purpose of facilitating our business needs we have put all our partners at risk and there is only one solution which is to notify every regulator in every country where we sell our drugs pull all our drugs off the market and fly right so basically two guys put this PowerPoint presentation together that's right

[01:10:51] Dinesh and his ball commission Kumar and it's hard for me when reading this to put myself in their shoes because truthful part of me thought are you guys idiots I mean I totally get the naivete at the outset with hey this CRO this contract research organization seems a little Shady let's go do a little digging I don't know where my analogies are coming from today that's like me coming over to your house

[01:11:22] Catherine you invite me over for dinner and you give me a little something you bring me a nice bowl of soup and I'm eating it and I find a tip of a thumb in it and I think I look at your hand and you have perfectly tipped fingers and thumbs and I think that's really odd I wonder if there are more bodies in here and I send my kid I say hey I'm gonna sit here and keep eating dinner you go look throughout her house and see what you find and thirty minutes later while you and I are still eating dinner he comes back and says daddy there's 200 bodies stashed in the house and my first reaction is I'm gonna put a PowerPoint presentation together and say Catherine

[01:12:03] I found 200 BA in fact there's not a room in your house that doesn't contain ten dead bodies that have been mutilated I think we should do something about it like it wouldn't dawn on me that you are the killer of all of these people taking this PowerPoint presentation which became known as the SAR document what does that stand for again the this self-assessment report I love it taking the SAR document into the boardroom I mean I guess if I'm gonna you could argue maybe they somehow thought that the CEO was the only one in on this on the board and the non-executive directors had no clue I mean I guess in their defense that's possible but it seems improbable and I guess it actually in their defense speaks to the lack of a regulatory environment that they could go to in other words if this were in the

[01:12:54] US that sar doesn't go to the board of Pfizer that sar goes directly to the FDA and the New York Times know what that's probably what it speaks to I think that is a really good point but also I will say for rajkumar coming from GlaxoSmithKline zuv this heavily regulated environment and he's like oh my god every single drug product is tainted with fraud but he tells Dinesh Tucker

[01:13:22] I'm a little bit hopeful that I'm going to present this to a subcommittee the board of the directors and they're gonna let me fix it and again I just have to because you're gonna tell us what happened which is certainly among top 10 most ridiculous moments in the history of corporate board governance but do you think on some level do you think he kissed his wife and kids a little harder that day when he left for the office was there some part of him that thought he wasn't ever coming home again because in the movies he'd have been killed right he wouldn't have left the boardroom I mean and if it were funny movie if it were like Austin Powers it would have been like one of those little they probably seen Austin Powers in a while of course I still know every scene off by heart but there's the funny version where the chair like catches on fire or a little trapdoor opens and you drop or it jex you into a shark tank and the not as funny version of this and the

[01:14:19] Godfather Goodfellas version of this on the way out to the car you get sort of clubbed bag over the head you're never seen again how did he not think that that was a strong possibility I'm not exactly sure what was going through his mind at that moment but one interesting anecdote that we didn't mention is as Dinesh Tocker was putting together his findings he comes home and he has his three-year-old son there and he realizes wait a second

[01:14:47] I gave him a Ranbaxy drug because he had an ear infection and he did not get better and the doctor then switched him to actually to a GlaxoSmithKline antibiotic and the boy got better right away so he is as he's doing this together he's putting the pieces together and he's like okay I'm not gonna give my family a Ranbaxy drug until I know the truth so Rajkumar is now in the boardroom and he's handing out his document how many pages are in the self assessment review document the

[01:15:21] SAR I love that just the name is so nondescript yeah when four slides just 24/24 slides with smoke coming out and fire coming out of every single one I'm just picturing him at the office printer just raffling these things off you know if he's anything like me thinking about do i staple vertically or horizontally do I go with the diagonal staple on this one or do I just put the little mini clip on it so many options yeah color black and white don't want to be showy or not showy yeah okay how does the board receive this so he presents this to a silent boardroom like you could hear a pin drop and just to give a context I mean sitting in that boardroom it was a subcommittee it was the scientific subcommittee of the Board of

[01:16:11] Directors so you've got a guy like to hender Khanna who is the was lieutenant governor of Delhi you've got super high-profile surgeon in India I mean you've got real power players in that room and the room is silent and then one of the board members asks well can we not bury the data which also is a funny question to me because Kumar has clearly gone to great lengths to uncover this synthesize it and now present it my general take on this is a culture of incompetent incompetence you see if you want to be a true fraud shouldn't you be watching more gangster movies shouldn't the board's response have been Raj this is exactly the kind of stuff we are looking for our lieutenants in the field to bring us thank you we will take action immediately by the way can we borrow your laptop we want to make sure we have more copies of this and then they let him leave and then they destroy the laptop and then they unser - like again not to give the criminals too many pointers here but was anybody competent in this arena like these guys don't even know how to get out of a bad situation cuz now you've just told the guy who's telling you I think this is the biggest scam in the war world yes it is and we want to continue hiding it it's important to know the mentality comes in part from being in a culture of impunity I mean they're not afraid of their own regulators they can buy off their own lately right because they have the lieutenant-governor right of one of the largest cities is on their board right they're not worried about regulators storming their offices in their mindset they think this can be covered up and I guess it speaks to not having if I mean even though India is a democracy in the sense their press presumably doesn't have the chops that a press would have in Western Europe or

[01:18:20] North America I think that that is true so Brian tempest who is the president he was sort of an acting president for a year he says he tells Rajkumar to leave behind his laptop which then gets broken down piece by piece I'm picturing like office space with the bait like by the way that photocopier hasn't been working either so that photocopier what's Rajas laptop get him in the parking lot right and throw it all into the Ganges right and they had sent the secretary out of the room so there were no minutes of the meeting and basically to Raj Kumar he got his answer right there so what does

[01:18:59] Raj do at that point what does he tell Dinesh he tells him what happened and two days later he submits his resignation with or without a hush package it's a question I don't know the answer to because his predecessor probably went through something similar and it sounds like there was a settlement there was I think a very large settlement I mean a sources had told me he got a million dollars upon leaving so I don't know what kind of settlement Raj Kumar may have had but all of these very dramatic events left

[01:19:30] Dinesh Tocker these sort of architect and author of all of this information alone without protection in the company at this point as Dinesh realize he's in trouble I don't think he fully understood how much trouble he was in so what happens next so then the auditors of Ranbaxy come into his department say they're gonna do a review it seemed clear at that point that they were looking for some sort of dirt on him and what happens next is that they plant dirt on him and they put his IP address on some porn searches and he is accused of looking at porn on his work computer which by the way is still that also made me laugh out loud because we're in a culture where apparently if you look at porn in your work computer it's a terminable offence go to jail do not pass go do not collect $200 lie falsify data jeopardize the lives of millions of people that's standard operating procedure will promote you for that but don't you ever look at porn around-ear I never quite thought of it that way but you may have a point in an attorney forum back see who left the company and spoke to me later said you know in retrospect I don't think he was doing porn in the office I mean again

[01:21:04] I'm laughing only because I need another response beyond rage I just I have to make fun of a lot of this even though there's nothing funny about this Dinesh remind me how many kids he has does he just have the three-year-old so at that point he has a toddler basically at home and his wife and he's moved his young family over - Gurgaon from New Jersey and is his wife also from India originally she is and is she abreast of what's going on no and that was another very interesting thing in both of reporting this and writing it and thinking about it they had an arranged marriage they had seemingly a good working relationship but really never communicated about any of this she didn't know why he was down in his basement office working until midnight collating these streams of data he was actually looking at porn on the company computer she obviously missed that detail he never told her she never asked so he's kind of going through he's lost his mentor who brought him he's now lost his boss yeah all jokes aside this is an incredibly frightening isolating experience and so he submits his resignation letter what years are we up 205 now or yeah in 2005 okay he comes back to the u.s. at this point if I know so there he is in India and he's trying to get on with his life he's doing some consulting but of course he had no plan to leave it's not like he had a job lined up so he's worried about money and he's trying to figure out what to do next so what comes to him so it's monsoon season he's lying there at night and all he can think about is all this data that he prepared on all of these world markets and the thing that he really focuses on which is interesting is he knows that the AIDS drugs that the company is sending to Africa are terrible he knows that they're not going to cure people he knows that they are going to degrade in the heat in what are called zone 4 conditions and he can't get over what he's uncovered he just can't get over it do we know looking back now what percentage of pEPFAR's incoming drugs were coming directly from that company they were certainly a very substantial player in PEPFAR I mean they were definitely supplying a lot of drugs to that program I don't know what percentage and it's interesting again bringing it back to on the one hand

[01:23:43] PEPFAR change the culture of generic acceptance did PEPFAR include anything in it that said oh and by the way whatever generic drug maker that's going to sell a product directly into this program will have an even higher level of scrutiny than the FDA current Authority is given that we're going to spend I mean billions of taxpayer dollars yeah on this you'd think that that would give the FDA which is basically like here's a private purchase agreement now I really have the authority to put my foot in your ass FDA approval was viewed as the gold standard it almost sends a negative message which if we need a higher level of standard it undermines our basic approval really worldwide I have to say this the view is there is no higher standard than the

[01:24:31] FDA's approval it is the gold standard many regulatory agencies they will just look to the FDA for guidance so they approve this company will approve this company that's it and regulators around the world sort of hang on the FDA's decisions so Dinesh is unemployed but realizing that there's a tsunami coming metaphorically as well as potentially literally through the monsoon which is we're about to unleash a torrent of it best placebo at worse something harmful to an entire continent well it wasn't even about - it was happening I mean those drugs were going regularly to

[01:25:15] Africa I mean millions of patients around the world were getting all those drugs as he lay there and he couldn't sleep so what did he do so he did something very interesting he set up an email account and he gave himself a pseudonym and the pseudonym he gave himself was melvin der singh who was then the CEO the CEO of the company so

[01:25:38] Mal vendor singh was this sort of scion of the RAM Baxi family it was his grandfather who had started the company his father who was revered who took it multinational and Mal vendor Singh quickly ascended to the role of CEO after Brian tempest left but Mel benders Singh I mean that was like a name familiar to every Indian household he was a famous yeah it would be like Bill

[01:26:05] Gates or Jeff Bezos United States so he creates this yahoo email account where he's Mel vendor Singh and he starts writing to regulators around the world and he's a very educated fellow but he writes in broken English and he pretends to be a bench scientist at the company and he basically writes and says I am being forced to falsify data against my will very dangerous etc so to the FDA's credit almost every regulator around the world blows him off thank you for your interesting email and we'll be back to you in due course he was writing to the

[01:26:42] FDA keeps writing he doesn't get a response and finally any attachments to these emails is he actually showing any of these yeah not yet keeps writing and then finally out of just pure frustration he writes to the FDA Commissioner who at the time was Lester Crawford and he writes to him and he says he puts aside the broken English puts aside being a bench scientist and he says I am pleading with you to put a stop to this crime and several days later he gets an email back and it is from a deputy at the FDA saying we're in receipt of your emails from this date this state this state this state this state we'd like to talk to you so he comes to the US or they come out to

[01:27:25] India this is interesting so Dinesh had thought all I need to do is tell them there's a fraud right and then I'm done with this I'm done they'll show up and they'll that's right they'll come racing across the world they'll descend on the company and my job has been done and what he did not realize is that he was barely even at the beginning so when they say we would like to talk to you he's surprised talk about what I told you told you oh boy so what begins is this kind of weird game of chicken with the FDA where they're asking for more information more documents they don't know who he is they just call him em he's using the same name as the CEO they haven't figured out that that's a pseudonym oh well they know he's not the CEO no company yeah yeah yeah yeah sir but they haven't asked him his real name like they know that obviously that's not his real name yes it wouldn't be by coincidence right right okay so he's presumably at this point dripping out pieces of the SAR and the supporting documents that led to it no he hasn't yet said anything about the

[01:28:36] SAR okay and he keeps sending them emails is he talking about the specific company or is he talking more gentle no he's talking about the specific company and he's sending snippets of email that basically implicate officials at the company in fraud but meanwhile while this is going on what is the FDA doing it's approving one drug after another made by Ranbaxy including atorvastatin they did they didn't do it yet because that was later in the story seven if I was actually 2011 og so they had been investigating the company for almost six years and they knew it was saturated with fraud at the point that they approve atorvastatin because we're coming up to the

[01:29:21] Valentine's Day Massacre right alright let's go there but finally these FDA officials I mean they're doing some investigations around what he's telling them and they finally say we understand that you have a document that basically delves into this and we would like to see it and at that point he says well do

[01:29:46] I need a lawyer I mean good question they provide him with reassurances he gives them the document and as you said so that leads to a raid on the company on February 14th of 2007 and I mean I guess it's wise that the FDA of course chose to raid the u.s. plant the headquarters the corporate headquarters

[01:30:10] I didn't realize the corporate headquarters was in the United States so you're just saying the u.s. headquarter us what is their authority there versus their authority in India presumably they have a fraction of the authority on Indian soil correct can they raid no Indian plant no they have no authority in India I see so that's why they do these kludgy sort of hey we're gonna come do a surprise inspection in two weeks I mean let's take a step back and think about this so we are completely dependent on countries

[01:30:41] Manufacturing life-saving drugs we have no authority no real legal authority on the ground we have no US attorneys in India I mean we can't serve a search warrant but hang on a second this seems kind of crazy to me given that let's use the TSA as an example okay so we have complete authority on US soil who gets on and off a plane don't we have some authority who gets on and off a plane that's coming into the United

[01:31:06] States even if it leaves on foreign soil well that's interesting you should bring that up because aviation is governed by an international treaty and all these countries are signatories to a treaty we have no treaty on drugs even though it's completely globalized we have a few formalized agreements but they don't give us any legal authority so that's we need the equivalent of airline security in the world we need some ability to police the United States doesn't seem to care if someone flies between Nigeria and Bangladesh to the same extent that they would care if you were flying from one of those two places into the US right but what the aviation treaty says is you all in your own countries have to police your airlines and set up your airports in the following manner and you're all agreeing to do that and if you don't do that you can't enter our airspace is what it says yeah and so that's obviously missing here and so to your point the FDA had no choice other than to raid the u.s. headquarters right that was the most they could do right but I mean on the other hand it does make sense that they go and raid those headquarters because that is where they're sort of launching all their drug applications into the market so what did they find during that raid oh man so they find for example we should talk a little bit about so tret so so trent is the generic version of accutane which is a drug that targets adolescent acne largely but it is such a dangerous drug leads to miscarriages suicidal ideation that the FDA gives it a black box warning Ranbaxy was the first to launch generic accutane in the US market but they knew that the drug was completely defective didn't dissolve properly the dissolution was messed up they had an internal document that basically says we know this drug is failing we're marketing it anyway and the cover page on this document said in big letters do not share with FDA wasn't that the actual name of the document as well like it was the file name or something like FDA agents okay so just go into the search engine and just search for keywords do not share

[01:33:34] FDA just see what comes up so I mean they get that document they get the SAR the amount of documents they get is so huge and so incriminating and it's on the basis of that that the investigation is fully launched but again this is 2007 right okay as you alluded to it will be many years before this story comes to its natural ugly deadly whatever ending what is actually happening from 2007 to 2013 or whenever this thing finally resolves like what does an FDA investigation mean when you have that much evidence like this isn't the way we invest crimes like this guy got a house full of dead bodies well I mean okay I understand your neighbors think it smells a little bit funky and every time someone comes over for dinner nobody ever leaves Baba Baba but now you went over to the house and you found the bodies right so what are the next steps when you have this much proof and I'm sorry does this involve the Department of Justice at this point yeah so the FDA they can't subpoena anybody they've no subpoena I thought they have no subpoena

[01:34:48] Authority so for any case they want to make they need a US Attorney so they involve the US Attorney's Office in Maryland and basically the whole case just grinds down into slow motion they're trying to interview witnesses where in back see moves people to India so they're sort of out of the subpoena free right so there's subpoena free they're battling the FDA investigators are battling US attorneys about who to interview what documents to pursue they're fighting with RAAM backsies lawyers they are trying to sort of track the frauds and what they're trying to figure what are we gonna charge this company with what dude the frauds mean for the quality of the drugs I mean have you spoken with anybody the FDA who could speak to what the internal view was circa 2007 because with the revisionist history you could sort of say look if you really want to put the boots to these guys you say hey guys either you cooperate immediately and fully with the investigation or we are suspending all of your sales in the United States pending resolution of this that's a huge hammer to drop on somebody and you can't drop that every time because if you're ever wrong there's no telling what the magnitude of that lawsuit would be in reverse but one it seems like in this situation you had enough evidence that you at least could have ethically made that threat clearly they didn't have the legal chops to make that threat or did they if they're the FDA don't they have the singular authority to suspend a drug by a company they didn't need the

[01:36:25] Department of Justice or Congress to say yep you guys are cool telling these guys no more drugs sold in the United States or by the way through PEPFAR while we're at it using taxpayer dollars until you fully comply with this and our investigation is complete like I I'm still struggling to understand the heel dragging was it are they back in 2003

[01:36:44] India where the naivete is this can't be nearly as bad as it looks well so first of all in terms of what was going on inside the FDA FDA investigators we're trying to figure out sort of each permutation of the fraud so wow they're doing all of their stability testing 4 6 9 18 months all on the same day so that's one revelation Wow everybody in the company appears to be in on this that's another revelation but as this is unfolding the other side of the FDA which is the sort of regulatory approval side of the FDA keeps on approving the company's drugs

[01:37:24] I see so good point you're making here which is structurally the FDA has enough silo in it that the people that are dealing with this company from a drug approval standpoint are not the same people that are investigating them but there's presumably not a Chinese wall between them all right and you know by the end of this there's like a Ranbaxy Enforcement

[01:37:45] Team that's 30 people large and then people start saying to each other why are we working so hard to keep this company in business why don't we shut it down why don't we take this application integrity policy this tool that came from the generic drug scandals of the 80s and use it to just take all these applications basically offline which would have the effect of shutting the company down why aren't we doing that and it's weird because I got the book is based on 20,000 internal FDA documents among the many other interviews I was sifting I have all the email records from inside the FDA about this company do these through a Freedom of Information Act hold it well first of all I mean anybody who's reported on the FDA will tell you you file a Freedom of Information request and you can if you're lucky expect to get a couple of documents two years later so I filed 16 Freedom of

[01:38:41] Information requests for this book I even sued the FDA I hired a lawyer to try to get some documents through the FOIA mechanism but the bulk of the documentation was coming through sources who are leaking documents to Wow yeah I didn't realize the FOIA would be that inefficient within the FDA it is not effective it is let's put it this way if you really want to get information I mean almost none of the information that the book is based on I would have ever gotten through FOIA I'll keep that in mind so the next time I'm choosing between a root canal and something equally painful FOIA the FDA I had no idea actually okay so just watch I'm sorry to interrupt you just keep going this this the or he tells itself yeah so then it comes to this point where Ranbaxy had the first to file for the biggest generic drug launch in history which was generic lipitor and there you have the

[01:39:38] FDA bureaucrats sort of parsing the details from their application and saying well is there fraud in this application there's fraud in every other application but do we know that there's fraud in this one ultimately they didn't find direct evidence fraud in that application but based on what did they inspect a single Indian plant so they send so last minute right and

[01:40:06] Congress is writing them letters saying we need generic lipitor now we're gonna be saving billions of dollars with generic lipitor you can't delay this approval any longer wait is Congress at this point aware of what the FDA is investigating not fully because the FDA does not disclose it they do a raid on

[01:40:27] Ranbaxy and a congressional investigator calls over and asked the FDA what are you investigating are you investigating drug quality and they say no what are they investigating drug quality culturally why is the FDA hiding their good investigative work from Congress wouldn't it give them more breathing room I mean Congress is breathing down their back and look if you put yourself in the shoes of Congress they're doing the right thing they're trying to protect the American taxpayer they don't have the window of visibility into the safety issues they are looking at this purely they're naive enough to believe as we all are prior to your work that atorvastatin is lipitor except it costs a fraction of what lipitor costs so every day this drugs not approved the US taxpayers on the hook for X more dollars

[01:41:17] FDA come on guys get it going and the FDA is somehow doing good work but being sheepish about it it's almost like if you didn't know better you'd think there was a second conspiracy theory here which is that this is not incompetence but rather political pressure for example would be one thing that jumps to your mind right I mean this is in many ways this story of Ranbaxy is a cultural damnation of India if we're just gonna be blunt and create a whole bunch of enemies and everyone on Twitter is gonna like you and me up for saying that but there's no way around it this is a cultural damnation of an enormous nation and I will say the book launched about three weeks ago in India and boy has it yeah I mean I have been under fire and this is funny all of my workings with people in India which is there's only one time in my life I've really had a lot of interaction people in India which is when I worked at a company a global company called McKinsey and company and we had a huge presence in India and we had a huge especially from a technical sort of analytic standpoint we had so much of our horsepower in India so in other words I want to be careful that I don't misrepresent that I know anything about India other than my own direct experience which is these people that were coming out of the IITs the Indian

[01:42:29] Institutes of Technology which is like I don't know they've got like an MIT in every state basically these IITs these guys were unbelievable like I have nothing but great things to say about all of these people I worked with through McKinsey who were again by and large graduates of the IITs mathematician statisticians computer scientist primarily I mean they were exceptional people which tells you that the problem is not the people per se but something within the hierarchy of companies that somehow slowly can corrupt a subset of people I mean like what do you think is actually at the root cause of this I know I'm taking us a little bit off this story but it's we've sort of been dancing around this issue a little bit in it I don't know how to reconcile these two things which is there's an amazing system of education in India that produces amazingly bright people who are incredibly hard-working and yet there's a systemic problem at least with respect to one industry which then makes you wonder well is petroleum going to be any better is textile any better if you go through all of the other industries maybe the stakes aren't as high I don't know but what reason do we have to believe that this isn't a broader issue than one company I had done a big magazine article on Ranbaxy before I launched into the book and that ran in

[01:43:51] May of 2013 and we got all these comments in from readers and I remember one of the comments was talking about a word I'd never heard before which is jugaad I'm like what is that spell that ju-jee a ad it's a Hindi word so in some contexts it has positive connotations which is jugaad is a sort of spirit of creativity that allows you to overcome obstacles okay so that can be incredibly positive in India where average daily life is so difficult and the systems are so onerous legal systems anything getting a driver's license navigating contracts I mean that's all extremely challenging but jugaad has a very dark connotation which means it's basically eliminating all obstacles and getting to the desired goal by the shortest by any means necessary and you got as I came to learn is something that is really prized in Indian companies and it's a kind of the rules don't matter the regulations don't matter what matters is the goal and Ranbaxy was a company that told its employees what matter because they had posters hanging on the wall which talked about this 15 billion dollar goal for I think 2015 basically it was a financial goal that mattered and that sort of began to explain why this company behaved the way it did and frankly as I began to report and expose that Ranbaxy really was not an outlier in the indian generic industry that in a number of companies I don't know to the degree of

[01:45:50] Ranbaxy but this is how you did business now again I before we get back to the story I think this thread is worth pulling on a little bit more we in the United States are not strangers to unbelievable fraud and we think of WorldCom and Exxon and Thera knows and all of these companies that are just complete and total frauds and so one could argue it's no different this just happens to be an example in an industry where the consequences were greater the consequences of Enron's fraud were

[01:46:22] Californians got screwed out of some electricity and a bunch of shareholders lost money and both of those things suck but it's not as viscerally upsetting as people taking bad drug so do you think that it is the case that there is just as much fraud here in the United States but the denominator is so much larger that it's sort of dwarfed do you think it's that well culturally were all the same and the difference is in the United States or in the West the regulations simply do not permit you couldn't get away with what they're doing and this is not a condemnation of

[01:47:00] Indian people or Indian culture it's a condemnation of a regulatory environment that as you said minors in the major and majors in the minor which is to say it takes an act of Congress to get a driver's license but any buffoon can make a drug it should be the other way around not that a buffoon should get a driver's license but it should be easier to do things that are easier there and harder to do things that are harder they're like so I'm giving you the book ends of it where do you think it lies first of all whenever we have these expose A's of companies that are corrupt to the core it's always shocking

[01:47:35] I mean it's shocking to see such a big fraud tyranno's Enron VW the Volkswagen fraud with the emissions it's always shocking it's interesting the examples you give are exposed within I don't know about VW but Enron was exposed internally Sara knows exposed internally right you could argue that that is a cultural difference is even though it was ultimately exposed eternally it you could argue it it was much harder to expose Ranbaxy internally I mean it ultimately was exposed internally but the culture of dissent might be greater in the United States is that yea possible so first of all people talk about a culture of compliance and companies have cultures and they sort of reflect these cultures to their and train their employees in these cultures and employees from Western drug companies that I talked to a lot of them talk about the training the cultural training of compliance and what that's like and part of the way that you develop a culture like that is you have to because you have regulators who are vigilant you have regulators who are on the scene so that's really not the case in India they're not worried about their own regulators they could buy off their own regulators or their regulators simply don't show up and so you don't have the same culture of compliance it's not something that is sort of organic to a company and you wonder if you took

[01:49:05] Pfizer BMS Novartis and moved them to India under the exact same regulatory environment would it be a matter of years or generations if at all that the internal culture of manufacturing excellence would vanish it's a Gedanken experiment but has it been done is there any example of Western or European companies degrading or the reverse well it's interesting you should mention this because Novartis has just found itself in the middle of quite a sizable scandal so they just got approval for a drug called so gen smih which is the most expensive drug ever approved it's the treatment is 2.1 million dollars it's a gene therapy drug one month after they got approval from the FDA they disclosed to the FDA that there was data manipulation in some of the animal studies for that drug and apparently they knew about it two months before they got approval so right now obviously this book has stirred up a lot of emotions in India and one of the accusations that has been locked against me as well why don't you talk about fraud in Western companies and they're not impervious and and it's a very complicated issue I'll be there certainly fraud in western drug companies and in Western companies generally but I think the difference and the difference as it sort of filtered down to the FDA is that here was a company that seemed completely lawless where employees across the board were directed to violate regulations that they did what they were told which would be very very hard to have as a situation in the US where you have anybody could go run to the FDA whistleblowers are legally protected here there's financial rewards for yeah I mean I think that's fundamentally the difference is systemic versus non systemic corruption and when you think of the most egregious examples in North

[01:51:10] America they are systemic they're fortunately not that many but when they're there so using Thoreau knows as an example Thera knows had very few corrupt individuals but because the corrupt individuals were at the very top of the pyramid they could organize the exact nature of the silos to perpetuate the fraud until internally it was no longer sustainable I don't know enough about

[01:51:33] Enron but my recollection of the story is Andy Fastow was probably the architect of that the CFO my reading of history is that Ken Lay the CEO probably not but he was sort of too uninvolved and who knows what the truth is about Jeff Skilling I suspect skilling sort of sheepishly encouraged Fastow and whatever but the point is you had the two of the top three lieutenants in a company and then who knows what the trickle-down was but again eventually a senior person there basically said well

[01:52:07] I mean it actually started through an analyst questioning things but internally at the house of cards fell down when internal people sort of came forward so I don't know i mean this Ranbaxy is so clearly an example of the most that might be the single most systemic example of corruption because it went to the board and fully permeated the board I mean I would argue at least at thorough knows the board was just incompetent but not outright complicit here you had something epic and so again

[01:52:37] I want to come back to the story because we're not even done yet but do you have any sense of how prevalent this is because we're gonna end this podcast with a practical discussion which is what the hell do we do I don't want the listener to think I haven't forgotten the question that is on everybody's mind which is Peter Kathryn thanks for the soliloquy but I've got a bunch of pills

[01:52:58] I'm taking tomorrow morning and my kids got an ear infection what do I do so we're going to end there I promise you but I can't help but escape to answer that question you sort of also have to understand the prevalence of this problem right so Ren maxi to me was like the jumping-off point for the reporting quest which is to figure out whether it was a total outlier or the tip of the iceberg and my question was how does this industry really work so my reporting ended up taking me deep into the FDA and to an inspector named Peter Baker he's a young investigator an analytical chemist kind of a badass he's like in a motorcycle group with tattoos he's not what you would think of as a regulator with a pocket protector and a checklist so when the FDA wants investigators to go and work in their India office which is just chronically understaffed and nobody wants to go and understand why is it the water the water the food the difficulty getting around I mean so many reasons but he sticks up his hand he's up for the adventure and he's in it just an interesting character he grew up in a family of Mennonites in a grass seed farm in Lebanon Oregon and they would often go on all kinds of missionary work anyway but he winds up at the fda's

[01:54:27] India office in 2012 and some of the FDA investigators for what are known as conference room investigators so oversees the FDA pre announces its inspections it tells the companies they're coming the FDA investigators are the guests of the company who arranged their local travel arranged their hotels they show up they get I don't see any conflict here I'm not sure where you're going with this beginning they get souvenirs they get souvenirs arrange for massages what might possibly go wrong they get like Gandhi snow globes and they get the welcome ceremony the opening slide show so Peter Baker was like I don't want any of that stuff and how old was Peter at the time when he first stepped foot in there he was 32

[01:55:19] Wow so the foot spa this guy oh yeah did you show up oh yeah no no no it's a new sheriff in town when I read your book by the way I don't know why well I read a summary of it first and I took him to be a gray beard I don't know why I just had it in my mind this is the guy at the end of his career the steely-eyed seen it all done it all been through the 80s served in Nam like that was the impression I had initially well it's really funny if this book gets made into a movie which it might matt damon could play him cuz he's a dead ringer that's what he looks like you heard it here first people mad if you're listening er anyone who knows Matt's listening this is the pitch for this role so some of these investigators are sort of conference room investigators they go in they sit in the conference show me the

[01:56:12] PowerPoint I'm going back to the hotel that's right bring me the documents so he's like nope he pioneers this new method of inspection he goes to these manufacturing plants they're like huge cities they could be over dozens of acres there's a lot of buildings you're finding a needle in a haystack if you think you're going to actually step foot and see a direct mistake instead you are going to see something that is directionally smelling wrong right so he decides he's going to start by going to what's called the quality control laboratories so these are sort of these areas off of the manufacturing floor that audit the manufacturing and basically if you are a law abiding pharmaceutical company you're using the data that's coming in from the manufacturing floor to see if there's any problems so are there any drugs that should be taken offline that are not meeting specifications what are the test results but if you're a corrupt drug company you might be using the quality control laboratory to figure out how to manipulate the test results how to kind of see what drugs don't meet specifications and figure out how to make failing drugs pass so he goes into the computers instead of saying print me out a document he looks in the computers and that's how he begins to track the metadata in these systems where they had deleted evidence and not that I know anything about computers but I'm not an idiot if you showed me a bunch of computer files like I wouldn't know anything about how to detect mass deletions did he have some training you know he had no training but he figured it out he figured it out because he had worked in a quality control laboratory in the branded drug sector before he became an FDA yes he knew what the fingerprint or signature of this like right every once in a while do you just you know we talk about all the bad things that happen but sometimes it's worth contrasting it with just the dumb luck that sometimes just comes our way and what if Peter hadn't have been the guy to put up his hand and say I'm gonna take one for the team and go to India I didn't get diarrhea for a few months and by the way I'm competent enough to do this job yeah because in fact I mean what he found was incredibly dramatic I mean he inspected 86 drug plants in

[01:58:47] India and China over a course of five years and he found some element of data fraud or manipulation in four-fifths of those and what's nice about the way he's looking is you can give them all the warning they want they can put all the window dressing they want in anticipation even if because I remember you wrote about how often the companies were tipped off you show up on Tuesday but the company had been tipped off earlier but where he's looking they're not going to necessarily fix unless the companies start talking to each other and say oh by the way but you know presumably he's not disclosing where he's seeing their mistakes well they did start talking to each other so in fact there was like an industry-wide whatsapp chat that they had where they were talking about him and his inspection methods because he became he sounds like Lucifer to these people he is Lucifer he became so devastating to these companies and just to give an example of what's at stake the book opens with this scene he goes in to inspect this plant run by this company walk heart and he encounters this employee who's trying to smuggle guy running down the hall to smuggle a garbage bag of documents out of the plant on his second day of the inspection and it's a chase scene so if you want to know what a chase scene in a sterile drug manufacturing plant looks like it is picturing Matt Damon just chasing some dude down a hall with a Jason Bourne swipe kick out at the end well it's actually a low-speed chase beneath these it's a speed walk it's a speed walk beneath these fluorescent lights and the irony is that it is sterile drug manufacturing plant the employees are if they're trained properly are trained to move slowly because you don't want to disrupt the airflow it's like a unidirectional airflow and so all the movements are supposed to be very controlled so if you have a chase scene in that environment it's a low-speed chase which is how the book opens it's a scene out of Austin Powers yeah it's crazy cuz it's like the irony of it it's like it's a chase but it's really slow and it's yeah but he figures out where the bodies are buried in these plants I mean he used the torn documents in that garbage bag to reconstruct that there was a hidden area of this plan where they were manufacturing sterile injectable cardiac drug for the US they were doing it on corroded equipment that left metallic particles in the drug that's bad right that's actually not good yes what is Peter doing today so Peter has left the FDA and he is a consultant for a auditing company that audits manufacturing plants you said something a moment ago that I wanted you to finish what you were saying so I didn't interrupt but I think it's worth calling out 80% of the companies he audited I want to go back to what you were saying had some irregularity so that's option a option B were not quite at the standard of the finest Swiss

[02:02:00] German and US plants option C were as bad as Ranbaxy I mean like walk me through this what is the employee of what Peter found the implication of what Peter found is that fraud and particularly data fraud so that is manipulation of quality data to make failing products sellable is endemic do we have a positive control for that in other words has someone done

[02:02:29] Peters analytics on the best of the best and is the background number on that 30% because of course at this point now there's nobody listening to this who trusts anything that comes out of a drug company and frankly I don't think the branded czar viewed that much more favorably than the generics because I think we've made the case that they're just under more scrutiny and they have deeper pockets so you could argue well they might not be doing the egregious nonsense like putting glass particles into pellets or giving you sawdust or doing their work on rusted machines but it certainly wouldn't be hard to make the case that there could be data fraud which is exactly the stuff that Peters autopsies and forensics uncovered so do we have a sense of what that background number is so I'm actually hopefully going to be publishing something relatively soon that will put some numbers to that but I think you could say there is really endemic fraud in

[02:03:27] Indian and Chinese manufacturing plans and that is not to say that fraud doesn't exist in the US plants but the kind of egregious shredding the documents bringing in data fabrication teams doing secretly this business card look like when that's your day job honey please meet my husband Bob Bob great to meet you Bob what do you do oh I work in pharma oh you know you a chemist no no

[02:03:57] I'm more in the data side are you a data scientist no no I'm in data fabrication Oh fantastic well so this is one of the mind-blowing things that I learned is that these companies a number of them do have data fabrication teams they bring in teams to fix these plants and fabricate documents before the FDA comes in you have to connect with Carol

[02:04:24] Tavarez because the extent of cognitive dissonance that must exist in a person whose stated explicit day job is data fabrication I'm really curious about that psychology because it's basically white-collar mob work if you're a hitman in the mob that's your job you get paid and you got a lakh people but we just don't think of that being plausible in the white-collar sort of upper echelon of Pharmacology how is this any different right except it's more efficient at killing at least the mob guy can only kill like one dude at a time right these people have the potential to kill tens of people thousands of people at a time don't get that blood on their hands that's really the difference there's this amazing quote a one thing I've been asked is what shot you most in reporting this there's this anecdote in the book where this US executive at Ranbaxy becomes suspicious about the data because it's too perfect it looks exactly like the brand data right yeah she realizes that the AIDS drugs are really terrible and on a conference call with like a dozen executives of the company she raises this question about the quality of the AIDS drugs going to

[02:05:36] Africa and the medical director of Ranbaxy says to her who cares it's just blacks dying which is like what are you do again like what's the point of your job you're working at a drug company it's something yeah it'd be hard to come up with just one thing that from your work that would have floored you because it's really it's sort of one with all due respect I think that's part of what makes this book a little tough is it seems to impossible at times it sort of seems like if you made this a movie and it was pure fiction it would be rejected yes because it wouldn't have enough suspense it wouldn't have enough irony it would be too over the top with that let's bring it back to I want to let you I keep interrupting you I apologize I want to let you get back to the story of how does at least the tale of this company and Dinesh come to a close because there's another point we didn't mention here which as all of this nonsense is going on there in play is acquisition by a Japanese company so I mean now we're perpetuating fraud on multiple levels we are also perpetuating fraud in the context of due diligence for a mega acquisition that acquisition by Daiichi

[02:06:51] Sankyo which was Japan's second largest drug company I sort of thought of it as almost like a reverse Godzilla movie where Daiichi Sankyo is coming from this the very formal polite culture the Japanese they come in to do their due diligence and Melvin nursing the Indian executive just rolls them and this is not the guy with the yahoo address that's right this is the real CEO the FDA's already rated their company they've got this smoking gun sar power point they suppress it from the Japanese through the whole due diligence thing they give their employees a script of how to talk about what the legal troubles are they create a false set of minutes from the meeting where the power point is disclosed they hide any reference to it in the Justice

[02:07:51] Department documents they disclose so Daiichi Sankyo ends up having no clue which I mean a lot of people are like who were their lawyers this is ridiculous but they end up paying Melvin der Singh and his brother two billion dollars for their shares in Ranbaxy and mal vendor Singh gets out of the burning house like just before the whole thing collapses and Daiichi Sankyo slowly begins to realize that they had bought this company that is fraudulent to the core and several years in they realized they're on the hook for five hundred million dollars which is the fine that

[02:08:35] Ranbaxy ends up having to pay to the Justice Department to settle the case against them now does ultimately that money get paid by Singh himself where does that money actually come from in restitution no Daiichi sankyou so no one has ever gone directly after saying no so then what happened is once the case settled and Daichi Sankhya was out of pocket 500 million to pay for REM backsies crimes they end up Daiichi ends up taking mal vendor sang to a court of arbitration in Singapore and get all of

[02:09:08] Ren backsies lawyers because now Daiichi Sankyo is Ranbaxy to testify against melvin der singh and in this arbitration hearing and the court in a turnaround Awards Daiichi Sankyo 500 million that mel vendor singh is now on the hook for and so right now I mean his offices were just raided in India amazingly he took this to an Indian court to say that the judgment is not enforceable in India and amazingly an Indian Court ruled against him well I mean as a skeptic I would say it's easier to turn on one man than one culture mm-hmm yeah I mean it's been very very interesting to watch it play out and Daichi is of course divested this entire bomb of crap this little turd bag has now been purchased by son as an intercept has it has Ranbaxy does not exist in the same way that it used to so this once you know very proud

[02:10:05] Indian company no longer exists in the end at least financially though I suspect not emotionally Dinesh was made whole through the whistleblower yes so he becomes a formal whistleblower under what's called a ki tam legal case so his identity was secret they reach a settlement he gets a percentage of the settlement so he ends up with 48 million dollars but his life really unraveled he and his wife break up he's had a very difficult road to hoe you see in the u.s. now he goes back and forth between

[02:10:41] India and the US and he feel safe in India you know it's quite extraordinary because whistleblowers are routinely killed in India so when he was thinking about blowing the whistle on Ranbaxy that was a sort of central calculation was the danger to himself and he ended up really rolling the dice on that and he's become an ongoing antagonist to the industry because he's now an activist and an advocate for safe drugs and he has just decided that that's how he's gonna live but he has survived this ordeal but emotionally I think it's been very scarring so it seems to me that perhaps the most compelling answer we have to the question that is probably at the top of everybody's mind which is what is the prevalence of this problem what is there or maybe another way what's the penetration of this you've done a case study of hopefully the worst of it we don't know but you've gone a few inches wide and several miles deep but then Baker comes along and Peter's assessment is well I've casted a much broader net I haven't gone as far into each one but I have found the fingerprints of fraud on 80 percent of what I viewed by the way that was 80 percent of non-us generic manufacturers are all manufacturers inclusive of us so these were 80 percent of the plants he inspected in India and China and those were okay so they were all right so 80 percent of what he inspected in India and China and that again that was a big number so you could argue the law of large numbers starts to kick in right and that is representative of your sample size so are we to take away from this that if you go into CVS Walgreens pick your favorite pharmacy you buy your drug and assuming you can even figure out what company sold it which turns out not to be easy we're gonna talk about that if it comes from a company that is

[02:12:47] Indian or Chinese you wouldn't be overly paranoid to assume there's an 80% chance that there's some misinformation in what you're taking which means again that could mean it's still fine that could mean it's not as potent as it says it is it doesn't have the shelf life it says it is like I want to create mass hysteria I want to walk through what really is implied by what you're saying it is hard to know for certain and it's hard to put a number but here's some sort of things that I can say we know that because of the kinds of frauds exposed in the book

[02:13:25] Americans have gotten drugs that in some cases are not bioequivalent have foreign particulate matter in it or toxic impurities or not as sort of represented so we know that for certain we know for example that millions of Americans were taking blood pressure medication valsartan losartan urbe certain that was found to have the active ingredient contained carcinogens and these came from Chinese and Indian manufacturing plants and dozens of versions of those drugs have been recalled and those carcinogens were in the drugs for maybe about six years and I'll throw in my own personal story here I have seen three examples of this in my practice which prior to seeing your book were really infuriating because I thought I was crazy having these arguments but sometimes you prescribed drugs for which they have a predictable measured response there's nothing subjective about it Oh an antidepressant did you I don't feel like this is helping me any maybe I have a placebo that those are very difficult to figure out even the antibiotics they're hard to figure out maybe it just took a while for the drug to kick in and now it kicked in sort of thing but when you look at lipid-lowering drugs it's really clear what's supposed to happen and when it's working or not working now there's gradation so we might be missing things that are under working but on three occasions over the past two years I have prescribed a patient

[02:15:11] Crestor and again as a doctor when you write Crestor it means nothing it means for the most part the patient will be substituted reserved a statin unless otherwise specified reserved a statin being the generic equivalent of Crestor and in these three particular examples there was zero change in the LDL cholesterol now when a patient is on ten milligrams of Crestor for three months and there is zero change in the LDL cholesterol there are only two explanations that I can think of theoretically three but for argument's sake the patient's not taking the drug or the drug doesn't work I like to think that I have an on sort of threatening tone with my patients so I always assume it's the first and I'm like hey any chance you ran out of your meds before you know a couple of weeks before the drug test and by the way the answer to that question is often yes so a lot of times I will see these issues or you give somebody allopurinol for uric acid the uric acid doesn't go down or it's been down and then all of a sudden it's back up and a lot of times yeah the answer is you know what for the last two weeks I forgot I needed a refill I was on the road bla bla bla bla but there were three occasions where that was clearly not the case and this patient and I just I really I have great confidence that the patients were in fact taking the medication not a budge and after the second one I said I asked my staff to can dig in a little bit and

[02:16:39] I said is the patient actually getting Crestor or were they getting a generic equivalent and one thing led to another and basically in those situations because it was too difficult to get the patient back on branded you just switched to atorvastatin which I now realize you're just rolling the dice going from one piece of BS to another piece of BS but I've seen this issue there's no question I've seen it and I suspect I'm not seeing it to its full extent because I'm only seeing it for drugs in which the measured response is so clear and so objective you think of as you said all the drugs that we miss this we wouldn't miss this on so what

[02:17:21] I'm discussing as an example pales in comparison to the myriad problems that could exist the contaminants the partial efficacy the time-release drug that is not a time-release drug and therefore is delivering too high a dose in a shorter period of time and does that explain the GI upset I mean I give you another exam tons of patients complain that generic extended-release metformin which is a drug i prescribed with some regularity doesn't work as well as the true glucophage XR does and metformin is a drug that can produce a lot of GI side-effects so I'm kind of stuck the book describes for example these two doctors at the Cleveland Clinic who began to piece together that some of their patients who and these are cardiac drugs were stabilized on the brand and then became unstable when they were switched to the generic and in some cases heart transplant patients were suffering organ rejection from a generic tech alumnus yeah the tacrolimus I think for doctors once they become aware of this as a kind of category of thought as a possibility some of them begin to diagnose the drug supply not just their patients well so we're in the process of doing something that's going to take a while but after reading your book I sent a long apologizing email to three people on my staff who were gonna be the ones to take one for the team on this which was we're gonna go through every drug we prescribe and luckily that's a very small list for our practice because we don't have many patients and we really narrow the focus of the type of stuff we're working on I mean we're not the ones out there writing antibiotics and stuff routinely but that's still a list of probably 30 drugs for every one of those drugs I need to know every single generic manufacturer and then we need to do the full colonoscopy on every one according to publicly available information have there been any filings against these companies just do a quick Google search news or Google this name FDA blah blah blah blah blah can I go through that exercise and I think this will take us three months to do that's how miserable and exercise it's going to be but what I hope emerges from this is a probabilistic heat map that basically says going forward again I don't think we can ever ensure with certainty even with the branded drugs but the goal here is probabilistic it's increased the odds in your favor that if you need reserve a statin atorvastatin pick your favorite generic anything hydrochlorothiazide which one are you absolutely not touching where do we preferentially do it anything else you would recommend that I do as a physician or a patient do as they navigate this so on my website because I mean let me just say since the book came out I have been flooded with emails from patients who want to know are there drugs safe where were they manufactured by the way just the thought of that is to me personally like I can't imagine a bigger torture anyone people listening this know how much I hate email I waste no opportunity to talk about how much I hate email the only thing that I could hate more than email would be getting a thousand emails a day asking me to to dig up the answer to a question like that they're the only one sending you that email oh yeah

[02:20:46] I mean it's impossible I am inundated but I also feel there's an obligation but you need to you need a system to solve this you're not personally going to be the one that gives them the answer to their question right so what I created on my website is a guide to investigating your own drugs which is basically like okay what our patients gonna do now we need new laws I mean you shouldn't have to be Sherlock Holmes for your own drugs but basically it leads them step-by-step figure out who manufactured your drug is that readily available on the front of the bottle it should because you don't often get the actual bottle from the manufacturer you're almost always getting a bottle that's a plane you know whatever yellow or green bottle that has a sticker on it that the pharmacy puts on does that sticker usually contain the generic so it varies from state to state I mean there are different disclosing requirements and it should but I mean if you're not getting that information on dispensing label you need to ask your pharmacist who's the manufacturer and when I go to a pharmacy or actually before I even go and pick up a prescription I ask who's the manufacturer who else makes it I mean I switch all the time from one day they're willing to do this without your physician's intervention yes because I go to an independent pharmacy but

[02:22:06] I think you know if you're in Express Scripts if you're CBS I think it's harder I think for the big chain pharmacies it's harder yeah the PBM s I contemplated in the last couple of days whether I wanted to go down the PBM rabbit hole with you and I hope you'll be okay with the fact that I have decided not to that's fine I think it's too big a topic do you want to say two sentences about it so people would understand why Caremark or CVS or

[02:22:33] Express Scripts are gonna be harder to navigate in as much as it offers them any hope I mean there is it worth are we just opening up a can of worms that's way too complicated I mean I can basically say that I think the optimal thing is to go to a brick-and-mortar pharmacy and have an exchange with a human being I mean that is ideal

[02:22:53] I mean pharmacists some don't really know about this issue but some know a lot I mean I've gotten a lot of mail from pharmacists saying like I've been hearing this for years from my patients that this drug didn't work or that I mean you can have a dialogue with your pharmacist about it okay it's good rx the app on your site you let patients know about that no I don't even know about a good rx a really really brilliant app that allows you to at least price compare them and that is a way that you can if you decide you want to go down this route of being brick-and-mortar you can basically price shop and it's really interesting like if

[02:23:29] I didn't have my phone on airplane mode right now and wasn't worried about it buzzing non-stop I'd turn it on and show you you sitting right here right now I would just type in atorvastatin it would say select your dose ten milligrams use current location right it's got the GPS I can tell it the zip code and it will in a radius of ascending order tell me the price for thirty ten milligram a torva statins cash pay buy pharmacy and you'd like to think they're all the same aren't they not even close so that you couple that with your analysis and you at least can get into the situation where you walk in and you could know your maximum out-of-pocket and by the way there's still a good chance your insurance company will cover it because typically the insurance company is just differentiating between the generic and the branded they're not gonna at least until you tell me different I assume they're not going to fiddle between two different generics if you specify one versus the other are they right but the problem with the price is that often the drugstore chains will be dispensing the lowest cost generics which may be the worst manufacturers in

[02:24:37] India do drug stores typically carry more than one generic well they often can order one generic or another one from their wholesalers because they're ordering from you know cardinal and Ameri source Bergen and I have a feeling I know how this is going to work for our patients what I suspect we will end up doing is partnering with one brick-and-mortar pharmacy and saying we will make you our exclusive partner on this and in exchange for it you will do exactly what the eff we say which means you are absolutely under no circumstance selling us anything other than XYZ dududududududududu and we will never think about this again and all of our patients will mail-order from that pharmacy directly to them but that's I don't know that doctors will have the time to do that or I mean I don't know this is you hit the nail on the head which is on some layer the patients need to put pressure on the payers which is both the insurance company indirectly through the PBM and Medicare and because patients I don't think individually or even frankly collectively outside of this have the ability to pressure the

[02:25:49] FDA and/or the drug manufacturers but the payers certainly can I mean if the payers decide we are not reimbursing you wholesale as a company until you get your act together well that should be a sign to fix things right well let's take this one step further imagine if there was a pharmacy chain that said you know what we're gonna test every drug that we dispense not every pill right but do a random sampling do a random sampling which is what should be happening I'd have like put any of them afford to do this or would they do this unless there was a big enough error that in a big enough issue that this could become a differentiating sales factor well okay so there's this small pharmacy called

[02:26:31] Valley sure and that's what they do that's their business model where are they based so they're based in New Haven Connecticut and that is their business model which is that they test every drug how do you spell that VA L is you re and presumably they can sell across state lines there are mail-order pharmacy mailer firms there a mail-order pharmacy yeah got it so here's something very interesting which is with the recall of these blood-pressure medications that were found to have this carcinogen and

[02:27:02] NDMA which is actually created in the production of liquid rocket fuel and that is bad for you which makes you wonder what on earth were these doing anyway I'm sure there's some reasonable reason why these things could have been in well one of the questions that the FDA has been investigating is whether they were reusing solvents ah yeah that would make sense anyway so the FDA detected three different carcinogens in these drugs

[02:27:31] Vala sure through their testing identified a fourth that is not very reassuring I mean it's great that they found one but like why didn't the FDA find this and why didn't the FDA find it how does valor afford to do this I think that large a mail-order pharmacy well right now they've got funding I mean they're a start-up oh I see okay got it so this is all baked into the business my business plan what's interesting about this just to go take a small tangent the FDA does these pre announced inspections overseas and their inspector went to one of these plants in China it's a camera it's Zhejiang who a high plant and the investigator found that the company was not investigating impurity spikes in its own drugs as required so the inspector recommended that this plant be sanctioned as official action indicated like the most serious which would have forced them to take action back in

[02:28:30] Maryland FDA officials said it's okay voluntary action indicated not such a big deal one year later this plant is in the middle of this worldwide recall of drugs because there are impurities in the drugs so the FDA actually found did nothing about it and now here we are it's not a positive story I'll go back to the question I posed a long time ago that I told you had come back to which

[02:28:56] I've been thinking about a lot only again for the purpose of like sometimes history just offers us insight if it were the hatch-waxman ebin Act of 1982 or whatever and you have the advantage of being transported back in time knowing everything you know today how would you amend that act to reduce the probability of this so the key thing would be to reform the first-to-file deal sweetener and it has been reformed since then because now it's not which minute you file but which day you file which means a lot of these generic companies are all filing on the same day and sharing the exclusivity which takes a little bit of heat out of the market gets rid of that sort of Lord of the Flies environment in the parking lot that we talked about but I think the biggest reform wouldn't necessarily be to the hatch-waxman Act it would be to the FDA in terms of authority first of all overhauling their foreign inspection program I mean my god a pre announced inspection does that solve anything for anybody except for the drug companies why give a plan eight weeks advance notice that you're coming and then ask them to plan the trip for you I mean you could argue that Peter Baker found a way around it in other words it's probably less about the regs around the inspection and more about the chops of the inspectors although in an ideal world you want both of those on your side that's a huge part of it how do you get more Peter Baker's at the FDA well Peter Baker proposed that very thing he said let me run a training program and train all of the inspectors to do these kinds of inspections and they sidelined him I mean he was basically taken off of inspections and he left he left the FDA he's no longer there he was passionate about what he did so there is I mean the book really exposes to some extent that the FDA does not really want to know what's going on in these

[02:31:00] Glantz this has the sad ending of a Michael Lewis story you know where you have some conclusion but then there's a realization that you haven't really solved the problem like mortgage-backed securities still kind of suck and there are still a whole bunch of these sort of crappy credit default swaps out there and oh by the way we haven't really reformed lending as much as we'd like to think we have and oh and by the way nobody really got spanked for the egregious mistakes that you know got made and I had a different idea by the way on that on sort of a disruptive idea around the regulation of this I think part of this could be addressed by doing something a derivative of the following so it wouldn't be this because this is just the first dumb idea that I have if you extended the protection for the primary drug maker so that branded drug currently has whatever it's 20 years and it's complicated because that's from the first patent filing and there's different patents but you basically say look you will have longer to sell this drug exclusively but in exchange for that you are now transferring all of them know-how to the generics so we're basically you could make it such that the NPV is the same to them you will make the same amount of money on this drug we will delay the time the generics can come in but basically the generics now have nothing to do except assume full manufacturing and production capacity in other words the act of 82 said you don't have to do clinical trials anymore we're now basically saying you don't have to reverse-engineer anymore mmm-hmm it's an interesting idea so there is a kind of generic that is somewhat like that it's called an authorized generic so that's one of the things that's in my guide to investigating your own drugs which is that brand companies because they don't want to let go of all their market share necessarily in all their profits what they'll do is they'll partner with a generic company they'll authorize that generic company to make the generic and they will transfer their recipe and with that does the FDA grant that other generic producer exclusivity for a period of time in exchange for that no not at all so what is the advantage why is the main company transferring basically giving that one generic producer such a head start they make money off if they can make money off of it they still retain a piece of it basically through some sort of licensing agreement okay so that's even a more elegant way than what I said what

[02:33:29] I said that's actually just a smarter way to make that happen I mean maybe that just becomes the way to do it there are only basically authorized generics where the parent company still shares some of the rent and in exchange for that they guarantee and you know what you want to go really draconian on those guys by the way you're on the hook to determine the authenticity of the product so bring it all the way back to the parent company so you're gonna get paid more money but now you have more responsibility if you're authenticated generic producer goes rogue you're paying for it so don't have the FDA exclusively be the one that has to police them have them all police from the parent it's another way of saying look it would be great if we could catch every drunk driving teenager out there and yeah we could put more cops on the street and we could give them more tools and more breathalyzers but wouldn't it be great if every parent was policing their own 16 year old as well it's a belt and suspenders approach so maybe that's part of the answer interesting that's possible I mean at the moment who knows what is possible I mean we can't come to any agreement over drug pricing every seeming approach has failed brand-name drug prices continue to rise and it's just our drug supply is really in a freefall we've got drug shortages there's no incentive for quality here and a lot of these companies are really getting away with it you know FDA investigators are walking into these plants finding egregious conditions and the FDA is downgrading their findings so it's hard to say what can practically be made to happen but I do think Congress for whatever it's worth is looking into it I mean it is sad because so many problems the people that have the means both educational and financial will be ok like I'm not worried about me and my family or you because we have the knowledge we can take the time to do it and by in a moment if we have to were willing to pay more and we have the disposable income to do that there are a lot of people for whom that's not true they simply don't have the time they don't have the knowledge they don't have the extra income to do that and those people will disproportionately suffer here and those are really if you really stop to think about it I mean that's the four alarm fire for Congress Congress exists first and foremost to make sure that it's that floor that doesn't fall any lower we can sort of talk about the ceiling and I didn't realize that you had put together sort of a tool on your site to make this easier because I do think that in the short run the we can't wait for Congress to solve this and I think we're just gonna individually have to take ownership over this to some extent it's important for patients to realize most patients if they go to a pharmacy they get dispense drugs they don't think about who makes it they don't even think about it I mean they may be switched from a branch of generic not realize that they may be switched between generics they don't realize it

[02:36:26] I've never personally paid attention to this until a couple of years ago when I started noticing this funny business with the reserve a statin and if I'm not paying attention to this who is how can I possibly expect anyone else to write I mean most people don't pay attention to it because the FDA has told us that it's all equivalent there's nothing to pay attention to they've got it there's no difference between brand and generic generic and generic it's all the same so the first step is for everybody to pay attention to who's making the drug and how it works well Katherine we're going to link really heavily to your work on your site a number of other things if you decide to release the beautiful 24 page self assessment report document the most innocuous title to a document in the history of corporate espionage we would love to host it but like I said I think a great compendium to this interview is there anything I didn't ask you that you've wanted to talk about it we joked about this off mic at the beginning you know I said to you when you walked in I said don't worry this is not a 20 minute interview with sound bytes and stuff we can talk about this stuff in as much detail as you want but

[02:37:33] I want to be sure we've talked about everything you want to talk about and we didn't leave anything on the table well I think we've basically covered it but just sort of my closing thought is that generics are supposed to be this great leveler you know it's like the democratization of drugs that like the rich and the poor alike can have access to these great cures and to find out I think that the companies sort of cashing in on that image are really selling that short in a very devious way is painful to realize it's a real sort of great hope public health hope that has a very dark underbelly well I think I and the listeners now probably have a better sense of why even Sam Harris could become angry which says that anger is not always a bad thing and you've probably taken a lot of your own anger and rage and channeled it into something incredibly productive I gather that you're still quite involved I mean based on what you've said I mean you're still involved in seeing that attention is brought to this topic specifically are you spending much time in DC I have been talking to Congress and I think they are

[02:38:52] I can't say that they're gearing up to get results but they're gearing up to look into it Kevin where can people follow you on social media yep so on Twitter where I'm pretty active it's at Catherine II ban my website is Catherine eben dot-com LinkedIn I think is Catherine eben so I see a theme here pattern and I will say that my 12 year old is my Instagram page manager so you'll have to bear with me there hello kitty by the way that makes me want Olivia my daughter to manage my incident yeah it's the way to go I'm telling you I would take so much time off my hands absolutely Catherine it's been an absolute pleasure I thank you first for taking the time to come here I can only imagine how mind-numbing it must feel to talk about the same thing over and over again with yet another stupid person interviewing you I hope this wasn't that painful but more broadly thank you for this incredible work you've done and the public good that
