## Description

Original release date: 3/4/19

In this episode, Alan Bauman, certified hair transplantation surgeon and hair restoration expert, discusses both male and female pattern hair loss, the science behind what drives it, and what that tells us about prevention and restoration. Having treated over 20,000 patients, Alan shares his invaluable insights into what works and what doesn’t in terms of the non-surgical treatment options. We also go into great detail about the more invasive approaches like PRP, and of course, hair transplantation, a procedure which Alan has refined over the years into a proprietary method that seems to produce unbelievable results. Additionally, Alan provides tips for maintaining scalp health, which is vital for hair growth, as well as the importance of choosing a hair specialist who has the tools, expertise, and patience to develop a compassionate and encompassing approach to hair restoration.

We discuss:
-Alan’s unique path, and how he became interested in hair transplantation [7:15];
-The prevalence of hair loss, types of hair loss, and the different patterns in men vs. women [15:45];
-The role of genetics in hair loss, and when does it start [19:00];
-Female hair loss: the role of hormones, pregnancy related hair loss, and what it means to have thinning and shedding [22:30];
-Primary drivers of male hair loss, finasteride as a treatment, and the potential side effects [26:15];
-Common treatments – Proscar, Propecia, Rogaine, and more – how they all came about and what you need to know [29:45];
-Primary drivers of female hair loss, potential treatments, and the different types of hair follicles [33:15];
-What are some of the unproven/snake oil methods of hair treatments being pushed to the public? [37:15];
-Preventative steps to take if you’re worried about future hair loss [42:00];
-Medications that may negatively affect hair quality [45:30];
-The importance of seeing a hair specialist [47:15];
-Impact of scalp health and inflammation on hair growth, how to pick and apply shampoo and conditioner, and how to avoid and treat hair breakage [50:15];
-Treatment options – finasteride, minoxidil, laser caps – how they work and what you need to know [57:15];
-PRP treatment: How it works, details of the procedure, and Alan’s proprietary protocol [1:11:45];
-The hair transplant procedure [1:29:30];
-Risks involved with a hair transplant procedure [1:44:00];
-Is a donor hair susceptible to the forces of the implant site that caused the hair loss? Can a hair follicle grow anywhere on the body? [1:47:45];
-Age appropriate procedures, how far the field has come, and why Alan loves his work [1:51:45]; and
-More.

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode explores hair restoration with Dr. Alan Bauman, a board-certified hair transplant surgeon. The discussion covers both surgical and non-surgical approaches to treating hair loss in men and women, including detailed explanations of PRP therapy, medication options, and modern transplant techniques. Dr. Bauman explains how hair loss affects approximately 80 million men and 46 million women in America, with various treatment options available depending on individual circumstances.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Hair loss affects 20% of men in their 20s, 30% in their 30s, 40% in their 40s [31:33]
- 200 genes regulate hair characteristics including color, curl, and texture [20:13]
- People can lose 50% of hair density before it becomes visible to the naked eye [11:21]
- DHT is the primary trigger for male pattern baldness [18:38]
- PRP treatment typically requires about 700 tiny injections [1:19:45]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Early intervention is crucial before follicles reach "point of no return" [1:35:50]
- Regular scalp health monitoring is important [53:24]
- Proper shampooing and conditioning techniques matter [54:35]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Women should consider treatment options beyond just minoxidil [59:52]
- Men should consider combination therapy including DHT blockers and topical treatments [1:06:52]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of those successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic

[00:01:04] I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming

[00:01:23] I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating or something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our shows members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:28] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription my guest this week is dr. Alan Bauman a hair transplant surgeon who is one of the few people who is actually board-certified in hair transplantation there are lots of hair transplant surgeons out there but Alan is one of the very few who's actually board-certified and I've got no Alan very well because one of my patients actually two of my patients went to him for procedures a couple of years ago I was sort of blown away by the results because the best hair transplants are the ones where after the fact you have no clue that the patient had a hair transplant got to know him better and was impressed immediately by how open he was to all of my questions and believe me there were a lot of questions before I refer one of my patients to another physician especially a physician who's going to do a procedure on them I want to be able to vet the heck out of them and I want to understand how they're doing what they're doing and internally we put together summaries of the stuff that we learned and Alan was so gracious in his ability to share his data share his insights acknowledge what he didn't know that over the past couple of years I've sent more and more patients to him who have inquired about both surgical and non-surgical solutions to hair loss and this is of course true for both men and women so at some point I said Alan we need to sit down and talk about this and

[00:05:26] Alan is of course one of the experts in the world on this topic he's treated over 20,000 patients he's done over 8,000 hair transplants the thing about this that's interesting is you come to learn as I as I learned that this is a problem that both men and women think about and so in this episode we talk about what hair loss looks like in both men and women and it turns out that pretty much nobody goes through their life without some change in their hair pattern now for men I think it's a little more obvious we see the results of hair loss but of course any woman who's been pregnant knows that just there and then she's going to experience a dramatic change in her pattern of both gaining hair and then losing hair post pregnancy but of course for many women this changes as they get older and once they go through menopause and I think most women aren't aware of some of the solutions that exist maybe as much as men are so we talked in great detail about what the non-surgical or non-invasive approaches are and there turn ugly many more than I had ever understood or even appreciated and I think Alan does a great job of explaining those and then of course there are many invasive things such as

[00:06:34] PRP that would be even pre surgical and then of course within the sir chuckle side of hair restoration like anything I suppose there are many different techniques and they have advantages disadvantages and Alan does a great job here of explaining the method that he has chosen and why I think it certainly seems to produce unbelievable results in the cases that I've seen this is an episode that has been I've been asked about a lot in social media so this is a great example of bugging the heck out of me over social media for topics that you want to hear about and both men and women have said please interview somebody who's an expert on hair restoration and so with that said please continue to ask about things that you're interested in hearing about and hopefully I'll be able to continue to find exceptional people with whom to bring expertise to you so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with dr. Alan Bob hey Alan thanks for making time today theater thanks for having me this is great yeah well we met actually through a patient because I mean a lot of the doctors that I know who are doing really cool stuff I'm somehow finding on my own but perhaps just as often actually now that I think about it I come to meet somebody through the work they've done with one of my patients and then that takes me down the rabbit hole because unfortunately a lot of times you know a patient will go and see somebody and the outcome for anything you know whether it be a colonoscopy or whatever it's not what you want but in particular the patient that saw you had such a great outcome and because you're in Florida where I just don't really have much of a network I was intrigued by the outcome and the patient insisted that I speak with you you know he was like you know you got to talk to him he's your kind of guy you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna connect and I was like of course yeah I mean I'm happy to learn and and so the first thing that amazed me when we spoke was that you trained as a general surgeons correct and I don't know why I didn't or well I don't know why I thought that would be so unusual is that common for people who are doing hair transplantation to have done a complete residency in general surgery well there are many general surgeons in the field of hair transplant surgery but

[00:08:40] I would say years ago was mostly dermatologists but hair transplant is kind of a potpourri of all different types of areas of Medicine than we have people in the field who our psychiatrists neurologists as well as the Commons ones that you would see dermatologists surgeons vascular surgeons things like that who have made a transition maybe from a previous type of practice into hair transplantation and is there a like a board certification for a hair transplant the way there is for general surgery or thoracic surgery so the American Board of hair restoration surgery is not recognized right now yet by the abms which is you know American Board of

[00:09:20] Medical Specialties so it's kind of in its primordial stage when I first got interested in hair transplantation there wasn't even a board certification test anywhere on the horizon and so of course my parents thought that I was going down a deep rabbit hole maybe with a dead end because I would never become board certified and they were very very nervous about my interest in hair transplantation back in the early 1990s but now it has a certificate in the way that so transplantation or surgical oncology which are not board-certified specialties are still certificates right even restorative dentistry has these types of boards and so it's a rigorous process one that was a lot of fun to go through to be honest because before that you know I never took a test that was specifically geared to my primary specialty it's all I do all I've done for well over 20 years is hair transplantation so to prepare for that was an exciting time it's rigorous written exam oral exam and you guys go through that every five years or how often do you research oh god the recertification you know I don't know I just did my research occation I should know it's probably like eight or ten years or something like that so what got you interested in the space because your it sounds like you're not I don't know if it's the exception of the rule but you went into surgery to do this whereas as you pointed out there are a number of people who come to this probably as a second career in surgery right right so I kind of fell into it almost by accident my first love was plastic surgery reconstructive surgery my first mentor was a plastic surgeon pretty prominent plastic surgeon on the

[00:10:51] Upper East Side of Manhattan and he was close friends of the family his kids were my age they had no interested in surgery and he kind of took a liking to me and I I he said hey if you're gonna go to medical school you're gonna be did you do residency of New York that's Israel and mount it's where did my journal surgery but this is way back when I was a teenager he said hey if you're thinking about going into medicine you should come and watch me operate and I was like well I don't know kind of operation he does but you know I went to go see him he was a plastic surgeon and that was the first time I ever saw surgery because back in the 1990's this was in the 80s no

[00:11:21] YouTube no Discovery Channel I mean I didn't really know what surgery was to be honest as a teenager and I remember being there at Beth Israel getting dropped off in the lobby and looking over his shoulder in the o.r you know he dressed me in scrubs whatever stand here don't touch anything blue I guess the security wasn't so great but you know I was looking over his shoulder and he was doing his procedures and I was blown away I was like this is what I want to do I want to do surgery and from there you know it was years and years of just shadowing him and being mentored often on vacation times and things like that and I pursued general surgery through you know my interest in going that route through

[00:11:59] PLAs to get to Plastic and Reconstructive is back in that day I mean today there's a combined plastics track where you can do three of general and three of plastics but presumably when you went through it and even when I went through training those were the exception most of them were still doing five years general surgery plus two years of plastics right right and that's just what I figured I would be doing I did an externship while I was in medical school that happened to be not happen to be but coordinated with one of the hospitals where he was an attending so I got some very very close mentorship there I was doing things with him in medical school that he wasn't letting his fellows do in rotation in the hospital so it was kind of interesting I felt like I had a nice leg up I got to watch him interact with patients in his practice as well as see him operate and he really was an amazing teacher and a great mentor of mine and really changed the course of my whole life really into the surgical end of medicine and seeing how he dealt with patients seeing his passion for the artistry and getting the results taught me a lot he was a little

[00:12:58] OCD which is great that's exactly what you want in a surgeon yeah I think I think you want that in your engineers your accountants and your surgeons for sure so I remember just being ecstatic just by every time we were together you know I was like what are we seeing next and so I always thought that plastic and reconstructive surgery that's kind of where I was headed and it really wasn't until I met a patient who had a hair transplant did I even consider looking at hair transplant surgery as a potential procedure that I would even want to perform I thought it was all painful or pluggy looking like why would anybody ever want to have a hair transplant I just it was just totally out of sight out of mind and when I when

[00:13:33] I met this patient and I couldn't tell that he had had a hair transplant I was basically blown away I was like well we need let's talk about this for a minute you know and of course he was getting something else done at that day and I was the good resident doing the intake forms and the paperwork and he was telling me about why he flew here there to get his hair transplanted and he was a lame and he told me all about you know what he knew about the procedure and I'm looking at a scalp come where you know do you mind if I ask you where did you get this procedure done you know where did you have this procedure and he said Oh up over there in Canada or something like that and I said no where on your scalp he's like oh right here at the hairline and so he started to explain to me in layman's terms the use of single follicles I mean individual hairs and what year was this this was in the mid 1990s and was your training so I was in my second year general surgery or the end of my first year general surgery I was thinking to myself just after that conversation because he was so ecstatic about it and it was really something I never thought about before and it was kind of unusual that the result was totally different than what I expected cuz you know as a general surgery resident you think you know a lot you know I think you know everything and first of all why would he have gone to Toronto to have the procedure done when everything is here in New York you know which is where I was trained so you know a lot of things kind of struck me that way but it was it was exciting and to see that and to see that it could be done in a way that was totally unexpected to me and of course

[00:14:56] I'd watched my dad go through his hair loss process so immediately I'm thinking maybe my dad should look into this and I thought then also well if this is that good maybe I should look into it and perhaps learn how to do it so I could add it to my future practice later on down the line and so that started me on the path to like looking into hair restoration hair transplantation as something maybe I would consider doing well I want to come back to that because

[00:15:20] I want to know about the genesis of the surgical perfection I mean to me one of the fun things about surgery is kind of understanding how operations evolve you know chose the residency program I chose because of its proficiency in doing this Whipple procedure and so you would go in there you would learn everything about how barbaric that procedure once was and how over years of being perfected in surgical technique even the type of suture that was used the mortality of that could fall from 50% to you know 0.3% so I want to I want to actually come back to this but I guess I want to take a step way back and just talk about hair loss in general so how common is it

[00:16:01] I guess both in men and women to start with that so hair loss is super common almost 100 million Americans are suffering from some form of hair loss and we know now it could be as close to 80 million men and even 46 million women out there who are struggling with the hair loss process so there's a lot of people out there who are experiencing hair thinning they may be experiencing receding hairlines loss of volume also coverage of their scalp and it's a it's a big concern for many although very much under treated and is there data on how many people care I mean or what percentage of men with hair loss care versus what percentage of women like is it naive to assume that this is even though a smaller problem by numbers in women that it might create more distress in women well first of all everybody cares about here don't they right I don't understand the question no perhaps right no but certainly it varies because you know you could be a young guy in your 20s losing your hair and and be really devastated by it or you could be someone who has a slower hair loss problem with the exact same amount of hair loss but at a much older age and you may be at a different place in time where you may not necessarily focus on that hair loss and remember that in men it's socially acceptable I'm looking at your bare scalp you shave down to number zero or two or one or you know with a with a trimmer maybe that you shave once every other day perhaps once a week so okay so there you go but the point is is that in women there's no socially acceptable option for female hair loss and so it can be much more devastating for sure even though it's easier to cover in women so there's is a lot of nuance there women can lose you know half their hair and you look at them across the room and think that they have a full head of hair and that's how the physical optics of hair fibers work meaning that you can lose 50% of your density and from across the room the coverage will be pretty much the same ok well that's really interesting right because yeah some people listening to this might say or get a mental image if somebody loses half their hair like one half of their head is bald eeeh there's not of course that's not what you mean you mean evenly distributed across their head half the density you know you you every two follicles become one that's pretty easy to mask the longer the hair is right right and of course you know female pattern hair loss happens in a very specific pattern behind the hairline that's where that density loss can occur so it's not equally - it's very rarely equally distributed and same in men there's a very specific pattern that you can see basically progressing from across the room but it's a it's a commonly accepted knowledge point that you can we see it obviously every day in the office that you can lose 50% of the hair mass so that might be a number that's a combination of the density and the diameter of the hair if you lose 50% of that that's roughly the break point between coverage and you know maybe some see-through to the scalp does that make sense it certainly does yeah so you alluded to something I guess I hadn't even really thought about which was you know someone losing their hair very young so is there a definition for premature hair loss because you hear that expression thrown out there but does it mean like everybody to the age of X is supposed to have perfectly normal hair volume and anything anyone that loses hair below that it's quote-unquote premature no that's a mystery mature is in the eye of the beholder obviously if you think that you're prematurely losing your hair just like prematurely gray right so there's a spectrum some people go gray in their 20s some people go gray in their 80s some people never go gray so how quickly you go gray is genetically predetermined if 70 is the new 50 then maybe you don't want to be gray at 70 so hair loss is very much the same thing but you know when we see young men I mean a hair loss can start anytime after puberty right 20% of men in their 20s 30% of men in their 30s 40% of men in their 40s have visible signs of hair loss that's a quick heuristic with percentage by decade yes pretty darn close and so what does that mean remember I said that you could lose half your hair by the time it's noticeable to the naked eye so immediately after puberty that's when hair loss starts and this is predominantly more in boys than girls though correct we were talking about male pattern hair loss right when I give you those numbers so the female hair loss typically it's a little bit later on and there's it's more multifactorial

[00:20:13] II we can see other things that are affecting the hair loss process you know women are just more complicated man ya know they do have that luxury so like I mentioned for Romani or like that that if you're graying that's genetically determined how much is hair loss genetically determined in men it's you know 99% 98 99 percent is genetically determined how quickly it's noticeable to the naked eye where it progresses to somewhat of the pattern you know is it more loss in the front versus the crown you know there's some variations there genetically of course there's 200 genes that regulate hair and that would include color curl texture and all of those play a role in terms of coverage right because again those are the physical properties and then hair styling of course so if you're a 20 year old guy and you know with your friends hanging out in the bar on a Friday night and you are experiencing some recession of the hairline you may be one out of your group of friends that's having some significant male pattern hair loss so for you that's premature you're looking at the rest of the guys in the group four or five friends they all look like they got pretty much full heads a hair and and you don't so that can cause a lot of stress and anxiety I think in this day and age you know Instagram age or however you want to call it people want to look good and feel good and they don't there's they don't want to be rushed into having to accept the fact that they're gonna look older than their stated age and I didn't realize that there were 200 genes that played a role in hair no recount them but that's what they know no directionally yeah so it's not a simple if your dad or your mom's dad or something like you I've heard these things that say that that's the direction of tracks it sounds like you're that's not the case right so x-linked mom's dad should tell you whether you're gonna go bald or not that's really not the case anymore we know that there's other factors that come from both sides of the family you know the genetic components that play a role in all those factors that I mentioned you know the color the quality the hair and so forth and speed at which the hair loss and the patterns and so forth and I now have friends who are brothers who one has total hair loss and the other looks like he's got the thickest head of hair

[00:22:19] I've ever seen in my life and maybe ones good if up all the other good at math you know and so everybody that's how genetics work it can skip siblings it's recessive gene so you could skip generations you know or it can be a wipeout I mean I have the grandfather bringing in or the dad's bringing in the grandfather and then the kids come in and you know and it's like a whole family affair because the you know the force runs strong in that family if you know what I mean talk to me a little bit about what's going on with women because I am aware of this only in that you know if taking care of more and more women over the past few years I realized that it's sort of like you say like I don't even notice it but they notice it right and they'll say you know do you think that this hormone is right in me or this hormone or taking a step back I certainly remember watching my wife go through pregnancy right where her hair would get very very thick you have a baby a lot of that hair falls out and then it just kind of all grows back to normal so putting that aside for a moment which is it must be clearly driven by hormones of course so the amount of follicles that are in antigen when you're in pregnancy is a much higher percentage so antigens the growth phase you're gonna more follicle staying an antigen longer time and antigen so your hair will be thicker and fuller during that time in pregnancy and then when the hormones crash back down after childbirth then those ratios go back to normal and a shedding phase and a flu via more telogen effluvium can occur in about six to twelve weeks but if you're prone to female pattern hair loss sometimes you don't necessarily recover from that dramatic effluvium so you shouldn't shouldn't just say oh well it's just pregnancy shedding and that's it because sometimes women come in they say look I had my kid three years ago my hair never rebounded from that situation it changed right after that and the other thing I hear women say a lot is the thickness was never the same after so it's laid out I mean I don't know that that one of us meaning me or the patient is skilled enough to assess follicular density but thickness is very easy for the patient to accept and you know I've heard women say a lot you know after my third like my hair is so thin and they're referring to the actual hair itself right well they could be referring to the hair fiber diameter and that can change just with age honestly it gets thinner with time but it could also be that they feel like their whole head of hair is not as thick as it was and that would be a volume issue so that could be the sheer numbers of hairs that are growing at any given time giving you let's just call it the pony tail volume you know a lot of women will say you know when I was in my 20s I put my ponytail in the you know with a scrunchie or whatever or a rubber band and it I could just I turned it two times and boom that was it it was like a you know a horse's tail and now here I am 10 15 years later and I can turn it three times mmm meaning they need another rat so that's an interesting litmus test I would have never thought about yeah for sure so and of course now in the in the office we have scientific methods ways devices tools that can actually quantify different areas of the scalp and give us literally cross-sectional bundle measurements of scientific ponytails and we can go back to the same area again and again but we may be going ahead of ourselves in terms of diagnosis and treatments and such but there are ways to measure that when someone says I have less hair or I have thin hair we need to figure out what exactly that what are they saying when they talk about that symptom because shedding is also another confusing symptom people say I have shedding well shedding happens every day hair follicles turn on and turn off hair follicles will grow for five to seven years a long strong hair and then turn off rest for 90 days and the cycle begins again and a certain percentage of hair follicles are in that growing phase may let's call it 84 85 percent but all of a sudden if you do something to switch that those percentages then you're gonna get a thinner head of hair meaning that there's less trees in the forest perhaps so coming back to the males for a moment which is pretty strongly genetically linked as you said my overly simplistic view of the problem is dihydrotestosterone is a hormone that will precipitate this in a genetically susceptible individual which is why two of the most popular systemic agents to mitigate male baldness block the enzyme that turns testosterone into DHT is that the only hormone that's playing a role or is that just the one that we have a treatment for well that is the primary trigger according to the data that we see right now and the data is very clear if you put someone on finasteride about a milligram a day they have a 90% chance of looking the same or better into the long run long run for pharmaceutical clinical trials you know is about five years it's not infinity but it's five years and that tells you that you know we're pretty close to that's a pretty safe bet that DHT is the bad guy you know responsible for a lot of follicular homicide out there does that mean that as a thought experiment I don't think it would ever make sense to do this if the moment a boy went through puberty he was put on finasteride are you suggesting that there may not like that might be enough to mitigate baldness at least in men because I think in women it probably is different correct well there's oh and the answer is complicated yes I think that would help in a huge percentage I'm not advocating that of course but remember that even if you could put some on a finasteride or even do TAS try which is a stronger DHT blocking agent right blocking both pathways to DHT you still squeak by with a little bit of DHT so there is still some of that happening in the body even with those strong pharmaceutical blockades and these things are not without their side-effects I mean there's some set of men experience sexual side effects with them and I mean I think the literature in the prostate land is still very confusing about lower rates of prostate cancer but potentially higher grade when it strikes and all of this confusion so

[00:28:18] I can I can tell you how that's been explained to us as surgeons by the urologists that were involved in some of those studies for example finasteride five milligrams is you know one of the more prominent treatments for BPH benign prostatic hypertrophy a large prostate you put somebody on five milligrams a finasteride their regular prostate tissue shrinks and so that's likely what's happening also at at one milligram dose and so what happens if the normal prostate tissue is shrinking and you go to biopsy that tissue you may be more likely to find some high-grade cancer or cancerous material in there just because the normal tissue is less voluminous so that's why not everybody in the world gets a prostate biopsy but everybody in a clinical trial does so that can skew the numbers and you know and I think that I don't know if I'm explained great but that analytics you know that's one of the ways it's been explained to us in the world of hair restoration surgery that you're not causing the prostate to become cancerous and of course you know thank God people don't die of prostate cancer it's you know it's a very slow-moving thing obviously there's very good survivability if you should be diagnosed but the point is is that you're shrinking that good healthy tissue and then you're more likely to find something on the biopsy that more likely to be high-grade and you know high-grade cancers in prostate are very very rare so it doesn't take much to skew the numbers from like let's call it now don't don't quote me but let's call it a quarter percent you know three quarters of a percent you know all of a sudden it doubled yeah you know it could be just a couple of biopsies to throw it off so you know you talked about finasteride which of course is the generic name Pross Carr is the five milligram formulation of that and propecia is the one milligram formulation correct correct which are both now off patent obviously you know as you know were they developed in parallel or was at first a BPH drug and then they noticed hey guys hair's falling out less oh we don't need to use as much of this let's create a new drug

[00:30:14] I will tell you that Merck knew from the get-go that it was going to be a hair loss drug they also knew about the effect on the prostate they went after the prostate indication first got that FDA approval and then did the and had safety studies and such done for that and then pursued the hair loss indication after and it was FDA approved for hair loss as a one milligram dose in 1998 so it's not it was not serendipitous as minoxidil was and some people confuse those two stories like oh this prostate drug you know they figured out it grew hair no no that's not the way finasteride came out wasn't minoxidil at least systemically a blood-pressure drug yes so I think back in the 70s minoxidil was administered for hypertension and it was I think it was people who are on dialysis honestly that were being noted to be on this drug for a long you know long periods of time and the and the the people running those clinics we're seeing patients on minoxidil oral minoxidil and they're literally growing hair on their knuckles almost you know and seeing hair growth in other places and that's how they just and it wasn't really that great of a blood-pressure drug minoxidil and so that's when they decided to move into a topical one man side-effect is another man's indication right yeah yeah for sure the story of Viagra not quite as elegant but similar so we'll come back to minoxidil cuz it's topical and I that's that's what Rogaine is by brand name correct so Rogaine was the first drug

[00:31:41] Rogaine wasn't obnoxio formulation with propylene glycol and that was the first fda-approved medication for hair loss so that is an important data point in the history of hair loss you know when we write the history books that really started hair loss as something that we can treat and the beginning of the end if you will of a snake-oil era so Rogaine is purchased over-the-counter correct so today

[00:32:04] Rogaine is available in a number of different formulations over-the-counter you can get 2% or 5% solutions or foam versions there's generic versions all over the place but the problem is is that most of those are very very irritating to the scalp they can be very greasy or gooey the foam versions if you have any kind of hair on your hair on your head whatsoever it can be very difficult to apply to get into the scalp so those formulations have some issues and that's why Rogaine if you will or over-the-counter minoxidil is consistently ranked as the most dissapointing hair loss treatment ever by Consumer Reports they had a big report on that a real number of years ago and the reason is because it's very difficult to use so I would say about 15 years ago we started looking at compounding pharmacies to really help us make a better minoxidil could we create a minoxidil that was penetrating better or easier to use less irritating to the scalp take advantage of some of the other knowledge that we have about the hair loss process like inflammation and so forth what could we do to potentiate or accelerate the movement of minoxidil across the epithelium into the into the location of follicles where we need it the most you know and that's where we came up with some of these more sophisticated formulations like 80 um and he do have and so forth all right well I want to come back to that as well because that sounds super interesting going back to just close the loop on the pathophysiology and the women who and again separating it from sort of the pregnancy cycle you know you have a woman who 20 years after her ten years after having her last child starts to say you know my hair is getting thinner and it's to the point where she's noticed it either just based on the volume of hair coming out in the shower brushing her hair on a pill or whatever and or even just able to visually see the difference what do we think is driving that acknowledging that it's going to be more complicated than just her DHT which is probably very low yeah her DHT levels could be very low but she can also be and rude and sensitive so there is about a 50% success rate when you apply finasteride and postmenopausal women with hair loss when you say apply you mean don't take it orally orally oh

[00:34:09] I I thought that it was completely contraindicated in women well women of childbearing age it can be used off-label and postmenopausal women because the risk is to a developing male fetus yeah and that's the main issue because you know DHT in a developing male fetus is the driver that makes men look like men for lack of a better way to explain so you know we would never want to use finasteride in women of childbearing age and it's not fda-approved at all in women and for those reasons in particular and but we do know that there are some studies out there that showed that 50% of women who were in these clinical trials with female pattern hair loss postmenopausal right no risk to a developing male fetus at all we're treated with finasteride and they got some response from it so their DHT may be a driver in some of those patients so what androgen sensitivity is something that is I mean we don't know the incidence but let's say 50 percent of women with hair loss have some degree of androgen sensitivity that could be driving it and you know if you think about for example the most common hormone abnormality of women of childbearing age with PCOS what are the things that kind of roll together in

[00:35:17] PCOS syndrome there's acne there's hirsutism hair growth on the face and acne did I say that and and hair loss and so those that what are though all of those have in common they're all androgen cracks so so there it is is a common androgen connection so do young women with PCOS also experience hair loss yeah it's devastatingly bad I just I didn't realize that yeah it can be devastatingly bad hmm very common in PCOS a lot of our and you're stuck because they'd probably respond to 5 alpha reductase inhibitor but they're in childbearing years who couldn't use it correct they're under treatment typically to improve their fertility you know so it's a delicate dance you know so we're left with other non androgen modalities and so that would be minoxidil to directly stimulate the scalp maybe low-level laser therapy to impart energy to the hair follicles maybe injectable treatments like PRP and so forth do those women in particular these young women with PCOS can their hair loss be restored or is it permanent well that's a trick question because meaning if you resolve the PCOS you know you can treat them and they can bear children and such will they also regain the hair that they lost it's tricky so here's the thing if you can normalize their hormones many of their hair loss symptoms improve slightly but remember that once the follicle is what's called gist damaged beyond repair miniaturized down to a certain level it reaches a point of no return so the terminal hair is a good healthy oak tree in the forest that's the your best best quality hair is a terminal hair vellus hair is the type of hair you have on the top part of your cheek it's invisible it's less than 2 millimeters long it doesn't have any pigment to it it's very thin in terms of its diameter so if a follicle was producing a terminal hair and then it miniaturizes all the way down to now creating a vellus hair you're out of luck meaning that there's nothing that we know of that I know of that's going to revive that follicle and get it to regain any kind of significant amount of growth so whatever kind of hair loss you have male/female the idea is that you got to take action soon to protect the functioning of the follicles before there's that point in no return that makes sense you alluded to Rogaine being the first drug or topical agent that actually had clinical efficacy which therefore I think you described it a very nicely as the beginning of the end of snake oil not the end but at least the first shot across the bow that this could be a legitimate industry correct just briefly what are some of the top three top five snake oil things that were being peddled out there to people oh gosh well we'd have to go back to the history books but you know there were all kinds of tonics and such that were promoted through advertising and so forth when you look at old magazines like there's always ads for exactly like some tonic or some some ridiculous chemical that you could opt urghhh ons whatever you know what I mean you know and there's always like a picture of a you know there's a woman with a beautiful long head of hair and so you know what happened was is that then I guess was you knows Johnson and Johnson or whoever was that had Rogaine was then able to say you know you can't advertise hair growth from that kind of you know lavender oil extract because we have FDA approval for that now so that was the method that kind of started to clear out the industry if you will moving some of those literally oil treatments tonics and so forth that had no clinical efficacy whatsoever out of the market because now if in order to advertise hair growth you had to have that FDA clearance you had to have the FDA approval behind you so and we don't have to do an exhaustive list now but I would love to list - an exhaustive link in the show notes but what are some of the snake oils you're seeing out there today that people come to you saying you know

[00:39:14] I've been where I've been on this and it hasn't been working or what do you think about this well you know there's a long list but you know here's the thing you have to be careful because you know people say oh well you know Rogaine didn't work for me but remember we said earlier on that application application makes a big difference compliance most people they pick up a bottle of Rogaine they they're like say days ago about it they don't do it twice a day they can't get it on their scalp they have some kind of irritation they get they don't know that it's working so a lot of it has expectations - so right so you know people say well yeah yeah Rogaine didn't work or you know this handheld laser that I bought back in you know 1999 you know it was supposed to grow hair but it doesn't but well the problem with for example that small little handheld laser just that you're trying to water your lawn with a watering can when really what you needed was a sprinkler system you needed a different type of delivery system so that you know we kind of get into trouble sometimes say well you know that people thought like laser was a bogus treatment even my colleagues for many many years thought that low-level laser therapy had no influence on the hair follicle and obviously they're all proven wrong by the exhaustive studies that have been done now and all of the

[00:40:24] FDA clearances which prove not only safety but certainly hair growth and we've seen patient after patient and what about it's not like biotin and things that you see people taking like these tablets or these makeshift things there's so much and New York is full of doctors who I just know this because I when you do an intake with your patient you find out all the medications they're taking and there's like all these cocktails of pills that they're taking for hair growth and I'm I'm obviously familiar with some of them like finasteride do tests right but I mean biotin what is by it well you have to know you know what they actually do biotin has been shown to improve keratin production not only the animal kingdom because it's used in horses who have hoof issues and a lot of that Sciences really is out there you know you can you can put a horse on a high dose biotin and their hoofs improve and that would be important if you're you know raising thoroughbreds for example because a hoof problem in a valuable racehorse is a big issue so there's no question that there's a lot of science and data out there it's less honestly in humans they're less data out there but you know if you put patients on by it in a high dose let's say 10,000 micrograms 9 times out of 10 they'll tell you their nails are getting stronger and we know that you can do hair tensile strength studies and put you know strip literally stretch and pull on those hairs and see the strength improve but remember that that's not going to improve your female pattern hair loss or male pattern hair loss problem to any substantial amount it may make the hairs that you have stronger but it's gonna need to be coupled with some other effective treatment and that's where layering these kinds of therapeutic interventions are really really important so have you ever had a patient come to you and say with a bag of vitamins no no have you ever the patient come to you and say I'm 25 years old and everyone in my family has lost their hair you know when they're in their 40s I'm and it's male or female by the way so feel free to answer the question differently is there anything I can do preventatively even though now my hair is still seemingly perfectly normal but it look if history repeats itself in 15 years I'm going to be losing it or it's gonna be thinning well a lot of my patients come to me with that exact question and concern many of my patients who we've transplanted or treated with other therapeutic interventions will bring in their teenage sons or daughters and say listen I you know I got measured too late can you measure my son or daughter they're going off to college they're going to grad school let's get them measuring let's see what's going on and then the son or daughter may or may not have a concern very often it's the parents just like probably they paid for braces so you know they're concerned about keeping their their child's hair intact or at least as long as it possibly can so we'll perform some evaluations and measurements so if we know that there's a hair loss risk in the family the father's a hair transplant patient obviously or something like that we'll use the try commoners to do hair bundle measurements we'll look at the areas that are permanent for example in the back of the scalp and we'll measure that and see what is their maximum hair mass index that's the that's a term that we use for the number that is a combined measurement of the diameter and the density in a given area of scalp and then we'll compare that area to an area that might be at risk like the crown area or the frontal zone or in the temples and so it's normal to see a little bit less in the temple areas but when you're going through puberty your hair mass is essentially all the same over the entire top of your scalp so I can pick up if they have a tendency towards hair loss very very early on way before it's noticeable to the naked eye they may not young man may not even have a receding hairline and we can tell by measuring that instrument are so sensitive we can tell already he's got maybe a let's call it 20% loss in that frontal zone because you're sure that it's not just 20% less genetically correct it should be the same you know these areas are the same I have patients that come in and they get measured and they are the same all of the areas measure a-ok now a lot of those patients are you know really teenage years maybe or women who have hair loss problems a different type of her Aetna Sara Lee a hereditary hair loss problem some other issue is hair loss sort of like atherosclerosis where you know if you lived long enough everybody would get atherosclerosis is this one of those things where if you you know because sometimes you'll see like you know like Ronald Reagan even at the end of his age he looked like he had this thick mane of hair if you did that - elet e testing on him would you suspect you would have detected differences I'm sure yeah I'm sure that I'm sure that so if we think if someone figured out a way for people to live to be 500 everyone's eventually going to lose their hair if they don't take some I think so I mean you know there are a few exceptions I have a friend of mine from New York he's in the music business and you know he's on the admin side managerial side and man he's got the hairline that he had when he was a teenager it literally goes straight across his head and it has not budged it has not moved and has not I don't know what the exact density is he doesn't let his hair grow out it's basically kind of like a buzz cut but you can see that hairline straight across and he know I've come across tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of people in my life so far and I've never seen anybody else like him so I don't know if it's a hundred percent true but

[00:45:32] I would guess that it is something like that where over time you will see some kind of thinning so what are these risk reduction techniques that or what what would you recommend for two patients in that in that situation well of course in those early stages for men sometimes the first visit to the doctor is their visit to the hair doctor honestly and there may not be any other medical conditions that we can necessarily pick up at that time that require you know drastic intervention but if we switch gears for a moment and look at it a little bit of an older age category they're male or female when they start being on at the age where they're taking medications for blood pressure or cholesterol or they're on some mood modulators those are some top those are like the top three types of medications that can really impact hair quality well I didn't realize that and is it always negative I'm assuming yeah so what were they again so blood pressure so blood antihypertensives anti lipid right cholesterol modulation is there a particular type is it SSRIs or is there a particular type of you you were a little vague and you description events yeah I would say it's just in general anything that decreases the blood that's being used to decrease the blood pressure I can't say if it's only SSRIs but it's a general rule if they're on some kind of blood-pressure medication typically they can correlate if you ask them pointed questions you can you can sometimes see at the time that they started that medication that there is some effect on their hair now how many of those things are sort of hypotheses you have verses documented facts isn't is that I didn't I guess I mean I'm not that I'm in this literature but I didn't know any of those things actually I didn't realize that hair loss was a side effect of those meds well it's just been so clear I mean I've treated about 20,000 patients and many patients say you know what when I started that medication a year ago fill in the blank you know cholesterol medication that's when I really started to notice my hair changed and you know when women tell you that their hair has changed unlike many dermatologists out there we believe them very much so you're gonna upset the dermatologist well why don't hermit ologist believe them well the general feedback from most of my patients is that they've been around that unfortunately they've been around the block to a number of different physicians may be under chronologiste dermatologists a primary doctor a family doctor whomever doing all sorts of blood tests looking for why their hair is thinning and no one has ever even looked at their scalp measured their hair or talk to them about potential treatment options except maybe the over-the-counter Rogaine bottle on the way out the door here catch so a lot of dermatologists have a certain bias where they look at the woman who as used as we've talked about looks like this she's got a full head of hair and say well you're not dying of cancer so you're okay and so this is not I wouldn't say it's a sweeping comment that I've made I wouldn't say it was appropriate for every single dermatologist out there and

[00:48:19] I think that many terms are starting to wake up to the fact that hair loss is important something important to treat and then it can be devastating for many men and women who are experiencing it so my heart goes out to them if they've been to a dermatologist or several and kind of been ushered out the door saying well you know we're here we're a lot but off cancer growths over here you know that's what we do so you got all your hair you know your your hair looks like technologists in high-volume places like

[00:48:47] New York in Florida that would be doing what you're doing which is there taking a sort of either surgical or non-surgical approach but basically doing pure hair restoration like it sounds to me like one of the problems in that scenario is you know if you seeing a dermatologist who's mostly interested in skin cancer it's like you're asking you might as well be asking your radiologist that question right yeah well unfortunately dermatologists often hold themselves out as experts in skin and hair but yet they have little ability to diagnose the hair loss process they have no interest in measuring or monitoring or prescribing even a treatment regimen and keeping a patient compliant with it so it's just kind of like a doorknob conversation for them and they're they don't have the time to do it honestly I mean a haircut a good strong hair loss consult in my office takes at least an hour typically patients usually or spend about an hour and a half in my office when they come in for consultation you're not gonna spend an hour and a half with your local derm certainly you know they're gonna do a quick exam you know look for some funky mole and then kind of send you on your way so they don't have an hour to spend with you so I think it's part of it is that those practices are just not simply set up to treat hair loss so so I mean the takeaway is I guess if you're if you go to see a doctor about a concern you have on hair loss find a specialist find someone who's gonna do a bunch of measurements you want to make as many objective measurements as possible absolutely we'll find somebody who does it full-time that's their area of expertise and specialty and yes who has those tools at their disposal to measure and monitor and figure out what's going on or whether it's genetic testing to look at androgen sensitivity and that postmenopausal women I mean a lot of

[00:50:24] Durham's don't just don't have access to some of that stuff and what so what were the tests again you do a test of tensile strength you do density and then you what what sounded really interesting was the comparison density test right where you do density in a region where there's never gonna be hair loss make that your control and then look at the crown yeah crown or frontal and temporal areas or anywhere really that the thinning is occurring you know you have to look at the scalp and you have to see is this skin tone normal and you know we've taught spend a lot of time talking about hereditary hair loss but there are many other types of hair loss so you know figuring out what's going on in each of these different areas you know requires someone to look at the scalp and see what's happening how many times do you look at the scalp and you see something completely unrelated like you know a fungal infection that can completely be treated and ameliorate the whole situation quite often actually and one of the things that we've learned I say I've learned over the past maybe five to seven years is the impact on scalp health - hair growth and you know we had kind of an inkling that maybe this was important but there is some good data out there journal articles and such that talked about especially coming out of like the the dandruff if you will treatment protocols of zinc pyrithione zinc and some other treatment protocols for Melfi the the yeast overgrowth that you get in the scalp that show that if the inflammation and the over activity of those populations are out of control then you can get a detrimental effect on on hair growth so we know that today that's that scalp health is important so that the soil in the forest needs to kind of be fertile and if it's really inflamed or there's inflammation going you have this inflammation going on that can definitely shut down on the follicle and impair hair growth so that's important to look at that if somebody has dandruff do we have a sense of how much that's increasing their risk of hair loss so dandruff is kind of a nonspecific symptom right so flakes right but flakes could be thick and yellow they can be small and white your scalp could be oily in dandruff e they could be dry and flaky so you know that's a whole nother deep discussion on trichology which is the study of the chemistry of the scalp essentially where we look at scalp pH levels moisture levels sebum levels and really try to assess what's the right protocol of scalp care just like you would do that an esthetician might do that for your face for your skin of your face well we want to treat the scalp in that same kind of way figure out what's the right protocol how often you should use shampoo what's the right shampoo for you and that's not sometimes a simple question to answer especially if you ever well maybe for you it is but but if you walk down the shampoo aisle in any supermarket you see that there's thousands of choices right so there's got to be some confusion there yeah do you have any takeaways on what people should be doing are there any do's and don'ts with shampoos and conditioners so

[00:53:06] I think the best thing well of course the do's and don'ts so shampoos and conditioners if you have any length of hair you should always follow your shampoo with a conditioner shampoo is like a degreaser meaning essentially it's cleanser and if you shampoo in a harsh way or with a strong surfactant let's call it then you're gonna strip out a lot of the natural oils of the scalp and also of the hair in a conditioner replaces those natural moisturization of the hair so it's kind of important to do both of those things but there's a huge spectrum of different types of shampoos first of all shampoo is not going to cure your hair loss so when you asked circling back about some snake oil type treatments there's no one shampoo that's gonna fix your hair loss situation but again you have to understand if we can if we can rectify some imbalance at the level of the scalp and reduce inflammation or tackle a fungal overgrowth and we're gonna start to improve some things and if we have some ingredients that maybe we want to apply in the shower while the scalp is kind of steamed if you will you know sometimes that's the right time to do it but I guess the point is that finding the right shampoo and conditioner regimen for you has to do with some of the variables that I just mentioned the scalp pH level moisture level oil level what's your natural sebum production what is your hair care regimen look like does it require a lot of product or hairspray or things like that that need to be rinsed and washed out or are you in a dirty environment do you live in the city where there's smoke and toxins and things like that you know and debris that you need to wash out of your hair on a regular basis so how does somebody

[00:54:35] I mean given that I don't think about this problem how does somebody who does think about this problem find out I mean is this something where they you can go to a website where there's like a you know if you fit these criteria this is the shampoo conditioner combo you should use well there are to some general guidelines right if so if your hair is kind of long and curly for example let's call it even kinky or afro type hair then you need like durable conditioning you need conditioners that kind of stick around for a while if your hair is on the other end of the spectrum let's just call it like thin and kind of limp then you need very very light conditioners and you want to make sure using shampoo that strips out a lot of that oil so that you get some weightlessness to the hair in order to style it so there's there's some general guidelines I remember when my daughter was little and

[00:55:22] I would give her a bath I don't know what this might have been just a total wives tale but I remembered that I was told Shampoo is more important in the scalp conditioner more importantly so you would start the shampoo at the head and work out to the ends and then when I would can put the conditioner in her hair I would start at the ends and work up is that total nonsense no it makes some sense because the ends of the hair are the ones that are typically the driest it's been around the longest the hair doesn't self repair it's a keratin fiber right that your body has produced it's not alive so if when the fiber is long that means it's been around a long time and so the tips of the hair is the part where you're gonna see a fraying of the hair right it's the part that looks the driest it was the part that's been had the most exposure to UV radiation and everything else a heat or if you've done a Brazilian Blowout or some other straightening treatment or curling treatment or colouring treatment the part that's received the most amount of abuse is the tips and so the tips of the hair are typically the ones that look the unhealthiest and feel the unhealthiest they may be rough the cuticles starting to peel up the ends are starting to split and fray and if that continues obviously then that's then you could lead to hair breakage which can actually is a very common problem for hair loss in women or trigger of hair loss and women the hair breakage literally that they've they've stressed out the fiber so much that the fibers are actually breaking and we see that with harsh chemical treatments time and time again are the new trends for flat ironing and such you know we've put the hot ceramic Flatiron again and again and again and again and again on your hair to straighten it to straighten out the curl and so that application of heat and or other products can degrade the hair fiber so you should condition the hair itself rather than the scalp but don't forget that sometimes the scalp needs a little love too and we have a bunch of different types of products that are for exfoliation and for moisturization and inflammatories and things like that I mean obviously if you have a severe psoriasis issue we need to get those flakes out of there and we need to treat that psoriasis you know that's a bigger bit of business than just trying to like well what kind of shampoo should I buy at the supermarket really so once we get to treatment when

[00:57:27] I think about this I kind of create four buckets so I don't know if this is right or wrong but you know we've talked a little bit about systemic treatments so something that you take like a pill where it's going to act you know across your whole body but you reap some benefit in in the hair follicle and then we've talked a little bit about topical as well like you know minoxidil I don't know if we would consider laser also topical but maybe that could be considered something topical well let's talk about for example putting oral and topical medications or pharmaceuticals in one bucket and then let's talk about non chemical therapies in another okay so our non chemical therapies would be laser and or PRP and so a lot of times during a consultation process we're looking to try to institute something that's going to help someone's hair loss issue and they may say you know what I just don't want the risk of side effects of this drug I don't want to apply this medication into my body and I can certainly understand that they may want to try something that's non chemical whether it's a real or perceived value of less side effects laser has no side effects oh I see so you think of laser

[00:58:32] PRP topical as maybe something you would try even before you go systemic I mean for a patient who wants to be stepwise obviously you could do them together but well well for men and for women it's gonna be different so for men we talked about the fact that finasteride knocks off the DHT level and that's the primary treatment it's a strong treatment 90% success rate very low in society and we're almost always going to consider that correct we're going to talk about that first yeah now they may say hey you know way I want to I don't want to do anything that's gonna lower my DHT level and they may have heard about side effects they may have side effects so there's ways to get around side effects changing timing the dose frequency the dose the amount of the dose moving that finasteride from an oral treatment to a topical with a prescription product like 82f is a way to get around that so that would be for men let's try to at least address you know the DHT issue first and if we're not going to go that route then let's choose from the other tools in the toolbox now for women because DHT is not the issue most women are of childbearing age we're not even thinking about finasteride for them we're gonna be looking at laser light topicals as kind of the first types of therapies and maybe PRP so talk to me about why does Laser work why does it work or how does work laser works by imparting energy to the follicle so we know now photobiomodulation is a very serious science dr. Michael Hamlin did much of the lion's share of the research at

[00:59:52] Wellman Center for photo medicine here in Mass General and Harvard he described and this is going back now almost 15 years or more the mechanism of action of low-level laser therapy how and where the photons of light in specific wavelengths are accepted at the level of the electron transport chain in the mitochondrial membrane cytochrome C oxidase and what you get is a hyperpolarization of that mitochondrial membrane and if you remember back from basic science that those ions flowing back and forth into and out of the mitochondria is really what generates

[01:00:22] ATP for kind of a simple way to think about it ATP is the energy center within the cell and if you can charge up those energy centers if you can make those mitochondria kind of fire up and produce a lot of fuel you end up getting a better stronger healthier hair growth do we know that in people who are losing their hair there's a deficiency in ATP production at the follicle now is this something that we're doing to override whatever it is that's potentially causing the issue we're trying to override it and it's the same thing with minoxidil when you apply a topical medication like minoxidil you know it has nothing to do with DHT but you're basically pushing that gas pedal all the way down to the floor trying to push that follicle into the best possible growth what is the mechanize it it's so funny I've never seen a patient take minoxidil for blood pressure and yet I sort of remembered studying this on

[01:01:09] USMLE part one what is the actual mechanism potassium channel okay and so what is that doing to the follicle so that's a great question and probably beyond my paygrade but there are some many physicians called great colleagues of mine in the UK who have kind of figured all of that out and I can provide that research for you but essentially what minoxidil does is it keeps the follicle in the growing phase so remember we talked about the antigen which is the growing phase and then of course the catagen telogen those are the resting degeneration phases of phases of the hair follicle and we know that in a certain area of scalp there's going to be about 84 85 percent of the hairs in healthy area 84 85 percent of the hairs are in a growing phase but as you get to a male pattern hair loss or female pattern hair loss situation many many more follicles are in a resting phase than in a growing phase before those ratios change and the hairs spend less time in a growing phase so the antigen phase starts to shore so that's one of the reasons why if you have someone with thinning hair whether it be male pattern hair loss in the hairline or female pattern hair loss let's say in the frontal zone right behind the hairline typically you can make a part with your comb and you can see these very very short kind of spiky hairs mm-hmm that is indicative of miniaturization and if you look at the microscopic level you'll see even shorter thinner weaker wispier hairs than that so yeah so what happens is that when you put somebody on minoxidil resting follicles start to kick into action and grow so you're gonna start to produce more fiber so fewer spikes more the long goes right and the guys who are already growing that may want to turn off too soon are kept in the growing phase so those tho antigens can be delay meaning that the and it's gonna keep going and we also know that the longer you keep a follicle and antigen the thicker the fiber becomes over time so there's literally fewer exits at the cellular level and the matrix at the base of the follicle near the dermal papilla the cellular material continues to aggregate in that area and almost like swell essentially to keep it in antigen phase you actually get a thicker hair follicle over time and a thicker fiber as a result of that so your question was how does minoxidil work it decreases the amount of follicles that are in that resting phase keep them in the growing phase and so you're gonna get better thicker stronger healthier hair from those follicles that could be rejuvenated that are not too far gone yeah okay that was the next question I was gonna ask you thank you so let's go back to something you alluded to earlier which is most physicians this is one thing I know about hair loss most physicians I've spoken with have said what you said earlier which is you don't want to buy minoxidil off the shelf you should have it compounded correct what I didn't realize that there was foams and didn't know that's what the exact issues were so that's obviously one issue you're trying to overcome is create a different viscosity that it makes it easier to reach the scalp but what are the other agents that they typically add to minoxidil to make it more efficacious so Trent Nolan retin-a yeah is excellent wait doesn't max didn't that also aggravate the scalp usually not at the percentages to 5% that we're working with you're not going to get an aggravation but there's a lot of good clinical data that shows that the combination of minoxidil plus threatenin improves the hair growth so there's some basic science that describes the increased penetration and then there's also on the results and increased hair density and hair growth that you get from combining the NOx alone and retin-a in it for example the formula 82 M product which is our most powerful most popular treatment most easily compliant version of minoxidil this prescription compound obviously you're going to have also a tiny little bit of flu scent alone in there so it's a little anti-inflammatory what is just it's okay it's a steroid anti no yeah that's one that you would put on your skin if you've had like a rash or something like that's very common in the dermatological world there's a basically a whiff of that in the 82 M formula so even you know inflammation is such a big topic on this podcast it comes up in every disease and just I would not have thought it was gonna come up in hair loss so I was part of a study in the

[01:05:25] University of Miami where they looked at the micro inflammation at the level of the hair follicle we donated a number of follicles from hair transplant patients from donor zones and recipient zones and such and what they determined is that there is an inflammable which is this mediator of inflammation that was discovered and elucidated through some of that research so there is micro inflammation it's very well known male pattern female pattern hair loss there is a lot of micro inflammation at the level of the follicle so we think that maybe not only could the Sinaloan that's in the 82m be making it more tolerable to the scalp certainly people can be you can have dermatitis I'm a just about anything you know you can put a piece of scotch tape on your head and have dermatitis from it so maybe that's keeping the scalp a little bit healthier in that way but also addressing that micro inflammation right at the level the follicle and shutting that down a bit and that also helps us out in understanding that there's some micro inflammation also helps us understand some of the more nutraceutical ingredients that we see it also helps us understand maybe how some of our sophisticated PRP creation techniques may improve hair follicle function once you understand that there is some bit of inflammation going on it kind of opens the door to some other modalities of treatment so we've established that for most guys a combination of 5-alpha reductase inhibition plus this type of a compounded topical minoxidil plus or minus the laser to hit and it's so funny

[01:06:52] I'm totally familiar with that technology for some of the experimental use that's going on with Alzheimer's disease for the exact same reason it's hitting cytochrome C oxidase by the way they're also using methylene blue which is a cytochrome C oxidase activator as well but I'm guessing putting minoxidil methylene blue on the scalp isn't going to be a great idea because you know you're gonna have to for every time you apply it you'll have to spend an hour washing your skin to get the blue off yeah I don't know how that would work so well so that sounds like a pretty interesting regimen unless you're coming here to Vegas to be part of Blue Man

[01:07:26] Group yeah I saw a woman in the airport today that had that going on so she she would be fine but she look like she had great hair so I think she needs it for women you've got those two options which is the same compounded minoxidil you don't have to make a different formulation for women we do not make a different formulation 82m works very very well in our female patients what's the laser yes they may use the laser may make it plus or minus they may or may not use low-level laser therapy you know one of the good things about the 82m product just for the women specifically is that it has a little bit of a skin conditioner and a hair conditioner in it one of the main complaints with over-the-counter Rogaine is that it just makes the hair nasty it just makes it greasy and gooey and basically unmanageable and style and so the 82m product goes on very very clean and dry and we teach also how to apply it so that its most active effect at the level of the scalp and you really don't get it on your hair how do you yeah yeah I've never really understood that how do you apply it to I mean if someone's in the early stages of hair loss or if it's a woman who barely has hair loss how do you actually get it on the scalp yeah and it's a tricky bit of business and if you're using a rogaine foam version then forget about it most of it is not getting on the scalp and that's part of the reason why a foam is not necessary such a great option for women but what we do is we teach how to part the hair the bottle that the 82m comes in has a an applicator tip so you actually put the tip of the bottle directly on to the scalp when you apply so you're kind of parting the hair and you're directing the application directly onto the scalp so it may sound complicated but literally once you know how to do it it takes you 90 seconds twice a day every day and that's the other piece of the puzzle most people who buy minoxidil over-the-counter think that once a day is going to do the job and that very very rarely has any substantial effect on hair growth whatsoever and what is the requirement of the laser how often does that need to be done so that depends on the type of laser that you have because the laser energy that comes out of these different devices could be intermittent meaning that there's a duty cycle to the laser right how much time that laser spends on or off during any given minute of therapy and also how the lasers are kind of designed into the device to shine on to the scalp is it something where it's a spot treatment that you have to move around like years ago we had the laser comb and you had to like move it all the way around your head every five seconds pretty laborious today the laser cap or cap therapy devices just sit on your scalp like a baseball hat and the battery pack clips to your belt or sticks in your pocket and you could be done in as little as six minutes and you do that once a day or twice a day so that would be well different devices have different recommendations so let's just start with the best of the best you know the cappellas Rx is really the top device it's a physician only device it has 312 diodes which is a lot can you say physician only meaning you have to be in the physicians office to use it no it's only prescription events or RI physicians you're not going to get it like over the counter you're not gonna get it you can't buy it on Amazon or

[01:10:21] Costco I mean that's through the pharmacy that's a three not the 312 RK rx device how much does one of these things cost so the RX is $3,500 Wow but what do you say well I don't know I guess I just they sound like a lot money well actually laser therapy is your least expensive treatment over time I guess because there's one cost amount to correct they last for 10 to 15 years

[01:10:42] I have many patients using the same laser caps that they did from 10 year 15 years ago all they've done is swapped out about hundred of our it's a buck a day yeah and no side effects non-chemical you know it's a great investment so let's talk about PRP you into it you ask me how often you do it so the six minutes a day but there are other devices like the laser cap which was 20 minutes every other day so but it sounds if you can be doing something else like yeah the harder thing seems to me like the minoxidil because you have to apply it twice a day yes so you know sometimes for example you know we busy college students kids just starting a jobs and so forth they may have difficulty applying something there to their scalp twice a day that living in the dorms and whatnot that may be difficult so you know we may do something more like laser or PRP for them might be easier for them to be compliant with that although it sounds like it's harder to walk around with a laser cap in a dorm room then no because it's covered by a baseball cap Oh literally a baseball literally it fits underneath a baseball cap geez Wow okay

[01:11:43] I can't wait to link to a picture of one of this see so you know well later on when we go down to the expo you'll have a chance to see yeah I'll stick it under my fanatics okay you alluded to PRP now you know in in and say the world of orthopedics where PRP is used quite often I think the jury's still out on the efficacy I think most orthopedic surgeons I speak with believe there probably is some efficacy to PRP though it obviously seems to be dependent on two things the technique used to basically create the formulation and the clinical judgment and when in you know who patient selection basically for lack of a better word for sure because think about it if if we relate it to the hair follicle for a moment if the follicle is dead and gone and you're hoping that your laser minoxidil PRP regimen is going to do the job what do you think that success rates going to be probably not pretty good so you know you can't come into a baldness clinic with total hair loss and think that a PRP is going to solve the problem it's not going to work and so I would imagine orthopedics is pretty much the same if you have someone who needs surgery because there's some severe depletion of whatever I don't know if it's cartilage or something else you know that's not going to be gently fixed by a little bit of regenerative medicine you know they're gonna need surgery for that and that the PRP may not necessarily solve that issue so I think patient selection is a big is a big concern and as it is in hair loss and many other you know worlds of medicine so how so I mean you sort of alluded to it which is there's probably a sweet spot right where someone who's not experiencing any law but is trying to be prophylactic that that's way too early and someone who's already experienced the death of the follicle you're basically you know wasting time and money correct so well you're not wasting time and money if you have ongoing progressive hair loss right you may not reach your goal with PRP but it may help mitigate future loss just like the use of minoxidil and laser is not going to bring back that receding hairline but it's going to keep it from receding further or faster FairPoint yeah thank you so combination therapy there's again thinking about what we do in practice every single day in my office is part of the process is to prevent loss of the follicle function and enhance whatever follicles you have and then the other piece of the puzzle is to restore density to those areas which are too far gone so PR people has a role in that right a PRP has a role in preventing the loss of that follicle function it enhances those follicles that are weak kind of like what minoxidil or laser might do for up to up to a point right and and we would need to use that over time so tell the folks listening how PRP works I realize I'm sort of taking it for granted that people know what PRP stands for what it is how you harvest can you spend a minute just explaining if someone comes in your office and you decide that they're a good candidate for PRP tell me what the process is

[01:14:35] PRP stands for platelet-rich plasma and platelet-rich plasma is an otologist treatment that means it's derived from your own blood so in the office we're gonna take a sample of your blood and we're going to spin it in a centrifuge which essentially separates the formed components in the blood so red blood cells were way much more than platelets do or white blood cells and so when you spin a sample of the blood you can then separate the blood components based on their mass based on their weight and the reason why we want to do that is that platelets contain very powerful ingredients called growth factors and cytokines and their platelets are responsible for not only clotting blood like we've all learned in grade school but platelets are responsible for tissue regeneration and repair they're like the orchestrators of repair in the body if you get a paper cut platelets come to clot the blood and then they also orchestrate the repair of the skin in that area they're the first thing that kind of happened platelets get activated by that injury they release these powerful growth factors which may call into action wound healing cells it may call into action or recruit stem cells into the area they may then trigger other functions in the body like increasing a new blood vessel formation and so forth but what does all this have to do with hair so what we found is that anything that helps out with wound healing tends to have a nice positive effect on hair growth and so

[01:15:57] PRP was started in the States back maybe you know 15 years ago PRP into the scalp at least in our clinic we were using it as a wound healing treatment in conjunction with hair transplantation and we because I'm remember I'm a born and raised general surgeon we know that anytime you want to cut the skin you want to heal it and so hey by the way low-level laser therapy does that too but PRP was one of the first indications was for wound healing for chronic ulcers and and to accelerate healing in diabetics and so forth so as a wound healing treatment therapy works really really well and was around this time some of our physicians were also noticing that when they applied PRP for wound healing they were also reporting some improved hair growth and at first I think many of my colleagues were very skeptical about these early reports but we were using

[01:16:44] PRP as wound healing i junked i figured if we can get our patients heal a little bit more quickly that would be a good thing less downtime would get that get them back into their regular team more quickly after a hair transplant but we were noticing it as well we were seeing this improvement in hair growth let me ask ya silly question perhaps presumably you were using it on the donor sites because that's where the incisions are made or were you using it on their recipie and they like recipient site both I see because okay makes yeah we were using in both areas the recipient zones obviously the ones that are pretty much more visible at that time in the let's just call them in 2007 2006 and that's what really when we got started with PRP and our colleagues were also noticing that as I said before that there was some improvements in hair growth and so we started to apply it a little bit more aggressively in some of these patients and applying it into other areas of the scalp that we weren't transplanting and lo and behold colleagues and myself included we're noticing that there was some movements in the thickness and the caliber and the length of some of these miniaturized hairs what what size needle do you use to inject it so I use a 27 gauge half-inch basically RP no PRP is not painful because we use a complete local anesthetic block so we're gonna block the entire area that we're going to treat people say well of course at once the local anesthetic is in place you won't feel anything on your scalp offices that's how we do a hair transplant people often say oh my god it's so painful like even if you put the local anesthetic in that's going to be painful no it's not we have a Pro Knox device nitrous oxide delivery system it's on demand if you want to take a couple of puffs on the nitrous usually makes it 100% painless and to be honest 9 out of 10 patients say that it was dreamy when they had their treatment done so maybe should not be pain so that's a good point for people to know yeah I am amazed you can get it out of a 27-gauge needle like I thought it would have been too viscous to come out of that no platelets are tiny platelets are

[01:18:38] SuperDuper tiny hmm I mean we can look up the exact measurement but yeah come to think of it there I mean we are extremely small yeah yeah yeah the platelets are cell fragments that are smaller than red blood cells yeah so they're extremely tiny and just as a directional number not that you're counting when someone comes for a quote-unquote standard PRP therapy how many actual injections do you think they require in a typical treatment so most patients want to know how many needles are you gonna hit me with doc Yeah right so that's always the question of course as I said with local anesthetic applied appropriately applied painlessly you will feel none of my PRP going in so you will feel none of the 700 injections that are required well no I wasn't asking from a pain standpoint I know her from a bleeding stamp no but for your your listeners you need to know that they're not going to feel any of the 700 very very tiny injections how long does that take you it takes only about 10 minutes where how can you do 700 injections until actually my nurse practitioner and I tag-team the scalp and so we do you know half and half so but I you know my thumb is pretty strong

[01:19:45] Wow each injection gets how much volume a tenth of a CC it's pretty quick Wow to be honest I mean the whole treatment and procedure in the office is about an hour start to finish and most of that is honestly the preparation time of the PRP I have patients who are being treated in New York so they haven't they're not patients that you take care of of mine who have had excellent results with PRP and I know obviously our mutual patients have as well and and we've talked quite a bit about it is it your expectation once you've decided or you know once it's like obviously the persons that you know they're seeing in New York I mean there's lots of good people out there but once you're in the hands of someone who has a really good set of patient criteria selection are you pretty optimistic the PRP is gonna move the needle oh yeah I mean PRP works well how often does one need to be treated that way well that's a great question so everyone's a little bit different in terms of the power and strength of their

[01:20:37] PRP remember this is not coming out of a bottle this is coming out of your vein so if you come to my clinic and you have 150,000 platelets per microliter you make you have a different platelet concentration and somebody has 250,000 so stop your aspirin before you show up well it is a smart idea but remember that if you believe that the aspirin is simply just delaying the activation of the platelets I mean as a surgeon you know that all bleeding stops so you know eventually the platelets get activated so maybe you know I'm not so sure that that's such an important so we are used to remember how we used to give all those patients a ton of aspirin after splenectomy and stuff like that when they were getting these sort of the macrocytic or maybe it was the shape of their platelets that was changing I don't remember if it was the number of the shape but okay I don't remember yeah yeah but I'm not so you don't were you don't worry too much other I don't I really don't I really don't I want to know that I'm getting a good platelet concentrate so I'll do a CBC at the bedside I have a Coulter counter in the office unlike most physicians I have the devices a Beckman Coulter counter and we'll do a CBC on the whole blood that comes right out of the vein immediately right there right before we do any kind of spin after we do our this is called a proprietary protocol of spinning and separation and concentration of the platelets we'll do a final count on that we'll use a couple of microliters not much to get a final platelet count on what exactly we're going to be injecting so I can tell you if you come into my clinic exactly how many platelets we're gonna be injecting for you and I think that over the years having done about 4,000

[01:22:10] PRP injections I feel like we have a very very good handle on how platelet count affects the outcome so we're working on that day something as simple as someone shows up with 150,000 versus 400,000 presumably the more that they show up with the better yes and there's some good journal articles that describe the effect of platelet concentrate on these biologic processes that were interested in so physiologically we know that there's a dose curve as you increase the concentration of platelets for example on neovascularization there is a dose-dependent upward curve on that so the higher the platelet concentration the more new of vascularization you're going to get now there's a biphasic dose curve on stem cell mobilization so as you go up on the number of platelet concentrates there's a kind of a sweet spot that occurs and then if you go over that amount then it starts to dip downwards so what exactly is that concentration in both of those studies that I just said what what is that concentration supposed to be according to that data it says somewhere between 1.4 1.5 million platelets per microliter is that is where that sweet spot exists and what we're trying to show in the office is that that correlates also at the bedside to the clinical response tonight I mean I assume you're gathering those data you've done 4,000 of these so you have your own prospective series yes so what I can tell you is that I think that there's a strong correlation between the amount of platelets that you come to the table with and the amount that we can concentrate so obviously we have to maybe make some adjustments in our protocol if you are kind of low on platelets but you know again there's some other things that we may not necessarily be taking into account everybody has a different size and shape of platelets it let's say your platelets are low but they're very big we don't know what exactly do those platelets contain but again there's some data in the clinical literature that where we can correlate growth factor concentrations with platelet counts this sounds to me like it's something that's still in its infancy where absolutely I mean that sounds like the crudest of all metrics and it's probably an oversimplification for what's really going on and you know hopefully in ten years you have for an assay than just something as blunt as the CBC right you can measure some cytokine or you can measure some other functional property of the platelet it probably matters a heck of a lot more than the number right I mean look eventually maybe there'll be a bedside pcr where we can figure out exactly what what exactly those growth factors are that are doing their job you know inside but the other thing that

[01:24:42] I've learned over the years of doing those thousands and thousands of PRP treatments for nearly ten years is the importance of the white blood cells so the monocytes are a very very important component I think they're underappreciated and not only in the literature in terms of what they do in the body but especially in PRP and I'm a very strong proponent of the importance of monocytes in the final PRP and we say that our PRP is monocyte rich and I don't think that that's really a term that's caught on yet but I think that it will and monocyte rich PRP so you can obviously it's easy to pull the platelets out but when you're looking at leukocytes versus monocytes versus eosinophils you have a sensitive enough centrifuge to get that band so the way that we've been able to do that is through a dual spin process so the dual spin process for lack of a better way to explain it the first spin is kind of a gentle spin to take off the red blood cells we don't want red blood cells in our PRP red blood cells in the skin or extremely inflammatory when those red blood cells lyse the heme is extremely inflammatory and there's a lot of variance the iron would be devastating it's really bad so we don't want that in the skin if we can avoid it so I prefer to have PRP that has less than 1% hematocrit so the PRP may look pink in the syringe but it's a very very small amount of red blood cells now of course when you're trying to camp the platelets right to camp the buffy coat you're right up against those red blood cells so the first spin takes off a light the layer of red blood cells and leaves us with a plasma which contains the platelets so the plasma based spin which is the second spin then essentially pushes the platelets to the bottom so we've captured this maximum number of platelets we can take off the platelet poor plasma as much as we would like leaving us within a reconstituted amount of whatever we choose concentration and volume of PRP so that process that dual spin process and I haven't found another one that has been able to duplicate this consistently removes the red blood cells consistently gives me a very high concentrate of platelets and consistently gives me this bump or boost in monocytes and remind me about how many tubes of blood are you actually drawing out for the full treatment we take 60 CCS on treatment okay so 60

[01:27:09] CCS concentrates down to about seven and a half CCS of PRP Wow that's incredible and how many hours does it take what do you mean takes from the time you do that first prick of blood until you're in less than an hour they're walking out the door in an hour they're out the door in an hour man I obviously know very little about yes so when you come in now you'll see let's get to the meat of it which is the transplant so how do you think about you don't want to know how long the PRP lasts in my hands okay yeah come on this is really important because most dermatologists are spinning test tubes they're getting all two to three times concentrate they're not getting seven to eight times on the platelets they're missing all the monocytes and besides all of that they're booking their patients for every other month or every month treatment so the treatments that I just described to you that we do that proprietary protocol is essentially about once a year and so people say well you know you could claim five years you could claim six months well how do you know well we know because we measure so we know that 90% of our patients get a positive response from the PRP that lasts about ten to fourteen months and that there's a small percentage of patients maybe 5% that need it more often than that and then I have another small cohort of patients that can get away with it almost every two years and that's it and what's the percentage of patients that are not responding well everybody responds to some degree the question is they responding where they want so if someone comes in with a receding hairline they say hey I doc I really want PRP here the receding hairline if they're hoping for some regrowth chances are that they're not going to get too much action there because why we talked about that that there's just you know yeah in that area there's not enough trees in the garden so to speak when we are plants in the garden when we go to fertilize but the other zones that they didn't even realize we're thinning we're gonna get a 20 to 50 percent boost in volume in many of those areas that's pretty and when they're leaving obviously you're putting them on the regimen that is medical topical plus or minus laser could be any of the above or just one when many patients are doing mono therapy to start they don't want to do two three or four different things and then other patients come in and they want to do kitchen sink approach so it varies it varies on their motivation sometimes the beauty budget sometimes it's just their time effort and energy involved their you know their desire to you know and and their goals honestly some patients come and they say you know what if I just stay the same as I am right now I'm pretty happy you know the way I am right now if I stay the same I would be cool and so there may make a plan for that but then there are other patients that say hey you know we got it we want to turn the clock back and that's where the transplant comes in so is it more often the case that the patient says something to you that makes you say transplant is really the only option here or is that generally the inevitable path for most people once they start going down the treatment well

[01:29:57] I think we're so clear about what these treatments do that the patients will typically say hey you know in order to accomplish what I want to accomplish it sounds like we need to transplant so it's very much patient driven process my patient you know is our priority and we have a patient-centered practice so it becomes very very clear after spending the time with the patient for the patient under the patient knows what they going to need essentially so they may say well hey you know what I think

[01:30:22] I'm probably getting your hair transplant it's now is not the right time maybe it's gonna be next year let's see what we can get with the non-invasive therapies and I'm cool with that but if somebody comes in and says hey you know I really want to fix this hairline with PRP and laser I mean I have to be honest with them and so and show them with the microscope look man we can wish and we can hope and that's okay but you know wishing and hoping is not a strategy so let's go back to that first patient that you saw who had gone up to Toronto where did they go what was special in Toronto having grown up there

[01:30:48] I'm curious because I didn't think much was special in Toronto so what was the other than the shoulders clinic for hernia repair interesting that's very special yeah for sure so things that were happening in the early in the SI the mid-1990s where that surgeon hair surgeons were learning to use single follicle implants meaning that instead of a plug or punch or four millimeter biopsy of skin they were cutting down and dissecting or getting down to literally a one hair follicle graft and what that enables you to do if you angle and orient that appropriately in the right position in the scalp is to create a result that looks like Mother Nature made it make it look natural it's soft so you can't put them in a row you can't put them perpendicularly in the skin you have to angle them but there are ways to work with single follicle implants to make your end result look a hundred percent undetectable and that is why that gentleman traveled from New York to

[01:31:49] Toronto because there was a gentleman up there who was having doing that work and it was doctor Seeger at the time is the surgeon that was doing that works and he's since passed on but um he was doing that work with linear harvesting so that was the old style strip harvest and using microscopic magnification to dissect a hair follicles and then implant them in a way that would make the end result look natural and seems like well why wasn't everybody doing that well not every surgeon was using microscopes not every surgeon was using tiny grafts they were using either you know larger what they called micro mini grafts let's say or those punch grafts to create the density - comments there the first is so they were still doing a linear graft which means that these patients were having hair taken out with a big scar and presumably in the back of their head that's a comment and then the question is how in God's name do you take a strip of hair out of the back and isolate it by follicle with or without a microscope I'm just talking purely from the standpoint of patients like how many years does that take no no doesn't take years I'm being facetious but no I understand so there's a lot of labor right so though my training and my training happened in the 1990s there we took linear harvests on patients and we moved two to three thousand grafts single day for those patients and I did that early on in my practice as well from a linear harvest and the way that we did it was with labor we had surgical technicians working two three four five at a time under backlights or microscope stereoscopic magnification literally doing the bench work to process that tissue but this is all done sterile II it's done aseptic Lee you know okay so you can't sterilize the scalp it's a you know common good news the scalp is very much immune to severe infection it's just weird built that way much like the face so you said two to three thousand you could Harbor synods grafts and would that be like one strip that would be what how many centimeters long and how was the single strip could be you know depending on the size of the case could be ten to 20 centimeters long and a centimeter wide Wow so it's gonna go from ear to ear sand really around the back of your scalp and unfortunately for many of those patients they ended up with some wide scars even with techniques like I helped pioneer back with the linear harvesting Trico

[01:34:19] FIDIC techniques where we would actually overlap the closures to get hair to grow through the scar there's still a scar and the scar has not as much hair it's a little bit smooth sometimes it has a different type of color right than regular skin so even with short haircuts hairs growing through the scar can still be a scar then can be disfiguring and so

[01:34:38] I'm sure you remember in the field of general surgery there was a paradigm shift from open gallbladders to laparoscopic so that was happening in the nineteen mid 1990s so I was very much attuned to changes in surgical technique in surgical paradigms and when fue follicular unit extraction started to become kind of a chatter on the internet there were some guys in

[01:35:02] Australia doing it and and a few people here around the u.s. I wanted to really try to do that procedure and perfect it and so that led me down the road to adopt fue follicular unit extraction at a very very early stage of the game so I how about works so follicular unit extraction is the use of a very very tiny punch let's call it about a millimeter in the early days we use disposable punches or sharp that were used for punch biopsies but these were very very small items smaller than the tip of a ballpoint pen typically to harvest the individual follicular unit so those are the groups of one two or three hairs each out of the scalp so the graft comes out of the scalp basically ready and without a scalpel and without stitches now in the early days was very difficult

[01:35:50] I designed the first manual hand turned instrument available to physicians to be able to do this procedure it's called the Baumann min Dex and we were doing these procedures in a very very slow way they weren't very efficient they weren't very accurate but what we learned through many many years of time on tissue applying this kind of technique eventually we got to a point where it became a viable procedure and is the harvest scar such that it doesn't even require a closure or need a stitch no clothes no it's less than a millimeter it closes up 50% in 24 hours and it's the skin is totally clean within another day or two really what you would the only thing that you would see like on a shaved scalp is if you had think of think of your head of hair like five o'clock shadow is that you would see a little bit less shadow in those areas there's no visible linear scar so now you could move a lot of hair and not leave someone with a disfiguring scar in the back of their scalp it gives a much more flexibility in hair styling is it safe to say today that nobody is still doing large scars because even if I open up the magazines and the airplanes you I mean I feel like once it's in the airplane magazine it's no longer inside baseball you know they have the picture of the guy Stan you're looking at two guys from a head behind and there's the scar and there's the no scar is it safe to say like no one is having that type of a harvest any longer no it's actually not true at all many of the large national clinics that you see on late-night infomercials still do linear harvesting and many of my colleagues here in the US still prefer to do a linear harvest than fue so I want you to play skeptic devil's advocate for a moment why are they still doing it what is what are they saying is better about that approach than the approach you just described of single follicular extraction well you know probably some surgeons that are kind of stubborn yeah I'd like to think that in something where aesthetics play such a role it seems like kind of a no-brainer there must be some other explanation other than like foot put it this way if I'm a patient and I'm going to see somebody who's about to do a huge linear scar on my scalp and I say to that person why are you still doing it this way when the pictures in the airplane magazines say I should not have a star they're gonna say oh well we get a lot more hair this way it's a lot more efficient I don't have to buy any expensive equipment to do this I don't have to learn any new skills it seems like it's much less efficient because well I guess it depends how you define efficiency you can have you have more hands involved but presumably it can take less time is that what they mean by more efficient it definitely would take less time if you're doing a 3000-4000 graft procedure in your office with a strip and you have enough staff that could be much quicker than an fue procedure for sure so if you had a patient and you were I don't know if you'd do this but if you were gonna dedicate the entire day to that patient like it was a 1 you know quote-unquote a big case of the day how many follicular units can you harvest and implant so we've done very very large cases all in a single day but today we would really prefer to do anything over 2,000 grafts in two consecutive days we find it a lot more comfortable for the patient it's a lot more comfortable in the office for the staff and our harvest rates and our harvest quality is much much more improved than trying to do a marathon you know into the evening type of sessions so most of our patients if they're gonna do a large maximum as much as possible procedure they're gonna get let's call it around 3,500 to 4,000 grafts over 2 days and that's with a wide shave all the way around provided that they have the hair to do it mm-hmm you know and there are exceptions I mean we've done 5,000 grafts on some guys and you know sometimes we try to get 3,000 and we just can't even do it what is the greatest number of grafts even planted on a patient and I'll ask it two ways one harvesting only from their head and two harvesting from other sites on the body which I've never even heard of until you mentioned this a couple maybe six months ago we were talking about this and you mentioned that in one of these patients you'd actually harvested something from his bier oh yeah we have to do quite a bit of beard harvesting these days many of our patients have old-style scar tissue from either procedures that I did back in the early days you know in the early 2000s when we were still doing half of our work with the linear harvest technique you know and I'm not afraid to correct those cases and to you know update those cases into the latest and greatest possible situation that they could have so top numbers well you know my dad comes to mind he had almost 8,000 grafts he was totally bald before we started most guys were totally bald up the top meaning that they only have the hair around the sides in the back most of them will need somewhere around six to nine thousand grafts to kind of fill up the zones and do you have if someone is that bald do they have enough donor site on the on the remainder hair most of the time if they've never been harvested they do but if they've had some less efficient harvesting techniques then we may have to go to other places as you say alternative sources of donor like the beard or the body hair to satisfy that and I've never really thought about it but my beard hair actually it seems about the same thickness as my hair but no is beard hair thicker than here yes usually it is but everybody's different so some people have thicker beard hair than their scalp some people have thinner beard hair than their scalp some people have curly or coarser hair on their beard it seems to be most common so we're not going to put your beard at the frontal hairline typically it's gonna be used as filler in the back yeah and it works really well body hair seems less much less thick and robust than hair hair I mean scalp hair right again everybody's different I mean if you are person with very very thin fine hair on your scalp you may find that the other hair body hair is a better thicker than certain caliber but the problem is and this is just a general idea that as you get farther away from the scalp the follicles spend less time in the growing phase so again we're going back to this antigen catagen telogen sure sure the body hair doesn't really grow

[01:41:47] I mean it's so it spends less time in antigen but it also out of let's say ten follicles from the body the chest maybe only five of them are growing in any given time so it's kind of like hiring part-time workers in your factory you know you put you've hired ten people but only five of them are showing up a day you know that's not so good so the beard is pretty good there for a oh really good yeah because two kind of solves a lot of problems beard is good to fill in the scar too sometimes uh yeah that makes sense now for women is this year it's not gonna work yeah no this strikes me is a much easier problem in women because you have generally far less volume to cover and far greater ability to cover up donor sites right so women pose different problems than the men you know if you want to do a large session on a man you can say to most guys hey can we you know give you a pretty short haircut and they'll be like yeah okay no problem I mean I love that haircut but I'll do it for women that's not really gonna work so if you need to move a lot of hair for a female patient it needs to be done in steps and stages so there's a couple of ways to approach the donor area in women that would be like shaving a tiny little stripe so a little horizontal area where we're gonna take the individual follicles from right cuz we're not going to cut a strip we're gonna take the individual follicles that way or we may trim a couple of hairs here or let's say one out of every 10 or 20 hairs and then go after those hair follicles the next day so there's no shaving whatsoever nice way to handle that but you know you'd be surprised how many women have receding hairlines like their temples really with female pattern hair loss really go back as they aged 55 65 years old they can start to lose that feminine shape to the hairline you can really start to move backwards and that's the most common area that we transplant in women is the temples a part of the hairline a lot of women want to move their hairline they don't unhappy with the size and the shape of their forehead they want a hairline lowering procedure that doesn't involve cutting with a scalpel or stitches or a prolonged recovery or risk of invasive surgery and it's very easy to do transplantation to fix a high hairline and to bring the hairline down into what da Vinci would call the golden ratio which is one-third one-third one-third so what are the biggest risks of this procedure besides the obvious risks that we talk about in every surgery bleeding infection etc or you know is there anything that is unique to this surgical procedure as far as a risk sure well bleeding infection extremely rare thank goodness even though we're making thousands of little tiny sites in the scalp not only the harvesting and implantation part it's a pearly finish isn't bleeding is not an issue I mean just like if you cut yourself shaving or you got a paper cut you know in 20 30 seconds you stop infection your worst infection typically with the hair transplant might be a pimple to be honest and you maybe most people have one or two and we call it you know could be around the time when the hair start to kick in like an ingrown hair you kind of have to pop it like a pimple release the hair that may be caught at the level of the scalp and it's pretty rare maybe like you know one out of every 20 or 30 patients that has more than you know a half a dozen pimples or something where it needs something more significant in terms of wound care to kind of release those hair follicles maybe they have curly hair or something like that but I would say the main concern for hair is not the physical attributes of the procedure itself because we can recreate something with artistic bent you know we apply an artistic approach to the shape of the hairline the angle the orientation of position of the hairs the variation in terms of hair density to make it look normal and natural not a wall of hair straight density across the hairline the shape that builds into the sides of the temples the temporal point on the side of the scalp the angle and orientation is required for recreating a crown area but really the risk comes to that you're simply not happy with the result and so again it all comes down to the consultation process what exactly are you expecting out of this procedure and have we gone over exactly what we believe we can achieve because if I tell you you're gonna be a 10 out of 10 and the reality is that it's gonna always be a 5 out of 10 then I've promised you the wrong thing and you will be forever unhappy with that so we have to be very very clear about what's possible and what's not I can't put back a full head of dense hair for you but I can make you look like you have a full head of hair you know and I go back to my dad for example total total baldness for two decades or a hairpiece and all that the transplants that he has if you look at him today even 15 years later after his procedures it looks like he has a full head of hair but it's an illusion it looks like he's got full coverage you see the frame of his face you see that da Vinci golden ratio he looks 20 years younger than when he had his procedure but he never will have that density that he had as a teenager until we can figure out how to clone these babies that makes a lot of sense and I guess that as your practice continues to grow one of the greatest things that each patient is providing as a gift to a subsequent patient is a before and after photo that gives you a bigger and bigger database to show patients more closely I suspect what they can expect based on where they are because you've got just a greater basis from which you can say look I've got 27 patients who look almost identical to what you looked like here's the range of outcomes and if you're not comfortable with that range you're not gonna be a great candidate correct so after eight thousand surgeries I can tell you with very very good confidence what's possible and what's not and what it will take to get there and if the patient is all-in and he's gonna protect the existing hair we know that that's gonna add a lot of great benefit to the end result if he's lacks two days ago and he's losing in the other hair while we're transplanting this area other areas are being lost that's gonna be a much tougher battle so it's very much a team approach and my patients become very much drivers of the bus so to speak because in order to get the best results there has to be a good amount of buy-in in partnership with what we do and what we recommend I can tell you what kind of therapies and treatments and such that are gonna get keep your hair growing strong but you have to do that work when you take a hair off the side of the head or the back of the head in an area as a donor hair and hair that was never gonna fall out yeah and you put that hair back on the top is it susceptible to its nature or its nurture in other words is it now susceptible to the DHT forces that took out the hair that it's replacing or does it bring with it its genetic pattern from its donor site so the whole basis of the field of hair transplant surgery is based on the concept of donor dominance so that would mean and again it's the theory right of donor dominance meaning that the hair follicles from the sides in the back of the scalp which are virtually immune to the effects of DHT most guys with a total baldness problem never ever lose that hair that it will grow live and grow forever in its new location there are I would say very small numbers of scientific reports that kind of put a dent into that hmm so in these few and far between cases we believe that there is some recipient area control and and the way that I would explain that to patients is if remember we said how long the follicles stay in the growth phase has a lot to do with where those follicles come from well one of our more prominent researchers and colleagues in the field took a hair follicle from one place on his body and put it into another place and then move that follicle someplace else and track those lengths of time that it's spent in the growing phase it tracked the antigen the low of the growth phase and so what you would expect initially is that wherever you took it from like let's say the chest it grew for an inch and that's it you put it in the back of your arm should grow or back of your hand it should grow for an inch well it didn't it grew differently in those different locations so there is some local effect so what we do say and especially true for women where sometimes they can have a more a diffuse hair loss problem right because maybe not necessarily all androgen independent that we say that those hairs are relatively permanent assuming they're ever done the experiment where you take a hair and implant it in an area that has zero hair like the palm or of course yes in fact they did that for someone have you ever heard of nulls from YouTube No so nulls from YouTube is a prankster I'm sure he wouldn't be upset with me sharing with you and your listeners that he had some hair follicles implanted into the palm of his hand during his last hair transplant procedure and it grew fine

[01:50:20] Wow so that is from a just from a pure biology standpoint that is really amazing no it's not because listen the hair follicle is an organ it's a self determining organ if you have a scar which doesn't make any hair on its own you can cut that scar it's gonna bleed right you throw a hair follicle in there it will survive it will grow it will thrive well there must be something very unique about parts of our body that don't grow any hair that I don't know I guess I mean I look I don't think about this obviously very much but it would just it just strikes me as counterintuitive if this were an exam and you asked me that question I would guess that if you implanted the most robust hair into an area that otherwise would never grow hair it wouldn't have the fertile enough soil to promote it no anywhere that you have a blood flow it will grow because all it needs is energy it needs the oxygen it needs the nutrients the hair follicle you if you have a non-healing wound on the side of your leg you know diabetic ulcer you can implant follicles into that area and those follicles are so metabolically active that they will actually secrete the growth factors demand more blood flow and vascular neurogenesis will occur and he wound healing will be accelerated and enhanced by placing hair follicles into that non-healing wound it's incredible the hair follicle cell population the population of cells within the hair follicle are among the most highest leve highest metabolically active cell populations in your body it's one of the reasons why chemotherapy knocks them out as well as the lining of your gut in bone marrow right I mean if you got your bone your hair those are some of the most highly metabolic and metabolically active cell populations that we have and so they continue to work and grind away to grow on your head a full head of hair right 150,000 hair follicles will produce somewhere around 1,500 feet of hair a day that's interesting did you say how many how many hairs on the head so you're born with about a hundred to 150,000 and it's amazing that you said you could take someone who is completely bald and through very strategic placement using only ten thousand hairs say no I said ten thousand grafts graph could be two to three hairs correct got it okay

[01:52:32] I don't know again we're not going to recapitulate you're a teenager hairline you know age appropriate matters right so the recession of the hairline that's gonna look normal and natural there that's where of some of the nuances right and the discussion between our patients who are maybe in their 20s who want to look like they did in their teenage years versus patients who may be a little bit more mature and there's their 40s so we're the idea is to design something that looks normal and natural as they go through the process well Alan this is super interesting I suspect that there gonna be a lot of people who listen to this who are going to potentially revisit assumptions that they've had on this entire topic I I'm actually surprised at how often you know a patient asks me a question about the and obviously I just don't know much I mean all I've learned over the years is to find people like you who I can send them to but I think what surprised me the most in this discussion is how far this field has come in what seems like a decade and a half basically yeah I mean it's it's incredible this is the most fast-moving field I mean it's incredible how quickly things have changed in hair transplantation from you know whether it be linear harvesting to follicular unit extraction to the use of cellular therapy you know PRP and and other things like low-level laser therapy and compound of medications to attack the hair follicle and from all sides and all different ways and all different modalities to help our patients really grow better hair and look great and feel great I mean that's what it's all about right it comes down to the emotion when you look in the mirror and you see that hairline growing back in you know patient after patient they say this is amazing this is a miracle this is like I never thought I would see my hairline again I never thought I'd cover that bald spot except with a hat I mean that's the exciting thing that keeps me going every day oh thank you very much I appreciate the the input and I hope that anyone listening to this who's had some questions about this has got some of those answered great well great to be here with you you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog at Peter Tiye MD com maybe the simplest thing to do is to sign up for my subjective lean on lame once a week email where I'll update you on what
