## Description

In this episode, Damon Hill, 1996 Formula 1 World Champion, opens up about his personal struggles with depression, feelings of inadequacy, loss of identity, and his ultimate path to healing following his remarkable racing career. Damon’s life was given a tragic jolt at 15 years of age when his father and legendary F1 driver Graham Hill died suddenly—the common string that ties together so much of his life and has forged so much of who he is to this day. We discuss Damon’s unique and remarkable racing career including his legendary battles with Michael Schumacher as well as Damon’s firsthand account of what happened that tragic day on May 1st, 1994, when his teammate, Ayrton Senna, died at Imola. But this is not just about racing; rather it’s a human story that’s cloaked in a racing one.

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic

[00:01:04] I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming

[00:01:23] I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our show's members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:28] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription my guest this week is Damon Hill

[00:04:13] Damon is the 1996 Formula One world champion and even by the standards of Formula One world champions Damon's career was incredibly interesting and took place during a brief but intense to mulch period in Formula One he was Ayrton Senna's teammate during the tragic year in which Santa's life was lost and he went on to have legendary battles with

[00:04:36] Michael Schumacher now you might be thinking if you're not a Formula one fan or a racing fan why would you listen to this episode well I want to address that up front and say that this is really not an episode about driving basically the driving the racing all of that is really a substrate or a vehicle through which we discuss the journey of Damon's life which was given a tragic jolt when he was 15 years old and his father the legendary Graham Hill two-time Formula

[00:05:05] One world champion died in a plane crash that he was flying and I think it becomes very clear when you read Damon's incredible autobiography watching the wheels which I can't recommend highly enough how much of an impact that had on Damon something that to this day it's clear has still shaped and forged so much of who he is he's very open in this biography about his depression and it was when I read his book for the first time about a year ago that I realized I just had to interview Damon and this interview did not disappoint he was incredibly open incredibly forthright about the struggles that he has had the inadequacies that he has felt and the journey that he's been on to basically break the cycle that he felt he would have passed on to his kids had he not figured this out of course we do talk quite a bit about racing and we go into great detail and I think that in many ways Damon's account of what happened that tragic day on May 1st 1994 when I

[00:06:05] Arkansan I died at mlah is probably the best account you will ever read in fact I make the point to Damon that it's really his book and his account of it that probably changed my mind about the events of that day I could go on much longer about what we discussed in this episode but I think this is one of those ones where you just have to sort of take my word for it and listen to it again if you're not a racing fan I don't think it matters this is really not a racing story it's a human story that's cloaked in a racing story and of course if you have any interest in motor sport especially f1 I think the the nuance and detail his career will be illuminating so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with Damon Damon thank you so much for making time on what is obviously a very busy weekend for you it's not busy I'm not actually working for sky which is my usual job so I would have to be normally in quite early but

[00:07:02] I'm working for f1 on my promotional basis so I get a little bit of extra leeway so I said but even so you hit the ground running when you're in Formula One I'm just come from a promotional event for thought for Formula One and then journalists want to talk to me because there's Lewis is probably going to stitch up his six world title so they want to know what other world champions are think of Lewis's performance so you have quite a few other various things you get involved with well I'm gonna resist every urge to go down that path which I would love to go down and talk about all the nuances of the current day the grid versus you know your air and stuff but we'll get to that in time I honestly just want to start by saying something which is your book is incredible and I can't recommend it highly enough to everyone so your autobiography watching wheels which came out three years ago is kind of one of these books that's sort of about racing but sort of not first of all thank you very much for saying that about the book

[00:07:59] I'm very pleased I wrote it and I'm pleased because it's reached people who have experienced maybe they've been experiencing depression in some way or they've they've had some difficulty in their life and I just wanted to make it clear that you know it's never paint plain sailing if you if achieve success in sport ory cheeks to achieve success in the world a lot of people like to gloss over the difficult bits just and I didn't want to make it sound like it was harder than it was to race but I couldn't ignore the fact that I'd been through an experience and part and parcel of my experiences of racing driver was wrapped up with my emotional life and having to dealt with the fact that my dad was a racing driver and then he died when I was 15 and then I became a racing driver and it seemed to me very muddled up so I couldn't just sit down and write a book about how I became a world champion because actually where does the motivation for that come from and how do you differentiate that between my motivation and my dad's motivation and how much of it was to do with wanting to do something for the family name and how much of it is purely yourself so how the hell do you untangle this stuff and I think a lot of people also go through these questions it's a normal thing to do it is really not so much that you're a Formula One world champion in fact that is a very small chapter of a book of a long book it's about a 360 page book and there is literally one chapter devoted to the 1996 season what's amazing to me is the sort of the degree of introspection that comes into this level of examination and the things that you tie back and forth and back and forth which hopefully as we get into this discussion I'll remember some of those things but it would be hard for people listening to this who don't know much about you to go anywhere to begin other than to start with November 1975

[00:10:01] I'll give a little bit of background just for folks but only for the sake of time but I'd like you to spend as much time as possible explaining your father's a legend I remember when I was watching old Formula One videos with my with my wife and the first time she saw Graham Hill she was sort of like wow that's like a really good looking movie star and I said yeah yeah he looks like a movie star but you realize like he's a Formula

[00:10:27] One driver in fact he's the only person to have won the Triple Crown of motor racing which of course prompts the what is that you know then I get to explain there's two ways you could technically win this and he wanted both ways maybe just tell people a little bit about who your dad was and why he was so significant to the sport of motor racing what he was as you say and in the sport a legend achievements wise but I think also charismatic Lee and also in terms of being playing up to the role of how the public expected him to be and reveling also in being that person I think he got to know himself because the seriously when my mum first met him she said he was very quiet and very shy and you know not the person that we got we got to know eventually is a star of the sport and also someone who was very well known as a great raconteur a great after didn't speak someone who dressed impeccably he had all his shirts made in

[00:11:27] Savile Row and his ties and he was like not a hair out of place the moustache the sight I mean just hey I'm the mustache right the moustache or moustache yeah various ways of pronouncing it Benny where you come from but he would ya trim it and you know - you know millimeter perfect and that was his trademark because in the in the early days they didn't have a closed face crash helmet so you could see the guy's face and their him there it was this guy with that you know the wacky races you got Dick

[00:11:57] Dastardly and you got you know all the stereotypes of that type you know you have David Niven was very suave with a pencil mustache and they'll say Errol Flynn and so he was kind of in this mold if you like I don't know what whether he was trying to be that person but he certainly it didn't have to pretend to be anyone else he he had the attributes to be that person and I think he loved he loved being that person and so he created interest in himself as a person out off the track and I think he was a lover of life he loved meeting people he loved communicating and he loved finding out about everything every aspect of life in every different strata Society and yeah he went at it in the 100% what is your earliest memory of him so you were born in 6166 September 16 he won his first Formula One title in 62 if I'm not mistaken there are lots of pictures of you as a kid around I don't remember that yeah of course I spent the legends of the sport right I mean so that if you go on Google and you go Damon Hill and there's a photograph up there at my christening with Bruce McLaren Stirling

[00:13:11] Moss my godfather Jeb Bonnie a taffy von trips is there my dad's there Tony Brooks is there it all came to my christening so it's on my level I grew up in that that was his world and when do I remember that what was the first thing I remember it's very very difficult to pinpoint it I can't because I would have been taken as a very young child to race events and I probably didn't didn't even know what was going on I probably heard the noise and that's about it but I think it becomes apparent when you go to school when you go for the first time you meet kids who have heard of your dad and you haven't in a way you know you can't do that who you're talking about and then you become yeah and actually the teachers are very conscious so I think you picked that up that there's something unusual about your dad and then you start to look at the world through a different prism by the way it was Jim Clark in that photo yes yes how could we have forgotten Jim Clark yeah which speaks to another interesting point of your dad's era which is how many of those guys died in a car and I think I've talked about this poor on the podcast probably my favorite documentary on all of f1 is called one I think it was came out about five or six years ago yeah I remember that one it is just such a beautiful depiction of those transitions in that era that your father lived through the Jackie Stewart lived through that these guys lived through hmm it is kind of a miracle that they came out alive it is statistically I think they knew that they had if there were 26 drivers in those days on the grid some years it wasn't unusual for them to lose - and that's like twelve to one chance of surviving and then you start stacking that year on year year on year I mean when my dad did Indianapolis in 1966 two years before that two guys were killed in the race and they carried on racing it was some 964 s it's just terrific and he just you know so two years later he's doing the race I mean he said he would have known the history of a race and he had got that he wasn't going to be cowled attitude I think that they had I sort of put forward the theory and I don't think it's anything he's not my personal theory but I think it's quite well understood that if you were born during the war era and you grew up during the war and my dad would have just missed active service he'd had to do national service after their school but he would have grown up knowing that guys just a bit older than you would have been flying Spitfires or bombers or going going fighting the Germans and risking their lives for everything and you wouldn't people were not expected to make a big deal of that so driving racing car was seen as jolly Jake's you know seen as in a lot of fun and you got paid and you could get killed but you know it's better than having to go and get shot at with a cat guns it was such a different era and I was actually for totally unrelated reasons talking with my driving coach today about something and I mentioned that I was gonna be speaking with you today and he said you know I wonder what his thoughts are on the following so he was telling me about how when he was doing 24 Hours of

[00:16:26] Daytona a few years ago during the race prep one of the organizers said to all the drivers he said look guys you all are young enough that you don't know what it was like when your probability of dying here was very high but I want you to pretend for a moment that it is that dangerous and act accordingly to the other drivers and and what he was really getting at was in the era that your father raced in there was a bit more of a gentlemanly approach to racing well I think it was you could describe it as I think it was a respect for the other competitor because you knew that person was prepared to take the chance of being a racing driver and accept the risks that ensued but I didn't mean they liked it at all it was awful for them it was it was dreadful and I think Jackie Stewart made it very clear in his book that going to a guys funeral and seen the family every other week or whatever twice a year or you know of guys who race against they must have felt slightly responsible themselves so I think the gentlemen thing was is more appreciation that they didn't want to be the guy responsible for losing someone else's life and I think that is that was quite strong in that in their day it's interesting you bring up Jackie Stewart of course who retired after 99 not 100

[00:17:45] Grand Prix's even though he had one more in a season and he set that out after a severe died his teammate that's interesting because it'll kind of come back to your retirement in a way which was drawing a line in the sand and saying at this moment I don't have the desire to do this anymore even though you guys were separated by by decades it's still interesting to me it still was dangerous when I was doing it don't forget you know it was known a few years after Ayrton was killed that I was still racing so I think the risk fact you are rolling the dice you know that the more times you do this that chances of something going wrong increase and the comparison has often been drawn to two gamblers but of course in accounting you lose money don't necessarily get paralyzed or killed or burn to death I am interested in this issue of humans being able to put danger to the back of their mind and we recently watched the amazing El Capitan film free solo I mean it's uncomfortable to watch in the documentary that anyone hasn't seen it they have to see it yeah listen closely because this and I forget the guys name terrible remembering names but this very interesting character who pulls it off he is described and is sort of described himself as a bit of an oddball they go into his background his family upbringing and reasons why he might have had difficult upbringing and maybe was was that a reason for him taking these risks in an effort to identify himself or impress his mother or show off in some way or what is it what was the motivation for doing this incredibly dangerous thing but whatever way you cut it he managed to put fear in the back of his mind you could not have done what he did without being able to go okay I'm gonna put the palpable tangible fear we all could identify watching this documentary this guy clinging to the side of a rock with nothing to help me it's just terrifying to watch it but he managed to do it with the good sort of you and Sid all the drivers of year but let's think about this let's think about

[00:20:00] Imola and 90 four and let's not even think about em Allah let's think about Monica the next race I mean it had been 12 years since film have died and then in one weekend you see three of the most devastating things it's only a miracle Ruben didn't die right but Ratzenberger dies Senna dies in your car and then Monica and vending huh yeah exactly so it's impossible to say that you were getting in a car thinking you're I mean no you're immune but I mean this is about as dangerous a time as ever to be an f1 yeah it was there was a freaking Lee high incidence of accidents that meant that driver got hurt so suddenly was raining I think

[00:20:42] Niki Lauda described it perfectly said you know that God had had his hand on f1 for this time and no he just took it off you know and and that seemed to be what it was it was like okay brakes are off guys you know you've had a good run and now we need to rebalance the odds and it was just happening one weekend after the other even in testing as well and you know he had people I paid real armies accident and actually before that even

[00:21:05] Johnny Herbert wasn't killed and Martin Donnelly who was my teammate Informer 3 and he got killed and in herethe and so so did you I mean when you were in that car were you what were you blocking out of your mind the possibility that it would be me I guess I don't know you just you know it's there but it makes you concentrate better see if something goes wrong with the car there's nothing you can do about that but if you make an error then you pay the price in this your fault so you you know you do concentrate a lot harder and you know that the risk of injury is great well before we come back to that let's go and finish the story again for folks who aren't familiar with with your father it all changes November of 1975 November 29th if I recall the date I think the way you describe it in the book is really really difficult to read truthfully because you don't gloss over the little details of the night you're watching TV with your sister your mom is in the other room and you hear something on the TV yeah and I think what it what it tells me and what I'm hopefully I'm telling also connecting with other people who've had similar experiences but you know we don't get over things like that it's the worst thing that you can imagine happening I'd like to think that you know I think a lot of therapy is about people getting over those experiences but I don't think you can possibly ever unremember the emotions what you can do is you can recognize that those emotions had a relevance there and then at that time and if you've locked them away and haven't revisited them and kind of exorcise them then they come back to you in other situations when you're not conscious of why you're feeling those those emotions at that time so they can be reduced in that way but if I want to go back to that moment right now I will get the same sensations that I had back then and I don't want to put you through that I can feel it in reading the words let alone hearing you say them but for folks listening I mean you know your father was in a plane crash and one of the things that stood out and reading it was how vividly remember your mom screaming that strikes me as like incredibly palpable everything that you just said a moment ago about the challenge in processing that and all those things how old were you when you finally realize that was the case that those are unresolved issues that can't just be forgotten yeah I think not until

[00:23:51] I stopped couple years after I stopped racing I think what's one of the issues as I just mentioned before is that your mind you know who am I am i different to my dad because if I'm different to my dad I have to live longer than him that was 42 and he died when his 46 you know so there's a anxiety in creeping anxiety that comes with this you know you're following a pattern and you don't want to follow a pattern because it's a bad pattern to get into so you have to differentiate that you have to change course somewhere that was one of the big pressures for me as a driver was I had family I didn't want to put them through what a fam had gone through you talked about that on a couple of occasions in the book which was and I don't know if it was deliberate but you keep making the point you weren't afraid of dying for the sake of your life but you were very afraid of it for what they would go through because obviously you'd experienced it yeah I think I would I mean if it would be at all possible to be angry with oneself if one don't want to do that but at the same time in humans in all kinds of situations whether they're in the military or they are in the emergency services or they do some other job that we as adults put ourselves in the firing line somewhere at some point and our children and maybe are too young to appreciate that but when they become older they look they will also see that there is a we can't go through life in cotton wool you know we we have things we have to do as humans to fulfill ourselves I would hope that by taking chances I mean when I say taking chances

[00:25:38] I mean calculated chances that that have a benefit somewhere somehow that my children would also not be afraid of doing those things so speaking of fear I can't imagine what it's like for your mom to lose her husband when she has three young kids teenagers I guess yeah your sisters would have been a teenagers as well at the time right yeah my eldest sister was 16 but my younger sister was only about 11 and you're already at this point into motorcycles yep the fun riding in in in the fields and in the woods on on small motorbikes and golf road bikes I hadn't got a road license then so it's kind of amazing to me that you didn't have a karting background you were by your own admission very late to auto racing that you could be as successful as you've gone on to be I think just to sort of move the story along a little bit let's go to when you decide you want to be an auto racer well I wanted to race bikes from quite a young age I was impressed by a friend of might where my dad died a friend of my dad's who was a

[00:26:51] Peter Giffen actually was a loser he actually raced for my dad but he was a foreman one driver and he took me and a friend of mine down to Brands Hatch not long after my dad had died just because he knew I liked motorcycle racing why don't you come and have a look at these bikes going round brass outside and I've never seen anything like it in my life you know and I've been to so many former won races literally sitting there yawning as you know Jim the jack is

[00:27:16] Jackie Stewart goes and wins another race you know it was like he's to go party we used to go and spend us any of our summer holidays we go to the Monza and we'd be parked up in some grandstand somewhere my dad went and raced and we'd literally sit there and Jackie Stewart would go past and then about a half a minute later everyone else would go past and they would go on for two hours you were going you know it wasn't didn't do it for me a car is that because the driver isn't using his body in a car he's using his body on a motorcycle I really I think that's a big part of it I think I as I mentioned before I kind of liked sports where I you're the projectile

[00:27:56] I'm the projectile but I'm also the the Acrobat you know and I think that it's very difficult to see that in car racing I think that's one of our big problems with with Y you know with people appreciating the current crop of former One drivers they might appreciate it when they're watching the race in the wet and you know sometimes you can see the speed and sometimes you can see their reactions but not nearly as clearly as you can when you watch a ski or you watch a surfer or you watch a guy on a motor T P bike it's abundantly clear that they are controlling the vehicle and I think that happened to me so I went to bike race and I saw these bikes go past and I just couldn't believe there was a guy sitting on the bike doing that sort of speed into and having ridden a bike myself I just thought what me do that you know one of those dumb moments you just you can't think straight being just seen his like the smell of the bikes like the noise of the engines you like the whole thing so that was my ambition to go by tracing and my mum was he was just about to say what was your mom's reaction well can you imagine I mean to me it was seemed like a time ago but actually it was only three years or four years ago since my dad died which is nothing in terms of those things so I go mum do you mind if I you know race bikes and to her eternal credit and bless her you know she recognized the situation which was that my dad had raced how could she deny me her own son the opportunity of doing something that and she had admired my dad for his bravery and skill as a racing driver as well so here was her son only few years after the tragedy coming the same do you mind if I have a go at racing bikes and she said I don't mind I think she took a deep breath but she said I don't mind you doing yet but as long as you do it properly I don't know what that means go as fast as you can don't get hurt but yeah I think that's but she knew there was no way you can stop guys and girls from doing these things so she let me do it and I mean she never said no you're not thinking which is not the case with some drivers and Jackie

[00:30:03] Stewart being one his mother never spoke to him because he raced behind her back she told him you're not to go racing and he did and then when he retired he phoned her and said I'm for retired and she said you're best off out of it that was the end of that she didn't actually ever say a well done or winning three

[00:30:18] World Championships as far as I know she just was a bit still cross within fur Wow so how did you make the transition from racing motorcycles to racing cars and given the fact that you didn't have this long lineage of karting that most of your peers had do you still think there's something about the motorcycle that gave you an advantage that they were missing no I would have been much better for done karting I mean that would be the right route to take I had to unlearn stuff and then had to I think particularly you learn stuff in karting about racing which I had not learned caught before we were racing and the tactics they employ and I'm thinking clearly that someone like Michael

[00:30:58] Schumacher and people like Johnny Herbert they were used to these guys putting their car inside the inside and chopping you up and that stuff in by tracing you don't they don't do that they do it the bit more now mm-hmm but in my day they didn't do that sort of thing because you'd go down both go down you know so it wasn't quite the same IIT bargee in by tracing it was more of a clean pass each time but so why did you decide to make that transition well I enjoyed by racing I've done okay but I've had a bit of a didn't really pick it up properly and then I had to go back to the beginning and start racing a club racing and I thought well I still love doing it so I was basically failing I've bitten off more than I could chew and I wasn't making any progress so I had to decide whether

[00:31:47] I stopped or whether I carried on I thought well I'm gonna do it because I enjoy it so literally border bike ran it myself on my own budget and went to Brands Hatch and I started winning things and about the same time but this is happening to us about 1983-84 okay I started winning these bike races and then somebody about the same time had said because they knew I'd race bikes and I don't think my mum my mum must have said well he's not doing very well and it's not it's not really happening and he said we should get him to have a go on a car so she says to me one day a friend of mine said you can have a go at his car he runs a race school in France it's called the Winfield school and it's might not name was Mike night and he'd offered you a a go and I said well I'm not I haven't got the money to do it and

[00:32:31] I'm not spending any money I spend on my bikes for don't worry they'll they'll you know let you have a go for nothing so I thought well if someone's gonna let me drive their car for nothing and I'm gonna go for a weekend in France for just for a bit of laughs then I'll do it so I turned up absolutely no I did no real interest or plan to do it I just did it so that for the crack as you

[00:32:53] Irish say and I did quite well what kind of car it was a formal Renault mm yeah I think so yeah yeah and a school car it's the same school that Frost and tombe and all the French driver Lafitte had been to and one of the things they had which was all sort of attractive to me was fully paid if you did well if you won the school scholarship you get to sponsored to to compete in France in a championship and they'd pay for it no elf would pay for it and I was absolutely rubbish I'm not a commercial person I was absolutely hopeless of getting sponsorship so I was always short of cash and so I thought I want to talk about Sega later on 10 years so I literally was a pragmatic decision I just thought well this is it doesn't be going anywhere the car racing the bike racing thing is struggling but just at that time I started winning everything on bikes I started to found the neck and just recently a friend of mine gave me some DVD that someone had put together of some sad person that stood by the side of the track at Brands Hatch and videotaped everything in those days it was a video camera and they put together a DVD and I was watching myself before I came out here actually of my by tracing had never even seen it before and quite good on a bike and I was and I want everything I literally want everything I did that season but it happened just the time that the car racing thing was starting to take off so I had to make a decision at the end okay okay am I going to really seriously be able to do this as a career by tracing what am I gonna what would the economics of motorcycle racing at at that time I could do a season you know for a cup of grant on my bike what could you make could you say no no wouldn't win anything no I mean if I went to national level you could you know I think some of the races had 10,000 pounds prize money I'll say buddy it was that or Grand Prix racing and the only real guy who made any money was Barry Sheene you know there was just very few people really moaning and living if you wanted to go and do the Isle of Man and risk your life and you could earn a bit more money but it seemed to be a poor equation I'm just gonna pause for a moment for the listener in the show notes we're absolutely at this moment going to link to the Isle of Man TT if you have any interest in understanding what we're talking about you must watch this or you can just go to youtube and search Isle of Man TT as in Time Trial and you're gonna watch something that you will think is being played and fast-forward it is not and Damen I still don't know who has it more dangerous there the spectator or the guy on the motorcycle it is the craziest thing I've ever seen yet I can't stop watching it you

[00:35:32] I think a lot of people feel that about it I think they feel they have mixed emotions I've been there to watch I haven't been to the main event but I've been to the classic TV TT and they have guys going just as fast and you have mixed emotions about it you're watching this meeting oh no please don't do that you know because it looks so dangerous but it also is awesomely impressive and

[00:35:52] I've been around the idea that a man on a bike myself and I've gone oh this is this is kind of there's a kind of spooky thing during you on to go faster it's very seductive racetrack was there any point in here Damon is you're wrestling with this to be the motorcycle guy to be the car guy was anything the back of your mind coming through you at the lens of your father and wanting to either emulate him or go in an orthogonal direction to him was that at all part of your conscious mind at least I think there's something fundamentally genetically there must be something in the genes to make you want to do this thing which he must have had because the he talks about the first time he ever drove a racing car and he knew immediately he caused a light bulb moment you know it was just seen you immediately he wanted to do that and that was the first time I got on a motorbike I turned the twist grip and it was like part of my brain just lit up and my grandma rode a motorbike my granddad never even drove a car so my dad's dad never even drove a car so where did he get it from well he must have got it from his his mom from his mom and they now with epigenetics and so forth they can kind of show that patterns of experiences seem to be passed through the genes so it's quite possible that something came through that side but for whatever reason I hadn't instinctively got what it took clearly to drive a car or racer bike but the motivation to do it I think was also to get to know my dad in the way in the sense that I was doing something he did and then you have some wherever relating to him even though he wasn't there but was he ever not there is he still here now I mean we started off talking about my dad you know you're revoking his image you're revoking his he's not even when I just went like that just then that said like my dad that was really you know it's a it's a very hard thing to differentiate yourself from your parents and I don't necessarily believe it's possible to be a completely an individual I think consciously you can say okay this is what I want to do

[00:38:05] I'm doing something different to the microwave I'm Paris I know they would disapprove of that or that's not their thing but I like it so that's a differentiation that's a that's a genuine thing but they're still there are they influencing somehow somewhere it's interesting that you say that I still think this idea that driving to get to know him is kind of a it's one thing to reflect on that I just wonder if at the time you could have even consciously articulated that or if that's just part of this incredible journey of introspection that you've been on through your career but especially afterwards yeah there were some parallels that have been drawn I think I might throw them in the book which is that when my dad was racing he lost his teammate Jim Clark and then he went on to become world champion in 68 and so in some senses you know my experience with being teammates to

[00:38:58] Ayrton and then you lose your teammate and then the team is kind of looking for a new direction and you kind of carry the the banner you you pick up the banner and try and try to get back to what we were there to do in the first place which was win I feel like I've been through similar experiences but my dad was you know I had extraordinary ability to cope with tragedy he he actually organized the race team when the Hockenheim with Jim Clark when he died and the guys didn't really know what to do and he got it all together and helped them and I heard recently um

[00:39:33] Emerson Fittipaldi talking about having it next and once my dad was there with Jeremy Rees organizing his extraction from the car and you know my dad was a very practical and you know in that way courageous person I'm exposed in some ways I'm glad I didn't have to go to some of the things he went through but to be an adult you ultimately have to be able to cope with the appearances that adults deal with you know that's that's not always the nice stuff so how do you manage to get into the Williams car I know you've heard the story before it's pretty funny how I think Martin Brundle was probably ahead of you in line to at least get the test spot right yeah and then did did he go and take the spot at McLaren or what there's two drivers very similar names mark Blundell who was the test driver Oh blundell that's right is Martin Brundle who's currently was actually actively racing but mark was the test driver at

[00:40:28] Williams then he went to McLaren so there was a slot available at Williams and so I went to William this was 92 91 actually so ended 90 I went became the Williams test driver in 91 92 are still there test driver Mark had moved on to McLaren they eventually became a McLaren driver but when the end of 92 arrived and Nigel had left that's right so Nigel won in 92 and then promptly retired to go to IndyCar but yeah but not till very late in the day so Frank had let ruk out of a Trey's ego because he thought that he'd keep Nigel and he'd already signed

[00:41:04] Alain Prost and when Nigel found out that he'd signed Adam Frost he set up yeah I think he decided he was gonna do Indy car was the implication and Nigel would be number two - Prost being one I don't think I think he'd already been with a Lane in Ferrari and I think he didn't want to be sharing a team without him so it may have been that he didn't attract a deal from Indy I don't know but then in whichever way it happened there was a space left Williams that

[00:41:31] Frank had really kind of not managed to fill because everyone else had been signed up so regarded wanted to come back from Benetton but they wouldn't let him go and so I was the guy there who knew how to so this is for the 93 C's for the 93 season and you had spent much of the 92 season basically learning the ropes on this active suspension car let's pause for a moment for people who aren't steeped in Formula One to explain what a technical step forward the active suspension car of 93 was some people describe that car the FW 15 as the most advanced car in the history of Formula

[00:42:08] One for its I'm being the Senna fan that I am I still favor the mp4 for as the greatest car of all Formula One but the case could be made for the FW 15 what is active suspension mean how would you explain that to somebody okay so it's a ride height control so why is right height important so it's the distance the car is is held off the ground lower center gravity is a good thing if you're very half the ground then you get a lot of roll moment on the suspension which the drivers don't like they can't change direction that quickly but the main reason is aerodynamic so they found just after they banned tunnels and ground effect cars they went to flat bottomed cars which they thought would eradicate the dangers of having too much downforce on the car but what the engineers did eventually was sure enough they found a way of making the flat bottom of the car work to create more sanatoria suck onto the ground and the closer you can get it and the more you can control the gap the more effective it is so active suspension is a clear advantage over passive suspension for the very simple reason that when a car is loaded it squashes the springs and it gets closer to the ground so it means a lot of the time the car is not at the optimum ride height it has two rides back up again on the springs when the car slows down so you get this variance in ride height if you can keep the car at the optimum fast or slow then you've got a huge advantage that's what active suspension was there to do but it had a lot of other interesting side effects in that you can then you can change the attitude of the car all the time so you could even stall the diffuser on the straight so you could lower the back above certain speed

[00:43:55] I just love it I mean you talked about this so you could play with it a lot we tried also things like making it roll into a corner so we'd have stagger on it and which they using Indy cars so if the corner goes right you'd make the left side of the car pop up a bit in the car would lean into the corner like a motor play yeah it's just unbelievable so do you remember in 92 when you were testing these features out in anticipation of the 93 season not actually knowing that you would be the driver yeah I

[00:44:21] I'd be the driver I knew that Nigel was making a good job of making it work and I knew that if I was in that car I would also be up the sharp end of Grand Prix racing but I was never more than that pipe dream you know I honestly thought I was 32 by then you know yeah let's let's reflect on that for a moment today a 32 year old rookie it's an impossible concept they wouldn't get you and you wouldn't get in a car

[00:44:46] I just don't think any team would put someone about age in the I think a lot of people look at it from the point of view that hat what's his what's his long-term future like you know they're even looking at drivers now who are I think it's the youngest average age of a grid in any uniform of one at the moment but they're looking at drivers who were 28 and thinking they're old left I mean

[00:45:07] Sebastien is 32 it's hard to imagine Sebastien as a rookie now I mean he is 12 years into his Formula One career at the age and four times the world champion at the time that you were entering your rookie season and to your point earlier not coming from a karting background so you could say I shouldn't have been that pizza you know honestly it was just pure I was down and out in when I was 29 we'd had all he we were talking about my first child and he got

[00:45:35] Down syndrome and I'd lost my drive in former three and I had to live and just bought a house we had a mortgage interest rates had gone up to 17 percent can you imagine that I mean a Florida boy imagine wall street now are you seventeen percent interest on a mortgage and I just had my first child me turns out it's got Down syndrome so we're

[00:45:57] Georgie and I are just working out well what does that mean for the rest of our life what are we lost respond and I still wanted to race cars I mean I was mad you know what why what madness was this that made me press on because it turned out okay in the end there's a line here which I'd say it's a quote I'm sure I'm bastardizing and it's basically like chance favors the prepared mind the context of the quote and I can't even remember if it was Einstein or Louis

[00:46:23] Pasteur or but it would there was a scientist who made this point and the idea was you look at scientific breakthroughs and you think it's an inspiration or a flash of genius and the point is no it's not it's a lot of hard work it's toiling it's failing it's doing the experiment over and over again it's failing it's failing it's failing and if you pay enough attention you're gonna see the right thing great scientists always talk about this idea that what separates the good ones from the great ones is the great ones are able to see the right thing at the right time they're able to extract from the data that which others don't see but that requires being there that be that requires being in the trenches and in many ways I think that that's what that 92 year was you put your head down you were in the trenches you showed up every day you test drove that car you basically helped Patrick and Adrian make what would like I said probably be the greatest technologically most advanced f1 car ever and you sort of did it without an agenda of well I'm doing this because it's gonna get me here I mean that's that's sort of my reading of it as a distance which was it was just being in the moment and putting your head down and doing this amazing job and so when the situation arose with Nigel going to IndyCar I mean I think Williams was incredibly lucky but you were there well I'd like to think they felt that you know I think I did do a lot of hard work but I didn't design the car I worked with the engineers I worked with

[00:47:55] Patti Lowe who is the computer guy who worked on the suspension and we did play with lots of stuff that we eventually used and I helped kind of shape it a little bit the traction control and stuff like that but they have to get feedback from a driver that's the point right yeah but that's the point actually it was at starting to get to the point where they don't need as much feedback as they used to because they can see it on the computer so they actually were going okay we know what a gear change is doing we're in control of that we know we can give you a throttle that can do this and if you've got to actually you know potentiometer on the throttle instead of a cable we can make it do this and we can see they can see all the things what we can't do is put their bum in the seat and go that's a scary feeling oh it's not scary in the car the driver can't override the negative things that we're giving to him you know the driver still played a part in that in that sense but what I did do was I think I was a known quantity and and I think what I work well with it with the guys with the engineers and they had Alan frost so it's not I didn't have anyone they had someone in the bank but they took a huge risk putting a guy and he's never done a couple races with Brabham but there had never run at the front in former one then they clearly thought well he doesn't have to run the front we got

[00:49:15] Alan Prosser just needs to back him up were you intimidated by Prost he strikes minister of a pleasant guy I mean no he would never not to any of my knowledge of that ever I've ever been felt like that I would do anything underhand you know I think he was a very decent Chapman I think he was clearly very fast and I could learn a lot from him so and I thought if I could beat him then it's very much to my credit and sometimes I did what did you learn from him technically in terms of like technical driving ability and what did you learn from him at the meta level in terms of philosophy he it's a very quiet guy and it was quite interesting things that I remember were him speaking to his wife on the phone before a race and he'd make a little phone call and he's clearly a very affectionate person and he was quite happy for me to see that he didn't do that in private and when I spoke to him about the car or something like that he mean I never I would never have gone up to him and gone Alan how do you do this so how do you do that you learn by watching the results of what he's been doing I speak to the engineers that running his car and they they say the amazing thing about Alan Frost is you know it doesn't use any brakes you know he's very very light on the brakes but he's incredibly quick right very light on the brakes and very little hand movement right yeah was never fighting the car no a minim minimal movement so obviously micro movements so he's very clearly ahead of the car and able to anticipate it and what he didn't do was throw loads of things at the car he just fine-tuned it and he fine-tuned himself

[00:50:58] I think he knew he was quick and I think he knew how to make a car go quick and he knew had a race and when you look at some of those very early races the Kyle army race with him and Senna Senna was brutal with him and you know Alamos is idli it equally tough back in that active car he wasn't intimidated either he was a hell of a fighter but he'd never show you that you know he wouldn't out of the car you'd never know that the guy was such a formidable competitor what do you remember about Darlington and 93 ah well what do I member of that that would be huh I remember my brain was fried because I was seen why every time I put set of tires on does it do the opposite what I wanted to do and at the same time

[00:51:41] Santa would just stick on his tires for a bit longer and oh god that was just so embarrassing I we we lost count completely of how many pit stops we done I mean I I have no idea what was going on it was and half the way through the race you just go this has gone so horribly wrong it's a farce but you suddenly find out you're a second you running second you go how the hell did I get there I stopped six times you know so for a guy in his first full season with the top team it was a bit of an eye-opener but I look back at that race and I just think why did I let him through so easily because on the first lap again it's of the stuff of legends right how he drove in the rain and that he could pass you and Prost on that first lap in an inferior car he had a lot more experience than me yeah yes and truthfully I just think there was nobody on the grid that was as comfortable in the rain is that although he was clear to say he didn't like the rain you know

[00:52:35] I remember in an interview once where someone made this point which is you know marathan you're so great in the rain and he's like I don't like this I just practiced in it you know but there's a funny picture of the three of you on the podium do it the two of you guys in your blue fire suits sort of like couldn't believe you know but it was it was particularly hard for Alain I think because it was a humiliating experience you know he I think it all went horribly wrong for Alain in that race and I remember that press conference as well

[00:53:04] Ayrton kind of he sort of made the point uh he was just brutal yeah and it was it was a tough one for Alan because um yeah Ayrton could be very very harsh and humiliated I mean after that race I was not on a lot of finest weekends as a team or for a lane but it was a great they talk about it as Aaron's greatest race you were third that season correct I was third that season I was second to Elena thing are you were second okay you know which is amazing you better check that cuz I don't know I don't know but wait no third I think maybe I was third you're right yeah yes yet you were third yeah so at the end of the 93 season was there any doubt that Prost was gonna retire was there a chance he was gonna stick around til 94 or was he very clear that it was one and done I'm sure it was clear that with Frank that that he knew was anything that's one for one year to get one more world championship okay so he's one and done and then all of a sudden Senna gets what he's wanted for several years now which is he has wanted to come to Williams certainly in 92 and 93 of course people know the back story

[00:54:14] Prost had an anti Santa Clause you don't get to have us both but there's interviews where Williams talks about how he wanted Senna in the 80s he wants an 84 85 yeah but he's gonna Frank he gave him his first full Milan test he could I don't know why I didn't sign him then yeah I feel like I need to go back and sort of watch some of those old interviews because he sent his first team was horrible and then he spent three years with Lotus before he went to

[00:54:41] McLaren so you must have been pretty excited right I mean you're thinking to yourself my first season in Formula One I'm third overall I've just been partnered with one world champion and I know I get another yeah and well that was Nigel as well that's right yeah yeah completely I was completely spoiled from that point of view I mean I had chance to see close-up how these guys worked which is something money can't buy I mean it was great for me I you know I really liked the idea of having so where were you in so going into the 94 season is Josh your second or third second second child with Josh born yet just was born in 92 yeah 91 okay so Oliver Josh yeah tabatha not yet not yet okay so you have two little boys the interest rate I hopefully has been refinanced at this point the 17% I think well I think when

[00:55:34] I got the test drive I was able to cope with the the interest and then I got signed back now is actually a full-time driver in 93 I think it was I didn't didn't have to swear squat quite so much but it wasn't so when the active gets undone for 94 when you're in pre-season testing for 94 you are probably the only person in the world that can appreciate the difference between the fw 15 and the 16 what are your first thoughts on that transition I thought it's gonna be different but it was very I found the car hard quite hard to drive get a time out of and be consistent what was the clearance on that car the ground clearance wait it's probably not on credibly low on the active car it was not as low as E sorry only passive car it wasn't as low as the active car it's much high they had to make it quite higher so but they were generating a lot of downforce and I think they had I think it could have been more difficult for them to get used again to controlling the the downforce without the active so it's a little bit of relearning stuff they'd forgotten I think now were you at all worried did you feel that the car in any way was unsafe as you embarked on the first race that year no I didn't never felt it was unsafe I thought it was hard to drive and you know but I thought that just because I'm Damon Hill and that's Ayrton

[00:56:58] Senna so I couldn't go out match his lap times you know I just thought this isn't for me it was new a new comparison ooh benchmark so I drove that car knowing that there was you know we had work to do on setup because it wasn't quite as good as it wasn't in the optimal range that he wanted it to being and so I think everyone at Williamson and Ayrton was we're trying to work out how he got there but then we were also distracted by I think a little bit by the performance of the Benetton which had suddenly come up on the on the rails and was winning racism it was the first race that year was it Australia

[00:57:37] Brazil listen Brazil was the second I thought about whether had these racing ie didn't we which was in Japan as well you're right it was Brazil Asia was second yeah yeah okay so sent us on poll loses control of the car doesn't finish yeah second race sent us on poll loses control of the car doesn't finish well he got knocked off didn't either oh yeah that's right yeah and and then so he's had a non finishes at Hunan finishes your second I'm second but a long way behind Michael and Michael's won both yep so you're heading into mo uh and you're on your heels the team is on its heels yeah lot of disquiet I think I mean I think at and was having doubts about you know he was quite surprised at the way the team worked and the performance the car he was a bit baffled by that and then there was he was worried that maybe Benetton were doing something with traction control they shouldn't have been doing and stuff so it was it was a definitely off-balance situation but I was not the lead man in that situation did so Anna did you share Senna's belief because he had talked about how after he got knocked out of the Pacific Grand Prix he was listening to he could hear

[00:58:54] Schumacher going by and he could he claimed he could hear the traction control yeah did you share that view that there was something in that car I'm software or hardware wise I never heard that myself and I all I had to go on was that Ayrton believed that there was something fishy going on but it was not something that I could control and not something I had any influence over so I you know pretty much stuck to back got back to work and on the car we had which was in testing you do what you could to try and get a balance on it and feel comfortable with it confident in the same way that you probably remember exquisite detail about the circumstances in the days around your father's tragedy do you have that same sort of recollection of Imola aspects of it yeah but I think it was different because I was also racing myself and you had to focus on what you had to do yeah

[00:59:54] I think you don't feel shocked when you're racing I think you have the protective wall around you a little bit I think you managed to remove yourself from overfeeding things I'll see when you're sitting at home watching TV you're pretty unprepared for something so but when you go to a racetrack you're kind of more prepared right yeah and also you'll you know something happens you kind of know how to just pour cold water on it and not let it affect you too much so were you shaken at all by the crash on the Friday yeah I was surprised at that but you just still have it look terrific but he got out okay with concussed and you just thought well that hurt you know that was were you of the view that the car is still safe enough that you know the crash is the crash but you're protected in the car was that kind of your view yeah I think so I feel I think

[01:00:48] I believed in carbon fiber and that you know that it wasn't going to be strongly it's gonna hurt like hell if you have a big shunt but you should be okay yeah I think we we did think that the worst was over a little bit you know what certainly wasn't anything like it was with aluminium cars that ruptured a fuel tank or something like that so yeah so what did you think on Saturday when

[01:01:08] Roland died it was horrible you know it was it's a horrible thing I drove because they stopped the session but I still was on the circuit so I drove past and saw them attending to him and was your first assumption to another horrible shunt but he's probably okay or did you know that no I didn't I knew that that was not a good one there was something about it I don't know what they just I just looked like there was much more sick you knew you know also the location it's not going to be a small impact or a place like that it's gonna be pretty fun high speed and I was just something about it and then the fact they stopped the session and more time goes by then when you start to fear the worst and it's so eerie to see I think I was telling you I was in mlo this year and spent the entire day there and went to obviously we're we're Santa crashed and went to where Ratzenberger I mean we saw all the crash sites and it looks like the margin for error is so much smaller than it appears on television and Roland's crash you don't really see well on television when you got back to the pit did you go back out to qualify again or did it was a session completely under do you know I don't know don't think we didn't run the car after that no on the Friday we pulled on

[01:02:20] Saturday on Saturday no we didn't I don't think because baritone was he would really shake him by this I mean he seemed to be he was he seemed almost angry actually yeah I think it was derailed a little bit by or upset by Rubens his accident I think it was in a very high emotional state I think he'd had a lot on his plate and

[01:02:42] I think I talked about that in the book I think people have wondered about his condition and I know that he'd spoken to my wife because she was in the motor home and he was speaking to her about having a family and it was it like having a family known and because she said you wanted me to to leave while you get changed and he said no you just wanna you know talk and that was a race day so I think he internalized a lot I think he took a lot upon himself I think he felt enormous responsibility for people in Brazil and the projects he had to do with helping young people and and

[01:03:24] I think he really felt that he had a job to do which he couldn't somehow Racing enabled him to do through his racing he was able to be it and Senna then he could do these great works that he had did you know he took an Austrian flag in the car that time no I didn't know that on the day no I don't need read about that later yeah I have always believed that the

[01:03:50] Senna's crash occurred because of a technical problem in the car I always thought the steering column broke it's really your book that has probably changed my view on that I think the way you describe the accident coupled with your experience in that car that has probably not probably it has it has changed my mind and it and it's also made me come to something that I think had always been a blind spot to me you see when you idolize somebody it's very hard to believe that they can make a technical error you just can't believe it right so

[01:04:25] I think if you idolize Sena you can't really believe that he lost control of the car it's easier to believe that the steering column broke and there are lots of good you know and when we create narratives that's sort of what we do and you could go through all of the stories about how that cockpit was built and how the steering wheel was in the wrong position but they had to add an extra couple of inches to send a steering wheel and of course that if you look at the sheer forces on that that's gonna be the thinking you can watch the onboard camera and and yet in a very unemotional way you sort of dismantle a lot of that logic you're right I mean I went through it in quite a lot of detail well that's because I had to after the event to go back through stuff with the engineers to see if I could on said any light on what had happened the data I was able to see showed me what concurred with the onboard footage was that he was putting opposite lock on on the car and controlling the car and my argument has always been that if the steering wheel column broke you'd put more lock on to make it work and I mean if you imagine you're so let's explain this to people because I think for people who don't drive a racecar they won't know the difference between lock opposite lock understeer oversteer etc I mean I I think you do a masterful job explaining this but let's go back to set the stage a little bit Tamburello is a sweeping left hand it's a very fast left-hand corner that is taken basically flat out assuming your tires are up to snuff now you also mentioned something really interesting which was the line that he took you were surprised at the line he took on the first flying lap after the safety car left it was about a couple of bumps and a couple of indents like it subsided the road is slightly subsided close to the curb on the inside line which is the racing line but I didn't like going in that line because I upset the car for me we upset the car so I stayed wide a bit and it was it seemed to miss the bumps but yeah the reason under there cuz I didn't want to go where he went you know not not because of what he you know what

[01:06:27] Tim but because for me it was in a harder ride but I'm not an Senna and he was inside her and he drove the car he wrung everything out of every time he raced you know nothing that you mentioned that the only real flying lap he had which would have been what laps six he had the third fastest time of the day and that's with 65 kilos of fuel and cold tires yeah they were cold not as pumped up as they should have been because they had to get around the safety car that wasn't called the suit was it cool but safe to go there anyway so wasn't the question slow super super slow slow safety car so there are I my own is that there are really what I say and what I believe is that I don't believe the steering column broke for two reasons one is if the steering column broke then your instinct is to keep steering and that means your hands would have would have just right so that so for the listener what that means is you're describing that as lock so if your steering column breaks and you're doing a left handed turn you're gonna be turning left as far as is humanly possibly because you your brain will not it's disconnected so you're you know you're a passenger so you just instinctively put more on and even if it's even if you don't put it on you if the steering column broke that broke them there'd be suddenly less resistance to the lock that he's putting on than his hands would put more lock on because it's suddenly released but instead you saw the opposite so explain what opposite lock is and how it's used to correct for a rear rear loss of traction so it's the attitude the car changes in relation to the direction of travel so the nose the car when it's over steering the nose of the car is pointing more to the inside of the corner then all let's say the the back of the car the middle of the car is is actually at an angle to the line of travel so what is this serif is it safe if I describe that to people as when you're over steering the rear of the car is turning faster than the front of the car into the direction you want to go more like a compass imagine a compass right compass spins from the middle so if you want it to point dead

[01:08:40] North that's good if it starts to point slightly west of where you want it to go which is north then in order to get the whole thing to keep going north you have to turn the wheel to the right so the direction of the point of the car is to the left you put the steering lock on sight to the right and that means the back of the car would act is more like a dart you know it'll actually start to straighten up and as the car straightens up you put lock back on so you point north understeer as well we weren't going to understeer but yeah yeah yeah but I think initially he was under steering because he reduced throttle yeah I don't think it was that ever under steering I think we only ever got over state because he he was turning into the corner so he put in lock on to make the car go around oh so you don't think he ever understood you think this was immediate loss of rear traction I think it was a change of attitude because you can see from Schumacher's on-board camera that he bought the car bottoms and when the car hit the bumps the car lost downforce and starts to slough slightly to the the back of the car comes out to the right so he puts a little bit of right lock on to compensate and then he puts more back lock up win it than that settle down he's put lock back on to go left again so the first one he recovered yeah well recovered he just did what you know he expected it to do the next one it was even greater and you get more of an opposite lock on and it suddenly snaps to the to the right and I just think that the speed he was going alone he was going through I think it's entirely plausible big tank-slapper done you know we call it a tank-slapper in bike racing it was just a massive sideways and with low tire pressures you had got a lot of lateral movement on the tire and then it springs back and at that speed it can throw off the track I mean I don't see that you know not detracting anything I think he was so motivated to win this race that I think he was putting himself right out there at the you know the end of the branch and maybe even a garlic

[01:10:51] Ayrton couldn't drive that car beyond the certain point without something giving someone I think the way you describe it and you go into more detail in the book we won't have to have to go through it here now because I want people to read this book it's so great but the way you talk about even being able to see like one of the radio lights or something on the wheel a yellow light and it so you actually have this frame of reference to actually see when he goes from lock to opposite lock and I think there was just something about reading your account that along with with reading Adrian Newey's account several years ago that really sort of changed my view a bit and made me realize like even your heroes can make mistakes and can lose control of the car

[01:11:32] I mean it's and lost control the car in lots in Brazil you know and we push the cars to their limits and ourselves thought to our limits and I my argument really in the in the book is so if you put someone under even someone as brilliant as Ayrton under a lot of stress with lots of different doubts lots of different questions lots of different problems and then you put them in a very competitive situation and you expect them to perform with a clear head in the same way that they have done in the past I think something's got to give somewhere you know you add in the fatality in the previous day the emotional state the guy had the determination to win the fact that he's in a different team it's not going away he wanted it to in the championship if you say if you put someone out in that situation is he gonna back down no he's not gonna back down he's gonna be answered and he's gonna go and go further beyond where he's ever been before because that's what Ayrton Senna was he's not gonna go okay I'll I'll feather the throttle through Tamburello do you wouldn't be at and Senna so you write about something which is that in the days that followed the last thing that was on your mind was to go to go to

[01:12:51] Brazil for this funeral not out of any lack of respect for Senate but probably out of the need to be with your family frankly yes also I didn't want to go to I know I'm like it's not it's also yeah it's it's really that the last time you were at a funeral was you know obviously a very traumatic experience for you but Jackie Stewart not just you to go yep Jackie rang me and said are you going to aunt's funeral

[01:13:13] I said I don't know Jackie I can't you know and he said you will regret it fuel you know to your dying day if you don't go he basically didn't set me straight but he made a very important point to me which is that you you have to do this in a way you'll wanna be a racing driver you can't you can't just sidestep the nasty bits he's about the most capable person to say that there's no one they could say that you with more credibility that was still alive at that point and you know in the absence of my my dad being around he was a kind of surrogate father figure to me giving me the right advice and impressing on me the importance of of being there and he was absolutely right so eternal gratitude to

[01:14:00] Jackie for that not something you want to do you know you don't want to get on an airplane and go to Brazil and go to some to be confronted with the Box they put someone in when they alive anymore you know the inside is horrible but when you know ends funeral was the most extraordinary event you saw how he affected people and that's what he'd lived with that's what he'd been carrying that nobody an f1 really saw they didn't really see him and that they thought he was a racing driver it's a bit bit nuts at times you know and a bit over emotional or maybe that's what they saw but they didn't see they didn't always affirmation they didn't see the way to the nation they didn't see what he represented and he and the hope he had given people in Brazil it's really amazing to this day I mean I talked about this elsewhere I can't meet someone from Brazil who if when I start talking with him about Senna even if they weren't alive right like or even if they were five years old our nanny for example is Brazilian and she was four maybe five the day he died it's her earliest memory of life because that's every Sunday that's all you did was you watched sent a race and the country stopped for three days and more than a million people line the streets for this funeral and to this day

[01:15:25] I mean it's like I if I'm in an uber and the driver happens to be from Brazil and we get talking about Senna it doesn't matter if they're 20 or if they're 60 this is the single most important person they'll talk about that yeah they were emotionally you know very strong nation they are so passionate about everything and and they and they love where Dan had done and given them he they've been through some tough times and and the football is one of they're also one of the things that lifts the nation and but but Ayrton had had taken them to another place as well and and was proud to be

[01:16:04] Brazilian and and it was a very very cool cruel blow to all those people in Brazil you know they couldn't really understand what had happened I don't think for a long time it was too shocking my daughter wanted me to ask you this question when she knew I would be speaking with you which was first of all she was like oh my god he's on TV when I told her I was in Italian to you because of course every Sunday we get up to watch Formula One so she she she knows you was the guy on TV she she sees less I had to remind her of like all you done but her question is were you afraid to get back in the car for the next race well cuz now you've got two weeks yeah for the dust to settle yeah you fully processed that two drivers have now been killed in the span of two days another one lucky to be alive so you could have easily lost three drivers in three days well I'll put a put it like this the enjoyment of driving had evaporated from that point on it was a task I had to do so there how long did that feeling I think just I think for a good maybe a couple more races or something or maybe certainly Monica was a tough one I did wasn't sure that I could cope with carrying all the hopes of the entire team you know I was not Ayrton Senna as it was abundantly clear you know I was okay but I wasn't gonna be able to do the things that they wanted

[01:17:30] XANA so that was a wobbly one how much fear did you have of physical harm versus the pressure you're describing of wait a minute like two years ago I was a test driver and now I'm the potentially the guy who's carrying the hopes of one of the most storied teams in Formula one because those are two sort of different things I mean they can they can overlap a little bit but one of them comes back to this real visceral concern of I can't let happen to my family what happened to me yeah I think I did have the brakes on being pushed into taking unnecessary risks so you might say okay we're you're not proper racing driver if you that's what Adhan would say you know if you'd if you stopped taking risks and you're not a proper racing guy well listen to

[01:18:23] Georgie talk with you about this at all well I mean when you say talk I mean was your wife in this moment of at this point it's back to being gladiators right I don't think so because I mean you've a gladiator I've done the worst I think nowadays I think basically you're trying to hurt someone else I'm not that sort of perfect but in terms of the risk

[01:18:43] I guess yeah you're showing your skills and you're also competing I think that's the key thing is to actually you want to be the first guy you don't wanna be the second guy so getting out there and erasing this partly what you love doing but then when you've just had the experience like that it it's sort of sour bit and I think it was just too much pressure on everyone did you talk with Jackie about this more because again in the absence of your father who would have been the perfect person to have talked this through with you did you feel like I want to understand from someone who's lived through this losing teammates for example this was all tied up her lip I have said I was affected with the thought that because ends accident was incredibly public you know and shocking and so forth so definitely mm my wife did not want her children to see anything like that happened to me so protecting the kids from any potential shocking incident was also part of our lives then I think after that and was was I think increasingly part of my modus of going racing my dad raced with three children a lot of racing drivers in those days had kids including Jackie

[01:20:04] Enzo Ferrari used to say that a driver with children was a second lap slower well there was a lot of world champions with children and I think that some in some sense is the goal is to survive so if the goal is to survive then you're doing the responsible thing by performing to the very highest level you can possibly can without going over that that threshold and you know Ayrton didn't have children you know I think it's very easy to to think of as racing drivers will could get to the position where they think well if I get hurt then that's - to you before you know but when you've got a family you think what if I get hurt someone else is gonna get hurt as well that's a slightly different thought in the last point I want to say about the that weekend is something else you wrote about in a book which again I think just speaks to the the beautiful level of detail you bring to these all of these little stories that just don't get told it was when you show up for Monaco and the Williams truck and sure enough there's Santa's clothing mm well it wasn't I mean wasn't expected yeah it's just funny it's one of those things where you talk about it like and it's so obvious when you talk about it which is every day a driver goes takes off his street clothes puts on his racing kit gets in a car but invariably sometimes that driver doesn't come back yeah that was something that a detail which is a really hard thing to consider but of course gets lost in the sensational stories is that you know that happened a lot with people in my dad's era and someone would have to go and clear out their room they'd have to go back to their room get their stuff pack it up and take it and make sure it got back to their family or their loved ones imagine that here imagine how many times that took place there very poignant experiences and also even just to think about that you know we we have all the stuff around us you know and we're certainly not there the stuff somehow we linger in the stuff we have and we leave other people with that responsibility to deal with it do you remember any of that from your father well yeah absolutely I mean like do you remember actively helping your mom with I've never actually thought of it until I read you writing about it right which is this idea of like well there's still a drawer full of socks and shirts and pants yeah you know so what does one do with these well that you know and of course then you have to decide whether you're gonna throw it away so for a long time I think my mum my mum kept a lot of my dad's ties for me this with ties that were about 10 centimeters across there are 1970s ties we like bright colors but they were my dad's tie so you know he kept them quite sweetly she kept them because she thought maybe

[01:22:54] I'd like them not as not to wear myself perhaps but you know as mementos and think but what do you do with the generator you have to let go of this stuff unless you look at you just think well I could wear it but it's a bit old wearing your dad's clothes you're still attached to it because of it brings you close it's a relic but can you let go of it can you get a go okay we're gonna throw this stuff away put it on eBay there's all sort of fans out there they love all that stuff with me but is it disrespectful you go to all those thoughts you go through there you just go through all these little questions and you can't find the answers to them you know what is the right way forward the other thing that's sort of interesting about this story at least to me thinking about through these lenses is I don't get the sense from the book and you didn't you're never explicit about this but I don't get the sense that Frank or Patrick sat down to have long discussions about this either is that am I am I correct in assuming that or were there times when they wanted to know how you were doing and they wanted to talk about your head outside of the car no but then they have their own stuff to deal with as well so it's not all about me they also are going through imagine what it's like for Frank he signed at to go out to race 15 imagine what's like for party like you know matches his car and people are saying it's failed he's having to go to yeah what is Adrienne I mean how do these guys off yeah yeah it's their everyone had a lot of stress to do with the engineers the guy works in the car not an easy time for for any of them you know so that's one of the contradictions with the sport is you know we focus a lot on the driver in some ways that the public see the driver as the public facing person the person the most interest you know but it's not all about the driver as well you work with these rely on the team you work with the team they went through a lot they were really battered after that experience and some of them still today don't want to talk about it as you head into the second half of the 94 season all of a sudden the gap between you and

[01:25:02] Schumacher is narrowing and as you head into Suzuka I think you're separated by a point right what was the situation and I had to he yeah well if he finished ahead of you he would win that's exactly yeah but then he crashed hmm trying to cut you off that was in Adelaide Natalie so it's azúcar who oh no sorry sorry sorry

[01:25:24] Suzuka was the second to last me yes it was which you want I had to beat him to keep the championship oh and you did yes okay so Suzuka is the race that you he came down to match play basically yes it was hole by hole and that you you wrote something very interesting about this which was you have this moment where you feel like you can't do anymore and you in the book you actually described this as you call out to to Ayrton and you say like if you're up there watching me like

[01:25:53] I need your help right now and then you describe the next lap as an out-of-body experience and I'm reading that and what you're describing sounds exactly like the way Senna described his 88 qualifying session in Monaco which was he wasn't driving the car like he was part of the car the car was being driven and I don't know if that was just a coincidence that because you didn't reference anything about Monaco but it was just interesting that you talked about having this thought of calling out to him for help as your former tee mate and then driving I think the word you used is you were possessed yeah us anyway I can describe it I mean it was

[01:26:31] I'm sure that there's a perfectly logical explanation or one that can be described scientific terms biologically you know I think that we we all know that every now and then we do something here people say things like I don't know how I managed to lift the car up or something like that to get off some chaos I you know we we have more potential than we are aware of and sometimes it to release that potential we have to play tricks with our mind and we have to say imagine that pain isn't there and you know if had stories of people who've you know got dreadful payment they can manage to cope with it by so meditation meditating and and all these things to do with fully exploring what the mind is capable of doing have got lots of very strange stories attached to it and I think people are right to be skeptical of them and question them but if I had tricked myself into through not deliberately but just simply I wanted to win that right I knew I had to win that race and I also wanted us to win for Ayrton as well there was an element of wanting to beat the Benetton team because of this story this story very so this experience we'd had in 94 so I was much massively motivated to win that race but I'd run out of steam I couldn't go any faster and he's catching me and I knew he became that he was gonna get me on the line and I just I just thought okay I think it's in somewhere and so I just said in my mind it was a kind of like

[01:28:11] Nivea there I need I can need a bit of a hand and I swear to god it was like someone had got my foot and planted it flat on the floor and I can't lift it off I couldn't lift off I'm going through the esses I'm going oh my god on their hands like my hands just correcting the car and I literally was disconnected from what my body was doing and it was just like I was willing it to win you know willing it just purely through thought through some sort of telepathic kind of way I was controlling things and eventually I got halfway around us so I got a I'm sorry I'm gonna

[01:28:53] I'm gonna have to come back here this is all gonna go horribly wrong and I sort of I can remember literally feeling like I was coming back into the car and in the hairpin and going I'll take you from here you know laughter I'm sure he can finish this off and now people listening to this will go you you're nuts you're making this up you know but that's what happened and I can't explain it any other way than I just did it so it was you know I beat Michael in the way so let's be honest little old me beating

[01:29:24] Michael Schumacher someone must have felt me well it's funny I'll pause for a moment only to say something for the person who's listening to this who isn't a die-hard f1 fan many a pundit has actually with the benefit of the retrospective scope said you're arguably one of the most underrated World Champs ever I mean you're incredibly modest you're so uncomfortable sometimes I do you remember when they did the this is your life special about twenty years ago mmm-hmm I found a clip of this on

[01:29:55] YouTube all right have you ever watched it no I thinking about TV show this this is life yeah I did I did yeah they got me on that one yeah yeah yeah you have to go back and watch this because I'll tell you what I can't get over on that show is how uncomfortable you are being commended mmm yeah think about it the whole show is singing the praise of the person whose this is your life they're bringing all these people out everybody's talking about you and blah blah blah you're making me feel uncomfortable

[01:30:32] of discomfort in watching you be praised by people is it's palpable to watch now maybe maybe I'm just a bit more tuned into that now because I've you know I've read everything you've written I've you but that was my reading of that now I could be wrong I'd be curious to know what your wife or someone who knows you well would think or what your children would think if they saw that is that is that just dad's you know countenance or is that actually dad being uncomfortable being praised in this way I am uncomfortable being praised I mean there were times when when I was in therapy which I talk about in the book you know where my therapist is a game I think he did really well and I be going oh no don't say that I'm when she I want you to criticize me I want to know you know how I can be better and what I've done wrong and now I'm much better with that

[01:31:23] I mean I honestly are if someone says that was a great shot even if it's rubbish I go okay well that was that's very nice of you to say so really appreciate it and but I know yeah it was it just made me feel really queasy about yeah getting compliments I don't know why I'm sure that's an awful failing in that you name a being I don't know I don't I don't know if that's true actually what I do think is I think we make we celebrate far too much people's achievements the paths they don't worry so much celebration as we give them I mean what is it mean the embracing driver yeah they want to really everyone wants to race they want to win they don't wanna win for everyone else he wants to win for themselves so it's the kind of selfish activity yeah every now and then you want to win for someone else and you yeah it's nice to do that but is it so praiseworthy no I mean I think it depends right I think it depends on I mean I understand your point of course right you know compared to a missionary doctor or someone who's you know out there saving a life or something like that maybe not but it's still a metaphor for life right it's still the substrate by which we can take lessons and expand and it still pushes the boundaries of what it is that we're capable of and I think there's something about that that sin is a most extreme example of that that we've probably ever seen in all of sport where at one individual's passion and pursuit is first of all it's a tool by which he was able to help millions of people in his own country directly and financially but I think more importantly it's it's sort of a hope that people cling to and you know in the words of David Foster Wallace you know we all worship something there's no such thing as atheism so we're all in the pursuit and worship of something I think also there's something is just maybe just occurred to me but I think also that I've learned to appreciate that opportunity doesn't come to everyone and some people look at somebody who's got had an opportunity and they done something with it and they've done the right thing with it and they've gone oh thank God you did that I didn't get the opportunity to do that but I'm glad you did because that's what

[01:33:40] I would like to done and so when they get praise did we get praise or something it's not you they're praising its celebrating the fact that somebody has had an opportunity and they've triumphed over the something and you're right that's what gives us all hope you know maybe if we got the opportunity we do the same or it's a generosity when you're celebrated celebrity I think you people say congratulations because it said we're celebrating something for all of us I think that's something which I'd perhaps never really properly understood

[01:34:12] I felt you know a bit like a kid getting too many Christmas presents or something I don't know well you almost got the Christmas president 94 because as we head into a delight of course now you're down by a point if Schumacher finishes ahead of you he wins the championship if you finish ahead of him you inish the championship and he crashes and all you'd have to do at this point has finished the race and you win and then something is wrong with your car mmm if I recall it was suspension yeah so what happened is we were racing hammer and tongs and a long way ahead of everyone else yeah cuz Nigel was on Paul

[01:34:51] Nigel's own Paul that had a horrible start it was basically a two-man race see my race and it was sort of Suzuka part two we went straight back into the battle we'd had at the previous race I did put him under a lot of pressure then he started to creep away from me and he quickly got so far away I couldn't see around it was like a street track that went around block service 90-degree corners and he'd just gone round the the 90-degree corner that I couldn't see that he'd gone off and hit the wall and come back on so when I come around the corner I'm right on his town he's coming back on the track and obviously not up to speed and I thought this is my chance

[01:35:27] I'm never gonna get this again because he he always he already managed to pull away from me so I thought he slipped up he's got managed to get back on the track and I'll have a go at passing him on this corner here so I went down the inside but he closed the door I mean touch my car and damage the suspension he crashed out so his race was run but unfortunately my car was also damaged and I couldn't care on either so he'd won the championship and a lot of people were very cross about that I have to say

[01:35:56] I look back I at the time I thought or whatever done that was a stupid clumsy move I just did but actually British review yes well when I look at it again it still looks like that to me but anyway that what I didn't know was his car was probably terminally damaged anyway so if he knew that his car was damaged then he knew he had to do what he did and if he didn't know and then it was just a defensive move that worked for him luckily I suppose because my car got broken I think the hardest part of that story for me sort of cheering you on is like you're just thinking come on guys you don't need the suspension to be perfect it just needs to be good enough for you to limp to the finish line there ain't no to this done you don't limp in a film they pare things down to the bare minimum if one part the suspension is buckled it's gonna just snap the moment you hit the brakes or put any load on it is gonna collapse so how does that race put the exclamation mark at the end of the most emotionally draining season of your life which is the lowest low and it almost you come within literally one foot there are 30 centimetres of width and you could have had the highest high and that season you know I could also been the same fat as that I mean is that basically why because I've heard you in interviews in the last 20 years you've never sort of complained about that race you've always had a very and maybe this is I don't know how much of this is is just you know you're being polite and it's not your nature to versus like you really had a saying wouldn't view of you know what look it I gave it the best I could it's amazing that I was the second you know had the second most points that season but I don't have hard feelings about it is sort of the way I feel you describe it

[01:37:47] I think in 94 I was I gave it everything I had and wanted so badly to to win I I'm I want to ask you a question D did you see did Michael set himself up somehow the villain was in some way what happened to Adam was not his full but I mean I think a lot of people Kate look here's the thing I mean I'm gonna just put my bias on the on the table right you can see my laptop over there it's got a mp4 for I mean you've got I'm a set a fan like no other

[01:38:20] I've never like Schumacher I have to be honest with you I never always felt he played in a gray area of the sport let's look at 94 well I'm the same piece I asked you that question cuz I sort of knew that that was the situation not from with you personally but there was definitely some animosity towards the way Micra went about racing yeah and part of that's not fair to michael right so part of it is I think if Michael had not raced at Imola

[01:38:46] I don't think Santa would have died that's not Michael's fault another way it's not it's noise fool but that's sort of the view that I carry right was Senna was convinced that Schumacher was riding traction control I probably think that's true remember Benetton refused to submit their data to f1 after that race incurred a huge fine several races later they get busted for using an illegal fuelling filter I mean they were always sort of doing something a little bit gray so I think there are some fans that just immediately fell into a Schumacher is not the good guy hmm but you can also look at s and say Adam was someone who's very volatile mmm-hmm and if he felt that someone had treated him badly he would almost never forgive them I don't think he ever forgave Prost for for Monaco of 88 for I think that was the beginning of the end of that and ah City and I think maybe that was weakness it is and you know my wife asked me about this she goes you sort of have a double standard with Sena like you know you're very quick to overlook his flaws I don't know that that's true

[01:39:52] I think what it is I think I think it's how open a book he was and how volatile he was that I actually see is appealing it's the there's no ambiguity of where you stood with him it's kind of Greek theater isn't it with with Anton yes he's kind of destined he hadn't got any choice in the matter his life his personality the things that made him who he was these forces were driving him and you look back at some of the earlier interviews I mean there was an amazing interview with Prost in 990 maybe when he was so upset at Senna but he made this point which was like God Santa acts like he can't die in a car you know he drives like someone who's immune from death but he said but he's not you know of course never would anybody imagine what that would foreshadow four years later so yes going back to your final race in 94 I thought Schumacher was out to lunch I mean I thought that was completely unfair but what should have happened was that the people who run the sport should have said you can't do that and they didn't they didn't do that with it and when he crashed into procced in Suzuka although I always thought that was sort of payback for no it's not I know you know I know you that you can't run we can't let drivers you can't be mercenaries no it's not it's not death wish you were whatever that film was with Charles but you're too young to remember I totally remember but you know so you can't take the law into your own hands that's what they're there for they're there to stop things getting out of hand and they just abdicated their responsibility to running things properly and you know that meant that opened the door for everyone in all branches of sport to go about the sport in the way they saw it being executed in formal one because everyone looks down look it sees formal honours the pinnacle of everything that's the way they work it so in American racing they're a lot tougher it's incredible you know they can be quite tough on drivers who bad driving and stuff on that and in the space particularly ovals as well because it is very dangerous so we're gonna skip the 95 season just for the sake of time because there's still so much I want to talk about post-retirement but into the 96 season you're racing very well you've now got this new upstart the another son of as you describe him right from my home country at what point even though it came down to the last race that so it's sort of a nail-biting season all over again your form looked incredible that season right

[01:42:27] I mean was there a part of you that was starting to accept halfway through that season that this is your season yeah I think I before the season started it was always a one-year contract I didn't know it was gonna be like my last season with with Williams but you know I knew when when we got to Monza my Monza which was a bit later in the day but I mean that the start season I thought this is got to be perfect this season I've got to you know not be distracted and I've got to polish the job I knew I had a chance the car was brilliant and Anu had a guy he'd never done all the tracks he was gonna go to so no matter how fast he was or motivated you know he he was at a disadvantage to me you know I had no excuse not to beat it really and he was a good teammate you know he was cocky and a bit irritating at times but quite charming with it as well what track was at Estoril when he claimed he could take the non-racing one he did that at the start of the season like in pre-season testing pre-season testing he's sat down and was I think he did it as a way of getting noticed by the team and the engineers by saying no you know do you think anyone could overtake roundly at last corner and boasting really and catching everyone's attention in the process and we'd sit there and go guys completely mad what was he thinking anyway did it that's the amazing thing and he couldn't have passed a better person no and he did it and also I was I was in the post race cooldown room with him as well and Mike was very cross with him because he claimed it was dangerous yeah the irony of that the irony of that is but that's fast the extraordinary thing about these guys is they're never wrong in any situation their mind they've tricked their mind to believe they have to be right in every situation and there's only one rule and it's they're all that's there their way they're purged and someone told me the story about Jack Nicklaus being asked in an interview once by someone get together with the public and meet the fan type thing and guy asked him when you three putted in the Masters in whatever he said I know the three parties you know you did I saw yours days I said never three parties in the month I never three parties my whole career you just basically explained that people who are that competitive and train their mind they don't see themselves as making mistakes well and you could almost argue that's a trait like that's a feature of their greatness is the ability to completely suppress anything that could be negative or that could reflect on them having made an error now I've always found that interesting because you take the opposite like you're someone that comes in with a totally different personality rich is highly willing to accept oh my god what did I mean did I make a mistake here how can I learn from statically maybe a mistake well that's the point I'm gonna make is the evidence would suggest both phenotypes can produce success so I don't know that it's necessary that one has to be blind to their mistakes to be successful in fact I would argue that that's a harder way to live your life isn't it I would say the Alain Prost was self-critical openly self-critical and and willing to accept a little bit of these fallibilities maybe and I think that in studies with sports psychologists they have identified the people who are the best people are more self-critical of themselves so that actually they see themselves as work in progress and they're always trying to improve or whereas the ones that have a problem of the ones that feel they've got it all and they don't need it they've got nothing else to learn and there's a kind of harder position and it's easier to fracture and you have to say in some cases when Michael was racing and weren't going well he fell apart it didn't compute I think in some cases and

[01:46:25] I think he showed a certain fragility but most the time he was so strong as competitor you know his confidence with what gave him also some power over when everyone else when that season ends you take a Concorde over to New York you end up on Letterman well they put a car they said yeah do away money on the show and they puff tape yeah yeah yeah I didn't choose to go yeah it's kind of amazing it would be only a few years three years later four years later that plane would be grounded never fly again so you kind of got this surprise from Letterman when you were on your sort of victory lap so to speak right because he pulled out a picture of your dad which again was done in good spirits it wasn't it was a you know done as a way to basically make a point which was you were the first person to ever win a Formula One

[01:47:12] Championship as the son of another Formula one champion and I don't think at that point in your career by the way anybody would say well of course you know once you're the son of a champion it's easier for you I mean if anything by that point you had established you didn't have a single break your way in terms of being the son of Graham Hill in fact I think even Letterman rift you about it a little bit that you still got you lost your seat it didn't help me keep my weight in this Drive No yeah I don't think Frank saw any benefit in that just having a son of around the place so no I don't know I don't know whether I had nobody can answer that one

[01:47:48] I mean is it easier is it less easy a lot of the guys whose dad didn't have successful careers though they went on to be successful racing driver says lots of sons of out there did you think about it when Josh was racing yeah I did I thought it must be difficult for him you know must be difficult because he can't just go racing and and be treated like everyone knew that this was someone who could potentially be a third time third generation world champion no pressure son I think that Josh was very mature and could cope with that but nevertheless it's a fact and you kind of don't know how to deal with I don't know you you can't ignore it you can't you don't want to keep banging on about it but it's there all the time it's a fact to life and and you know well that certainly no that's now we got to get back to the racing and and actually the only thing that really makes any difference um any were things that think that people really care about is whether you finish so the next year ninety seven you're in the arrows car and then you spend the last two years and with Eddie

[01:48:51] Jordan right yeah yeah you managed to win a race in the Jordan car right yeah was it hungry no it was spa spa yeah your last win was a spa yeah epic circuit yeah but I knew when I thought that I couldn't do that again that was a to race in the wet I'm 38 years old and it was exhausting mentally physically you know it was really tough I think if

[01:49:19] I if I'm finding this difficult now I just you know what did you decide at the end of 98 to come back for another year what did you have left to prove at that point without two-year contracts so I thought the car was getting better and I just at the end of 18 why would I come back yeah I know you have a contract but but I mean contracts aside did you still have I want I want you can't it's very difficult to just give up it's very difficult to go okay well I'm you know

[01:49:43] I've not had a good weekend but or good season I found it quite hard but I'm still fetish youngish you know and I still think there's a chance and so that part of you overrides the the one that can be utterly brutally objective and say you know you should stop now and so I got halfway through ninety nine and thought I can't I can't carry on with this I've got to stop gonna get out and

[01:50:13] I wanted to stop at the British Grand Prix but Eddie Jordan had got someone else signed up and made a commitment to someone to get me out of the car and I said well I don't want to leave on a you know I like at least to go out you know saying thank you to everyone and finish my career where I started at Silverstone and British Grand Prix and everything can you can you see your way to just letting me do that and that was then suddenly got all complicated and suddenly I got locked into doing the whole rest of the season so let's go to the very last race your last race as an f1 driver 1999

[01:50:47] Suzuka right yeah so by that point I just got I had gone wrong in the race somewhere and I just thought I'm a lap down I had to come in for a front wing we got no chair in a way out the points it's it's just I thought right now in a wheel could fall off I could hit a barrier and kill myself and then it would all been stupid wouldn't it why risk it so I came in and what did you say I said I'm finished what did they say they were what's wrong with the car nothing I mean it's a lot like Mickey vada in yeah 1975-76 right yeah they're not happy with you if you retire a car but screw them sorry they don't understand you are putting your life at risk and affecting potentially you know your family and all that stuff and there are times when it doesn't matter this was really a crescendo for you right this was it's your last race but it was the moment when you finally sort of said wait a minute like I am now secure enough in my skin I'm a Formula One world champion and on my terms today yeah this is enough no exactly I done it their way my whole career I had always given everything I had for the team and

[01:52:00] I gave everything I had for Williams and I got the sack and after a bit you just go hey listen tit there is a deal they're doing a deal you've done a deal with them ok it says in the contract you will always give the best your performance I gave the best I had nothing left you know do you remember that evening or the next night you were

[01:52:19] I guess it would have been probably a where was your family at that race No so how long before you got home do you remember let's say two days mainly p.m. yeah what was it like that first time you came home knowing you were retired was it the greatest feeling was it a sad feeling very I don't I don't actually remember I think I was very relieved and happy I thought I was home and dry I thought I'd escaped that's what I thought

[01:52:43] I actually and all of those things came home to roost you know the things you put back behind you those fears and wherever worries that you imaginings that you have you kind of go well you know you can you can stay there for a bit and then when you step out the car I just think I made it I mean ask I made it through in one piece it's like getting to the top of them hounds El Capitan and actually the worrying thing is where do you come back and do something dangerous again you know you have to kind of so I did I didn't stop racing I thought right that's it I'm not going anywhere near anything dangerous for so long like I'm you know I'm still relatively sane about things like that

[01:53:26] I did do karting when when Josh was karting I got back in him got pumped up again started racing a few guys but took a few risks there but generally I've been too good but this is kind of interesting right I mean there are a lot of people when they leave the peak of their profession their identity is so wrapped up in that thing and again this could be being the f1 driver this could be being the bigshot lawyer the bigshot doctor but I see this pattern all the time which is people that have this inability to go from being at the apex to living quote/unquote the normal life you never really seem to I mean you went through something different which we're going to talk about which was now that you had more stillness around you I think you were able to appreciate the depression you were able to go back and confront some of the tragedy of your life that I don't think had been fully processed but you also didn't have as much of this struggle it seems with your identity being first and foremost a driver my thing I felt like I denied my my identity by being shoehorned into being a racing driver I mean I think I I did the racing I don't think I ever thought that that's who I was you know I knew I could do it and I liked doing it and I felt strongly that I was a very good driver and I could beat people and

[01:54:57] I gave it a hundred percent but I just thought that's that's only a small your formula one wants people to be a certain way you know they want particular types of heroes and and I just thought well and maybe I'm not that person I don't want to be what you want me to be so I've got to be me and I want to go racing the way I go racing and I gave a little bit but I also perhaps was not cut out for that role I did I II how many of the younger drivers ever come to you as they're ending that they're entering the twilight of their career and asked for advice or just wanted to talk about that transition not one not one driver has come to me and go on I want to be a formal driver what do we do this amazing I mean is it's almost not a conversation that never happens with racing drivers they hardly ever speak to anyone else Racing driver about getting advice it's not like tennis or golf or something like that without coaches it's really peculiar I was lucky I had my dad you know my dad when I was younger so I kind of gleaned quite a lot of knowledge from him but maybe it wasn't clarified because I was only very young but I did ask drivers occasionally for a bit of advice got some help from James Hunt once he just said thinking doing a good job and that was really help that made me feel great because I thought there's the guys he's you know it's respected actually giving me some thoughts on what

[01:56:40] I what he thought I'd say I'm trying to Rack my brains to see if I've got I also didn't get advice as such but I'd used to speak a little bit to Niki Lauda and were you close to Niki at all a little tiny bit not that close but because he raced against my dad I kind of felt like he was cognizant of that side of my life or if you like so bit of a connection there Jackie of course

[01:57:01] Jackie would give advice but as far as the people coming to me and going how do I think I think probably people look to my career and thought I don't want to do it like the way I did it so hey they don't ask my advice you wrote about how you weren't specific as to when this occurred after retirement so I can't tell if it was two years after ten years after but you wrote about how you were on a family vacation somewhere you were you were sort of sitting there

[01:57:29] I think just with Oliver and you you you wrote that you were frustrated confused and angry and then you had this moment of sort of clarity and I don't know if you intended it to sound like a turning point but it sounds like it was I believe you were already in therapy at this point you were already speaking with a therapist and you were already confronting your own depression but what is it about that moment I mean depression is such a depressing would people still you talk about depression

[01:58:00] Meera you can sense people go oh please don't talk about depression Anais my comment on depression is that depression is a way of telling us we're going the wrong direction so it's a profound signaling a running out of energy an energy that is is depleting and it's actually starting to go the other way it's actually starting to drag you down and it's because it's trying to tell you something you are sort of doing this to yourself you actually need to re-orientate your perspective on things how do you do that and that's that's easy to say and I said when anyone has had depression knows someone can't say to you just cheer up it's the most useless advice one could give do not understand the meaning depression if anybody thinks that that's what it's about it's almost like you've run out of ideas completely and it's not even the buffers it's it's the black hole isn't it so the abyss I remember I did actually go and see Rothko exhibition that Tate

[01:59:05] Modern nothing else and I was looking at one of his paintings and there's usual thing there's the horizons so they are literally horizons aren't like this and one of them was a very sunny looking painting so had sort of like the Sun above and then this you went down it went darker and darker and - it went down and I remember looking at this painting and just going I don't want to go down there and you felt like you were on a path to there or that there was some sort of pole like yeah you didn't make a change that's where I think you mentioned identity

[01:59:41] I think that is fundamentally important and I think the people who have had an overwhelmingly powerful parent let's say they haven't fully evolved their own identity they haven't had the chance some things you know maybe your dad's famous and then he dies who you are you he dad son are you who are you he wasn't around long enough to kind of it didn't manage to get to that point where I was confirmed as me my mom and my dad were distracted they had this career going on his his career going on I think I didn't fully develop an identity I knew I had somebody that people responded to and my friends when I went to school but it wasn't a fully developed personality wasn't a real rounded thing it was it was sort of half cooked yeah and when I stopped racing I done I just expressed something that I had maybe I was just you know play-acting my dad those are the sort of questions you you

[02:00:48] I didn't really cheat it so to be 40 years old and to be thinking those things has got to be somewhat jarring right because you're sort of saying wait a minute Who am I like I haven't figured this out right now mm-hmm yeah and what if I've spent the last 20 years yeah pursuing something that wasn't really about me no exactly and there was there was definitely an agenda part of it was to restate the life that we had before he got killed so I managed to get us back I used the word us but of course my mum had lost her husband and my sister's lost their dad but I had a family but in a way and partly my mind I was it was if I restructured my family then we'd restructure the family that was shattered that was destroyed so I'd rebuilt this thing so there was this it's a misplaced concept it doesn't apply because it's not you can't put back together a family that died my dad not gonna come back and so my kids were growing up I was thinking all the time well I would have done anything to have had my dad back but they had their dad they didn't know what that was all about did you ever feel at some point that you had an obligation to them to figure this out because the irony of it was you lost your dad because he actually died but if you didn't figure this out your kids were gonna lose their dad not because he's physically dead but because he's emotionally absent or emotionally dead and for lack you know did at the risk of sounding too dramatic well and I think the more the more you dig in they the more you realize that your parents relationship was was not as ideal as it should have been and when you're younger you idealize them and everything's wonderful when clearly it wasn't and what you don't want to did you ever talk to your mom about this yeah I had I did actually go and start to talk to my mum about her relationship with her husband but she was quite defensive non-defensive but she was she had created explanations for her relationship with her husband and he clearly had they'd had difficulties but then if I started to criticize him then she would suddenly come to his defense and do you think part of that is just her stoic nature you know you write stories about her upbringing I mean you know she almost died during the war and then on top of that she's standing there as one of the wives during the most dangerous era in the history of this sport we're but a one in three chance your spouse is gonna die over the course of their career and they're saying all the time this is a noble thing to be doing well why really you know was it that no when you've got family and stuff too is it really that admirable that you're putting all that at risk and of course the irony is where he retired he was home and dry yeah he retired about six months before this crash yeah he was 46 he stopped he had this team didn't he was that I think so everybody thought everyone breathes a sigh of relief eyes in the Norwich the bullet he dodged the bullet and bang six months later it even worse than anyone could have imagined it wasn't just him it was his young Protege driver team designer team principal the chief mechanic engineer all gone in one big catastrophic bomb and makes you go through life slightly thank you you never quite sure what's around the corner that's the horrible thing if you knew in call it 1985 right so you're 25 years old if you knew then what you know today or if if you could go back and talk to that guy then but as yourself now what would you tell the 25 year old version of yourself now I would try and dispel from him a lot of erroneous notions about how the world works and who really cares about what you think and what you do and and and I would say just don't waste a lot of energy thinking about those things or trying to make an impression on people because you think that would help you it doesn't wear like that you know you just don't worry about that if you've got a job to do do the job if you do it well and you do it better than other people then that will work that will help you focus on what your things you can do not on the things you cannot do anything about and don't waste a lot of energy worrying about them I probably would say that and I don't say enjoy it just you know don't put yourself through torture because you think this is something that means a lot it does you know we're going around in circles chasing each other and trying to come first that's all it is yeah it's interesting right you talked earlier about the nobility of this board in the 60s and 70s when it was basically the most you know dangerous thing you could have done it was all pornographic some people actually I think looked at from the one and with put off they thought it's a disgusting thing now I can see that that I can understand why they felt that way I think that anybody in the sport at the time were even today we like to embellish it and make it seem like it's such a wonderful thing and it is it's impressive it's incredibly impressive but let's not get it too far out of context you know it's just a it's a lifestyle choice for a lot of people and and it's a show brilliance in certain fields but it's not gonna really change the world for the better a few people's weekends get a lot better or a lot worse but do you think that there are benefits from Formula One for example in terms of advancing safety technical achievements of vehicles I think what fun one does brilliantly is that it shows people if there's an issue or there's a problem they can solve it they're absolutely brilliant at not stopping when there is a challenge they go where's the challenge we don't know they well we'll do it well we'll find a way around it will do then that's the impressive thing about Formula I mean

[02:07:36] Max Mosley do you remember a couple of days after the Senna crash he was very recently become the president but I remember this press conference and he said you know I think very aptly the question isn't why did Senna crash although that's all anybody wanted to talk about the question is why did he die because the reality of it is if you took a hundred drivers in the exact same crash 99 of them probably would have lived it was a very fluky death Fuki and also the thing to consider is that just to explain people didn't understand there was a part of the suspension that penetrated his crash helmet and the force needed to do that wasn't that great if he'd crashed at a very slow speed and that this suspension had happened to come back that and we've all been in crashes like that you know guys we've all crashed you know even former

[02:08:29] Ford you got suspension arms and wheels flying all over the place you know if it be going that fast you imagined throwing a wheel at you at 20 miles now it's gonna go through your head yeah so that to me was the big step forward in in Formula one safety which is yeah they're probably just as many crashes today as there were in the previous generation but people aren't supposed to die there's an amazing place where

[02:09:00] Formula one really did step up and and I think made that difference so I don't know I think you're then way back into that loop of when you take away the risk do we appreciate the skill and the and the yeah so do you think the pendulum has swung too far why you know I don't know how you want so I just I because you don't want to say there should be more risk no you don't well there's a guy who constantly that reminds me he's an engineer that there's a difference between hazard and risk so the hazard is what can happen and the risk is the potential of that happening so the chance of that happening so you know the chances of being hit on the head by a flying wheel are slim because not that many people have been killed despite all the flying wheels in motorsport yet well we can name two three people have been killed by that that's just an avid boy in the halo so we believe we have eliminated the hazard the chance is reduced I suppose because it's got to somehow get through the the halo so we've taken away one of the hazards to someone being hurt that's got to be a good thing so we have to then replace the challenge or if we taken away some of the challenge of the sport then we need to find a way to introduce other challenges that will be appreciated whether that's I don't know giving the cars more power or you know more difficult to drive or if it looks easy and it's too easy than nobody cares you know they're not gonna they're not gonna be watching you mentioned how after you retired you didn't even watch the next decade of racing I mean when when

[02:10:47] Schumacher was yeah you know what the result was gonna be so he just cleaned up didn't eat for about five years and I actually I was at a low point with regard to the way the sport was run at that point too nothing personal against Michael but I just thought this is this is putting on a show for the benefit of just one person and a team and I just didn't see that's what people wanted I mean unless you were German Italian I suppose yeah you also said something that really got my attention I'm writing a book right now and in this book I talk about this practice of going to funerals and you know it's funny because you had talked about how much you did not want to go to

[02:11:35] Senna's funeral which makes all the sense in the world but in the last couple of years I've come to find funerals to be an amazing grounding experience and a reminder of for any individual how insignificant we are you know like I've never been to a funeral yet where the earth stopped turning on its axis so that gives me pretty good confidence that there is no one of us who's so special or so relevant that somehow our departure from this planet will change the rotational force of the earth it'll change it for us exactly only for us yeah and more importantly to be a little less glib about it it focuses you on sort of what matters because it's what people are talking about at the funeral that probably matters more they tend to talk more about the type of person you were than what your achievements were it's much more about maybe what kind of a mother you were then what kind of a lawyer you were and I couldn't help but notice this line in your book that is literally just it's one sentence and it almost goes unnoticed which is that you you found yourself reading obituaries a lot and not of anyone famous of people you didn't know tell me a little bit more about that that comes back a little bit to what I was saying about applauding and celebrating people in public away who've done stuff and you read other lives of people I'd never heard but maybe in their own career never feel there they're well-known but yes yeah just it's unbelievable the kind of lives people have and the things they do modest people do extraordinary things I remembers a guy over it was a kind of diplomat who managed to stop a revolution just by going up and standing in front of the guy who was head leading them you know just some insignificant apparently looking guy would do something extraordinary or woman and it's those stories which I think are profoundly moving because you don't know who these people are they're out there now and you might meet them and you don't know what they're capable of doing in an extraordinary situation they could be the people who suddenly do something really you might have just passed them by everyday little you know their lives they've people have just dismissed them as being ineffective and they'll do something really remarkable now how has that insight helped you in your journey

[02:14:00] I think I think it's made me wonder what whether I'm one of those people or not you know I'd still I shudder to think that you know what something might happen I might have to kind of make a decision as to whether I go in a burning building or not you know but there are people who do that but they do that without even batting an eyelid you know you just think just being a racing driver is it that brave it's like I'm getting there I'm enjoying what I'm doing as well you know and people's capacity as well for work I mean some people's that's just unbelievable they can pull off in one lifetime so human beings are extraordinary creatures that's the right word and I like learning more and more about them I like more learning more about what we're capable of and what some people are capable of I know I have my limitations but I'm still in awe of people are skilled or people are educated in all kinds of ways and are able to make things happen as well some people have the amazing ability to get things done I mean whether it's Elon Musk or you know that guy who's doing the ocean cleanup thing you know he it's amazing some people just have this ability I I'm absolutely rubbish at making anything happen I don't know why I come up with an idea and I can't seem to get it to take hold and then me probably because I doubt whether it's any worthwhile do you think your kids would say that you've been rubbish at being a dad or do you think your kids would say that I remember one of the things he'd talk about I don't think it was in this book it might have been in a number maybe it was in this book but you talk about how upon retiring the thing you look forward to most was taking them to school you know this idea which again that struck me as a little odd because I have to you know we can't help but read the stories of other people and put ourselves in them that's the nature I think of what we do is we are so self-centered as individuals we always tend to extrapolate through our own lens and I just there's a part of me that feels really sorry for someone to be at the pinnacle of a sport as an example and then have to retire and there's a part of me that thinks god that must be awful like at least I don't know what it's like to be great you know so so there's there's joy and mediocrity because I can't imagine what it would be like to be the best in the world at something and then to be off that stage and I guess I was just sort of pleased for you that even though I knew because I know how the story unfolds that there is this huge journey you have to go through I thought how much better is it that at least you have this you have these four kids hmm that means so much to you the will can completely change with one generation and it's all about how we nurture our children in what we advise them in and the opportunities we give to them you know it would only take one generation of people who didn't want to kill anything or anyone isn't that kind of amazing when you think about that that your children and your father are separated by only one generation and yet there's very little in common in there exists in their experiences hmm yeah that well it's extraordinary that amount of change that's been in in the world as in those two lifetimes I mean do your kids ask about the grandfather much nothing a little bit yeah

[02:17:35] I think they know about him I don't think he may be in time but I don't I don't think they let it rule their lives which is the Graham Hill was a huge thing in our lives apart from me and my elder sister but not so much my younger sister but his absence was a big thing in her life but for our lives it was all about this thing called Graham Hill you know which was a kind of concept which over touched everything you did you borrow a quote from Lincoln dearly yeah well well so I believe it was Lincoln who originally said if you have six hours to chop down a tree is it him wouldn't you spend four of them sharpening your ax yeah you basically paraphrase that is if you had ten years to chop down a tree you spend nine of them sharpening your ax yeah the way I read that is that it took a while for you to put this book together you had there really you had to sort a lot of things out before you could write this story that's right I couldn't really put pen to paper for that and so I felt like

[02:18:35] I knew I had a foundation or something I can you know write it on because you know it's all over the place with my ideas my thoughts about things you know I just think I used to listen to programs on on radio for about philosophy and mathematics stuff that comes into your head like gödel's theory of incompleteness and Vic and Stein's where we cannot speak there or we must remain silent I mean these things are very profound you can only have it's being or nothingness it's which is such as argument you know if there either is something or there isn't how do you get something out of nothing and no sort of thoughts and it would be for me I had to get some sort of bloody answers from from somewhere and you know and then you realize they spent an awful lot of time energy trying to work them out and they were appalled at smarter than me and they didn't get there well they they didn't get answer you know nobody got an answer but tell me who's got the answer

[02:19:43] Peter maybe maybe you're the man no no no I I definitely don't have the answers but I I think I'm just really impressed with the journey it's this journey you've been on that is and I don't really amazing it's a journey that is well-worn it's a journey that men and women I keep saying and women all of us humans have been making for thousands of years we've all asked everybody's gone through or in every epoch they've been wanting to know these answer see we're cool and it's natural to want to know those answers and I think it's you hear the writings and the philosophies of ancient civilizations they're all fascinating and have some kernel of truth in them that somehow got appreciated by another group of people somewhere else without the influence of Western civilization or something like that you know it's it's something that is eternal and something which is profoundly compelling about being a human being I mean I was going to mention something so here's something when when I was quite depressed I had a tree that was given to me a tree a tree which was given to me for my 40th birthday by a famous rock band person who couldn't make it to my party and it was a trick piece tree it was an olive tree okay so I had this olive tree which

[02:21:10] I kind of treasured and I thought I really must plant this tree and get it water at some point and it got attacked by a fits or some sort of bug mm-hmm so I spent ages picking these bugs off the thing I didn't want it to kill the tree but I was killing the bugs so I'm thinking hang on what do I do do I let them kill the tree do I kill the bugs do I leave it do I leave it be do I not have any involvement what is my purpose here you know what what should I be doing that's the kind of stuff that stops you in your tracks when you when you're heavily you know in those mindsets you kind of get caught between those unresolvable questions maybe I just Chuck the whole thing in the skip but hey I think you're special in the sense that I don't think enough people spend time thinking about these things I mean I think these these are the human questions and it's really easy to just not think about them it's really easy to live a life that is unexamined i

[02:22:19] I don't think I examine my life as closely as I can because quite frankly it's not it's not comfortable I would say Peter I think I don't do it as much as I used to I actually now I've got to the point where I go I think that's an unanswerable one I think we'll just let that one go and actually that it's liberating in that sense you know I don't have to stop everything until I've got an answer to that when you look at that same painting today the painting that starts with the the Sun and it gets darker and darker as you go down the painting that once made you think I don't want to go any lower where do you see yourself on that painting I'm in the sunny bit you know I don't feel like I'm gonna slip into that abyss and I think that it was the abyss was a complete loss of identity

[02:23:06] I think the abyss is no identity and I think when you have questions about your identity and you have you don't know who you are and on that point I would say what I've also realized is that identity is very much a compound of real relationship to others and this is where it becomes I think it becomes a healing thing when you recognize that who you are is what you are to other people as well as who you want to be for yourself you know well that's very well said I'm not sure I could add anything to that

[02:23:45] Damon I have really enjoyed this discussion I've wanted to speak with you for such a long time and I'm I don't remember what the first thing was that made me reach out to Luke who was obviously who introduced us and say hey if there's any chance you think Damon would be willing to speak I'd love it if you'd make that introduction but and I wish I could remember what it was but I read something that you wrote or saw something you said in an interview and I thought this is a person who is gonna have a unique perspective on a human condition I think everything that we've talked about today I think I think emphasizes that and and I'm really grateful for it and I think that I can't stress enough to people listening to this that you don't have to be a motorsport fan to enjoy your autobiography I think it's it's a great story about overcoming loss I think it's a great story about struggling with with one's identity and I think anybody that reads it's gonna get something out of it special so I thank you for writing it because I it doesn't strike me as a book that was easy to write it was under a lot of pressure but I think it sort of eventually unfolded it very surprisingly to me I you know I think I'm a believer in things coming to fruition and then there's the right time for things and I do want to say thanks very much indeed for your kind words about the book and compliments and I'm not uncomfortable in with receiving your praise because it's lovely to actually recognize that that is communicating isn't it and I think that someone is is connecting to your communication like that then that's that's very satisfying very fulfilling so thank you very much my pleasure thank you for everything thanks for being here thank you you can find all of this information and more at
