## Transcript

[00:00:00] Now, my hedge is, you know, how about I just stave off chronic disease as long as possible, stay as healthy as possible, stay in the game as long as possible, so that if it turns out that that was for nothing. We're sitting here, it's 10 years from now, I'm in my early 60s, and someone comes along and says, "Peter, all that stuff you did was totally unnecessary. You could have been eating Cheetos, drinking margaritas all day long. I have a pill that's going to make you 20 years old again. I would have no regrets. I would be like, I don't care. I am really glad I did what

[00:00:38] I did. Um, but I would have regret if I put my eggs in the basket that said, I'm going to drink the margaritas all day. I'm not going to exercise. I'm going to wait for the exercise pill to come along and it just doesn't come along. Sure. I also think we just have to, you know, accept, you know, one of my favorite thought experiments. Um, I forget, I was talking about this with a friend a couple of weeks ago.

[00:01:02] So, if you just consider modern human history, right? We're just talking about 250,000 years. I don't Let's Let's forget everything that came before Homo sapiens. You go back in time 250,000 years ago, 200,000 years ago, 150. You do this in like 50,000 increments until you hit 10,000 years ago and then 5,000 years ago and then 2500 years ago and then 1,000 years ago. And you go in and you ask them to predict the future, letting them see everything that's happened before because of course that would be a difficult thing to do most points in time. They don't even know anything beyond their like what's the future? You're like, oh [ __ ] I went back too far. Yeah. Yeah. And it's sort of like it would be impossible to imagine because the pace of change during that 250,000 years was pretty much nothing, right? Then you know 5,000 years ago we get agriculture. Um then you know a couple hundred years ago we get you know the industrial revolution like we really start the first industrial revolution. We start to get these big step function changes. But even if you go back in time a hundred years so hundred years we're in the roaring 20s. life couldn't be any better. Nobody knows that there's this depression coming. Nobody knows what technology is coming. You know, all of these things. So, we couldn't predict anything. You go back in time, 40 years,

[00:02:20] I don't think anybody could have predicted what we're doing today. Ray Curtzwell successfully did. What did Ray predict? Almost everything. Probably about is it 70 if you're conservative? 60 to 70% accuracy, which is wild because the baseline accuracy is zero. And if you're if you're not conservative and

[00:02:43] you was able to predict a substantial amount of correct predictions all the way through the 2020s and he was the almost the only person to predict the arrival of artificial general intelligence as interestingly enough specifically the year 2029. Um, and now there is a debate of he was probably too conservative and AGI will be here by 2027. In the early 2000s, they did a lot of asking questions of AI experts, people working in the space, and almost all of them said Ry was an insane person and uh about half of them said we could never actually create artificial general intelligence. The other ones were like, "Oh, in 2100 or 2070 and uh every 5 years that you ask this, everyone trends closer and closer to Ray Curtzwhile's original prediction." He's not doing magic. So earlier you said something kind of interesting. You said uh we start at 250,000 years ago, then we got to 125, then 50, then so on. As you said, that things get faster. Uh progress happens exponentially quicker.

[00:03:47] But if you plot every single event on human and animal history and geological history, it all plots on the same logarithmic scale, very very tight clustering. And right around 2045, the lines [ __ ] vertical. And so when I make predictions, which are not mine, I'm just paring what other smarter people have said of possibly getting traction on almost every kind of disease in the 2030s. This isn't the wishful thinking of a child, though mentally I'm below the average child, at least in my own heart. Um, this is something that is inevitable based on our incremental understanding and manipulation of the world. It is the most accurate type of prediction that you could make, bereft of exact knowledge, because it's the thing that tracks on that exponential progression. If we're pessimistic about it, we're actually estimating that things will somehow progress substantially less than they have been.

[00:04:44] Computing power is an easy one. That curve of computing power in the early 2020s, people were like, "That's it. Moore's law is dead." But then AI picked up the pace and it's outpacing Moors law like crazy. Exactly on the trajectory that Ray Kurtzwhile was the first one, probably the best, to formalize. So when

[00:05:02] I'm saying crazy [ __ ] like we're going to kibash aging, we're going to kabash disease and all this other stuff, it's tantamount to someone in the 1930s peak depression era days to hear that in the 2020s you can make $16 an hour working at McDonald's and that in the United States the poorest people are the fattest. They'd be like, "You're out of your [ __ ] mind." And you're like, "No, no, no. It's totally true. Like I'm in the future. It's totally true." and like, "So, what do you do for a living?"

[00:05:32] Can you imagine describing to a person 1930s what you do for a living? You're like, "Well, social media." And they're like, "What's that?" You're like, "Oh god, how do we even put this to you?" And we're still working in the same physical world. We're really the same humans. But anytime we think, "Oh, gez, there's no way it's going to get this good, all disease eradicated. Hold on a sec. When's the last time you've treated a patient with chalera?" Do we have chalera in the modern western world anymore? Yeah. I think th this is this is um where I'm less optimistic. No, no less no more confident to be clear. So so I want to I want to be very clear that I could be wrong about all this by the way. Yeah. I but but just as a you know a point of discussion I my optimism is less around not everything you said I agree with in terms of compute velocity etc.

[00:06:19] Um it comes down to the manipulation of biology where I I think um certain things would need to be true to undo. So So I'll give you a a silly example, right? Do we believe that in 10 years we will be able to take a pro an an egg that has been put into a frying pan, fried, the clear part has turned white, and make the white part clear again?

[00:06:45] Like do we think 10 years will bring the technology to do that? Yeah. Hell yeah. And but why why do we think that we'll be able to unfold proteins again? Because um Google's Deep Mind project just mastered protein folding last year and this earlier this year it took the first open contracts with major pharmaceutical companies. Again, I'm very familiar with it, but that's a very that's a that's a remarkable problem for which obviously a

[00:07:10] Nobel Prize was awarded, but a very different problem. like I'm just not sure that the entropy will allow the reversal. Right? So what DeepMind did again it's incredible that they could actually take an amino acid sequence and predict the protein structure in folding. But when the protein has folded, right, which is why the egg goes from clear to white in the pan, how do we how do we undenure that?

[00:07:39] Yeah. through industrially designed enzymes which we do not have the brain power to design but for for which I'll put this as as well as I can for which in the 2030s AI will be comically overpowered for because we think we're very complex and by our own standards we're insanely complex but AI is so much smarter than us already in many of the relevant ways and soon to be way smarter than us to a degree agree that most of us have difficulty conceptualizing. I mean, just a quick analogy, imagine explaining to your dog why the only season inside of your house is a a light summer day. Peter doesn't know what seasons are. It's total communicative throughput involves gestures and emotions. It knows its name. It knows sit. It knows a few other things. You can't do it. It's impossible.

[00:08:37] AI as predicted by these very simple equations which have never steered us wrong of how smart it's going to be in 10 years in 10 years will be like probably several orders of magnitude smarter than us than we are than dogs. So it sounds like wishful thinking and hope. No doubt many of the comments in this will be like this guy's an idiot lunatic. Fair play. I don't necessarily think that. They might they might look at me and say, "Peter, you you you are so pessimistic.

[00:09:07] How can you be so pessimistic?" Or or or it's not that I'm pessimistic. It's how can you not be more optimistic? Uh but but nevertheless, yeah. Sure. Sure. Um the solutions to the problems that we're seeking to systems that intelligence, should they choose to solve them, can be uh for lack of a better term, pedestrian in nature. and they're going to be dealing with problems that are much more complex than the re-engineering of a human biology. So for me, when the raw compute and the raw understanding of how to manipulate matter and energy to get kind of any kind of shape you want at a given energy input, when that's there, the only question is like are we going to try to do it or not? And that's where I come back to the incentives and constraints problem.

[00:09:53] The biggest hurdle to the development of advanced pharmarmacology and genetic engineering and so on to do this kind of thing is going to be regulatory in nature. Hands down. FDA everything's off by 5 or 10 years. It sucks. But once AI has enough time to cook on these problems, the candidate drugs released will run through trials with just an unreal record. But why? Because if you have very not so good at things, AI it's decent. No, but like AI is going to do a great job at the first step of the process, which is what's the molecule, right? Like right now it's trial and error. It's brute force. It's super painful. Yeah. Not anymore. Right now, exactly. Alpha changes that. Yeah.

[00:10:40] How is AI going to streamline the phase one trial where we have to prove once we have the IND Oh, yeah. No, no, it doesn't streamline it at all. It just flies through it like it knocks out phase one, knocks out phase two, knocks out phase three market. So you can say we get to phase two to phase three, it's still going to take a decade. Oh, totally. But at the end of that decade, we have super drugs hitting the market all at the same time as opposed to incremental process. The increments are all handled up front by the AI and that last decade is just like we just got to do this. Yeah. So your example would be it's like coming up with reatride in 2014 when we had llutide as the first generation GLP1 that sucked. Yep. We already knew how to build retatraide back then and we could have just done it. No one cared because the money wasn't there slash there's lots of other candidate drugs you could work on.

[00:11:29] That's interesting. I hadn't really thought of that. Yeah. So if the AI is powerful enough, it'll just give you candidates that are just killers right off hand. It's like but how will it know that? Because again this is such a silly philosophical discussion but like didn't we kind of need to see that okay semiglutide was better than lagglutide but we had to see you could you I don't know if this was predictable you had to actually see the experience to then go from semiglutide to tzepatide and realize that oh like maybe it's the gip as well as the GLP that's really good and Yes. Now when we look at the pipeline, it's it's different. So I I do wonder I mean again it's a it's a it's a very tantalizing proposition, but I wonder how much of it can be figured out through simulation, which is what would be necessary eventually all of it. Uh but I'll give you the second rung of what's starting to happen now. The second rung, the first rung is a candidate drugs based on protein structure alone.

[00:12:34] And will that protein structure fold into the receptor we're targeting well enough to give us some activity? Y the second phase is this sounds funny to say but is computationally going to be tractable quite soon. Simulating every single protein in the human body and seeing how that candidate drug interacts with every single other protein and then you just optimize the selection criteria for dialogically. Are you familiar with

[00:13:03] Jeeperon aka Exua? A a new major depressive disorder medication. So Jeepperone, the trade name is Exua uh is uh what class? Target SSRI, I think. And it only targets the serotonin receptors in specific parts of the brain as opposed to just like you're going to get it all. And so it has seemingly no more probability to reduce sex drive or alter consumption of food patterns than a placebo. And and that's not even developed with AI. That's just a more selective targeting. We can get almost 100 to zero ratio targeting with that phase 2 approach. Now you just want muscle growth and skeletal muscles only.

[00:13:47] You got it entirely AIdriven. And when the first phase one participant takes that first pill, there's an almost 100% chance that they're just going to be like, "Holy crap, what else do you feel? How's your blood work?" Everything's totally normal because we've tested it on every single other receptor in the human body. There are definitely bumps in the road with that. It's not quite just that simple, but it's on the way there. And the last thing in the world

[00:14:11] I'd ever want to do is to think, "Oh, AI's over." Every now and again you hear like, "Oh, AI is overrated. It's overhyped." In my view, there is no overhyping AI. Short of like, "It's magical and it's going to be here tomorrow and we'll never die." Fine. Okay. It's a few years to too offc center, but um the power of computing all of this and then using that computation to test it in the human body and getting iterative loops on that is to me not to be understated. And if somehow biology is somehow magically intractable for older folks or whatever, um I think that um scanning of the human brain and brain machine interface and mind uploading is going to happen by the 2040s anyway. And then it doesn't matter what the hell your body's like, you live in the cloud. Yeah, I've thought about that a bunch. I'm not sure I like it.

[00:15:05] Why not? [Music]
