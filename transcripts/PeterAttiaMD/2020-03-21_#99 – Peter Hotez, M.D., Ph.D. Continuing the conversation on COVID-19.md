## AI Summary

Here's my analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast with Dr. Peter Hotez:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This follow-up episode with Dr. Peter Hotez, recorded on March 19, 2020, focuses on the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation. Key topics include the impact on healthcare workers, testing challenges, transmission dynamics, and potential treatments. The discussion emphasizes how quickly information and understanding of the virus was changing, with particular concern about younger patients being affected more severely than initially thought.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Confirmed US cases at 13,000 but likely much higher due to limited testing [00:05:33]
- Young adults (20-44) making up about 1/3 of hospitalized cases [00:26:34]
- Virus can survive on surfaces for varying periods; cardboard and other materials discussed [00:23:14]
- Blood type may influence susceptibility to infection [00:26:05]
- Temperature of 56°C (133°F) for 15 minutes required to kill virus [00:48:04]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Practice social distancing [throughout episode]
- Consider wiping down packages with approved disinfectants [00:46:26]
- Maintain mental health during isolation [00:49:56]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Medications discussed:
- Hydroxychloroquine potential benefits [00:35:28]
- Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir) study results [00:41:55]
- ACE inhibitors and ARBs discussion [00:37:08]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"This is our third coronavirus pandemic in the 21st century" [00:39:50]

"The psychological devastation of the United States I think is gonna be almost as big as the damage from the infection" [00:54:55]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
- Long-term immunity after infection
- Impact of different blood types on susceptibility
- Mental health strategies during prolonged isolation
- Optimal protection protocols for healthcare workers
- Role of military in pandemic response

The episode provides valuable insights into the early pandemic response and highlights many concerns that would later prove prescient. The discussion of healthcare worker protection and mental health impacts was particularly forward-thinking for March 2020.

[00:00:03] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter Atia this podcast of my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness . and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level at the end of this episode I'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to

[00:00:42] Peter Atia MD com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode welcome back to another köppen 19 special episode of the dr podcast and once again joined by dr. Peter Hotez renowned vaccine scientist pediatrician and an expert on the current coronavirus outbreak we released an episode with

[00:01:04] Peter on March 14th which received a lot of feedback people were very grateful for that and wanted to have him back on with other questions it is difficult to immediately address questions that are posed in the aftermath of a podcast that's five days old because five days in this outbreak is an eternity so a lot of the stuff we talked about today is not actually stuff I thought I would talk about with Peter at the time that we finished our last episode and again that means it might not be germane a week from now but nevertheless this was recorded March 19th in the late afternoon evening and as such it's probably only as relevant as that timing given the temporal nature of things at this moment in time I think podcasts become pretty obsolete pretty quickly so hopefully you're all able to listen to this today March 20th or shortly thereafter moving forward I will continue to release shorter and more irregular podcasts probably trying to get out two or three a week also I'll continue to post videos on Instagram and eventually they'll make their way onto

[00:02:08] YouTube usually the next day again everything at this point in time is open to subscribe nonsubscribers equally and we're also in the process of putting together a specific page on our site that's at Peter Atia MD com that will house all of the information we're posting on this SARS CO v2 virus that's the responsible agent for the disease known as kovat 19 so again podcast now with Peter please enjoy it keep in mind hopefully within a couple of days we'll aggregate all of this stuff all podcasts all videos plus all of the internal memos that we are sending to our patients we're just gonna start putting all of that stuff out there for everyone and that'll be on our site so hopefully you enjoy my discussion here today with dr. Peter

[00:02:55] Hotez hey Peter thank you so much for making time again to speak I know it was less than a week ago that we sat down to do this but a week in terms of this coronavirus seems like a year with respect to the knowledge and insight that we're gaining with respect to everything else in health care I really appreciate the opportunity to be on this was our first podcast together and maybe it was the topic but the response has been extraordinary I've been getting emails and texts from people so many individuals and all of them really enthusiastic and supportive and saying that we did such a good job explaining some complicated science and and asking questions that people who actually wanted to know the answer to but maybe never articulated before and tied so many things together and connected a lot of dots and then in a few cases we've even gotten people reaching out asking if they can help to support our vaccine development efforts and we've had some a lot of really good follow-up so thank you again for that opportunity

[00:04:06] I was really also impressed with expected to hear only from either physicians or healthcare professionals but I've heard apparently this podcast is reaching people in all walks of life and people who just really are kind of sick of things so dumbed down in the mainstream media so I think we hit a really good level well thank you that means a lot coming from you and I agree

[00:04:29] I've sort of always rejected the notion that people need dumbed down sound bites I think that's probably just a an assumption that when really vetted is probably not true for the majority of people I think if people in medicine signs can explain things clearly and patiently then I don't think you need to have a great background in this to understand complicated topics and this is a case in point I think that's also why you know I've been asked to come back to CNN Fox and MSNBC is because I'm willing to take a little bit of time and explain complicated concepts and provided I can get more than 30 seconds or a minute or two it seems to resonate well with people that's what people want to hear they don't want to hear dumb dumb crap they want to hear real things and want to understand the nuance and know that certain things are complicated and that we don't have all the answers yeah so Peter I want to talk about a few things that have sort of changed in the last week obviously from a confirmed cases standpoint at the time of this recording which is Thursday afternoon

[00:05:33] March 19th were a little over 13,000 cases confirmed in the United States but I think it's safe to assume that that's a small fraction of the true number of infected patients do you have a sense of what range you would apply to the true number of infected people a couple of things first of all you're seeing every day it's a big jump every day is the largest number of new Kovac cases that we've ever seen when I last looked it was just this morning it was just under ten thousand now you're telling me it's 13 and before then I think it was eighty five hundredths and seven thousand so undoubtedly a lot of that is we're finally getting some testing underway and it's starting to catch up with the actual population who's infected and and where this goes I think is going to be very interesting I don't think we have a real sense of the percentage of the population infected I think what's happening is not necessarily that this is even new transmission these a lot of this are probably areas that have been undergoing transmission for few weeks but we're just picking it up now so I think that's an important component and you know there are models that say for every person you identify there's 50 more 20 more but it I don't know how strong the assumptions are for those models so I think we have a lot but I think what's more telling is just hearing from physicians at major hospitals from all over the country from

[00:07:05] Philadelphia Baltimore New York and elsewhere saying they are just taking care a lot of patients and they're already feeling overwhelmed even this early in the epidemic and that says to me that this thing is now revving up despite what the actual numbers of tested cases say and it also tells me that one of my worst fears and nightmares that I talked about in the last podcast and I've been rattling the cage about is coming true that this thing is rapidly approaching overwhelming health systems and doctors and nurses other health professionals are starting to get exposed in getting sick and with that is a lot of worry also a lot of heroism on the part of health professionals but I'm very worried right now that we're not doing all we can even close to protect one of our most cherished resources in this country which are our health care professionals and I think we're really seeing this rev up now and a few weeks ago I testified in Congress and I was alarmed at the fact that we weren't paying attention to our nursing facilities and assisted care living facilities and the fact that we've had 25 deaths in that nursing home in

[00:08:26] Washington State in Kirkland that's when I used the liberally provocative language in Congress and said this is the angel of death and I knew it was going to get on make a lot of headlines and it did but it got people's attention this week felt I had to do it again I went on CNN Newsday with Allison Cammarata and and I had to do it again because I'm so frustrated that we're exposing some of our nation's greatest treasures our healthcare professionals to this virus without making them feel safe or protected in any way and I said look if a significant number of healthcare professionals start either self quarantine or actually getting sick or if you have the situation where colleagues are gonna start taking care of colleagues who are very sick or in intensive care units the term I use it'll be lights out by lights out I mean this whole thing is over things will unravel in this nation very fast and you know I knew I was again being very provocative but sometimes you have to do it to get people's attention and now I think it's starting to register the question is can we mount an efficient response to figure this out

[00:09:39] Peter you alluded to this idea of do we have a sense of how many people are infected as a function of how many people are confirmed so the actual to confirmed case multiplier we've been building one of these models ourselves we've looked at other people that have built them I've seen people estimate that look it can't be less than 45 to 50 our internal estimate which i think is very conservative is probably closer to 25 and what it's basically doing is trying to figure out what is the assumed number of days from an infection until a fatality and then what is the assumed infectious fatality rate and obviously it becomes very sensitive to both of those but if we pause it for a moment that it's on the most conservative side of those estimates in the neighborhood of 10 to 20 do you consider that a positive or negative sign in other words if right now there are quote unquote only a hundred and twenty five thousand people infected in the United States are we in good shape we may or may not be because remember those 125,000 are not evenly spread across the country let's say it's 200,000 just for argument's sake what that really means is there may be 30 or 40,000 cases in the New York area and things are getting scary very quickly and there may be another similar number in Washington or California or the couple of places where there's known transmission and basically just a handful of cases maybe in Texas or places like that so the question then is if you're modeling how you're going to do this way you really want to look at as a map of the US and you're gonna see a bunch of let's say use red is your color to mark the number of cases you're going to see a red blob smallish red blob over New York and what Seattle maybe one or two other places and it's those blobs that are gonna start to grow and then you're going to see other small red dots appear in the country and they're gonna start to grow and then it's going to be the question of whether those blobs begin to coalesce across the country so that's how it's going to work it's not the absolute number of cases in the US you know it's interesting because the United States is so large you want to look at those nodes of where there's significant levels of infection and and see how they grow and intensify in color and what I'm hearing from Governor Cuomo he's really sounded the alarm in a very effective way and that's what we're gonna be in for for the next few weeks or months is a New York like situation starting to pop up in other parts of the country yeah that makes a lot of sense let's go from that then onto some testing because testing is now going to figure into this of course I can't get a straight answer from anybody so I'm curious as to whether you have an insight as to why the CDC an FDA elected to go with Roche for the testing kit when they were very late to this as opposed to using one of the companies in

[00:12:50] China that had already done literally millions of tests and had pretty robust data on sensitivity specificity etc I don't know how they made any of their decisions around testing it's clear they should have gone to commercial kits from the very beginning I'm getting asked a lot of questions about what's gone wrong in the testing what's gone wrong in the hospital response and I've sort of deflected the questions a bit because right now if we have to really focus on the matter at hand I think what's going to happen is when we get through all this whether it's in a year from now or 18 months from now or or sooner there's gonna have to be some type of independent committee to really look into the missteps and it's not for the purposes of being punitive it's for the purposes of trying to figure out how to fix this when a new pandemic emerges next time so we don't make so many of the same mistakes and and I think we'll see a number of flaws that went on with some of the agencies I think we'll see some of the flaws that went on on the communication between the federal and local governments and and state governments and that may require us to enact some new legislation to fix it but it's just been so exasperated to see how this has been rolled out we didn't have a lot of time of notice but we did have time it's not like we didn't have any idea was coming we had at least a month arguably two months to know what was going to hit the United States and we also saw pretty quickly that this was not going to stay confined to central

[00:14:32] China or even China it moved pretty quickly the Asian countries and even when it was starting off in Italy we were still pretty slow on the uptake so the fact that we did not have a faster trigger is gonna be really interesting and it's impossible to know right now where the fault lies I have some suspicions which I could share in private with you but I don't think it's gonna help us right now to to start pointing fingers but now it's a matter of figuring out how we rapidly fix this because now unfortunately now that we're starting now to fix the first phase the testing but we still have a ways to go we're already moved into the second phase where health systems are already being stressed and I'm worried it's gonna be close to collapse in a couple of weeks unless we can figure this out

[00:15:23] New York is already reeling we are seeing the anxiety on people's faces in the new york hospital system and I'm very concerned now Pierre what do you think is going to be the rate limiting step in healthcare delivery in an area like New York or other areas that are going to be sort of epicenters for this do you think it will be the health care providers do you think it will be ventilators do you think it will be PPE for the healthcare providers where do you actually think the breakdown occurs well I see the first breakdown starting to happen with doctors and nurses already exhausted already demoralized to some extent and people feeling that no one is really looking after them and they're kind of on their own so we've already had that initial breakdown of trusts can you say more about that Peter I want to make sure I understand what is that resulting from is that due to a belief that the the system isn't providing them with the necessary equipment to protect themselves or the necessary resources to take care of patients where is that disdain or lack of trust coming from well I think it's coming from seeing colleagues get sick and inconsistency and what the plan is a lot of hospitals have them prepared for this adequately not seeing also this disconnect from what they're seeing coming out of the state government or federal governments when they're very worried about for themselves and their families they're seeing colleagues start to get sick they're hearing stories of some colleagues being seriously ill and either it's the White House still two or three weeks behind still having the testing discussion or state governor's not really saying we hear you we know you're concerned here's what our plan is is chilling actually I think the as I say the only one now because it's New

[00:17:26] York it's higher profile and all the media outlets are in New York the only governor I'm hearing from on a regular basis is Cuomo and he clearly gets it and has sounded the alarm but I'm concerned and I'm also hearing about from parents of residents or residents themselves and then on top of that now the latest story that's come out of both MMWR the morbidity mortality weekly report from the CDC as well as Italy is that this is no longer a disease of the old and infirm it's significant numbers of young adults people who are residents fellows young attending age actually now with severe illness and going into I see use in this country and that buzz is already catching on among young physicians and that's highly destabilizing and I think that's probably our biggest link right now eventually it will be the lack of respirators and lack of PPE but I think right now it's the fact that you're seeing young physicians and nurses people in the best years of their life now getting sick and the feeling that they're feeling abandoned and I'm getting that sense from either direct emails from nurses and physicians thanking me for speaking out and echoing their concerns and in many cases it's parents of resident physicians and young and nurses as well and that we're starting to see that being a regular occurrence right now so what is the solution to that Peter because we can't obviously on a moment's notice ramped up the number of doctors nurses respiratory therapists hospital staff I mean everybody in the hospital right it's the people that we don't even necessarily immediately think about the people who clean the ventilators the people who clean the hospitals I mean all of these people are not going to be trained overnight so how do we solve this problem when going back to your earlier point if you look at average numbers across the United States it's very easy to be misled this is really going to be probably about local waves of this so is the solution that we are mobilizing physicians from geographies that are under utilized into higher utilization areas how do we actually go about solving this problem well the problem is the areas that are likely kovat 19 are also probably underserved already by physicians I know we're all sort of thinking out loud and I thought about that too but realistically what do you do take a physician who sir the entire county an entire County in western Nebraska and take them to New

[00:20:07] York to help out that's probably not realistic either maybe not as a rate as an example but again I don't know what it's like in the Houston area right now or in Dallas or other major metropolitan areas that are not New York I mean could one repurpose medical staff from those areas to deal with the first wave in the places that are very likely to be overwhelmed quickly yeah on the other hand it could be but then if you actually talk to physicians in areas where there's not Cove in 19 it's not like they're not already stressed out and already overburdened with their daily activities and the electronic health records and and everything else so the whole system to begin with has been pretty fragile with very high rates of what some people call physician burnout which is a term I don't like it all but it's not really burnout it's making these horrible unreasonable demands on physicians and and health care providers to benefit the insurance companies so you've already got stressed-out young physicians who are heavily under siege and now you're gonna bring them into a Cove in 19 area I'm not sure so the bottom line is I don't have I don't have an any obvious solution to figuring this out one possibility that I've thought about and haven't introduced it to anybody yet is could we dramatically expand the US

[00:21:38] Public Health Service especially with all these individuals who were at home now and in some cases not receiving a paycheck would there be any advantage offered to have this use a commissioned core of the Public Health Service or even the military to bring in a whole cadre I'm not highly trained individuals but individuals that you could train like medics to help out just to provide an increase in the number of people who can help manage ventilators and that sort of thing so that's one potential possibility and then the question we're not quite there yet it's gonna be very hard to persuade Congress to take that kind of action so Peter what is the latest thinking you have on things that people who are presumably not infected so either asymptomatic or confirmed to be not infected which is a very small number in the latter category because of the dearth of testing the things can do to sort of reduce the probability of getting infected so the obvious one that we've discussed of course is social distancing but let's say someone has already sort of adopted that posture and now they're sort of asking the second-order question which is look I'm basically working from home my kids are no longer in school what am I supposed to do with my Amazon package when it arrives what's the probability that virus is being transmitted across that how much insight do we have into the real transmissibility of this I don't think we have a lot of data you saw this week this paper in the New England

[00:23:14] Journal of Medicine that measured length of time on the virus on inert surfaces and I actually did an interview of ProPublica asking me about the u.s. mail is that contaminated with virus and what should we do and maybe we know that the virus can live for a certain number of hours on cardboard that's been looked at but then the question is how relevant is that really and what's the real risk I think for me the priority is protecting people who are coming into contact with sick individuals and I come back to the health care providers and the first responders and you saw how the CDC is now managed it so they came out with new guidelines this week which kind of loosened the criteria for exposure and what exposure means and basically saying you could stay in the workforce and keep doing what you're doing depending on the intensity of the exposure and I think it's sort of a desperation move but it may be something that we need to do in order to keep people in the workforce I come back to what we introduced last time we spoke which is the antibody therapy but not using it as a treatment but using his prophylaxis I think that could potentially help a lot so the idea is when you harvest antibodies from individuals who've gotten sick and recovered have antibodies you apheresis their blood you recover the plasma component maybe isolate the antibodies if you give a big dose of that you could potentially treat someone who's sick but a small dose of it like a 5 ml dose you could use that as a form of prophylaxis and the antibody would last a couple of weeks so that a single injection can potentially greatly reduce the likelihood you're going to become infected as a health care provider or a first responder for a period of two weeks and then you subsequently get another dose as we discuss it's an ancient method but now refined using better technology so the White House actually came out today in their press conference and actually talked about this I brought it on national TV on CNN and Fox a week ago and now it's out there saying that the federal government is going to do it what's interesting is in the meantime over the last couple of weeks a number of academic health centers have started to put together a network of blood banks to actually start this and what I've heard is that none of them have actually been contacted by the federal government yet so I think we got to resolve that why there's that disconnect that this informal network that's already started is not better linked with the White House announcement today in the comments of the new FDA

[00:26:05] Commissioner Steve Hahn what did you make of the recent study looking at blood type and susceptibility yeah I thought it was interesting I'm not sure what it means and I'm not sure how it's necessarily relevant to developing the plasma therapy so I think it's an interesting finding but I'm not sure how it applies just yet yeah I mean I think just for folks listening so they understand it was looking at data from

[00:26:34] China and basically observing that people with a type blood had an increased risk of infection people with otai PUD reduce risk I think the hazard ratio on the downside was more impressive than on the upside in other words it was more about having Oh blood and therefore anti a antibodies that seemed to be somewhat protective so again does that really matter as you said maybe maybe not it certainly isn't immunity that's the point I mean the way that potentially convalescent serum could be since we spoke there's been a few interesting observations now and people that are scrambling to understand it better I think one of course is in parallel the studies out of Italy and and the younger age group getting infected and seriously ill and the question is why didn't we see that in China I think that is interesting this very high number of seriously ill hospitalized people between the ages of 20 and 40 I think it's now in the u.s. accounting for a third of the hospitalized is it that high I saw a report today that was about 25% and I was going to ask you the question you're opposing which is what on earth can account for this difference in the United States it's the most disturbing thing I think I've seen today yeah so I think the number that I saw was around third first of all half of those hospitalized are under the age of 54 which is very different from what you saw in China and those and about a third between 20 and 44 is the number of 29 30 percent is the number that I saw and there is even a blip of people under 19 so that's a big question and I think the numbers are going to turn out to be somewhat similar in Italy now it's been pointed out that those individuals are not dying but I said this morning that well even if they're not dying if their can imagine if their being in ICUs and intubated that is still a horrible ordeal for a young person to go through and if we have that happening over and over again that's a huge tax on the system I don't know I mean the question of whether smoking is responsible or even vaping has been raised we'll have to do the epidemiology and what the mechanism is we know smoking can the up regulate the ACE to receptor for the virus I don't know that anybody's looked at vaping but trying to understand what it is about young people that's different in Europe in the u.s. or maybe it's just genetics and genetic factor but well there's something different and I'll read to you something it's a photo that was taken and sent to one of my colleagues from someone he knows in London today so the piece of paper is just the ages of the people they admitted to the ICU today this is a hospital in London I'll read them off to you 46 2268 6151 71 32 29 28 37 34 32 he then also showed me a picture of the 34 year olds chest x-ray and it is effectively a complete whiteout so again will these patients survive hopefully most of them will but as you said they're not out of the woods because the long-term the tale of this on morbidity is significant I found a study yesterday that looked at 10-year follow-up on the Tsarskoe v1 patients the survivors and the amount of cardiac disease and pulmonary disease in those patients was not trivial suggesting there was some lingering effect of that virus yeah and the other interesting finding when you look at the papers on

[00:30:23] Med archive from the Chinese experience there's a lot of what they're calling a cute heart injury and it's not really clear what's going on there whether that's a viral myocarditis or whether it potentially whether they're just having myocardial infarcts because of the a RDS and shock but you're seeing a lot of heart injury and I suspect that's probably accounting for a high percentage of the deaths as well so the first thing people want to say is this is virus mutating and I'm always suspicious when people are quick to claim it's mutation I'm guessing not but we'll have to unravel that but we need really good epidemiology now on those younger patients to try to understand what the differences are you know Peter I've been asked this question a bunch and my usual answer is probably in the short-term but not sure in the long-term and the question is once a person is infected and recovers do they have lasting immunity and obviously the convalescence serum experiments would suggest at least in the short term there's immunity do we think we have an insight into that in other words is just to speculate is this something in your mind based on other coronaviruses that looks like a seasonal virus like influenza or more of the type of virus where once you have immunity it's largely life lasting I think there's a paper on mid archive or bio archive out this week on non-human primates showing that once you're infected they're immune to reinfection whether that's applicable to humans is hard to know but I'm gonna work on the premise that that exposure infection will probably confirm immunity but the flu of course is a different story because of all the antigenic drift and variation but then the other questions that have come up this week are around these projections from the federal government and the report that they just released saying that they think this pandemic will last 18 months and I'm trying to understand what those assumptions are I think they might be out of models from an imperial college which look at the fact that this virus may go down in the summer but come back in the fall and then potentially be seasonal after that until eventually enough people are infected and therefore rendered immune from the virus and I'm guessing that's how the 18-month estimate is coming from the other thing

[00:32:56] I'm hearing and I hope it's not the case is that I've been told that the 18-month is because they're anticipating after that we're going to have the vaccine ready to go and and I've really been downplaying expectations of having a vaccine in 18 months or at least a rapidly deployable vaccine in 18 months

[00:33:16] I think we have to be more realistic about that in terms of going through all of the adequate safety we're just now only have the first vaccine and clinical trials with the technology that's never been shown to turn into a licensed vaccine so I think we're gonna be looking at five or six we want to be fully underway for a while so even though I think we're hearing numbers like a year 18 months from my estimate I think it's probably more likely much longer than that so I hope that the models of ending this pandemic are not depending on having the availability of a vaccine I think we have to proceed as though we're not going to have one in the near future now having said that I'm more optimistic about having a lot of new technologies come out like the convalescent antibody but we're hearing some interesting things about new drugs especially some of the repurposed drugs because the new chemical entities will also take a while but not nearly as long as a vaccine speaking of repurposed drugs yesterday the New England Journal of Medicine published a paper looking at Collett rrah it was at the top level viewed as a negative study but I think many people ourselves included have looked at that and said I think the only thing we learned from that is giving collectorate to people who are on death's door is probably not helpful how did you interpret that paper it could be you know people often think that antiviral drugs are like antibacterial drugs and they seldom have that same dramatic effect I mean clearly the HIV story is amazing in the and the lamivudine story for hepatitis C is amazing but more typically it's you don't see that dramatic impact of antiviral drugs so you very well might be right I wouldn't throw it out just yet there's been a lot of discussion about hydroxychloroquine and there's some interesting in vitro data on showing hydroxychloroquine inhibits replication of the virus also it has some anti-inflammatory effects and then Didier Raul from Marseilles who's I've known him for years he's amazing infectious disease microbiologist mainly focused on

[00:35:28] Rickettsia like pathogens published a small study showing maybe there's some effect of hydroxychloroquine I think people are over maybe hyping a little much saying we have a cure we clearly have to do much larger studies but if hydroxychloroquine could ever work out or have an impact I mean it would be perfect right it's cheap you can make a bucket of it it's orally bioavailable the nice thing is you could use it not only for the US and Europe but it'd be relatively straightforward to use in low-income countries and especially if this virus is now in Africa we don't even know about or parts of Asia so that if I had a wish list and it would be X nay on wishing for my vaccine it would be I think around something like a cleric when we've also been reading about some of the ACE 2 inhibitors and the angiotensin receptor blockers and we're getting sort of a mixed picture about that depending on what paper you're reading so and especially around the AR B's the ARBs is they sometimes call them claiming that some of the common antihypertensives that we use where they're saying well on the one hand it has the ability to interfere with the ligand attachment of the virus to the ACE 2 and therefore that blocking effect should have an antiviral property others saying no no no it's actually going to up regulate the receptor and make things worse and I got an interesting email and I want to talk I'm a professor at Nova Southeastern

[00:37:08] University Robert Smith is in the School of Pharmacy he's been looking at this and he actually thinks that it could work for a totally different reason that it actually doesn't air this a lot of the air bees don't bind actually to h2 but other components of the angiotensin pathway and they have anti-inflammatory effects so so I think we're in a steep learning curve about these class of drugs in terms of their effect but we certainly should be evaluating them especially now that we're starting to get Mouse adapted virus and maybe transgenic mice with the receptor I think it's going to be a high priority to look at some of these drugs if you looked at all at chemists at it's a pretty esoteric drug it's a serine protease inhibitor I think it's only used in Japan to treat pancreatitis but some of the preliminary work looks really interesting it's a transmembrane protein and it appears to interfere with the ability to gain entry actually I think it sits right next to the ACE 2 receptor and impairs binding because there's a protease that's involved in

[00:38:15] Tsarskoe v 2 and it's a it's a subtle icing like protease which means it's a serine protease and known as furin fu rin so I'm wondering if that molecule works by interfering with the furin so that'll be a interesting story and and that's potentially a good drug target so there was a paper that came out not too long ago about the furin from this and it's relatively unique among the beta coronaviruses that this virus has it and

[00:38:46] I can't remember if SARS one has it as well or not the homology between SARS the co v1 and Co V 2 is similar but not enough that I mean there's enough commonality to them in the spike protein isn't there that if you had a effective target for one you might have luck against others which I guess is really less germane to the question today and more about the ongoing probability that these viruses aren't really going away are they yeah and we're starting to think about what is the kind of vaccine that we want to develop we have this

[00:39:19] SARS one vaccine that looks great against SARS one and we think it could be repurposed against SARS - and then the question is what should be the goal should we be focusing only on SARS - or should we really start thinking about a universal SARS vaccine and I think before SARS two came along we saw how all these other beta corona viruses were emerging out of bats and we wrote a grant to the NIH and I don't know if that one even got scored was but I think that's going to be an important approach

[00:39:50] I mean we have to learn our lesson now this is our third corona virus pandemic in the 21st century so we have to reconcile the fact that these are going to come out on a regular basis although technically really SARS and MERS probably weren't really constituted as pandemics were they I mean they were probably closer to epidemics and and this being a true pandemic potentially yes I don't remember how they are classified so SARS one of course emerged out of southern China and severely affected Canada so maybe it wasn't classified as a pandemic and and the mayor's coroner virus emerged out of the

[00:40:27] Arabian Peninsula and then affected Korea where it decimated hospitals in Korea which brings us to the other point as this is the modus operandi of corona viruses they tear through hospitals causing a lot of death and destruction the hospital personnel this is what they do this was true of SARS one it was true of Mayors and now it's looking like it's true of this one as well that knows a

[00:40:55] Kamiel transmission is a huge factor in this group of viruses and you know if I were gonna design a vaccine which we're doing in terms of the target product profile I would say a highest priority our health care provider so I think again to revisit this and we started the discussion on this but to revisit it unless we can deal with the health care provider issue in making hospitals safe places we're going to be in very deep trouble so I think that has to be a national priority and maybe the White

[00:41:30] House needs to create a specific task force around this is what are we doing to protect our frontline health care providers is it the antibody therapy should we be looking at angiotensin receptor blockers should we be looking at other the chloroquine for prophylactic purposes if we can't fix this problem really quickly I said on CNN it's lights-out but you know what

[00:41:55] I mean I think there's just no way we'll be able to manage this epidemic speaking of designing we touched on this very briefly I think the first time we spoke or maybe it was just on a time when we spoke and it was not part of the podcast but I've had discussions with some of the most intelligent people I know and they've asked not in a sort of conspiracy theory way but they asked isn't it possible that this was a virus that was designed for bio warfare that was either inadvertently got out of the lab or something I have my own logic for why I find that theory very very implausible what's your response to the implausibility or plausibility of that thesis well when the epidemic was unfolding in

[00:42:38] China and I started hearing these conspiracy theories it was easy to debunk it who's gonna design a bio weapon that's gonna kill Grandma and Grandpa I mean that's not an effective bio warfare strategy but now that we're seeing now I don't have that Pat answer and not that it's an appropriate answer anyway but now that we're seeing a number of young people affected the plausibility goes up but not by much and

[00:43:04] I just like to say you don't have to why go in that direction when we already know mother nature is one of the best bioweapons producer there is and and we know that these viruses have been it's not likely we didn't know where these viruses were before we've seen a whole family of these viruses that we actually call them SLE viruses SARS like viruses and bats and even before SARS too we were investigating our vaccine to see if across protected against the various

[00:43:39] SARS like viruses that were emerging out of bats and and it did sometimes it didn't others and so we knew that there was this whole family of bat corona viruses that are emerging on a regular basis so if you don't have to postulate a bioweapon well why do it when it's so obvious that we've got all of these viruses that ends o attic viruses that are circulating yeah I mean my response was probably a little more theoretical but it was the best bioengineers of the past two decades can barely get a crop to grow any better using GMO or insert gene vectors through genetic engineering and to adenovirus I mean it's not like genetic engineering and GMO crops have been a robust success and if that's the best and the brightest for 20 years I don't know where they found the people that could make such a good virus I mean let's you know first sort of being diabolical let's think for a minute if you were designing a bio weapon most bio weapons people would design stars one write a highly lethal virus but we actually saw that even though is a devastating disease and people who got it if you were infected you were sick pretty quickly and you were going into the hospital and you weren't walking around the community infecting others so that's why I think SARS one snuffed out pretty quickly this one is really problematic because it's not as lethal as SARS one but it's number one number two it's more transmissible and number three there is a large group of asymptomatic individuals and that's that's what creates a toxic mix for this virus because it quickly spreads throughout the community and infects it kills a small number of people but still five to 20 times more than influenza so it is that very toxic combination of not being the most lethal not being the most transmissible but high enough in both categories and all those asymptomatic individuals so in some ways it's hard to imagine one that's more diabolical but I can't imagine anybody being that clever to think about designing it in that way

[00:45:57] Peter you mentioned something on Twitter today that just assumed that when your mail is delivered to your house basically assume it's been delivered by someone who's carrying the infection whether they realize it or not what does that mean practically what can we tell people who are again getting the Ramazan packages getting their mail trying to limit their exposure what actually can be done to dramatically reduce the risk of transmission through these fomites based on the study you just quoted from

[00:46:26] England Journal of Medicine that came out I think last Friday or this week and other things we've learned just through the field of I R ology well we don't have a lot of data my gut tells me that the risk is still pretty low I mean the things that I worry about I just don't worry about getting the mail so right now I'm not doing anything I think if you're concerned you can certainly take a Clorox well first of all who gets mail any more I guess we get Amazon packages so if you get your Amazon package wipe it down with a Clorox wipe or one of the approved alcohol wipes you can certainly do that I don't see any any harm in doing that my sense is what's your real risk your real risk is close personal contact with somebody with this virus I still think that's probably the most likely mode of transmission what about food a lot of people these days are in the process of ordering food now whether that be if you live in a city like New York you're doing takeout what do we know about the temperature that it's required to be confident you've killed the virus and then what about when you're talking about groceries things that are very difficult to wash like lettuce or strawberries is this just a time to say don't eat these things or do we think that pay if you leave it out of the fridge for a couple days it's probably fine although not that you'd want to eat your lettuce if it's been sitting out of the fridge for a couple of days right now I personally have not really been doing much with produce that's different from what we usually do I mean maybe wash it more with water as the CDC put out any guidance about that I haven't even I have not seen it yeah the only thing

[00:48:04] I've seen is from the w-h-o looking at Tsarskoe v1 they published some data on temperature and again that basically suggested that 56 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes was about required to kill that virus and so you could extrapolate from that hey if you get your takeout and you at least heat it up or if you're cooking food that you can't speak to how it's been handled or it hasn't been you know otherwise sit in your freezer for a month you want to make sure this is north of 140 150 degrees Fahrenheit for me I just think it's the produce that strike me is a little bit more concerning just because the virus is going to survive a little bit longer in the cold based on the w-h-o report I saw and again maybe this is marginal maybe this doesn't matter compared to what you said a moment ago maybe just not being in close proximity to other people or people who are not inside your bubble is first second third order reduction strategy it also becomes the point I mean we're already living under such austerity measures as it is with the social isolation gets to the point where we're gonna have such a huge percentage of the population having their mental health affected by this I think there starts to be diminishing returns by doing this so unless we get some clear guidance from the CDC or FDA saying this is what we found and we're particularly concerned about that at this point I'm not doing this which gets to the whole mental health aspect just the thought of people being in their houses day in and day out it's been great for my TV ratings but quite honestly I would not want to be watching Peter Hotez day in and day out is such dreary news that I have to believe we're gonna start seeing some significant psychological impacts and

[00:49:56] I'm worried about suicide rates I'm worried about and I hope we're looking out for that because especially if this drags on so I think it's really important for the government to be a little more clear when they said it could be an 18 month pandemic to specify this doesn't mean that you live like you're living right now for 18 months I just don't think that's doable for a large population so there's going to have to be some kind of assessment there and I'm almost as worried about the mental health status of millions of

[00:50:30] Americans or people all over the world as I am the actual virus and I'm starting to hear from colleagues and family members that it's already creating a lot of hardship and also people of certain categories for instance you know I have a special-needs adult daughter and now she's her routine is totally halted now and this is putting a huge amount of stress on her and then our family as well so I would imagine people with special needs family members in the house are really struggling right now and I don't think we're too consumed with the actual infection to even think about this and should we as a nation start thinking about some kind of low-cost mental health activity and I don't know what that would be whether we create a network of providers mental health counselors who make themselves available mental health counselors with our borders something where people can maybe either it's for free or maybe just it's some really low cost where they could

[00:51:33] Skype with somebody and have that discussion I think that potentially could be a national priority as well or have the academic health centers take this on I can't agree with you more Peter I've been commenting to my wife for the past few days that the days seem to be going by very quickly in isolation but that overall time seems to be going very slowly and the irritability within me is unbelievable I mean I'm not the most sanguine guy to begin with but I think the lack of control which is probably what every person on some level feels right now

[00:52:10] I guess different people internalize that in different ways but certainly in me it just comes out as incredible irritability which may pose a greater long-term risk to my health than any coronavirus could well it's interesting my reputation is being someone who never gets angry never gets visibly upset or seldom does and within the last month at a lab meeting where I wasn't happy with the way things were going I got pretty upset and sort of an important meeting with colleagues I also got very upset and reacted in a motional way that afterwards I'd kind of sort of scared myself I said wow I can't believe I did that and sent an apology and I said what's going on here in my case it's I'm not sleeping and that's and obviously because the anxiety I'm not sleeping because we're trying to get this vaccine started through into clinical trials and all the teleconferences and documents that we have to put together and then all the media stuff because I'm doing a lot of early morning and oftentimes late night then when that happens you're only getting three or four hours sleepy you're doing that several days in a row and but I think being given the opportunity by Fox News and and MSNBC to talk to the country and explain things about this virus in a way that we're not necessarily hearing from our leaders I think that's an important opportunity so I'm doing it but that in itself is stressful also threading the needle because all three of the cable news networks are fairly politically charged and you're being asked provocative questions all the time about this and that and trying to thread that needle to say things in a way that goes beyond the politics and really addresses the virus so I think it is taking its toll I'm sort of lucky because at least

[00:53:57] I have two really big activities that I'm doing that keep me occupied with my wife and she's at home and with Rachel and her special needs adult daughter and I think in all she's got on all day is the cable news which is so dreary and I just imagine that happening millions of times over this is not going to be good for our country and and so one of the things I've started to down set it's a small thing but I've been trying to in my messaging talking about the science and a few times I've been doing this I think I'm going to be more of it as is to be upbeat about certain things not to drift into the the happy talk that's not backed by data but just talked about the fact that the United States has got this great history in times of adversity of taking on big audacious goals and and building out new technologies for this virus is one of them and that's where

[00:54:55] America shines is those big audacious goals and taking on complicated projects and coming out ahead at the end I think those kinds of things I think we need to hear more about and again I it's not some people say I mean you're gonna do you're gonna do the happy talk thing and no I that's very different I think it's it's a realistic goal and to say that we don't have to be passive about this simply just hunkering down in our apartments or our houses there we still can do great things and there's probably better messages out there than just that but I think it's gonna be important to hear more of that but again the psychological devastation the United States I think is gonna be almost as big as the damage from the infection well on that Peter I wanted to it's almost like you read my mind I did want to end with something sort of positive what are you most optimistic about a movie spent a lot of time talking about things that concern us with respect to the burden on the healthcare system the properties of the virus that make it especially troublesome if you're trying to fight it but if you think about where we are today versus where we are a week ago even what are you optimistic about what's moving in the right direction what trend do you see that you want to see continue there's a few things going from not very impressive sounding to more impressive things I think just from a not selfish sight but I think we're seeing scientists being put in higher esteem we were trending the wrong way for a long time because of this anti-vaccine movement but when you hear the esteem that people like Anthony foutch he have in the country because he is a scientist I think that's kind of reassuring that times of stress people are looking to scientists for guidance not only to solve problems but also for leadership roles and I think that could be a positive outcome of this and people writing letters to our team of vaccine scientists trying to develop the vaccine and we just had this thing I was very moved their vaccine scientists are still working through this because they have to because I have to make this corona virus vaccine we just had a massive donation of Girl Scout cookies for the scientists really showing that the community is out there behind us of that for me was really positive also science communication was already starting to trend in the right direction but I think it's really taken off the data sharing that's going on putting things up on bio archive on meta archive these preprint servers has now become a routine form of science communication it was already starting to take off but now it's done regularly in the fact that even the journals like JAMA New England Journal of Medicine Lancet are putting their stuff out there quickly in the public domain if we keep doing this it's going to change the way we do science publishing I often say our model of how we publish science was invented in the 1850s by the German scientific institutions and it worked for a while but believe it or not communicating science according to the rules of 1850

[00:58:20] Germany is probably no longer adequate and and I think we started to see this with SARS Wan and mares and then Ebola and I think it's gonna reach its full fruition through this epidemic so the fact that scientists are being held in higher esteem recognizes important people the way scientific communication is done I think and the same is true of our physicians and nurses I think the fact the heroism we're seeing of physicians and nurses and you saw those stories from Italy of the whole nation standing out in the balcony and cheering for physicians and the nurses and health care professionals I think there's maybe gonna be a new awakening of the humanity behind the medical profession that I think we're starting to hear and and it works both ways not only just people standing up and cheering but more and more doctors and nurses telling their story of sacrifice and knowing that when they go into work saying goodbye to their kids or their significant others knowing that they may have to be in any kind of quarantine after that not knowing if they're going home are gonna get sick

[00:59:34] I think people seeing the sacrifice that physicians and health care professionals and nurses make stuff that we do every day that gets unnoticed is now being noticed so I think that's also going to be a potentially very positive outcome of all this I mean the worry of course is out of sight out of mind we might have said some of that after SARS one and Mayor's I said the whole vaccine infrastructure will change we'll be able to change the whole vaccine ecosystem on the base of those epidemics and really not all that much happened a few things happen but not much I always think maybe this will be the one that will happen in terms of more immediate successes that you might see what can we look for for things that are gonna work the one thing that I saw was last Sunday morning when Andrew Cuomo Governor Cuomo wrote that what I thought was a very courageous op-ed piece in The New York

[01:00:29] Times saying what was on my mind for a while but I didn't want to say and he just said it we're gonna need to bring in the Army Corps of Engineers and I think that was an important piece to this recognizing that we may need to bring in our military and maybe sooner rather than later so we're already hearing about National Guard units being called up I think we're gonna need our military to build temporary hospitals and facilities maybe some of the human capital we're gonna need for this is going to become an important piece to this as well well Peter on that note we've gone a little over the time I know we both set aside for this and we've got a lot to get done even though we're sort of late in the day but I want to thank you again for for the time and obviously for the hat you're wearing which is sort of being one of the important phases of this in the public I do think it's important that people have sort of credible information and you're speaking to a lot of people not just to the public but also to policymakers for what it's worth I'm a little bit more optimistic this week than I was last week in terms of the seriousness with which this is being taken especially inside government based on a number of personal discussions and some second hand discussions so I guess that's the thing I'm personally most optimistic about I mean there are some people on the federal side who've definitely been doing this and people like deborah birx have been good and Tony of course is always great and Brett Gerar is not a household name but he's assistant secretary of health and was with us for a while here in Texas and he's been the one assigned to finally ramp up the testing and he's been doing that I think been doing a great job to me I think the profile that Governor Cuomo's had is the one that really woke us and who got on has been getting on there every day and saying what the hell is going on where my respirators where my beds these are the projections these are what we're gonna need this is what's gonna happen to our hospitals and being overrun so I give a lot of courage points to the governor in New York on that front all right Peter well thank you very much I want to let you get back to work and I know we'll be in touch again soon and we'll pick it up then I think what impresses me about our discussion today is how different it was compared to a week ago and shows you how quickly this thing is moving and so always happy to do this again at some point we'll see how this thing continues to change because I said a last week I'll say it again this week the stuff we're saying today may look totally ridiculous in a few days or a week because this thing is moving so fast these virus pandemics emerging threats set you up to make you look bad and they do that with our federal leaders or state leaders and even doctors and scientists who go on TV so do continue to need to refresh yeah I hope they make us look bad by saying we over responded then we under responded
