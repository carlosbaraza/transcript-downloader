Celia Morgan is a Professor of Psychopharmacology at the University of Exeter who has authored numerous publications on the potential therapeutic uses of ketamine in mental healthcare.  In this episode, Celia dives deep into the neurobiology of ketamine, how it affects users, and how it differs from other, more classical psychedelics (LSD, MDMA, PCP, and psilocybin). She explains the potential promise of ketamine as a treatment for recalcitrant depression and addiction, and she details the results from her clinical trials in these areas. She discusses the importance of using ketamine in combination with psychotherapy to maximize its benefits, the potential risks associated with ketamine use, and advice for those interested in the therapeutic use of ketamine.

## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia hey celia thanks for making time on a friday evening to uh to sit down and talk about ketamine and perhaps a few other things uh but great to meet you ut thanks it's my pleasure um so let's talk a little bit about your background because i know that you i think you finished your graduate training in the uk but then you did a stint here in the u.s at yale if i'm not mistaken correct yeah um so i did my undergraduate in psychology with pharmacology and astrophysics for a bit but um then i went i did a phd program at university college london but as part of that i spent some time at yale and i'd got a scholarship to do a little bit of research out out there in the us so what did you focus on during your phd so my phd was largely focused on the effects of ketamine um and back then you know that was in uh makes me feel quite old but nearly 20 you know years ago um we were looking both at the acute effects of ketamine as a model of psychosis so at the time people were using ketamine with the idea that would help us understand the neurobiological underpinnings of psychosis because actually from the outside ketamine looks quite a little bit similar to people who are psychotic um and so we were using that to map the kind of cognitive processes in um altered by ketamine but i was also simultaneously looking at people who take ketamine recreationally because at the time that was quite a big problem in the uk um so yeah i had this kind of dual focus and when i went to the us it was to work on again some neuroimaging studies um looking at ketamine as a model for psychosis so it was before it really became established as an antidepressant so let's talk a little bit about the history of ketamine it was synthesized in the 60s i believe correct yeah so it was synthesized as an anesthetic by parker davies um who it was synthesized as a replacement for pcb or fence cyclidine um because obviously people know pcp as angel dust and there's this kind of folklore around it of people running at the police and being shot down and keeping running but i mean really the problems with it had this protracted psychosis-like effects that lasted for a really long time following anesthesia it was still a good analgesic anaesthetic they synthesize ketamine as a similar molecule so it still works on the same receptor in the brain the nmda receptor but it was ten times ten times less potent um and yeah so it was synthesized back in the 60s and the drug company that synthesized it were initially really impressed by its analgesic and anaesthetic effects but then with increasing clinical experience it was noticed that people were coming around from ketamine anesthesia reporting a variety of quite weird effects say things like hallucinations and out-of-body experiences and that's what's really limited its routine clinical use but it's still one of the most widely used anaesthetics in the world today it's on the world health organization list of essential medicines so yeah i mean one of the one of the things that i remember from my clinical training was that the you know one of the perks of ketamine was that you didn't have the respiratory depression and most things that we use as anesthetic agents have this problem where if you overshoot them and that's not an issue if you're doing general anesthesia because you have an endotracheal tube in the bronchus and uh and the main stem bronchus so you're breathing for the patient but when you start to think about conscious sedation respiratory depression starts to become a very frightening consequence that must be managed closely and with ketamine you didn't have that now is my memory correct that kids were less susceptible to the hallucinogenic effects or like i literally this is because i didn't do any much in pediatrics but i i can't recall if there was more flexibility in using it with kids or am i making that up no i think i mean it is used more with children um i don't know that's the thing i've we tried to do a study actually which never really came off but i don't know if it's that people haven't asked kids if they're hallucinating or maybe they have more they're just more it's more it seems less foreign to them if they are yeah yeah exactly they're tripping all the time but they're more open to like changes in consciousness so yeah i think they certainly seem to i mean it's used routinely whether i i'm really interested and i don't think anyone's really actually asked children about their experiences but yeah it's definitely i think it's used because it's so safe you know so in pediatrics and geriatrics also in battlefield medicine it was the most widely used anaesthetic in the vietnam war for instance um so it's used yeah as you said it's really safe physiologically um as an anaesthetic because it doesn't slow your breathing or your heart rate um so when you've lost a lot of floods it's good as well because it actually even vaguely increases your blood pressure so yeah i think that's why it's a widely used anaesthetic it's a really good question about kids though and i don't think i mean i know there's some people trying to get them in in its antidepressant use now with adolescents so i'm sure we'll cover that later but yeah yeah and and i'm glad you made that other point by the way it doesn't lower blood pressure so now you talk about it being the perfect anesthetic in trauma and shock where those patients are hypovolemic their blood pressure is already going down you give them an agent that if anything slightly acts like a vasopressor raises blood pressure without the respiratory depression i mean in that setting you can understand why it it sort of became you know a turning point in in the field medicine in vietnam yeah absolutely i mean the acute experience must be really unusual when you're in that setting but i guess the dissociation is so like i think there's an interesting study about looking at the interaction between those acute subjective effects when you're on a battlefield but i mean yeah also as you mentioned not having to intubate people that's why it's really popular in developing countries where you've got limited access you know to um or ability to intubate patients you know so it's a really important medicine in anesthesia still and i think that's something people forget you know with all the new um developments with the use of kettleman yeah it's really interesting when you go and imagine what surgery was like before ether and you know i mean when you i mean that's just ridiculous um and to think that anesthesia is something we've only had for about 140 years uh yeah it is pretty crazy to imagine a fascinating fascinating concept anyway like when you lose consciousness and how you measure that you know there's different things and ethicists use there's an index which will rely on some eeg to look at how your consciousness drops but i still don't think we really know you know what turns it on and off but yeah that's probably another podcast so you mentioned that ketamine is is kind of an analog would you is it safe to say it's an analog of pcp um yeah so they're all under the class of arrow cyclohexamines um and so i think edward domino coined the term dissociative anaesthetics to describe um pcp and ketamine and also people include nitrous oxide in that category laterally so i think based on the fact that they kind of dissociate you from your body and are characterized by these out of body experiences um which can be quite helpful again i think in an anesthetic use yeah so they are they are related compounds with with similar their main action is on the nmda receptor so let's talk a little bit about that let's assume that folks don't know um what the uh nmda receptor is they don't know what glutamate is they don't know gap like let's just assume people are coming at this from a standpoint of not being completely up to speed on excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitters um explain in in some detail exactly how these neurotransmitters work and how other neurons can amplify or attenuate the response of those and where ketamine fits into that um sure so i guess well do jump in as well if i'm either going too slowly or too quickly um but yeah so glutamate's the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and it's prevalent all across the brain and one of the um receptors that um glutamate works that is the nmda receptor and the nmda receptor the end methyl the aspartate receptor it's really important in a lot of our higher cognitive functions so it's the kind of the fundaments of learning and memory um particularly a process in learning called long-term potentiation which is where neurons that or brain cells that activate at the same time are more like then if you if they both activate then they're more likely to activate in future so it's characterized by this term that someone said neurons that fire together wire together and glutamate is really important in that and other you know excitatory functions in the brain and gaba is an inhibitory neurotransmitter so it um shuts down the flow of electro impulses across the brain what ketzman does is and before we do that so just to give some people some examples right so glutamate is excitatory gaba is inhibitory we can give people a sense of like alcohol you and i were talking before we started about you know gaba analogs that are meant to mimic alcohol i mean what are they doing why do people feel relaxed when they drink it's the gaba potentiation um when you look at things like benzodiazepines they're working at gaba right yeah so yeah yeah okay so so and then are there things that we can examples we can give people that work at uh glutamate that are amplifying glutamate we tend to focus more on the opposite right yeah so like lumotri genes so drugs used in seizures and tend to reduce the flow of glutamate in the brain particularly in the prefrontal cortex i'm trying to think of examples so good question peter do you know of any no i can't think of anything on the top of my head that would do that because again we normally are thinking of the opposite side of that so alcohol increases gaba in the brain and that has the effect of kind of dumping down your brain activity and reducing things like anxiety and slowing your motor function and generally inhibiting the flow of electrical impulses across your brain and then it's part of the reason why we get um the symptoms you get when you stop drinking your brain kind of goes into a more hyper it's like a seesaw i guess so the alcohol is being pushing down on that side and keeping it damp and down and then you release that and you go into kind of a more excitatory state and so you get things like and and you know i work a lot with alcoholics so things from alcohol withdrawals you can get seizures and the shakes and that's all down to this kind of increase in exploitation so so that's why that's why um withdrawal from strong gaba promoters like benzos and ethanol can be fatal if not managed correctly you can't you know it's sort of funny i think people intuitively sort of know this right like you can stop opioids immediately and it might be the most painful thing in the world but it won't be fatal whereas if you take a person who's on a high dose of benzodiazepines or a person who drinks a lot of alcohol and you stop that abruptly it actually can be fatal and they are the drugs you can die from withdrawal in because of these huge then increase in excitation because i guess with no repeated alcohol use your brain gets used to having all this gaba on board and then you get adaptation and your brain kind of upregulates to counteract that and then when you remove it yeah you can die from withdrawal so the people i work with um you know severe alcoholics it's unsafe for them to stop straight away so they have to cut down and use things like benzodiazepines and withdrawals say yeah it's um yeah it's something that you think people do think about opiate withdrawal potentially as a really difficult thing but as you say you wouldn't die from that it's only from withdrawal from um these inhibitory substances like alcohol and benzodiazepines so so so then so so okay so we have excitatory and inhibitory neurons and the inhibitory neurons are they the ones where you have like an nmda receptor that is sort of globbed on to a say a glutamate receptor yeah that's that's one of the theories of how ketamine works basically well we just talked about the neurons yeah no no but you're right yes i'm going exactly to now different ideas because because i think they're really it's not 100 clear exactly how ketamine works correct no no and so there's a couple of theories that either castleman blocks directly um the nmda receptors and the glutamatergic neurons and then this triggers a kind of downstream cascade or i mean there's some evidence that maybe it's a combination of the two and this was you know but is that that ketamine blocks um nmda receptors on these they're called gabaergic interneurons so they're who will gaba recep in neurons that synapse onto your glutamate one so they they put the brakes on your excitation um so they they so if you block an an md receptor and a gabaergic interneuron then you're going to have a net effect of increasing glutamate flow in your pre-synaptic cells so they're pre-synaptic um so yeah it's not quite clear and it probably is a combination of the two um it's i think increasingly people have become interested in their downstream mechanisms really and potentially in the therapeutic effects of ketamine but i expect we'll get back to that later yeah so so again ketamine is one of these drugs where the dose kind of makes the poison i mean i think that's true of most drugs but it really has different effects on an individual based on how much they're getting right and you know anything from kind of like mild hypnosis to some dissociation to complete and is you know complete anesthesia yeah absolutely no at low doses as well people you know i've worked quite a lot with people who take catamine and non-medically or recreationally and they lower doses it's got kind of stimulant properties and then as the dose increases you get kind of just perceptual distortions and illusions and kind of a mild melting people talk about floating higher doses still you get kind of much more profound maybe not hallucinations but changes in the perception of reality and the highest dose you're completely sort of catatonic but people are experiencing inside these really really profound um hallucinations and that's i mean it's those really high doses from my work with you know non-medical ketamine users that were actually really dangerous a couple of people died from taking ketamine you know and then having a bath and they're completely dissociated from reality and they drowned and it's like the saddest thing and it makes you i think as a user the ketamine users are very vulnerable to accidents at these higher doses because you are not completely dissociated from reality really wow so that's sort of like lsd in the sense where it really has no ld50 meaning you can't there's no amount of lsd that you're going to take that is going to create some physiologic process that kills you the way for example tylenol acetaminophen you know would you know poison your liver at a certain dose but it's not to say that lsd is completely safe because you can alter your behavior in a way that is so altered from reality that you put yourself in harm's way and you're saying basically is that the same with ketamine that if you look at it from a purely pharmacology standpoint there's no ld50 given that it doesn't have respiratory depression and all these other things that we worry about or how do you think about that yeah no i mean i think there's very few yeah um it's much the cases i'm not aware of anyone are getting to like a toxic dose of ketamine and there are problems with you know repeatedly taking high doses of ketamine and which have been uncovered in work with abusers but yeah it's um and physiological problems the ketamine has a direct toxicity on the epithelial so like the lining of your bladder um which is really interesting is something only merge really with people using really high doses but yeah there's no ld50 like you say i think it's um it's more how and i'm much more so probably even than lsd where a lot more of your kind of top-down higher cognitive functions are preserved with ketamine they're not and you are completely you know catatonic people will be kind of collapsed um anita is really in a catalytic state so you're much more vulnerable to accidents and yeah through that the the drowning in a bathtub example that seems tragic and to imagine how dissociated you would have to be to slip into a bathtub inhale water and not respond yeah exactly you're you are completely dissociated and it's really sad it was someone that i was working with and that's not the only example i know of a few case studies or examples of people who that's happened to various different accidents so yes it's really tragic as you say um while we're on the pharmacology let's talk about the different routes of administration i assume that most of the time when it's used medically it's intravenous yeah that's um most of the studies um certainly in the depression field and when it's used in anesthesia i think people would give it intravenously it's the best bioavailability and the most well characterized route um but yeah or out as you say in american um but um there are other ways of administering it you know which i think have been increasingly used intramuscular has got quite good availability in the blood and then there's people starting to use things like sublingual administration so putting under the tongue um intranasal obviously is the root popularized by first the drug users themselves but then patented by um the pharmaceutical company and have now used that for their licensed form of ketamine and depression um yeah and those are the main ones and and oral dosing although it's that's not as great in terms of bioavailability it's obviously easy way to get a drug over and across into the system but yeah you're right i think and there's no hip hop there's no there's no liver toxicity with i know you're going to have a bad first pass effect which is why you prefer to put it under your tongue as opposed to to swallow it um but there's no toxicity it just means you need a higher dose if you're going to take it orally presumably yeah i think i mean it's not that well characterized i don't know whether i don't i i assume people are doing the toxicity studies at the moment because i know there's some pharmaceutical companies looking at overall dosing as a potential but i think for the purpose of our discussion we're really thinking about what has been learned through intravenous and intramuscular and perhaps most recently intranasal yeah and that's where my bulk of the research is for sure okay so um in the 1970s when this drug was being used pretty liberally as an anesthetic it was was it unscheduled in the united states i know now it's a schedule three so it is you know it's a much more regulated compound but is that yeah i think it came when was it in the us i think maybe 1997. yeah i think it was yeah it's relatively recent yeah yeah late 90s 2003 putin banned it and russia just basically even yeah even for use in humans and quite an interesting story bridget bardo obviously the very attractive french actress petitioned him for to use it in animals because it's obviously widely used in veterinary anesthesia so he removed the ban for animals but kept the band in place for humans which is pretty horrendous considering what an amazing anesthetic is i'm in the uk it became it was 2006. so yeah and in the uk it mirrors basically the u.s um regulation around our equivalent of c3 yeah ours is class b yeah it's under the misuse of drugs scheduling but it's um it's obviously what we couldn't you know schedule two drugs they used for you medical use but unlike i mean maybe it's something we'll get into whether you consider ketamine to be a psychedelic drug but there's not any other drugs with these kind of type of effects that can be used medically that are legal so that's right so in the united states the other psychedelics lsd psilocybin and even mdma which is not a psychedelic are schedule one which means they are not even used they have no medical use at all yeah and that's i mean it's interesting drug policy wise right because ketamine is the most likely to be abused i would say of all of those compounds but it's the one that's you know legal for medical use i mean it has as we've said got an amazing number of medical uses but you don't consider mdma psychedelic i mean i don't think i'm an expert to say but no i don't consider mdma a psychedelic personally uh i sort of put it in the category of venom pathogen and um because you don't really have any dissociation with it right you know it's not it's not altering perception in the way that lsd or psilocybin uh would and your point is an interesting one right which is you know schedule one typically implies no medical use high potential for addiction well certainly i think there's medical use for psilocybin and mdma as you said pretty low potential for abuse and interestingly while ketamine clearly has a high medical use i want to talk to you about the potential for abuse as well i've heard mixed things on this but what did the data say how how addictive is ketamine in terms of other things for which we have benchmarks like for example benzodiazepines and opioids where we we really have a clear sense of the addictive potential of those molecules where does ketamine stack up um well i don't know if we have really good data on that but i would say i mean in terms of physical withdrawals symptoms i mean it depends how you assess the addictive properties right so there's the initial high um there's yeah and how you how you really categorize that because i guess i would say i struggle with things being addictive people become addicted to things um but they're all multifunctional coffee's yeah um but i would say i mean we did a study of people that use ketamine so they're probably at higher potential for abuse um if there might say people who use ketamine non-medically as in what you would say recreationally i think about nine percent of them had symptoms of some sort of dependence or craving nine percent so nine percent of a group of like recreational users of drugs so i'm finding that hard to benchmark that against opioids and benzos i mean that's like means a bit lower so so i'll tell you i mean the last time i looked at the opioid data and and someone listening to this will probably say no that's wrong um because i'm going by memory my memory was about 20 of opioid users became addicted but that was prescription-based opioid painkillers right that doesn't include heroin where that number might be higher but of course you're also pre-selecting a different sub subgroup of the population so it's not really an apples-to-apples comparison in other words what i'm saying is of you know 20 of patients who would be prescribed opioids for medical use you know could could become addicted which is a staggering number right one in five people who gets an opioid prescription could go on to abuse them later you know so i don't know how much faith to put in that number because it seems so absurdly high but it's you know it's plausible and i guess so the only way we would really know this i suppose on an apples-to-apples basis is you took patients who were being treated with ketamine for another indication such as recalcitrant depression and you ask the question how many of those patients would go on to experience dependency pharmacologic physiologic dependency yeah yeah and that we know i mean so far the data suggests is pretty low like what's not really seen at all okay so we know that a little bit from the trials that have gone on so far but it's a really early stage and i guess if you're doing apples to apples you know opioids is that daily like or benzos i don't know like frequency obviously how you're defining addiction is quite hard because if it's physical withdrawal symptoms or is it impacting on your everyday functioning or is it not seeking beyond your prescription those escalation there's a yes it's uh it's a tricky one i don't i mean i know from having worked with ketamine people who are addicted to ketamine that's on as a small proportion of people do become addicted and for those you know as we mentioned it has these really serious physical consequences of having um toxicity on your bladder you know i was working with people 16 year old girls who've had their bladders have to have as cystectomy so you have your bladder removed and then they're you know having to wear a colostomy bag really dire consequences and i think that's quite rare i was thinking about other drugs that have got like a direct physiological so just to make sure i understand so these are 16 year old girls that were not using ketamine for medical indications such as depression they became addicted to it recreationally yeah and this was kind of an epidemic in the uk in the 1990s early 2000s when we were researching it because people didn't really know anything about cat's men so the nickname was when i was in i was in medical school in the 90s and i we learned about it as special k right that's what it was referred to so now that i don't know if that was the san francisco name because that's sort of where i was going to school and i don't know if it was it called special k in the uk also yeah i think people called it that um some people you know it was very the the so these people that i was working with were very constrained subcultures so we have kind of these travelers they're like um people who live itinerant lives you know i don't know if you have something equivalent in in the us so it was amongst those groups um some of them called it kitty smack basically saying it's like an addictive drug like it was basically like heroin for kids i see so it's kind of the jv or junior version of heroin not quite as bad yeah for those people but there was zero information about it at the time and and they were not taking the drug the way it's given you know for depression they were taking grams and grams of it every day so these serious something important to say and what would what what would they experience i mean grams of this i had we'll come back and do the math on what that means but if they're taking high doses of this stuff daily were they taking it and then basically passing out in their apartments for hours and just dissociating on trips and no i mean they would be so a dose that would render someone completely yeah catatonic septic would be they would just tolerate it because it is the tachyphylaxis is like a rapidly developing tolerance and if you do administer ketamine repeatedly in a short time window you do need to give higher and higher doses i think that's what you found like with these people they were going they were functioning you know walking around on doses that yeah would floor you know an elephant or certainly a horse um so yeah it's pretty it was pretty extraordinary i've got quite and i think i do feel yeah so with with with the opioids we kind of have a sense of what that high is that the that the person using it is experiencing right that mu receptor when it is uh you know agonized it um it produces a very deep high what is the feeling that that person is getting from those escalating doses of ketamine even once they're tachyphylactic what what is what do they say that they're experiencing that is bringing them back to it yeah it's a really good question and i think it's not one thing we actually did some research on this i think we spoke to about 120 guessman users doing some interviews of why they took it um and some of them did so some of them said very pragmatic things i think because it's very cheap so things like it's cheap it gets me really off my head i think the escapism of it you know they but there is i mean there's some new receptor there's some slight opioid actions of cats maybe we can come on to that talking about the different isomers of ketamine but yeah so some people are taking it just for the escapism some people talk more as we'd see them kind of psychonauts but almost addicted to chasing the consciousness and the insights they felt they were getting and they were just taking more and more to try and get more insights i mean there's some really you know high-profile examples of that i don't know if you've heard of john lilly who was the kind of neuroscientist based in california okay um and he at the film altered states is about him and he did quite a lot of unusual research you know giving lsd to dolphins um he invented flotation tanks i think um and he writes in his book the scientist clearly documents becoming completely addicted to ketamine to the extent that he was having an intravenous drip of ketamine you know pretty much 24 hours a day so he really heavily escalated his dose and became kind of psychotic i think and we had these revelations and went to tell the president of the the president of the usa for your um about the world being taken over by computers um but yeah so i mean it's a really fascinating book if you're interested in reading an account of ketamine addiction and and how did that story end for him what what is the well i think he managed did he manage to get off the ketamine in the end i'm trying to remember that's a really good question i can't remember the end of it i know there's some sad and there was another book called journeys to the bright world by someone called marsha moore i think she was an heiress to some her husband some kind of fortune and but her husband was an anaesthetist and she experimented with ketamine it's actually quite interesting they are very different subjective experiences so john lilly's one's very machine state and he's experiencing hallucinations very related to being in a computer and hers were very soft and round and going back to the earth but she sadly i think froze to death she took some ketamine outside and again that thing where you are completely dissociated in your um yeah from your body and she'd gone outside one evening and actually froze to death that's really sad i mean i didn't there were people taking really high intravenous stages of ketamine and but yes it's got it it's got a rapidly developing tolerance and why is it different so pcp i'm i'm trying to think i don't really think i took care of any patients that were strung out on pcp but i certainly remember the lore of the drug and it was it struck me as a much more aggressive drug uh people that were on pcp as you alluded to earlier they seemed almost bulletproof right they'd punch their hand through a glass window be unfazed by the fact that they just broke every bone in their hand um given that these drugs have such a similarity why why did pcp seem to produce that phenotype or is that just lore and that really wasn't what was happening yeah i think that's law i mean i think it produces protracted psychotic state but some people have likened it i think they gave the police nets even to catch people on pcp there was a lot of kind of police brutality these special pcp nets police brutality associated with pcp and maybe the people taking pcp some people have suggested it's kind of a degree of racism or yeah again it's kind of people in poverty so yeah i don't i've been looked for examples of this kind of bulletproof phenomena and i can't find any in the literature certainly there's definitely examples of people having a protracted sort of psychotic-like symptoms having hallucinations having to be hospitalized but this whole running police and the kind of violence aspect i find hard to imagine and is pcp still being used is it still a a street drug it's certainly not it's never really been a street drug in in the uk i don't i i'm not aware there's many reports in the us either so it's interesting and it's interesting in the context of the new use of all these substances nobody's really thinking about using pcpa but maybe that would be something to investigate so speaking of kind of the resurgence of these drugs how would you contrast ketamine with psilocybin and lsd so psilocybin lsd of course are much more similar to each other how does ketamine differ i mean obviously it differs in use case but do you have other senses of how it how it how it produces a different experience yeah i mean obviously it has a completely different action where they work on the 5ht to a receptor and ketamine as we were talking about works on these kind of glutamatergic receptors and there are some similarities in the acute experience which is one of kind of people talk about eu dissolution and ketamine causes that quite profoundly so you lose your sense of self and that happens to a degree as well on cytocybin and so much mushrooms and lsd i think you get much like you can think more clearly on lsd and psilocybin ketamine impairs some of your higher cognitive functions and causes that kind of analgesia which is associated with ketones got an anxiolytic effect so even at higher doses people don't report anxiety whereas i mean they can describe things as some of our patients describe things that sound scary but they don't feel the kind of physiological anxiety um whereas you know drugs like lsd psychosis people can report being absolutely terrified by the experience and i think maybe that's the dissociation that happens more on drugs like ketamine where you really have the sense of being separate um and everything's kind of emotionally numb um as i guess you'd think with it being an analgesic or an anaesthetic and that might be due to the the greater inhibitory effect potentially of ketamine is probably why you maybe can short-circuit some of the anxiety that can definitely happen with lsd and psilocybin if the setting isn't right or if the dose is too high yeah and so that i mean it's and that's probably when we were talking before about the you know the abuse potential maybe why it's got a higher abuse potential because that's right it has less of a negative feedback loop i think anybody who's tried the other psychedelics will say look if you if you go back to the well too many times you're you can you can you can get stung yeah yeah exactly it's unpredictable in that sense um whereas ketumin and that if you're looking for kind of escapism you don't want to escape into absolute terror well so all right so let's let's talk about depression because i think this is where people are really becoming interested in ketamine it's certainly how it came to my attention seven eight maybe nine years ago was um god i'm trying to think how it was a physician friend of mine saying hey i you know he was saying he's been prescribing intranasal ketamine to some of his patients for depression and i thought none of this makes sense please say more um and he said yeah no this is it's perfectly legal we you know i have a compounding pharmacy and these are the instructions that we give the pharmacy and they give him an intro you know they give the patient an intranasal spray and they use this spray i forget the frequency with which it was like once they were doing it once a week or something was the the use case um and at the time again this is maybe 10 years ago i couldn't find a lot of literature on it and and you know i found some and i found some interesting case reports and i found i remember there's one study i found based in india that looked pretty interesting but then i sort of forgot about it until maybe four years ago and um and i think what brought it back to my attention was frankly the epidemic for lack of a better word of ketamine clinics which which you know basically are almost as ubiquitous as starbucks now so um before we get into kind of the business of ketamine clinics i i want to just kind of understand where the where the idea came from how was this something that people even thought was you know worth pursuing clinically and then how does it work uh who does it work in who does it not work in you know let's just go down the depression rabbit hole sure yeah i mean that's quite where it came from it's probably he there was a really early study in iran i think i mean it might even date back to some quite dodgy work by salvador okay i'm not sure if you've heard of him yeah he's um he was uh but i do want i do want to compliment you on the use of dodgy that word cannot ever be overused so any anytime you want to just throw in that that's a dodgy scam or that's just dodgy work please please feel free to insert that thank you it's not a very scientific word but no it's it belongs here it belongs here okay yeah and he definitely was a dodgy guy so there we go um he was a he was working for the mexican government actually i think interrogating people and he took some of the techniques from that i think and tried to he's a psychologist kind of psychotherapeutic practice and he was giving ketamine with other psychedelics um to try and produce changes in people's brain state but i guess that's probably the first documented cases of people using ketamine in a kind of psychiatric therapy sense and this is what this is in the 80s or 90s no that was back in the 60s yeah so way back maybe the 70s there was this study out of iran um but really yeah the work that's kind of caused this whole explosion in ketamine depressable research because i don't think anyone was really watching those areas of research came out of a group at yale and a guy called robert berman um who did an early study in 2000 um giving ketamine a single catamaran infusion to patients with treatment resistant depression and they showed the thing which was kind of groundbreaking and that's was that you could get this rapid reduction in um depressive symptoms not as our traditional ssris you know your prozacs and your traditional antidepressant drugs have got a delayed onset of action and it was just kind of accepted that they take two weeks to work and you know there's various ideas of why but um this this ketamine works immediately and and then people with treatment resistant depression how it was administered in those early studies was this so that was yeah sorry so that was intravenous intravenous okay and what kind of doses were they using oh it's 0.5 milligrams per kilogram yeah so okay so an 80 kilogram person is getting 40 milligrams intravenous over 40 minutes yeah over 40 minutes so not an iv push but a pretty quick drip yeah so really quick like mild dissociation i would say from my experience of using different doses and some kind of peripheral subjective changes um so yeah we've used that dose in acute studies and then just for reference um what would a recreational drug user who's not completely habituated so they're not way up the tachyphylaxis curve but if if if a recreational person went to their drug dealer and said i want some ketamine because i want to blast off what dose would they be given that's really variable i'd say but maybe more on like at least a hundred if not 200 milligrams i would say got it so they're going to be given two and a half to five times the dose that and they would blast off with that they would probably take that yeah that would be a blast yeah no people in chinese i think is the typical route okay and is the bio availability similar i'm sure the onset is different if with intranasal versus intravenous versus intramuscular but does the same amount of drug basically get to you with each of those routes yeah it's slightly less than intravenous is obviously the optimal reason for that but yeah it's pretty good way to get it across which is why it's now being taken forward as a treatment and depression i guess okay so so the so going back to this patient that's getting 40 milligrams it's a higher dose i would say that's a dose that they know something is happening they're not getting a placebo but it's they're not being blown out of the water no i mean i think it's really variable through all my work i guess i must have given like hundreds of people get them in in research studies and it is the response is really variable okay and not necessarily predicted so we wait adjust all of our doses so give me the range what's the what's the sort of interquartile range so there are are there some people that literally feel nothing at .5 migs per gig i don't know that anyone would feel nothing but maybe feel more like slightly drunk and feel a bit disoriented you know that kind of feeling like intoxicated basically and slightly dissociated and at the other end of the spectrum are there people that are just tripping people who are going you know people have gone down a canoe in their mother's eardrum like doing really weird stuff like having frankly nations basically like um really extreme responses and i think i mean we can talk about that in a bit we've found out a little about what predicts that i think now tell me yeah i'm very curious because i just know myself with any single agent that i've ever ingested in my life anything that ranges from alcohol to acetaminophen to you to a psychedelic agent i'm i need like three times what anybody else needs to feel it and i've always been curious as to why that's incredibly hard pizza it's so hardcore no i think i'm so the things that we um the things that we found out from our research is that people with a family history of alcohol problems would they have a greater acute response to ketamine they're more sensitive to it yeah okay and well they have a greater sorry as their greater response to the therapeutic effects they've actually got less of the response to the acute sorry i said that completely wrong um and one of the other things bmi which is kind of obvious i suppose is so higher bmi um body mass index is um predictive of a higher acute effect because they're but that's because they're getting a higher dose yeah in well in a way but then i guess the bmi is is slightly different and i suppose maybe that's something to consider similar with alcohol right like you're but that's not surprising that's not surprising right because it was because bmi really speaks to how much lean mass and nonlinear mass you have it doesn't really speak to your organs and it certainly doesn't speak to your brain no no it doesn't speak to your brain so no these are really obvious things i mean and this is why we haven't got very far in predicting how people respond um and therapeutically we know with depression the more suicide attempts people have a better response so they're more likely to respond which probably maybe means they're more severe i guess um but yeah we know not very much at all really there's some kind of but so let me ask another question does the acute response that you're watching during the call it two or three hours that they're in your chair being administered the drug right because it's a 40-minute infusion presumably it's another couple of hours while they're under the effect of the drug we call that the acute response is that predictive of what you're really after which is the um the abatement of depression yeah that's a really good question i think the field is pretty divided so the way that the acute effects have typically been measured is with a scale called the clinician-administered dissociative state scale which basically looks at dissociation but it was designed to look at dissociation from people having flashbacks from traumatic experiences and so it are some questions that are relevant for catamaran but some are not so it's like things moving in slow motion have colors change um do you have a sense of forgetting chunks of what have happened a lot of it is relevant but people have looked at other aspects of the acute experience so with these dissociative effects some studies i'd say about 25 find they project predict the therapeutic effects we've actually done a systematic review on this um but the others don't and so i think there's a there's maybe but i think in general psychiatry there's a feeling that these acute effects are a nuisance and that we need to find as a whole you know research effort has been devoted to finding drugs that don't have these acute effects um with kind of limited success um so i don't know i think and actually when you look into the data people who use a bit more nuanced ways of looking at the acute effects so there's some scales that look at some of the bit more i guess you'd say trippy effects and things like mystical experiences in the sense that you can't explain the experience that's gone on and those do seem to predict so it's quite interesting wow first of all i mean to just try to unpack that it's not crystal clear that the person who's sitting there feeling slightly drunk is going to have a lesser outcome or a greater outcome than the person who's on the canoe in their mom's you know eustachian tube right so the second point i would extract from what you said is we're probably using too crude an instrument to try to tease out exactly what effects in the acute phase matter and it's either because we don't know what questions to ask them in that window or we're not doing our analyses on a fine enough gradation of symptoms is that a fair assessment yeah yeah that's what i'm saying basically i think we need you know maybe a definer more nuanced um understanding of the effects so we're doing some stuff now just recording what people say and getting them to describe it and then using artificial intelligence kind of machine learning algorithms to um find patterns in that to see if that might predict it because i mean that seems like a you know a bit of a no-brainer now that we've got quite a long way with just using natural language to predict outcomes so by the way does ketamine produce amnesia um yeah it's got some amnesia but people can't remember the experience it's not as so you might forget aspects of what's happened and it's only impairs your episodic memory but people do remember the experience so we do interviews with people about the salient points of the experience they'll remember but i guess it's through a bit more of a fuzzy haze than maybe your classic psychedelics um so a bit less accessible i would say the patient then let's say after you've done this the patient wakes up and it's three hours later or wakes up is the wrong word but the patient sort of returns back to their their baseline state do they immediately feel the alleviation of the depression is that how quickly it can can can onset people can feel just yeah quite considerably better a colleague of mine we put mcchain he he set up the first nhs um treatment resistant depression clinic here in the uk and he likened it to the you know the film awakenings which is actually about parkinson's but like these people are really severely depressed you know they often can't get off bed and that they suddenly come alive some people you know not everyone responds to it but yeah that is pretty rapid and people just feel a kind of sense of clarity a bit more interest in the world i would say like almost like you're able to detect novelty where you weren't before you know your attention yeah it's quite a great thing to see what is the um mean and median duration of how long that lasts well yeah that's um again a really good question is around i think people say i mean and again it's really variable and obviously some people don't respond at all so it's important to say that what what fraction do not respond at all i don't think we have a good handle on it basically we need more real world data because if you look at people in trials it's often very different but i think it's around maybe i would say like 50 50 60 oh my god i had no clue it was that high so you're saying just call it 50 half the people that go through so half the people that show up with completely treatment resistant depression and go through this experience under the well-controlled setting of the lab in the clinical trial have no benefit from it yeah i think that's what's happened over time so the early studies it's like carlos serate study you know it was 75 and this typically happens with any new treatment i think the as more and more studies come out the rates of response reduce so yeah um i would say i mean maybe maybe i'm being overly conservative um so i should probably have that figure to hand um but i will say i think the duration is probably about you know two days to a week um often and some people have longer we'll have two weeks but that's the bit where my research comes in really because we've been looking at how you might extend that response and that's something that does seem to be coming out now if you give it alongside psychological therapy of some kind um you can really extend the response of the to ketamine and the antidepressant effects as well as so my child has been looking at ketamine in the treatment of alcohol um but we found still reductions in drinking six months following just three infusions so space put in how far did you space those three infusions apart oh they were between either a week or kind of up to two two weeks probably on average between them with seven sessions of psychological therapy so quite a limited treatment program really so let's go back to this because this is sort of interesting right so so we would say let's say 50 of people that show up and let's define treatment resistant depression for somebody it's not defined by duration is it no it's not responding to it so and it's i mean it's a tricky one because it's defined differently depending on different trials often people define it as not responding to two conventional antidepressants um in the current depressive episode um or having had multiple different treatments but yeah so it's not defined as treatment but there i mean some people take a more conservative definition of that to have maybe three failed responses so it is pretty variable in the trials and depression is requires at least two weeks of the set of symptoms that we typically associate with depression and and it would it be classified as depression if there is an obvious externality so loss of a child you know if your child died and a month later you can't get out of bed is that considered depression i mean what i mean by that is like how does that get classified given that there's such a clear explanation for the why yeah i think i mean if that continued for a really prolonged period of time but then that even that in itself is maybe contentious because i guess but yeah but there's a clear boundary between you know grief what's your anticipate from grief and natural sadness okay and then depression so let let's keep this one sort of simple and say that this is not something that's clearly associated to a trigger such as grief but instead um a less less obvious to explain form of depression it's been going on for at least a couple of weeks let's make it interesting and say it's been going on for months so that this person has gone through one ssri they've taken it to a therapeutic dose they've had no benefit they've then progressed and moved to a different ssri or a different class of drug and snri or something like that and similarly they're just not getting the benefit does it matter if um do we sort of assess how much psychotherapy they've been doing at the same time it depends on their um i mean i'm just thinking about the clinical trials or the reasons we give for prescribing off label catermen here in the uk and um typically it would be the antidepressants like not responding to antidepressants but yeah you could say failed response to cbt i mean that's happened in a lot of the trials they would have non-responses to cbt i know particularly some of the cytocybin studies but that's cognitive behavioral therapy yeah okay so so now the person comes in and again we've just said 50 of those people are not going to respond and that's pretty sad so what are we saying to those 50 of people it's we we we're going to go back to trying more and more conventional therapies or do we say we should try this again and maybe the second time we use a higher dose or something like that yeah because some people there's some evidence that people take maybe three this is in depression um maybe we'll take it might not respond to actually three ketamine doses but maybe the fourth one thing there's some evidence that having an extra beyond three doses might increase the response i mean certainly the unlabeled ketamine which is this bravado this is the johnson version of ketamine which is intranasal and that's indicated you know for a repeated dosing so you start out twice weekly i think it's for a month and then move to weekly um and what they're finding with the long-term studies is that people are staying on the dose i think there was an idea that people might you know progress off or drop down to i think they drop down to fortnightly um but they're staying on it for a number of years now i think um is the kind of long-term data so it is a maintenance so the plan is to keep people on ketamine or like let's go back to somebody who responded so let's go back to a patient who's um depression is profound and they've been through all the treatments and nothing's worked they do their first ketamine infusion and they feel remarkably better and it lasts four days and then all of a sudden the depression sets back in is the is the thinking that we're going to repeat this treatment and get longer and longer periods of um benefit during which time we can work more on psychotherapy uh to to try to you know wean off the need for ketamine yeah i mean that would be my thinking and that's some people's thinking i think is that targeting the therapy during that time um is is really important if you don't want to keep someone on ketamine as a maintenance dose by the way do patients need to stop their traditional antidepressants when they are coming to these trials so if the patients because most of them are probably on ssris and not doing well do you at least get to keep them on that yeah i mean we in our trial we were our funding body which is like the uk state didn't want us to include people on ssris but actually most of the studies the depression studies people are still on them and there's no interaction so it's not like some of the other novel substances like psilocybin where you'd because they're it's working in a completely different way in the brain so yeah so disney since you what do you think is the mechanism of action oh yeah so i mean that's where i think potentially the therapy and targeting the therapy is really important i mean people have talked about ketamine and and indeed the others psychedelics psychoplastogens i'm not sure about the term but maybe the idea that they prevent this kind of cascade and the study showing they increase synaptic plasticity in the prefrontal cortex what certainly ketamine does and so it increases the growth of new synapses and dendrites on so basically the ability of the brain to form new connections and that that is correlated with um the antidepressant effect um and so we kind of want to be doing some work at the moment to sort of chart the time cause of that in humans by looking at eeg so that's kind of electrical signals from the brain and trying to target the window of this synaptic plasticity because we know from animal studies this might be kind of starting four hours following the ketamine days peaking about 24 hours so we just sort of track the antidepressant effects which is quite interesting i think the idea you know for me as a psychologist is that you could time your psychological therapy when your brain is most plastic and he's able to learn new things and we know actually you know this kind of plasticity is impaired across a whole range of likes like sort of psychiatric disorders so not just depression but also in alcohol and addiction and and trauma so actually being able to stimulate the brain to kind of learn new things well it's really plastic then actually giving some psychological therapy that uses that process because we know that's what we're asking people to do really in psychological therapy is to think definitely about things learn new ways of thinking about old problems um so yeah that's that's to me it seems like an intuitively appealing mechanism i mean there's some problems with it and that neuroplasticity happens from all sorts of things so some might argue you know is this like specific enough as a process um other drugs produce neuroplasticity that we wouldn't say were necessarily potential treatments for mental health problems and psychiatric disorders so you need to find out more about it well like cocaine so people say the neuroplasticity produced from cocaine is used um is why it becomes addictive like there's a kind of stimulation of that from an acute cocaine dose so i do think we need to find out a bit more about it and maybe it's down to something really specific and neurobiological um so i'll leave that to my kind of pre-clinical researchers but yes it it's fascinating now when you think about when you think about things like mdma and psilocybin the the real a lot of the therapy takes place well under the influence of the drug whether it be for ptsd or depression um is that happening also with ketamine when that patient is in the aftermath of the infusion or is that are they basically just left alone during that period of time and the psychotherapy takes place immediately following you know the next day and the next day and the next day trying to take advantage of them being less dysthymic yeah i mean in our work certainly and we wouldn't be trying to do any therapy under the influence of ketamine i think puberty dissociated you know the memory is impaired to me that's i know there are some ketamine therapists who do use this what's called kind of psycholytic approach which they use mild doses to be able to um do some therapeutic process there's a really interesting study actually from a guy where is he um in texas i think like in one of the va's i had some correspondence with him he's actually looking at complex ptsd um which is you know really severe multiple traumas and he was treating complex regional pain syndrome on top of that so these are really traumatized people who've got like really severe pain and he was giving continuous quite low dose um i can't exactly have my fingertips the dose but ketamine over 96 hours so continuous infusion and he was doing very kind of basic um psychological therapy during that time and found massive reductions in you know cap score which is on measure of ptsd symptoms which i mean it was a really small study but i thought that was quite an interesting approach um but no not to answer your question we do the therapy outside of that and i think most people with ketamine do do that i think really with cytosimin as well even people would argue what you're doing in that but they're having the acute experience is really just supporting them yeah yeah that's fair and then it's the integration afterwards where yeah well there's very little research on what integration is or what the key fundaments are it's kind of accepted that it's this thing that you have to do but i don't know we're kind of lacking in research from that side um and what do we know about the brain under the influence of ketamine i mean have people done fmri or fdg pet and and kind of looked at either the metabolic state of the brain or the activity of the brain i mean you've obviously mentioned the prefrontal cortex but is it can we get even more granular than that are there certain sections of the uh of the pfc that are more active than others yeah there's someone then there's quite a lot of really interesting work so there's the kind of i guess as you'd imagine the default mode network which is you know being tell folks what the default mode network is it's very kind of your it's basically what happens in your brain when you're not doing anything active so when you're in a scanner and we don't give anyone anything to do then that's a resting state scan and you look at how the brain networks connect so people say it's kind of yeah the task that the kind of background activity of the brain and have likened it to things like rumination which we know are important in depression which is like where you repetitively think about something you can have positive rumination as well you know repetitively think about something good but repetitively thinking about something bad more kind of mind wondering so that's why the default mode network has been kind of shown to be disrupted following psychedelics so this kind of background normal kind of chatter of your brain and also similarly with things like mindfulness so there's been studies looking at that we mentioned in prefrontal cortex there's some really interesting studies looking at prediction error signaling so the idea that your brain is basically like making predictions all the time about the world and that's how we understand everything perceptually you know we know that there's like whatever behind your computer screen there's a world behind that i would predict that if i put my laptop screen down and found there was a gap in reality then i'd have as like a massive shock of surprise because that was signal to my brain i had to learn something new so every time a prediction that we make based on our learning is violated then you get this increase in learning and attention and activity in your brain um and there's some work showing that ketamine basically disrupts there's a bit of the tortilla prefrontal cortex so sort of in your prefrontal cortex but a bit back and a bit to the side um that's really associated with this prediction error processing and that's disrupted with ketamine so things that aren't surprising become surprising the things that shouldn't be surprising and are completely predictable and things that aren't predictable are no longer surprising so basically kind of noisy signal um that i think it's like it's just quite an interesting way of understanding maybe the subjective experiences from a lot of these drugs that you turn off some of that kind of forward prediction from the brain and make a kind of a noisier signal so i think that's quite interesting way to think about the subjective experiences but yeah i mean there's quite a lot of neuroimaging work um being done i've yeah we've done some of it as well looking at kind of hippocampal function and is the brain hyper-metabolic under the influence of ketamine um i do i i think the idea is more kind of hype more hypo in some ways and so get an increase in sort of prefrontal glutamate um and we know that as well because you get attenuated so in it and an increase in kind of prefrontal function but then there's yeah so i don't know that that's particularly clear um i guess and the neuroimaging as they've done it as a method in the past it's not my area of expertise so yeah how many patients do you think um when when relieved of their depression during these ketamine trips um will need to stay on ketamine as a long-term treatment and if so at what frequency yeah so i think i that's what's really frustrating in a way is that there's all of these ketone clinics as you mentioned that sprung up well across the u.s we don't really have that in the uk because we have a state healthcare system so in the uk any patient who is receiving ketamine for depression is doing it through the nhs it's paid for by the nhs there's a couple of private clinics now um that have sprung up giving catamarans i'm involved with one actually um but there's it's mainly there's five centers prescribing on the nhs but it's all off label um because our state healthcare regulator have not recommended yet um it's bravato which is the kind of the intranasal ketamine for use and so there's no licensed ketamine for depression um so it's all prescribed for treatment resistant depression but if the physician prescribes it off label is it paid for still by nhs uh yeah in these some of these clinics yeah that have sprung up yeah so there's maybe maybe five of those at the moment but yeah i think as is potentially there's a lot of data out there that we could be looking at but we don't have a good registry of all the patients so we don't i think in answer to your question though yeah there will be a number of people that probably might respond and we don't know what in all of these clinics my sense is that not everyone has treatment resistant depression i think particularly in the u.s it's been given for a wide range of indications i mean i my guess in looking at the way it's being done in the us is there is no indication the only indication is do you want to pay for it yeah and that's really i mean that's a bit i guess there's kind of worrying signs there although but yeah i mean that's why i think it would be amazing if we could have a kind of international registry way and we we could look at and then we could look at this data we'd have the data to be able to say you know with this presentation how long someone would likely be on catamaran um because speaking from the trials data is is one thing but actually it's already being given out there you know for like you say for all manner of things so it's a shame because i think those data would be really helpful and also it would add a level of kind of safety potentially for the patients and for the clinicians um i know there's a couple of case reports of people going across state lines ketamine seeking i don't think it's a huge problem because i mean but we don't know right so we must be mindful of the potential of these things i've seen some slightly worrying trends recently but i helped organize a ketamine conference with some colleagues um some of them from the us and uh we had a few pharmaceutical companies coming in they're developing ketamine for all daily dosing and to me that's a bit of a worry having worked you know for 10 years researching caterpillar users because i feel like even if you're using very low or daily dosing you're going to have to do escalate right yeah so where's the end point and if you if you aren't giving it in a sport of therapy is the idea that people just don't catamin all the time i don't know to me it seems a bit worrying maybe there's something i'm missing about the drug development pathway there but no no i don't i mean i'm going to just take the skeptic's point of view on that i don't think you're missing anything i think it's a land grab for a greater profit motive without enormous consideration for the downside um you know so so i i mean i would i would share your i don't know what it is about ketamine that has me sort of cautious um and maybe it's just the anecdotes and that's a bad um that's a bad frame but um you know it just do you is there is this gonna sound really silly but do you do you have a scent you ever seen people with these sort of ketamine eyes like these sort of sunken distant like this person has taken too much ketamine in their life and their brain doesn't work as well anymore and i think you can have that with i'm sure there are lots of different drugs that can produce that phenotype i'm sure somebody that's taken far too much cocaine can experience something but but but it i i think it has it's something that you see more commonly i would assume with ketamine than you would with lsd or psilocybin because as you said the frequency of use is much harder with those other drugs like no one is going to i mean i shouldn't say no one i'm someone can do anything but it's far less likely that a person is going to take heroic doses of lsd or psilocybin over and over and over again whereas you could get down that path with ketamine and again it's just anecdotal but you know you see some of these people where you you get the concern it's not just the bladder i mean the cystitis is a very obvious and and tangible objective side effect that can be devastating this is much more subtle it's just something's changed in that person's brain and it's not for the better so am i just sort of making this up and it's possible i am and that i'm just over extrapolating from something else but have you you've been around this more than almost anyone do you have a concern around that yeah no we've done a lot of studies on that as well and i guess maybe i don't know we haven't studied sunken eyes but we have like yeah and it's not it's i mean it sounds silly to say it it's not physically sunken right like like you would with hypothyroidism it's just it's a vacancy is more what i'm describing a kind of dullness yeah and i mean i guess like any addiction one thing i noticed and again anecdotally was just like a lack of you know when people lose their sense of humor and that seems to be like a thing an addiction it's like the the spark has gone out of life which is odd right because what we're giving ketamine for this guy's quite a paradoxical drug in depression is to like put the spark back but then it makes sense you do it too much and maybe that's is gone and we found that you know cognitively we found cognitive impairments and with planning and we found actually um reductions in you know your hippocampus which is involved in processing novelty um and encoding memories and that's the function of that is reduced in some of our brain imaging studies with people who these are people who take daily heavy doses of catamaran so i'm not saying even your non-medical recreational user would show this kind of symptoms so people who take it occasionally but yeah really really really heavy doses i think that's possible um i don't know because seeing the way that it's administered in clinics i mean originally it was not never really the idea of it was a rapid acting antidepressant and i think the promise was that it's not a maintenance medication you know and how empowering that is for patients to not be on a daily medication and that's why i feel a bit sad that there's not more research effort going into looking at enhancing the antidepressant effect with therapy so we don't have to give people hundreds of doses of ketamine or maybe some people will just need that and that's a cost-benefit analysis i guess you make when you're prescribing any drug you know because these some of these people you know this is life threatening right like people who are really heavily suicided or say has anyone done that study where you because that's the closest way to get to a quality adjusted life year analysis which is going to be that cost benefit analysis has anyone taken that group of patients who are the most treatment resistant and randomized them to continuing to try to treat even though it's resistant versus ketamine and looking at really hard outcomes like differences in suicide rate there's people who have definitely done work with patients with suicidal ideation yeah and you get reduced mortality with ketamine so i guess and they have randomized people which is i mean these are tough studies to do right yeah of course they're ethically difficult as well when you know that you have a treatment yeah really really difficult um and so just you know amazing um just yeah i'm amazingly an aware of the researchers doing that work because it's so important so so what is your intuition say is probably the sweet spot for what the intermittent you know call it transient but fixed use of ketamine is as a bridge to go from completely treatment resistant to depres depression to treatable depression well yeah i mean i guess my works mean with people with addiction so maybe i could talk about that because i feel you know more able to speak just from our data but there we used as i was saying like these three doses and seven three three doses specific um separated by seven days each yeah seven days to two weeks um and then that was a 0.8 milligrams per kilogram so it's quite a slightly higher dose than in depression because you get a sort of cross-tolerance with alcohol um because alcohol also works on the same receptor as ketamine at higher doses so that's you know when people get really intoxicated and feel like they're spinning out that's that's kind of your alcohol working on your nmda receptors um so yeah we use that to be doses and these i mean people with alcohol problems have depression as well and can be quite severely treatment resistant what we found that i think is interesting is we were still seeing impacts on like reductions in rumination which i meant that repetitive negative thinking and reductions in anhedonia which is a hallmark of depression but also across multiple disorders and that's an inability to experience pleasure in the world and um so we saw reductions in that at three months but they were back to baseline at six months whereas they were still showing reductions in drinking which is i thought was really interesting so they might suggest like certainly in depression that maybe that would be the time you know so you have maybe weekly or fortnightly days yeah because to me that that model makes a bit more sense if you if you could say look this is a treatment that you know you need to do once a once a quarter you know every three months you know so you have a loading phase where you do the infusion weekly for three or four weeks and then you're on to kind of a quarterly schedule um that to me is very interesting uh yeah what's what's less interesting to me and what i'm seeing certain people do is twice a week ketamine infusion for life i mean that that strikes me as you know i just i i worry about the toxicity of the drug and b i'm it would have to really have an enormous efficacy to justify it seems um and and i look at the short-term studies where they're comparing ketamine to versed like it's not that much better not that verset is a good option by the way but you know when you're using verset as a control um and you're seeing well basically that's telling you there's a pretty big placebo effect from doing this as well no exactly oh anything it was but on and well i mean that's my intuition as well this a positive thing if we're maintaining people on this twice weekly you know for life so tell me why you think it's working in addiction and and do you primarily work in alcohol addiction or do you also look at opioid addiction we want to look at opioid addiction as well and actually there's some other work going on in the u.s um looking at opioid addiction and this work dates back to some work by a russian psychiatrist of jenny krapitsky who did work with heroin addicts and found a similar you know dosing regime which was just three infusions with his psychological therapy around it produced reductions in heroinis at 12 months you know quite significant do you know how much how much of a reduction i know in alcohols there's a 40 reduction in relapse right at 12 months in these russians at 12 months yeah and what's the control group which i assume is doing is the control doing pharmacotherapy or behavioral therapy such as twelve i mean to this for context this is in the 80s in russia they were inpatient alcoholics and um so they were a lot in lock towards so i remember saying to have jenny did anyone drop out so they can't drop out they're locked in so i think it wasn't in the normal consensus ethics process as we have now um but still a really important study and both groups had 100 people in and so and it wasn't you know it wasn't a randomized controlled trial he asked people if they wanted to be in this catamine and psychotherapy group so i'm sorry i don't understand the trial you have an inpatient trial where all the patients are given yeah trial and quotes this would constitute a dodgy trial um yeah this is dodgy so it's inpatient and they're all given unlimited access to alcohol but they're no no no no no they're not they don't have so how do we know how do we know what the relapse rate is they say they do they do their detox they get given their kettleman they're discharged and then when followed up oh well i see so they're out they they behave as outpatients but they're not allowed to drop out in other words if you drop out the kgb bring you back well yeah they couldn't drop out of the treatment i was what i was asking him about was like do people tolerate the treatment well yeah they just did this they didn't get like shot by the kgb you know yeah yeah so they were really important study you say yeah i'd only ask people if they wanted to have this it was kind of like group psychodynamics psychotherapy with just three infusions of ketamine he was using higher doses so around an intramuscular to one to two milligrams per kilogram so yeah quite strong so but we haven't done the head to head of ketamine plus behavioral therapy versus pharmacologic plus behavioral therapy for alcohol no we haven't i've done catamaran plus therapy plus compared to catamaran with a kind of therapy control yes compared to placebo and therapy compared to perceive it so i did a full arm trial okay so tell us about that tell us about that trial oh yeah so that's the one that i mean it's been so yeah what we found i mean which was great because that's what we hypothesized and that's quite rare i wasn't expecting to get what we hoped for was that we saw the strongest the greatest reductions in drinking and greatest abstinence in our ketamine and therapy group and it's 86 abstinent at rates at um six months and then the second best effect was in our ketamine and education control so we wanted to look at the effect of therapy get them in with them without therapy but there's really none specific effects of just spending hours with a therapist is quite nice so we would put the kind of we concocted this i mean it's a bit like medication management which is used in a lot of the us trust so tell me about what that's a that's a that's a very elegant trial um design because you get away from what's called the performance bias of the therapy right the the therapy itself you have to make sure you're you're controlling for just the fact that an hour three times a week they have to go talk to somebody and so the question is so tell me what they do in the education arm of that yeah so we wanted so that we wanted it to be i mean it's not blind right i think for most people but some people thought they'd have the therapy so that's quite positive um because you can't that's another issue is that you're really blind for psychotherapy but um people were doing kind of calculations about alcohol talking about how alcohol affects the body and we did some relaxation but just as we thought as a bare minimum of what we wanted to do with people going into like a ketamine session you know a ketone infusion was to have a bit of a relaxation um control so i think maybe the relaxation helps with the blinding but yeah i know we were pleased with the design i mean and then did for the non-ketamine group did they get versed or what type of a control do they get what's the placebo the same so where they got no they got they just got saline basically also no dissociative effects no i know which is a bit of a shame um in retrospect we should have used something yeah like midazolam or yeah yeah of universe said but we just use the saline placebo okay so it's i mean we nevertheless so it's a it's a but it's still a very elegant two by two study perhaps only limited by the fact that the control didn't get some sort of active substance yeah but nevertheless at 12 months or sorry at six months you said that the double positive group double positive meaning ketamine plus actual psychotherapy dedicated towards alcohol reduction did you say 86 were still alcohol free at six months abstinence rates yeah which is good really i mean we were really impressed and then there was and then what about the other good the response were quite good in all of the groups but it was statistically significantly different so that's you know what we care about research so there was um a small i mean it was 96 patients it didn't feel like a small trial it was only 24 patients per arm so we weren't powered for the really for the full interaction but actually we're taking it forward now into a phase three with 280 patients so that's good again funded by the uk state which is great so we get to run it in nhs settings and hopefully see it as a medicine you know in those in those contexts because one thing i mean i don't know what you think of the psychedelics world but um and i think some of the therapies are amazing but for our state health care system those things are not ever going to happen you're never going to have two therapists for 40 hours you know so i wanted to come up with a therapy that was deliverable in our state healthcare system because you know i mean certainly it's a great idea that you could you have that kind of system but we've got we have had we've got these kind of slightly lower level trained therapists and there's a lot of them in the nhs here and so we designed our therapy to be quite manualized so that they could deliver it um and it take a short amount of time so how much therapy how much therapy were they getting in the activities they get about only about and total about 11 hours in six months yeah so they just get they get it for the treatment part and i do think that you know like oh so just in those first three weeks or two weeks when they're getting it's it's three doses separated by seven days yeah for um for a total so they have a therapy session before their infusion immediately before and so if they were in the therapy group they would be doing kind of mindfulness practice and then in the education group there's some relaxation and then they have the ketamine session and then they just recover you know as you would from an anaesthetic and they go home come back the next day where we think the peak of their um the kind of synaptic plasticity effects are and they have another not so these are longest sessions of an hour and a half therapy and they so it's kind of a ketamine infusion sandwich between two therapy sessions and they repeat that three times what is the therapist talking about i don't really know much about alcohol addiction but so so when you like in particular when that patient comes in the day after their first ketamine infusion when they're as you said at their maximum neuroplasticity what i mean i assume the therapist has a very clear playbook for how they want to work with that patient in that 90-minute block what what's in that playbook i'm saying some of it's very pragmatic you know things like what are your most risky situations for drinking like trying to preempt um situations where they might relapse but some of it's more about how you want to live your life and the values you want to embody um so trying to think about thinking about your life without alcohol how would you structure that and there's some yeah with things about thinking about your thinking around drinking which is more kind of cognitive behavioral therapy based what are your thinking biases let's identify those and then planning so they have quite a lot of activities to do in the week or weeks in between the sessions you know what i guess like standard homeworks but planning their days journaling um keeping track of those things we teach kind of mindfulness techniques to enable people to deal with cravings um to get a bit more of a space between them and their kind of addictive impulses so there's a whole range of stuff really we through the book of the evidence-based therapies at them oh sorry go ahead yeah no no no no did you go ahead no no i was just gonna ask you tell me about the inclusion criteria i mean obviously you're dealing with a patient who's motivated who says i want to stop drinking and then they they actually come and do a pre-infusion therapy session is there anything that in that session the therapist says we're not going to include this patient like is there is there another decision that's made of a go no go based on that pre-infusion session well the go-no goes normally made before that so they had to go through like a number of screenings basically to get as is with a clinical trial which is kind of a problem with clinical trials that we end up with quite pure populations but we needed people to be abstinent when they started as we were talking about right at the beginning you know with a lot of people who are drinking they can't stop straight away so they either need to go through a medical detox in most cases or you know supervised most of those are in the community now so you can work with people's healthcare providers to um support them as they're doing that so we keep checking in with them until they're ready to start so normally maybe two weeks after if they've done a full detox if someone's drinking really heavily but we're they're at levels that we think you know we can help them support them cut down over a four week period we would do that so they'd normally be a kind of pre-screening where we check all the medical um contraindications for people and psychiatric ones so we don't include people with psychosis or psychosis in our first degree relative people with uncontrolled blood pressure because of ketamine increasing you're like so uncontrolled hypertension because ketamine increases your blood pressure and a variety of other things um we would exclude people from the study um and then we have to access kind of their medical notes and so yeah it's quite a process but the main bit is getting people abstinent and so when so this all the therapy is all around like you know supporting people with a new life and giving using the kettleman experience really to get that perspective um a perspective they might not have had for a while a kind of new perspective to think about their life in a new way um and try and focus on how they want to go forward really so it's really i'm using the ketamine as a catalyst for the therapy rather than purely focusing on the pharmacological properties of it and uh remind me how much does blood pressure go up in that type of a therapy when you're at point eight megs per gig what's the raise what's the increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure i don't know it really varies so some people are really minimal some people like it goes up about 10 um i guess i'm i'm trying to think um as a psychologist i guess we have anesthetist there for the whole thing so they're probably checking that yeah there was someone we had to stop the infusion because it went above i think it went over 180 um so but that was that's pretty rare and that's do you know why we we we do exclude people but then my anaesthetist colleagues say you know if we're people in theater we just give them ketamine perspective of this they're they're quite you know they're i guess because of the way anesthetist the people that kill you right ultimately of all the medical professionals who wanna they're quite um yeah desensitized i guess to risk whereas we're like oh right so again tell me what the response rate was in the double negative group so the group that didn't get the ketamine and only got the education but without therapy what was their six-month and was like still i mean really high so about six just 68 i think how what do you attribute that to so it means there's a 20 difference between the two the two extremes which is still great but how do you attribute a 68 non-drink or an abstinence rate in people that didn't get ketamine and didn't really even get therapy they just sat down and talked with somebody about alcohol biochemistry yeah yeah i mean and it is i think that was pretty extraordinary for any clinical trial and we did have a really lovely team so i partly put it down to that i think you know it's something you see in clinical trials people just do better hey because they they've gone through this whole rigmarole process with this really strong intention to stop you know so they've been through quite a lot of hurdles that the trial was pretty demanding so if you stuck with it we also had things which i hadn't mentioned like um we had a scram i don't know if you've ever seen them they're using criminal justice um more lindsay lohan had to wear one when she had some duis it's basically like a tag that you put around your ankle and measures your um alcohol through transdermally because you excrete about one percent of alcohol and sweat so there were things that we were using to measure alcohol that might have actually act as an intervention on their own and you know the fact that you have to go over it wasn't now we're using a much more discreet wearable wait but then it's a really clunky thing you know you have to say you're not gonna do swimming for six months you know all these things i think that in itself was an intervention yep um but also just be you know a lot of these people don't have a lot of social connections some of them did but the fact of having people looking after them checking in on them all the time you know repeatedly measuring like people just showing you general human kindness i think can have obviously a really positive effect in a group that might be quite isolated yeah i mean that that's amazing i mean i think these are really kind of staggering insights because you have everything from the monitoring of compliance to just the interaction i don't say any of this to diminish the fascination i have in both two components of this one being the effect of the ketamine and therapy producing 88 abstinence at six months but also just looking at the control group and realizing it didn't take much to move the needle and what can we learn from that sort of more big picture it's a bit of a sad statement it really is yeah and i think our alcohol services here in the uk are just so dysfunctional at the moment you have to you know people by the time they get to any sort of treatment people they're really seriously complexly you know with multiple health problems or people have been through multiple treatments and they've not worked i don't know and it's really hard to access therapists so it's like multiple things just like oh yeah it's really sad it doesn't actually take that much to shift something that's pretty entrenched you know but well the other thing too is um it makes me wonder about less responsive cohorts down the line where you would expect the response rate to be lower but let's say you took an individual who's less interested in not drinking you know i mean i don't think you could treat someone who says i'm gonna keep drinking but someone who maybe hasn't fully hit rock bottom but says you know yeah maybe i'm drinking too much and yeah i probably meet the criteria for being an alcoholic but but i haven't destroyed my life yet you know i just i just sort of wonder if you have these places for earlier intervention as someone is on the path towards um you know really destructive alcoholism so so a lot lots here so in the phase three obviously you said 200 plus patients so that's going to be great you're still going to do the same for arms well actually i mean it's funded by the nh at the department for health care so we've gone down to take the two most extreme arms um ideally i mean in an ideal world of infinite resource i would definitely have the forearms because i really like that design and i think something's really missing from the broader psychedelics world is teasing apart the impact of the therapy and the drug but um i think we felt speaking to clinicians so we've got like a patient advocacy group involved from the start that actually given potentially the you know some of the risks with ketamine that we wouldn't really want to give it without a therapeutic container so having found these promising effects for this efficacy study which is more of a definitive study then we would just take the most extreme arms but yeah so we're looking just with the therapy and then you know the various other more discrete wearables compared to our um placebo but we're using a low dose ketamine this time um instead um to manage expectancy um so what will then what will that slow down will the high dose still be 0.8 megs per kilogram yeah and the low dose is low like 0.05 we're sort of working out with some piloting but and why is that because at point at uh not 0.5 they will their point not five actually they'll experience nothing right i mean they shouldn't feel anything yeah not really anything we've done some other studies and we've done some studies with morphine and um childhood traumas they're looking at people's you know we've i mean it's completely a different area of research looking at how childhood trauma seems to synthesize the brain to the to respond to opiates um and there we found actually using a very low dose morphine was kind of a better control than another drug so i think it's actually helpful in expectancy so you tell people you're getting it you're getting the drugs no matter what yeah yeah yeah yeah and then also because we had patients actually drop out because well too because they thought you know they knew that they hadn't got the kettleman they hadn't got the active so we're saying you're getting one of two doses of ketamine it's kind of easier to maintain people in that the other thing is you might be able to recruit some kgb offers to kgb officers to help with that uh that dropout rate exactly no one drops out so we're not doing any dodgy stuff no no no no no this is this is not a this is a non-dodgy trial non-dodgy um um so what's your what's your there's one other thing i want to talk about before we we we we wrap this up so i want to but i want to sort of put a bow on the ketamine story um

[01:36:06] what would you say to people here in the u.s right so where where ketamine clinics are ubiquitous and as far as i can tell i think you can just walk into them i don't think you need a referral i don't think you need a medical referral to go to a ketamine clinic although i think there are therapists who do make referrals and say look this is a reputable clinic and i'm sure that there are many reputable clinics and you know your depression is recalcitrant or um you know you're having this problem in your life and i think it could get better here so i so i suspect that there's a really good conduit of therapists sending patients appropriately to good ketamine clinics but let's also pause it that anybody can walk into a ketamine clinic which i really do believe is true um and sort of tell the persons there hey i'm having this issue i want to do it but there's a bit of a conflict in that model because when you walk into the clinic they're in sort of incentivized to do what they do right when you're a hammer everything's a nail when you're a ketamine clinic you're incentivized to give ketamine um how would you caution people around ketamine uh use liberally in that context i suppose i'd say that it's the evidence you know that we've gathered and not just us doesn't another group at yale sam wilkinson has looked at immunotherapy and ketzman and there's another trial starting in depression is that actually it's a bit of a waste if you just if you just do the ketamine you should certainly try it embedded within therapy and you probably don't need you know all of those doses i think interrogating what you're trying to get out of that experience and that actually it's you know i think it's that's great to hear that therapists refer people to ketamine clinics like we've got so far with therapy then we're going to use this as a boost so we can continue the therapy to me that seems much more appealing model because really do people want i don't think people want to be kind of stuck on a drug even if you're not you know addicted but you're going in twice a week or even once a week like that's so disempowering for patients we know that right and speaking to patients one of the things they said was great about that are treatment approaches you know rather than being on daily meds or things like other treatments and alcohol like the campus say you have to take three times a day they feel pretty liberated you know and they know they're doing the healing themselves which i think is a really important part of the process so i'd say yeah get get kind of get a therapist think about using a really minimal number of doses i mean i do um yeah it's worrying there's some really worrying practices that you hear about you know some mail order ketamine clinics i don't really worry about them from the abuse side maybe i'm wrong not to but just because it's so expensive i think unless you're you know you have to have a lot of money to be able to afford that ketamine but i just think it works unsafe because if it certainly don't take getting at home when you're not supervised you know this drug makes you completely dissociated from your environment if you if something happens there's a fire and all sorts of things could happen you can't take it unsupervised but i think there's a lack of kind of clinical care and supervision in some of these models um that yeah i find that really worrying but it's expensive as well so yeah you you sort of answered what my next question was going to be which was not at all to to say do you condone the use of of non-medical or recreational ketamine but more to say if someone is going to use ketamine recreationally what what is the what is the instruction set you provide them to make sure that they don't harm themselves psychologically and physically so one of them is if i'm just going to extrapolate it's like if people are going to do ketamine recreationally there really needs to be somebody around watching them right you can't you can't trust yourself to be under the influence of this drug at least at a high dose which i'm guessing based on what we've said is you know depending on your size 100 to 200 milligrams would be considered a high dose yeah really high and i think you know start really small doses and i guess that's the advice that you would always give to people with any non-medical use of a drug yeah and do it in a you know safe place with someone who's not under the influence of any substances and start with a small dose but yeah i mean it's not i don't know so much them in the us you rarely get ketamine particularly cut with other things but it can happen so there's something to be careful of as well wow that's interesting what would it typically be cut with people i mean there are ketamine analogues which people have shown so there's a drug methyl settlement um so they're the kind of research chemicals that have come out of labs in china israel um so it's an analog of ketamine but it's got studies have shown more toxicity with the bladder um and slightly maybe higher abuse potential but yeah typically i mean i yeah i don't i don't think it's it's normally particularly cut with things but it's something to be mindful of and why it's really important to take a small dose you know but ideally yeah obviously i think cautionary non-medical use well celia that's i mean this is super interesting i mean this is i've sort of been deliberately sort of ignorant of ketamine i don't know why i've sort of gone down the rabbit hole and trying to understand as much as possible about these other uh agents which ironically are tend to be the one that are schedule one and therefore not really readily available for clinical use outside of trials we do have many clinical trials here in the united states looking at in particular the use of psilocybin and mdma um but but ketamine's been a bit of a black box to me and yet it's the one that i probably have seen the most people use because of course it can be used legally so i found this discussion very helpful i found this discussion really insightful um and it it sort of uh clarified for me a lot of the the use case the neurobiology the risks and and perhaps most importantly what the promise of this agent is um so i want to thank you for your time and again i know it's late there in the uk at the moment and uh and more importantly i think thank you for the work you're doing this is really fascinating uh and i and i kind of love the model oh thanks for having me peter [Music]
