**Duration:** 1 minutes

## Description

In this “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) episode, Peter dives deep into the topic of muscle mass and strength, examining their essential roles in both lifespan and healthspan. Drawing from over 30 hours of prior discussions with experts including Layne Norton, Andy Galpin, and Mike Israetel, this episode distills the most important insights into one comprehensive and up-to-date conversation. Peter explores why muscle matters for longevity, metabolic health, and injury prevention, and clarifies the differences between muscle mass and strength, including which is more vital for aging well. He breaks down practical strategies for building muscle safely and effectively, including progressive overload, training intensity, rep ranges, and the importance of explosive power. Peter also covers key nutrition strategies—like protein intake, timing, and creatine supplementation—and offers practical advice for everyone from beginners to seasoned lifters on building and maintaining muscle safely and sustainably.
