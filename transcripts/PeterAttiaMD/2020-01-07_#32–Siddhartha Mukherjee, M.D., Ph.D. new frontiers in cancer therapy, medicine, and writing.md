[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD comm

[00:00:40] hey everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive my guest this week is Sid Mukherjee who is a remarkable writer in fact a Pulitzer Prize winning writer in a remarkable physician and scientist in fact probably there's nobody I know that combines those three things as efficaciously as Sid does his biography reads like I'm making it up he studied biology at Stanford he then became a Rhodes Scholar went to Oxford earned his PhD in immunology returned to the United States to earn his MD at

[00:01:13] Harvard etc etc etc fast forward to today he is an associate professor of medicine in the division of hematology and oncology at Columbia University which is where we met to do this interview he has published also and continues to publish consistently in both The New Yorker and the New York Times which and of itself is quite a distinction as I would learn typically one is on either side of those but not both and of course he's published in New

[00:01:38] England Journal of Medicine nature in addition to a whole host of other medical journals I met Sid by five years ago at a dinner that was set up by Luc Antley someone I'll be interviewing very shortly who will be a guest obviously soon and while I remember that dinner very well I was surprised to learn that it left such an impression on Sid and he described it as something to the effect of one of the most interesting and perhaps important scientific collaborations in his life that stemmed from it as we kind of jotted out a napkin experiment that went on to become a paper that was published by a group led by Lou and and that paper was published this past summer and we talked about that in detail that paper involved the use of ketogenic diets in combination with a class of drugs called pi3 kinase inhibitors we're gonna go into great detail on that so I obviously don't want to repeat any of that stuff here but I think for those of you that are interested in cancer you're obviously gonna find this episode very interesting but the other thing we had said is it doesn't matter if you have no interest in cancer I think you'll find this discussion interesting because say it has a way of making everything interesting and that to me is part of

[00:02:43] SIDS gift when I got his book the gene in the summer of 2016 when it came out it's one of probably only six books in my life that I was not able to stop reading from the moment I started so it's one of those things where everything else I was doing had to be put aside for a few days until I could finish that book that's just the way said writes and it's also the way he speaks he is a unique human being and I think that will come across in this interview the other thing that was a total pleasant surprise to me was in doing the research for this podcast was coming across a book that I was ashamed to admit I didn't even know he'd written called the laws of medicine or that's big it's called the Three Laws of medicine and we talk about these three laws and rather than even stating them now I just think it's worth this podcast is worth the price of admission just on the basis of understanding those three laws so with that I hope you will welcome Sid to the show and I do want to just remind folks to please sign up for the email list I've been putting a lot of effort into those emails every Sunday morning they go out and I hope that they're at least worth some value I think they are and I like to be able to kind of share things with folks that I'm reading or seeing along the way and they don't always have to do with longevity keep in mind one of the things that I think takes up more actual time than anything else with respect to this podcast is putting together the show notes so Bob and Travis work really hard on those and the feedback we've been getting is incredible people keep saying my god how do you make these things and the short answer is I don't I don't do any of it but Bob and Travis do especially Travis and I think that if you spend a few minutes looking at that stuff especially if you find some of the content challenging and when we get into technical terms which we do on some of the pod you're pretty much gonna find everything in the shownotes lastly if you're enjoying this it would be an honor if you would head on over to Apple podcast reviews and leave us a review especially if it's a positive one but we'll take a negative one too as long as you can be constructive in your feedback so without further delay here is my guest today Sid

[00:04:43] Mukerjee hey sit thanks for making time my pleasure thanks for being here yeah I don't get up to this part of the city very often so if I hike well it's a massive Medical School and it's hard to imagine it anywhere else except for uptown in this way you know we go right all the way to the river it's amazing and the last time

[00:05:04] I was up here was to see another one of your colleagues on the other side of the street Rudy Leibel who's a good friend and I used to be up here a lot more often so it was nice to come back most of our podcasts go really really long this one I don't think we have that luxury of time so I kind of want to get right into things but before we do I certainly think for the listener who doesn't know you well your your background which I'll allude to a lot in the introductions we don't spend too much time on it but you grew up in India came to the u.s. did you do college here or I went to college at Stanford yeah oh that's right you went undergrad at

[00:05:33] Stanford okay then Medical School at Harvard actually then in the middle I was away for three years I did a little road scholarship yeah you're a Rhodes Scholar yeah I was it was called and that's where I got my PhD and my PhD is in immunology mm-hmm which is a subject that I left behind I went to medical school at Harvard

[00:05:49] Medical School then did my fellowship my internship my residency at Mass General Hospital fellowship at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and then started my own lab and clinical practice at Columbia University and have come back to immunology in a strange wide widening circle of the way yeah the first time we met was a dinner that Luke and Lee had planned for us as about three or four years ago and I remember at the time the topic that Lou is passionate about that

[00:06:20] I'm passionate about was sort of metabolism of cancer and at the time I wasn't something that seemed as interesting to you as it is today and I know today I want to talk so much more about that because the work you guys have done in the last few years is in many ways what I think is the most interesting stuff to talk about it was also a tough dinner because you don't eat most things it's hard to have dinner with someone when you went half the menus off the menu so anyway we somehow managed and scraped by and it was a wonderful evening actually led to what was that five years ago yeah led to one of the most interesting and perhaps important scientific collaborations in my life with Lou Lou but it was at that dinner which we kind of hammered it was in a

[00:06:58] Japanese restaurant on the Upper East Side in a tiny little place you remember I that's exactly I know exactly exactly it was well because we wrote on it you know it was a little bit like one of these napkin experiments where you write on a napkin an idea and that idea takes five years to come alive this thing that was sketched on a napkin that evening and is now leading to a actually kind of a massive clinical trial across multiple sites very energetic teams coming in to all of this out of that little napkin on

[00:07:27] Japanese restaurant yeah that was a really fun night prior to that I had read the Emperor of all maladies I don't think the gene was out yet the gene was not out yet I want to spend just a couple minutes on the Emperor of all maladies because if there's anybody listening to this who hasn't read it you won the Pulitzer Prize for that book I believe I did yes yeah so it's it's a must read having myself studied in oncology there were so much that I learned you know I trained at Hopkins which is you know so we're in the

[00:07:51] Halstead School of where the mastectomy was created where many of these things were created but to really understand the history of Barnard Fisher's role in the mess that community it's just an unbelievable story my only criticism was at the time quite a depressing story yeah you know I mean I'm not saying that to be critical I mean is the criticism of youth in the field no no it was to me actually interestingly people often bring this up idea up for me it was actually it's far from a depressing story it's just the opposite in fact if we don't contend with the question of how I mean the emperor of all maladies just for people who don't know is a history of cancer starting from its first description in Egypt right down to my own patients thousands of years of a journey against a disease that seems to morph in change over time every time we look at it this has a new form it reflects our own diversity to some extent our own violinist our own imagination as humans so to me not a depressing book because it is a way to look directly

[00:08:50] Klee at the face of the enemy and I don't find that depressing I find that clarifying and there are many many high points in this journey there's the invention of the great surgeries that save tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of lives around the world the dramatic advances against breast cancer and most importantly against some variants of leukemia whether mortality was a hundred percent in 1950 and is five or ten percent now 95 percent change in mortality is a huge difference in must rank is one of the great medical inventions of our time so for me far from a depressing book but a bit to me a clarifying book that tries to clarify why we're here today where we're going what happens next why we're not doing certain things why we are doing certain things so that's my impression of what happened at the end of that book when did the idea to write as it's really referred to the biography of cancer when did that idea come to you was it in your fellowship and your training at something yeah I was training and it was a very simple moment actually I remember a woman who I was treating for cancer came to me and I was giving her yet another trial of targeted therapy a new kind of therapy and she finally sat down on one afternoon and she said where are we going with all of this why are we here how do we get here and she was of course asking it in a very personal level but you could take that question and make it a much much larger question where are we going in this battle against cancer why are we here today what happens next why aren't we elsewhere how much of this is the wildness of this family of diseases how much of this is the capacity to use our the greatest skills of our imagination against this illness you know in the 1930s 1940s 1950s when you asked a child what the outer limit of their scientific imagination was they would say I want to be a rocket scientist and I want to send a rocket to the moon by the 1950s 60s 70s if you ask that same child what the outer limits of their scientific imagination would bring to the world they would say I want to cure cancer it began to define the limits of our scientific prowess are the limits of our imagination a world without cancer so there is a sense in which this is such an elemental illness so much of our culture is now defined through the lens of cancer and what was shocking as a fellow and I started encountering cancer in the clinical sense was shocking was that there was no such history that it was all ad hoc and we knew little bits and pieces of it was like looking at the enemy through a patchwork quilt with little holes in it and the attempt here was to say well what is the full story what does the story look like when did this start why did we end up here what happens tomorrow what happens way into the future 100 years what will cancer look like and a lot of thought experiments go into the book so that's sort of the genesis of the book and that's how it came about the research is also remarkable for a book like that anyone who's read it will appreciate and and again I think what's nice is this is one of those books where you can be an oncologist and read it and find it staggering and you can be someone who has lost a loved one to cancer but wouldn't know the difference between a sarcoma and a leiomyosarcoma doesn't matter the book resonates which obviously speaks to your ability to tell a story and then that's sort of Tim he what mind-boggling about that book is the way and it's the same in the gene by the ways that you weave in and out of a personal story and then something that's very dense scientifically and on a personal level this is challenging because I'm in the process as you know of writing a book and doing a pretty lousy job of it I think but it's this challenge of you want to be able to do the science justice but you need to build a tell a story so how does the the scientist Sid Mukherjee get along with the writer Sid Mukherjee well I don't think there are two separate people I think they're integrated into one person and that's very important there are many people in my world they wrote as a process of thinking Stephen Jay Gould comes to mind not to draw a ludicrous comparison Charles Darwin wrote to think of Oliver Sacks wrote to think I would suspect that Atul

[00:12:55] Gawande writes to think I mean I know it's also so the two people are fundamentally not different people in my brain in order to do the scientific work that I do I need to think it through often through the essays that I work on and they inspire you know kind of yin yang or roundabout way circular way ways didn't find new ways of thinking about the world the cancer world so there isn't a conflict I don't feel a conflict the process is probably of interest I mean the process is that when I started writing Emperor I sort of made a personal vow or a strategy in writing that this was my first book I'd never written a book before I wrote down some principles or tenets that I would follow and I've kept them in every book since the first one was that there will be no scientific abstraction but no place or point shall you go through five pages or three pages without there being a human being in the middle of this I'm I'm a translational researcher I'm a human scientist and that meant that I've made a personal promise that you wouldn't go through five pages without understanding what the payoff of these pages that you've really worked your way through often as a reader what the payoff is so if you look carefully through that book every five to seven pages the story comes alive in a human story in a scientific story and in a scientist story they all intersect they and sometimes through my stories there are times that are tough when I'm writing what the description the first cancer-causing genes oncogenes and their mutations it's tough to say well what's the human being this is a laboratory experiment in which you sprinkle tens of thousands of bits of genetic material onto cells and ask the question which cells become turned from normal to cancerous and that's the way you trap one of these cancer-causing oncogenes what's the human story behind well they're two stories one story is quite lovely it's the story of Bob Weinberg the scientist who you know walking through Boston in a snowstorm and suddenly realizing not in a one-to-one manner but this idea of sprinkling tens of thousands of genes onto pieces of genetic material onto cells like a snowstorm of genes there's a kind of congruence to that story it's not like

[00:15:12] Bob Weinberg woke up one morning and saw a snowstorm and said that's the experiment I should do but there's a kind of emotional congruence to the back story of a scientist but then the second story that illustrates this point is to walk through a patient telescoping down or other Oh scoping down words from their outer cancer a tumor a lump a mass that is about to kill them a real patient of mine a man with lung cancer and slowly in that same story of this man's illness began to microscope down to the fact that he actually has in his cells this mutant gene that Bob Weinberg once caught in the snowstorm of sprinkling genes on cells and all of a sudden this man's cancer he's sitting in a room in

[00:16:02] Boston surrounded by his family dying of metastatic lung cancer but at the heart at the root of that lung cancer is that very same gene that very same oncogene that was discovered described 1020 years before in a paper in a kind of dry abstract scientific paper and all of a sudden that gene the genetic material that can drive the growth of a normal cell in being make it malignant making metastatic so metastatic so malignant that our best medicine our best minds can't stop the growth of this aberrant cell all being driven in part by that very same gene that was trapped twenty years ago in in a laboratory experiment on rat cells so all of a sudden this thing comes alive to you in a way that it becomes consequential if you didn't know the identity of the gene you would not understand why on earth this 70 year old man in perfectly good health he's all of a sudden decimated by one or two or four or eight mutant genes in his cells that suddenly take over and drive the growth of these cells anyway that's one example and comes up over and over again so that was the first tenet that was the first what was the second one there are many so I'm not going to go through all the tenets but the second one was that this book all these books should be fundamentally readable by everyone you talked about this already it should be like a kaleidoscope that if you turn the book left words in you you see it as an oncologist it's still interesting the pattern changes if you turn the book right words and say you're an anthropologist it still is interesting if you turn the kaleidoscope upside down and shake it in and there's a new pattern that's formed it's because you're reading the book now as a clinical scientist or you're reading the book because your daughter has leukemia and you're the father of a patient with with leukemia or you're reading it because you yourself have been diagnosed with breast cancer or your mother has and all of a sudden the

[00:18:02] Kaleidoscope changes but the point is that the object remains the same it's the same book but you can read the book in various different ways you can come into a different ways often when I'm in this sounds like a strange statement often when I come back from the wards I reread my own writing to figure out sort of what was I thinking then in 2008 when

[00:18:23] I wrote those sentences and how does that change now has it really been ten years soon ten years so I should tell you that there will be a ten year update to the emperor there'll be three other three additional chapters I assume one of them will be immunotherapy as an update that's right so they're very broadly three sections that are updated and I've thought about it for a long time so there'll be an updated section on prevention there'll be an updated section on early detection and an updated section on treatment so that's the very broad three big broad chapters but in every chapter there will be deeper dives into what's happened now since the last ten years and within the treatment section and potentially within the prevention section there'll be a huge role of the immune system which was not fully appreciated in 2010 I thought that was the biggest distinction between the book when I read it and then the PBS special a Ken Burns special which of course again will link to all of these things in the show notes here but one you got to read the book but - I can't recommend enough the Ken Burns special they did an unbelievable job I think sharing your voice and that was the biggest I remember watching it thinking oh wow there's a big difference here because there's a three installments or five I can't repeat yet the third installment felt like it was half immunotherapy it was half a minute at people because part of the reason was that again this brings me to the next tenets in the book or writing the book the next tenet was that there's so much cancer research in laboratories going on everywhere and the tenets or the principle was that unless that research has manifest itself in a human drug in a human medicine in a

[00:19:57] Rican ception of how think about preventing treating or detecting cancer in a fundamental reconceptualize I D --is it won't get into the book so tumor immunology of course had been around for a very long time Coley's toxins famously and another such efforts very very early on but in 2010 we were at the edge of that moment in which we began to use tumor immunology in human beings as powerful medicines to change the course of the disease it was just the first trials that come out and in fact the book was completed in 2009 and the first trials had not even come out then this is a little funny trivia story that I'd almost forgotten about this until somebody mentioned it to me a year ago I think the first real paper that I wrote as a fellow was on ctla-4 it was looking back at this series at NCI of patients who had been given ctla-4 and responded and this paper basically identified the strong association between autoimmunity and their response to it right of course this will be interesting later in our discussion because I want to of course talk about James Allison so we'll come back to that but you're right that was sort of when it went from you had interleukin 2 that worked in maybe 10% 15% of patients but you couldn't predict why that was the bigger question you didn't know why were some responding and why were they only responding with certain cancers to where we are today where it's really been a transformation in the last 15 years absolutely and so when we started the film version of emperor with Ken Burns which I obviously was very close I work very closely with

[00:21:27] Ken I should say that the gene is also being made into film by Ken Burns oh my god it's like Christmas all over again it's almost completely shot we're sort of moving towards that editing phases and so forth but when can people expect that movie it's already been scheduled I think it's winter or fall 2019 so it's on the skates on so what a year from now yeah how about a year from now yeah we're working through footage and historical footage and archival footage and so forth but to wind backwards the crucial piece that had been added since the book was of course immunological therapy so much of what the last episode was around this new burgeoning field I mean in the first meeting that we had around the transformation of the book into the documentary film the first thing that was raised is what's changed and the answer was very obvious what's let's go therapy it might have been emphasized as much in the book and I may have just missed it or it's possible you also observed this as a change but I believe it will factor into the 10th edition which I can't wait to get my hands on is the role of obesity in cancer as if I recall in the documentary you said look this is now becoming basically the second leading preventable cause of cancer after smoking which was again I was aware of that at that point in time because of the work that I'd been doing and sort of my little echo chamber but I thought this is a PBS bet this is not something that I think most people would appreciate this is becoming a first for many people to hear that's right and the one thing that we should make clear is that every word in that

[00:22:55] PBS document was vetted by some of the most important and thoughtful scientists and cancer biologists and physicians and physician scientists and cancer advocates across the world there's a backstory in other words the script was vetted over and over again so that we wouldn't say things that were misinforming the public or or because this is this is documentaries for all time Ken Burns's workers evergreen hopefully my work is evergreen so it was very very carefully vetted and it was quite clear by the time the documentary came out that the signals that we were picking up around obesity and cancer were becoming extraordinarily clear for some cancers obviously not for other cancers and the provocative statement that sits behind all of this is that really since the last 20 odd years I mean even 30 odd years we have been struggling struggling to find preventable human chemical carcinogens of substantial impact every word in that sentence is important we have certainly found chemical new chemical carcinogens in humans but often in that effect small pockets of people who are exposed to those carcinogens we have found lots and lots of chemical carcinogens which have moderate to a very small impact if you look at populations overall the bar might be smoking so smoking is a is a good bar this is a smoking or tobacco smoke is a chemical carcinogen which is removable or preventable and has substantial human impact across populations changing smoking behavior can change fundamentally the epidemiology of cancers across nations if that bar is smoking we have struggled for the last 20 odd years to find things of that magnitude and effect the direct impact of that is when people come to me and they say well what do you do to prevent cancer in yourself and your family I have to sort of casually or not so casually admit that not Ray Mabus Lee don't smoke but it's not like I'm eating goji berries or avoiding some fundamental thing that everyone else is not in the know about because there aren't any I mean you know I'm obviously not exposing myself to these rare unusual occupational cancer carcinogenic agents but I'm not doing something fundamentally changed that's different from you or anyone else to prevent cancer the exception to this rule of the 20 odd years of the hunt for chemical carcinogens is obesity now you and I can have a debate is obesity a chemical carcinogen no not in the traditional sense is it even preventable maybe but we have to think twice or three times about it there's a role of genetics and environment in all of this and even do we think it's obesity per se or hyperinsulinemia or any other endocrine exactly or first of all is in an endocrine problem is an inflammatory problem or is it a metabolic problem at least 300 BC is such a a such a crude phenotype that's right there at least your point has at least three if not six underlying phenotypes that each of which mechanistically would make a lot of sense that's why celebrating cancer is a naming a logical phenomenon that is the cytokines the inflammatory all this going back to your general point that obesity was becoming identified more and more clearly as one of the potential causes of cancer or I should say strongly correlated with the development of cancer so strongly that we think that there's a causal link based on all everything that we know about epidemiology some cancers that we began to take this seriously and we're still taking it seriously but as you're pointing out there are several horns underneath that blanket of obesity that we understand very crudely and we've to figure out which of these is driving the cancer risk I would like to spend the next six hours discussing with you the tenants of writing for selfish reasons but instead I'll punt that to we'll do we'll have dinner in a couple of weeks and we'll finish that discussion I want to talk about another book you wrote that doesn't get as much attention which is the laws of Medicine you wrote that after Emperor before the gene correct that's right so the laws of medicine has a very different mandate as it were and that's because the book came out in associated with Ted they had commissioned ten books by ten thinkers around the world and they asked me to write a book up on that and ice it's necessarily a small book it's really a you know the mandate was to write basically a 75-page book expanding on a single very very incisive idea so that's the laws of Medicine yes if I if

[00:27:14] I got them correctly the three laws are a strong intuition is much more powerful than a weak test uh-huh how did you think of that and what is the most important application of that law to the way you think about medicine or specifically oncology today this to me is one of the great neglected ideas in medicine perhaps one of the great neglecting ideas in the world this idea initially comes from Thomas Bayes this is a Bayesian idea Thomas Bayes was a cleric but by evening he was a mathematician and an economist and he let his work leads to one of the most seminal and funny thought experiments that I've ever encountered which is the following and I

[00:27:49] I sometimes quiz my my daughters with it which is the following this is not Thomas Bayes his own example but it arises out of Thomas bases work and he one might imagine going to a street fair and encountering a man who's tossing coins and he tosses coins and your job is to predict whether the next flip coin flip is gonna be heads or tails and so he tosses the coin 20 times and all 20 times its tail's so then he turns to the crowd and he says what's the next coin flip going to be heads or tails now the mathematician in the crowd who's the professor of mathematics says 50% says 50% and you know everyone says absolutely right but the child in the crowd says no no you don't understand this is a stupid problem it's the coins rigged the coin has only it has two heads or two tails as case may be and the child is right and what's important about that insight is that the mathematician imagines the world this in this case this is not a stab at mathematicians in general but the professor of mathematics thinks of the world as having no history as having no a priori x' it's a world that's created in over every time the coin is flipped in its heads and tails equal every time but the child knows and

[00:29:05] I all humans know that in fact the world doesn't behave like that everything has priors and you need to understand those priors before you can understand the posteriors there's wisdom in that idea and it took someone like Thomas Bayes to figure that out that most of our lives we aren't living our lives like the crazy mathematician professor we are living our lives like the child we're thinking to ourselves what was the prior antecedent imagine this is true for any corner of your life the first question you ask yourself when you're trying to solve a problem try to understand the cosmos trying to understand something you ask yourself what was the prior life did the Sun set in the West last night and how about the night before and maybe I don't need to create a formula to figure out whether the Sun is gonna set on the west or the east tomorrow it's because it's set on the west every time they're obviously loopholes and gaps to this kind of thinking they're surprises that you can miss so bases fundamental idea was that you can only interpret a test in the light of what that test is predicted in the past it's an extraordinarily important idea in the way we think about about the universe that the past performance of a test tells you something not everything but tells you something about the future performance of a test and you can apply to many many things in the world you can apply to any kind of thinking economic economic thinking climate change oriented thinking that the past is a guide to the future not only in a kind of loose way but you're really using a rheostat weighted strongly by the past and this of course applies to medicine and it's a forgotten rule in medicine although it does seem like one of the things that

[00:30:41] I've always felt physicians innately do well without realizing it which is the opposite of where I want to be not to take the potshots but I think where we do very poorly isn't understanding asymmetric risk so Nassim Taleb has written a lot about asymmetric risk and I think he's absolutely right to be critical of not just physicians but basically most people so so my argument is we are innate wired to be Bayesian we are absolutely not innately wired to appreciate risk and both of these are important that's right so one of them we have to hone so much more because I think it just doesn't come naturally I played a funny experiment which you'll appreciate I'll send you the list and you'll have a field day with it it's 20 questions and each one is a quantitative question with an answer but they're not obvious you would never it's not like how many you know presidents were there or something where you might know the answer you asked the group we're gonna give you these 20 questions I want you to answer each question not with a number but with a 95% confidence and I think you know the game no I don't know that ok so interesting game so at the end of 20 questions if you've done it correctly you should have 19 out of 20 of those ranges correct I've never met a person who can come close you almost without exception get like seven of the twenty right you can't even contemplate what that variability is so the second law was that normals teach us rules outliers teach us laws so this of course these were very carefully the mess I thought

[00:32:10] I've spent a lot of time thinking about them of course this is the anti Bayesian law this is the exactly what you're talking about this is the idea that simultaneously in a medical brain has to live the idea that the Bayesian idea that when you hear hooves think horses not zebras famous medical tenets hoof beats outside your window are likely to be horses they're very unlikely to be zebras the second law is once in a while they are zebras and you need tools you need special ideas special tools to figure out what these outliers look like who they are how to find them and how to quickly find them so that you can identify them and triage them differently so in some ways these two laws are yin-yang they polarize against each other and what's interesting about them is that they both in medicine can both can be simultaneously true in the same way as our assumption of asymmetric risk is simultaneously true with the idea that our understanding of the base of a world in a bayesian way is helpful and important so the second law is about how to identify outliers how outliers tell us about the nature of normalcy how they tell us about how complex in

[00:33:19] Asians can produce occasional far outsiders and how those outsiders really challenged us to define what these interactions look like in real life I mean this simple example is it's very very hard to figure out the genetics of any disease without finding the rare people who have the disease as a consequence of a mutation the classic example of course is that we would not have an idea how to regulate our body or to prevent heart attacks if we hadn't paid extraordinarily close attention to a small family small groups of families that had a mutation in the gene that controls cholesterol metabolism most people don't have this mutation because those families are quickly extinguished we think because they died of heart attacks they have all sorts of problems they die of heart attacks but by paying extreme attention to this one family that has a mutation they're rare scientists all of a sudden uncovered a whole cosmos in which we understand now cholesterol metabolism and because of that cholesterol metabolism other scientists eventually developed the first statins so all of this you know the fact that hundreds of thousands of people in the world are taking this medicine to prevent heart attacks tracks back to a rare family where because of a genetic mutation they had a very very high risk of cardiac disease and of course now we know there's a whole family of those people there's at least 2,000 of those mutations that produce that phenotype and these natural experiments are actually a remarkable thing and of course to bring it back to the gene to now have a tool a probe to be able to explore that is amazing the third law for every perfect or exceptional medical experiment there is there's a human bias that goes along with it again these are unique to medicine and what's interesting about them is that they are unique to me at least what's interesting is that that they're unique to the day to day practice of medicine but they apply for every I think they apply to every corner of life you don't have to be a doctor to realize that for every every time we think of something if you're really skeptical thinkers we have to think about the bias that comes intrinsically with that thought in other words every single declarative claim about the universe that we're making must have necessarily a declarative bias that comes with it they're matched if you want to be a scientist you want to be a skeptic your real job aside from being creative and designing experiments is to find for every single declarative claim that you're making the bias that's drive sitting like a little devil buried inside that declarative thing because I promise you everyone has one each one of these claims has one and Richard Fineman who listeners of this podcast know is one of my heroes one of my kids is named after him he named Fineman or Richard his middle name is find I see yeah and my wife at first was like why would we do that but then once she had read surely you're joking mr. Fineman a couple of times because she'd read it once before she realized why but Fineman said eloquently right the job on science is not to fool yourself and you're the easiest person to fool that's right so to your point the only thing I would disagree with what you've said said is I don't think these are unique to medicine

[00:36:25] I think these are laws of science alright and it may be laws of life on some yeah so the mandate here really was to use this book as a kind of springboard to challenge the way we think about virtually all aspects of of how we live you're gonna read an article in The New York Times tomorrow that will make some claims about some politicians somewhere in Oklahoma or you're gonna read about an economic paper that is now being presented to the feds and your job is to be adequately skeptical about it and understand what are the priors how do we explain this particular fact based on the priors or the prior to the priors matter to use a very topical example there's someone's past behavior in college or in school high school tell us about how he or she is gonna be a judicial candidate or does their behavior under scrutiny in any way predict their behavior when no one's looking that's right that's another question the second question that you might ask here is again it's an outlier question right scrutiny versus not scrutiny are they do they become outliers to themselves if they're scrutinized if they're versus when they're not scrutinized and the third question is when I read this story what are my biases am i reading it because

[00:37:37] I'm a man am i reading it because I have a particular experience of my in my own lifetime myself my sister my my daughter my friend my colleague is that coloring the way that I read this particular story so absolutely and you know this thinking goes on over and over again this these are circular processes do those biases of priors do the priors have biases and so forth so you can use these I mean I I certainly use these tools in clinical yeah it's a beautiful as you said it's a very short book but again well we'll certainly make sure people have this link to it because I I think it's a great way of teaching people how to think and that's again I just don't think we're innately wired for every facet of thinking now going back to your background in immunology very recently we had a very exciting for those of us in this space very exciting Nobel Prize awarded I mean it was as we were discussing before we started recording it wasn't so much around immunotherapy but a very specific element of it which are the development of checkpoint inhibitors two of them in particular were basically acknowledged here that ctla-4 which I mentioned earlier

[00:38:41] NPD one tell me why these are so exciting they're exciting for many reasons they are exciting for again some history and some background as the story as it were is exciting because if you ask the question in the 1990s what's the relationship between cancer and the immune system you get a kind of diffuse answer you'd get an answer which could be very unclear because there were all sorts of complicated lines of evidence one line of evidence was that in patients with the complete collapse of the immune system such as patients with

[00:39:15] HIV or complete collapse of at least of one wing of the immune system they would get these cancers you've nobody else could get but what's interesting about them and this is where the thought experiment this is with the brain cells start sort of ticking and wandering they would typically get viral cancers viruses that would now get unleashed we now know many of them viruses like human papilloma virus they would get cervical cancers they would get anal cancers so a lot of viral cancers but patients with

[00:39:43] HIV did not generally get lung cancer I never thought of that said so we have enough data to know that they either at no greater prevalence or even at a lower prevalence when you start to talk about you know for example lung cancer or GB or kradic cancer I never thought about you know it's a very important so the data are mixed because of course in the 1980s they weren't living long enough so all that we know is that the first groups of cancers that cropped up in these men and women were not lung cancers that were not pancreatic cancer so at the first pass with that cut short data set you might begin to imagine then if that's the case the immune system completely collapses you only get a certain kind of cancer then what is the possible role of the immune system in in cancer control and Yuma if you were in a list you might have given up in the 1990s and said well you know take the whole immune system away and nothing really happens even with this cut-short data set so maybe there isn't such a complex interaction well it turns out that people like Jim Allison and his Japanese colleague did not put the immune system away they put that data aside said this goes back to the laws of Medicine they said sure it tells you a little bit but

[00:40:56] I didn't tell you the full story the full story turns out with there's one layer deeper and the full story turns out that in people who don't have a collapse of the immune system whose immune system is otherwise intact cancer cells not not all cancers but some cancers make specific factors in fact they evolved in the world make is the wrong word here they evolve so that they put up specific factors put up specific signals that inactivate the immune system or that make the immune system no longer able to kill or recognize the cancer cell and the identification of these specific pathways these specific factors was what led to the Nobel Prize because in further work Jim Allison and and again his colleagues as a big wide field showed that if you inactivate these specific factors if you drive nails through them using a variety of methods then all of a sudden the cancers become Reeve is about to the immune system and the immune system can attack and kill the cancer cells now why is it exciting exactly exciting for many reasons first of all it's important to realize that not all cancers respond we don't know why some do and some don't melanoma is highly responsive it's an immunological engaged tumor is it because the melanoma has many antigens that it will suddenly be more recognizable is it because the skin is such a lymphoid organ is it the right environment we don't know all of these questions the other thing to realize is that people have responses and some people continue to respond some other people sadly will relapse and they'll go you know the cancers will start growing back in the context of their re-educated immune system and that leads to the second question which is what happens then is there a second pathway and this is an important idea I think that goes back to your first question which is about whether this is depressing or not the important thing is once you drive a single stake through cancers heart it's like placing the first crampon on a climb you see if there's no crampon that's placed on the climb you can't climb a mountain it seems like a wall it's a blank wall and you don't know where to go left or whether to go right or what to do once you plant that first cramp on try that it sticks and it sticks you all of a sudden the whole face of the mountain becomes too different now it's a different mountain now because now you can ask the question because the first crampon was planted in that particular place and it's stuck and it's deaf I have a new vantage point exact perspective has changed that's right and so this is the important piece to realize about cancer research and perhaps about all research is that the first crampon or the first stake through cancers heart is an incredibly important stake because then you can ask what i call linear questions before that first one is placed the questions are nonlinear you don't know where to place it the whole map is open once you drive a stake through the first question the world becomes more linear you can may now ask the question what's the mechanism of resistance to that and when you do find that what's the mechanism resists to that and so all of a sudden the perspective is different because you've climbed through that first and that's usually where the Nobel prizes are given your Nobel prizes are given often for planting the first stake through the heart of a disease through the heart of a problem and that's why this Nobel Prize is important it's not of course as you're saying this does not incur the field of tumor immunology in general there is it's a wide field our own lab does a whole bunch of work into minimun immunology but we're put on the shoulders of those prior giants as it were and so that's the recognition that's been given you said something that I think is so important and worth reiterating there's also something about immunology and immunotherapy that's quite interesting as far as planting that stake which is the durability of response it is often the case that when you have an immune illogic remission it is a durable remission and it's not always the case but it is much more likely the case than when you say for example see a chemo therapeutic remission or even a surgical remission on a personal level I have a very close friend who was diagnosed with colon cancer 10 years ago at a very young age you know he might have been 40 and that was unusual in and of itself I remember talking I went to the hospital when he had his colectomy spoke with the surgeon after it sounded like a horrible case huge tumor the mesentery was full of nodes which I assumed would be positive every 26 node sampled all came back negative huh my friend was adopted we later realized he had Lynch syndrome eight years later he goes on to develop pancreatic adenocarcinoma unresectable so it's encased the mesenteric vessels he cannot have a Whipple procedure and as you know and unfortunately many people listening to this will know that is a death sentence yeah that's a non-negotiable you will not be alive in nine months and he was put on an anti pd-1 therapy because he happened to have as you would know these patients with

[00:45:42] Lynch are gonna be much more likely to be susceptible to checkpoint inhibitors two years later he's disease-free okay just unbelievable stories yeah and I think your point is an elegant one that I'd never really thought of before which is focused less on the fact that we haven't solved the problem and more on the fact that we have made a finite and real step towards establishing a new place a new location for which to view this disease that's right so I described this as taking a nonlinear problem into a linear problem now of course the answers are often not linear per se but it gives you a route and we will come back to the metabolism study that we did with Luc Antley that is a great example of taking a nonlinear problem and converting it to a linear problem now

[00:46:22] I'll tell you about that in a second but anytime this was the place with Vivek - let's tell people what Gleevec is yeah it is a good example of a drug where we learned to target a mutant cancer gene and actually the gene product so in that case the answer it's a blood cancer called chronic myelogenous leukemia was also a death sentence and also GI stromal tumors NGS trauma to museum chronic myelogenous leukemia was a death sentence people had to go through transplants I've watched probably a dozen in the pre Gleevec era dozen patients died of chronic myelogenous leukemia or the complications of transplant

[00:46:58] I trained briefly as a transplant er and then all of a sudden through the work of many people including Brian Druker that drug was discovered so before that scientists figured out based on very careful genetic analysis that the tumor was being driven by really the work of one gene and the gene was called BCR

[00:47:18] Abel it's and it's an oncogene it's a not found in normal cells but found in these cancer cells and the product of that gene became like a like an engine like a manic engine that was driving these blood cells to go crazy and make more blood cells and proliferate and proliferate and proliferate and it was this engine gone wild inside a cell and every time the cell asked the question should i / than looking at its normal state or nutrients metabolic state etc the only answer I would ever get was from this engine saying yes go ahead and make another cell divide etcetera etc etc so this was identified that the exact the gene product was I didn't find a protein product of the gene was identified and then through an elaborate series of experiments in circumstances chemists found a way to actually Jam the engine one molecule human beings may we stitch this molecule together it's a remarkable achievement and once the engine is jammed which suddenly turns out that the disease goes into remission this was one of the first examples there others of so-called targeted therapy where you take you synthesize a chemical to Jam cancers engines in a cancer specific way it doesn't affect normal cells but what's interesting about that is that some people develop resistance because the engine cancer cells evolve and they find a way of resisting but that resistance it becomes a linear problem you figure out what the mechanism the resistance is and you drive a second stake through cancer heart and when it becomes resistant to that he drive a third stake and so forth so all of a sudden the problem would seem like a big blank Rock became a linear problem so that that goes back to another example of how that first mistake or the first crampon really helps with the problem and now for immunotherapy immunological therapy the roadmap is much clearer why do some tumors responded by some don't respond visit a question of the environment that the tumor is sitting in is that blood vessels is that tumor cells is it immune cells these are answerable questions these are so called linear questions but the first big step here was to define the problem this is really a nice step off to exactly where I know we want to go which is we've got surgical oncologists medical oncologists radiation oncologists in many ways a subset now of medical oncology is immuno based on ecology the work that you Lou and many others are now doing is potentially a another branch of oncology called metabolic oncology so you're beyond gracious in your suggesting I have even something to do with helping that evening turn into a what sounds like a very productive collaboration between you and Lou and I'll be talking with Lou as well when the next month I'm sure but let's talk a little bit about what came out of that collaboration and certainly bring it back to Ben Hopkins paper that was in nature I believe was the nature yeah exactly yeah so let's talk a little bit about the question what were you trying to understand the question is there's a very wide question and there's a very narrow question the wide question is how does the body's metabolic state affect cancer it's a very big question because cancer is like all cells are eating nutrients as well too in order to grow and the question therefore is the cancer eating a different set of nutrients than normal cells this work goes back to famous work by Otto Warburg done in the early nineteen where Otto Warburg was one of the first people to make the hypothesis that there's something fundamentally different about I mean we won't go into great details but it's fundamentally different in which the cancer cells metabolize compared to normal cells they use fundamentally different pathways to metabolize and if you could find a way to target these metabolic alterations in cancer cells you would find an anti-cancer drug so but that question has been hanging around our field for a long time and as our understanding of normal metabolism has changed we've begun to identify not just one dozens of nutrient pathways that cancers use that may or may not be different from normal cells may be slightly different from normal cells may be a lot different from normal cells so that's one big question the second question which is a slightly narrower question is that when you give a drug whatever drug it might be your favorite chemotherapy your favorite drug any drug does it change the metabolism of the cancer cell and does it change the metabolism of the body and could this be a mechanism by which cancer cells become sensitive or resistance to chemotherapy so these are two related questions again to reiterate one question is how is the cancer cells metabolism different from the normal cell in normal circumstances and the second question is how is the cancer cells metabolism differ from a normal cell in the context of giving a drug in other words can a nutritional state be exploited and or a drug sensitivity be exploited through nature exactly those are the two questions so we focused in this particular site we actually are interested in both I'm interested in both but we focus on the second question and the second question in this particular case was that there was a very promising group of medicines that was being used in clinic in fact I had used them as a trial list they had come really out of Luke Han Lee's path defining work he had defined the pathway or the signals that these medicines attack and there was an enormous amount of optimism because this was considered a fundamental pathway this is the beauty by the way of being in a place like New

[00:52:33] York or Boston it's you can talk about someone doing this pioneering Lu was in Boston when much of this work is done he's now here in New York and you don't have to collaborate with a guy across the world let's collaborate with the guys on the Upper East Side instead of Chelsea that's right so lose work over the last decades had been to define this pathway and ultimately led to the formation of the creation of these new medicines they're called pi3 kinase inhibitors and they go by fancy names like develop and things like that but anyway when they came to clinic surprisingly there were some responses but there was a lot of resistance in patients that tumors were resistant to the drugs and didn't respond and that was a puzzle that Lou had come up with in his own work and then separately seven miles of town I was scratching my head about same puzzle because I'd been using these same drugs in cancer patients and finding that patients became resistant or were resistant to start and so what was chalked out that on a napkin that evening was we had thought of lots of ways that these patients had could become resistant we had thought oh maybe the tumor had a mutation well and there's one other point I guess to add just that we remember but maybe it's worth reiterating is a lot of the patients that were on these begin to develop phenotype like they look like they were diabetic so that's the point that I was coming to in a second we didn't know what if that meant that that was the source of the resistance that was a true true and unrelated yeah the question was was a true true and unrelated mean you can think of many other mechanisms of resistance you can say the tumors became a quarter mutation you could say the host had some problem you could write down on a piece of paper thousand ways and those were the traditional ways that one would explain resistance the traditional ways of thinking about tumor resistance is mutation the host eats up the drug the non-traditional way and this is what the innovation in the study was that what if there's diabetes that we were observing the high levels of sugar and the high levels of insulin insulin being the most important piece of this what if the drug was causing diabetes separately from the tumor given to normal people that the drug would cause diabetes in some people worse than others and that diabetic phenotype a diabetic state the hyperinsulinemic state was being used or exploited by the tumor to essentially become resistant to the drug it's a little bit like in the analogy that I drew I remember on the napkin it's funny

[00:54:52] I still remember the table we saw the drawing so Lou and I were batting this idea back and forth while you you were eating nothing and the idea was that to me reminded me of the famous story of the woodcutter who's sitting on a tree limb and chops off his own limb and falls down and I drew this picture I remember of the woodcutter on a tree limb because what happens is that the body mounts an insulin emic response to the drug that insulin emic response goes to the cancer and starts feeding the cancer and then the cancer becomes resistant so you essentially undo all the good that you've done with the drug by cutting off your own limb because of this entry circuit and the long and short of it is that that's basically in animal models that happens to be true so we showed it using formal systems and formal methods that this insulin amia is a consequence of the drug has nothing to do with the tumour has nothing to do with anything else if you give the drug the drug goes into the liver and the pancreas and causes a sort of a pre-diabetic State that's often worsened that if you're already in a pre-diabetic State this hyperinsulinemia is used then by the tumor to become resistant even while the drug is present it becomes a pathway by which the tumor becomes resistant and most interestingly that you can paralyze this resistance by putting animals on a ketogenic diet so basically there's never any sugar source to drive the insulin you blunt the insulin response so acutely that you can no longer get the insulin high again this is not to be confused with with the idea that this is a sugar feeding tumor idea this is not a sugar feeding tumor paradigm because to be clear on a ketogenic diet your glucose levels might go down from normal but it's not an enormous reduction even in a complete fast you'll still maintain at least three millimolar of glucose it's the insulin that becomes virtually unmeasurable that's right so it's and this is an insulin feeding the tumor question and so I think that three points that need to be made about the study to be very clear first of all it's an animal study we're now launching a human study that will launch in November with patients with lymphomas endometrial cancer and breast cancer particularly a triple negative breast cancer I'm very keen on studying because this is a cancer that has so few options that's right there very very few options so that's the human study the second point that it's worthwhile making is that it's sort of like folks don't try this at home this is a very particular study with a very particular drug on cancers combined with a diet the study only worked when the drug in the diet were combined it does not mean that the ketogenic diet is gonna prevent cancer we don't know this it's an open question we're actually studying that separately yeah and I want to talk just a little bit about that paper because that's boy

[00:57:31] I sure want everyone to make sure they hear that loud and clear cuz few things upset me more than when I spend a little too much time on Twitter and I come across people who seem to want to claim that if you're on a ketogenic diet you can't get cancer or if you have cancer just go on a ketogenic diet that's not to in fact to be very clear but study in fact demonstrated that that was not the case not only that the study also demonstrates that some cancer models including leukemia is accelerated on the keto diet in fact we have a big follow-up study to try to figure out why some cancers are accelerated by keto alone but when you combine it with the drug they actually go back down into he permission the third point to make is that it seems to be mutation agnostic and that by that I mean this is a very important idea which is that twelve tumor models responded twelve I was not aware that it was that high yeah twelve and actually all 12 that we tested responded every one of them responded and it didn't matter what oncogenes you had or what tumor suppressor genes were mutated they all responded to different levels leukemias respond they become then they'd relapse at least in the models endometrial cancers we can't get them to grow pancreatic cancers respond extremely strongly so it's another example where you're not targeting it seems the mutation this is not like

[00:58:45] Gleevec in which you're driving a stake into the engine of the cancer or that engine there this is a much more global yeah it's solved yeah it's a much more global assault in fact in some ways it's parallel akin to this immunotherapy in the sense that it the immune system doesn't care if you have wrath or doesn't seem to care at the first approximation whether you have a mutation in one gene or another gene grass or not grass it will kill the tumor cells based on its characteristics of what it sees in the tumor similarly here the metabolism seems to be tumor wide but not single kinds of cancer specific we don't know this to be the case the thirteenth model that we try will may be this was the one that not won't work but this has generated a lot of excitement for this reason you know I have a friend who has definitely her2 new positive maybe er positive PR negative but has stage four breast cancer is in a pH 3 K inhibitor trial out of Dana Farber has been on the trial for probably five years she's the only survivor here's the interesting thing she's been on a ketogenic low carbohydrate diet the entire time while she was taking inhibitor yes okay she's still on the interval and so what's interesting is I've told Lou about her case yeah because she's fastidious in this and she's able to get her hemoglobin a1c now under six which for many of those patients is very difficult talked to you you me and Sid had lunch once about two years ago this is the very first time you ever showed me the day yeah that's right we were on a computer we were at that Indian place or the Chinese place on Second Avenue that's right yeah and when you showed me those data I just immediately thought of her so it's actually been on my list who introduced

[01:00:17] Luke because she doesn't live in New York but no enough tonight I want to bring her out and I want you guys to meet her because yeah the combination of his pi3k inhibitor and this dietary choice she's made going back to your second rule right she's the outlier that is right that is giving you something to probe yeah we hopefully will have many such patients I don't know you know this is why we're running the study Syd as you can probably imagine I could spend another 12 hours speaking with you but I want to be respectful of your time I know we're a little late in the day we got a later start than we wanted and you've got a long trip home and I want you to get to see your family the last question I want to ask you really is one that I need you to be a little bit immodest with which is how do you do what you do I don't meet a lot of people that I look at and realize that on every level of their life they are better than me you know usually I meet people and it's like yeah they're better at me at those three things but I can do this one thing better and and I'm sure I could think of something I do better than you but it's many things I don't know about sense of balance I can probably shoot a bow and arrow better than you but when I think about how you balance the devotion you have to your patience to your family to your research to your writing it humbles me I don't know have you put any thought into that the fact that you created these tenants around writing is very interesting to me it says that you you aren't just a natural gifted guy that fell out of this guy who figured out how to write you know you had to work at your craft yeah so how do you work at this craft of just excellence in general the simple rules that I have is

[01:01:45] I'm a very question and project driven person if I set projects I'll usually fulfill them again it's the same set of crampon in the mountain rule which is that in order to write a book you have to write the first line of the book and inevitably that's not going to be the first line that survives in order to do research you have to do one experiment and inevitably that experience gonna not work out you're gonna do 10 15 iterations of etc to me the fundamental rule that works for me is just to throw something at the world first line the first experiment the first idea and then keep at it I keep at it over and over again I come back to it

[01:02:21] I come back to it over and over again and I keep asking questions and then at some point of time and that's another moment of sensitivity is to figure out when the work speaks back to you the experiment starts talking back to you have to be really open your ears have to be really open and that's really the skill of a scientist I think the scientist I think has or even a writer they have really two skills and that they mix together the first one is the creative step putting out the first line thinking of the idea you know I'm gonna write a biography of cancer I'm going to write the history of genetics etc but the second one is to be open enough to realize when the work starts speaking back to you and let that happen let the experiments start talking back to you be skeptical if I have a conversation with it those I think are the two skills that I sort of bring to my puzzle the rest of it is just like everyone else trying to balance eating a meal versus you know writing in two more lines stopping starting sleeping the usual well said I don't expect this will be the last time we sit down and do this

[01:03:25] I'm gonna be a lot more stuff to talk about I can't thank you enough I consider you Lou I mean that some of the other folks we talk about I mean real mentors of mine and it's it's a it's a vital äj-- it's a real privilege to call you a friend and to be able to sit down with you and just even the tiniest insight into is that your work yeah thank you you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog and the nerd Safari at
