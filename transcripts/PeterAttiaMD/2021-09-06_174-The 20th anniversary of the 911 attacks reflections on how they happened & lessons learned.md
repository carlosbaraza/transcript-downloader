## Description

Lawrence Wright is the author of The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11 which won the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction and was named one of Time's top 100 books of all time.  In this episode, released just before the 20th anniversary of the September 11th attacks, Lawrence and Peter discuss the book and the lasting impact of that day. Lawrence reflects on his personal experiences on that day and how he was first drawn into reporting on the attacks. Lawrence then discusses in detail the history that led up to 9/11 which is really composed of two parallel stories. The first story is of the growing discontent in Muslim countries, the roots of Islamic radicalism, and how two extremists, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, joined forces to create the global terrorist organization Al-Qaeda. The second story is about how interpersonal and institutional conflicts between the FBI and CIA led to a massive failure in intelligence and resulted in multiple missed opportunities to predict and prevent the attacks on September 11th, 2001. Finally, they reflect on what we should have learned from 9/11 and the future of terrorism.

## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music] AA Lawrence thank you so much for coming over I love being able to you know kind of interview people in person so to have somebody that's from Austin and to be able to sit down with you is is is really exciting today well it's a pleasure to be out and about even under the constrained circumstances that we find ourselves you know this is a topic that I think many of my listeners are going to kind of wonder what does this have to do with longevity because that tends to be what I what I speak about but but as we sit here basically uh you know minutes away from effectively the 20th anniversary of certainly the most um pivotal moment for many of us in our lifetimes of course you were also alive during some of the other pivotal moments in our history um I think for many of us we just sort of can't believe how fast 20 years has gone by um so kind of want to just start with a maybe a silly question but what do you remember of that morning that Tuesday Morning where were you back then I had breakfast with a bunch of colleagues that were learning

[00:01:13] Spanish and so we would speak Spanish at breakfast and um every Tuesday and uh after breakfast I got in the car and NPR was on and they had reported a one plane had hit the World Trade Center and by the time I got home the second plane had hit and um I had written about terrorism already so I was aware that this was probably a terrorist attack it it wasn't a surprise to me that it was a terror attack of course it was an immense surprise that it was such a dramatic strike had you heard much about Al-Qaeda before this were they familiar to you yeah I had written a movie uh called The

[00:01:59] Siege with Denzel Washington and Bruce Willis and and at Benning um and it was about what would happen if terrorism came to America that was a question I asked myself and I you it already happened in London and Paris of course Tel Aviv you know so suppose it happened in New York and uh this movie came out in 1998 uh and in August of 98 uh a couple of months before the movie actually opened uh there was the first big strike by

[00:02:32] Al-Qaeda against American embassies in East Africa and 224 people were killed um and you know that was scarcely remarked and I don't even think that during the elections you know the terrorism was mentioned uh you know campaigning had already begun for well midterms were underway um so it wasn't a central issue it happened over there uh we still had this sense of invulnerability in America and I think that's why it was unnoticed but there was another bombing that same month in

[00:03:11] Cape Town South Africa at a Planet Hollywood restaurant and uh two people were killed two British tourists and a little girl lost her leg and uh an Islamic group call I forgotten what the name was an Islamic group claimed credit saying that they were um protesting the trailers that had appeared in movie theaters for The Siege the movie hadn't even come out yet and people are already dead and uh that was a scarring experience for me you know that I didn't feel that my movie was responsible for people getting killed but had the movie not happened they' probably be alive and so terrorism touched me uh right off and it's you know it's 3 years before 9/11 uh there was a lot of anger in the

[00:04:09] Muslim Community about having being depicted as terrorists because it was a that having spent a lot of time in Egypt and so on I I sense that if you're going to make a plausible terrorist action that would be the source of it but there were pickets outside the movie theaters I mean in people don't like to go to the movie when they're pickets so you there's always another show so it didn't do well it was a bomb and then after 9/11 it was most rented movie in America and I think it was because in the movie there yes there is

[00:04:43] Terrorism yes it happens in New York and it presses so much of what actually did happen but it had an ending and you know it it it turned out all right and I think after 9/11 people were desperate for something that would give them a little hope yeah I was talking to my wife this morning uh she was so bummed she couldn't be here to meet you because she's such a fan um so we'll have to figure out a way to do something another time so because she she was really bummed to not be here but but I was talking about how it it's not clear to me because I've never really talked about it with anybody else what the impact is like collectively for for the average person right so you know my story is like everybody else is which is

[00:05:30] I can remember in Crystal Clarity every detail of that morning I was a I was a surgical resident at Hopkins um I was down in the Pediatric trauma Bay a kid had just been hit by a car so I was tending to this kid you know getting x-rays doing all the things he turned out to be totally okay but just making sure he didn't have broken bones and I remember a person I remember who they were walking in and saying a plane just hit the World Trade

[00:05:57] Center and I assumed it was like a Cessna that had hit the Trade Center in the fog so it was sort of like my only thought was oh it must be a foggy day up in New York today or something didn't think anything of it kind of went right back to work and then of course you know some odd 40 minutes later second plane hits all of a sudden now the TV's on in the ER and we're all seeing what's going on and then you know for the next 48 hours none of us left the hospital because we were sort of waiting would there be survivors coming obviously there were none um but the part I never really understood is how much of a lasting impact it had on me for reasons I can't explain I didn't know anybody who died that day I didn't even know any of the

[00:06:44] First Responders or people who were traumatized as survivors and yet for at least 10 years I had horrible dreams about being on uh was it United 93 the flight that got that crashed in Penn I had dreams of being in the cockpit as it was nose diving in the ground um you've spent time talking about this with people is that a is that an experience that you've seen in the in the normal person who's not who who wasn't physically or directly touched by this in some ways it's a generational divide you know we're old enough for it to have deeply affected us personally and I think every

[00:07:31] American was profoundly affected in one way or another the for one thing there was this sense of invulnerability it was a smug feeling about we exist in the world but apart from it you know things that happen out there in the rest of the world don't really touch us we meddle you know in wars and so on but it it never comes to the Homeland and that was so punctured it was so disillusioning and uh you know that we're in we're a regular country and we're vulnerable uh and that was you know shattering and I don't think anybody who was cognizant uh at that age I don't think anybody walked away feeling the same now it's interesting to me because you know the culture changed around that event and young people don't know what America was before 9911 they only know you know the country that we've become and and I reflect on you know when I was like in high school uh I remember I took a date to the airport in Dallas uh it's called Love

[00:08:45] Field but not for that reason but back then it when you didn't have any money and you wanted to entertain your date it was you know a plausible place to go and so we went walked out on the tarmat where an American Airlines plane had flown in you know and we decided he' just come from Paris so we sat in the first class compartment and a steward us as we called them then served us a snack and then we went up in the FAA Tower and you know come on in kids and so we sat down and watched them you know Landing planes and that was America there was a sense of freedom and you know we talk a lot about freedom but that was really

[00:09:27] Freedom that you could teenagers you know just wander in and and and see things and the S unguarded feeling that Americans had that we were not threatened and now the airport experience if you can just compare that uh nobody you know young people even people in their you know mid 20s now or even 30 don't really know America beforehand they don't know that you could go into an office building without having your picture taken or you could go visit the Liberty Bell in

[00:10:06] Philadelphia without having to take off your belt and your shoes you know we've built up a Security State and we've been so deeply involved with the rest of the world in an antagonistic manner since then and that has become normal but it's an abration in our history and you know I think that you know I I would would like for us to try to remember the country we were and aim to steer towards that because if you forget the the memory if you lose the memory of the country that we were then I don't think we can ever get back to Port it's funny you mention that story about being at Love Field um one of the memories I have is anytime my dad would travel and my I'm sure my parents will come up during this discussion because they're immigrants from Egypt which plays such a central role in the story were about to discuss but um it was not uncommon for my dad during flights you know if he was going somewhere and he was returning to

[00:11:08] Toronto which is where we lived um he would spend most of the flight in the cockpit just playing patty cakes with the crew because he was such an outgoing guy and it I'm not making this up there were times when he would bring the entire crew home and prepare a me meal for them cuz he was you know he cooked he owned a restaurant so there were times when he would show up with eight random people from Air

[00:11:33] Canada who were coming to our house because they had you know a night layover in Toronto and they'd be coming over for dinner I mean like think of how how bizarre that is in the context of the world we live in today yeah we're not unique in that but other countries have been putting up with this kind of defensiveness for a long time and so it's a bigger challenge in America and you know there's no doubt that we needed to be on guard and protect ourselves and ramp up our defenses and you know but the truth is you know we've in in trying to create security for us we've created a security state that is such an ement of our freedom that we are doing to ourselves you know we're doing it to protect ourselves but at the same time we're the ones that are holding the handcuffs and it's it's an abridgment of our freedom in a profound way that I think that people who talk a lot about

[00:12:31] Freedom don't really appreciate so how long after 911 did the idea come to you um that you were going to to put in the type of profound research that ultimately led to the looming Tower which I think came out in ' 06 that's right it was immediate you know I I knew this was the story of our lifetime um it was not clear that day uh that it was

[00:13:03] Al-Qaeda U but it was pretty clear to me I mean I had in my movie The Siege I depicted something like that kind of organization and I if you remember uh the phones were out in Manhattan that morning because the cell tower had been destroyed I do remember that because I had a my at the time my girlfriend who was an architect lived in Manhattan and

[00:13:30] I couldn't get a hold of her for a day and a half and I had a couple of friends from medical school who were residents there couldn't get a hold of a very strange situation yeah it was unnerving and um so I I I sent an email to my editor at the New Yorker David remnick and I said put me to work I've been kind of straying from the reservation you know working on movies and things like that so um that afternoon the phones came back on at least for the New Yorker we had a conference call with I guess about a dozen uh New Yorker writers and you know like me you know scattered around uh you know Jeff tubin I think was in um the Bay Area or Jeff Goldberg and Jane mayor were both in Washington and you know we're all checking in and you know what are you want us to do and what David asked us to do was to find stories just you know human stories that can form part of a narrative that he would weave together and U and I felt that had a handicap in Austin you know but um somehow I found this young man named Kurt yelson uh he was a reporter uh he was supposed to have been on the top floor of the World Trade Center at the windows on the World restaurant on the 101st floor before a conference that his magazine which was called

[00:15:02] Waters it's an investment magazine uh he had an appointment there 9:00 and um he slept through the subway stop for his the first time in his whole life and uh so he turned around got off on the Chamber Street exit ran into the World Trade Center uh the trade Center's elevator were up a flight of escalators so he ran up the escalators and into an elevator and there were like 200 elevators in the two towers and you had to change floors so um he ran into the elevator and an elevator operator was holding the door for this woman who was taking her time you know walking across the lobby and Kurt was very anxious because he was late and as she checked in as she stepped into the elevator he noticed that she had a rose tattoo on her ankle and he thought to himself oh wow and then the plane hit and in the doors to the elevator accordioned uh and nobody knew you know what had happened was it an earthquake you know it had the building had been bombed before by a precursor of alqaeda so there was that you know but you know Kurt stepped out of the elevator and he looked around in the lobby and there were objects lying there uh concrete objects some he said the size of an alarm clock and some like a size of an office chair and just lying on the you the ground of the the lobby and it was eerie and remember he had to go up a flight uh but he was confused and he saw u d light um and went towards that and it was a door that led to a a patio and he walked outside and there were hundreds of shoes on the ground and something else that he thought was luggage but turned out to be human torsos and then something landed right beside him and so he went back in and uh his his story of escaping the the

[00:17:28] Trade Center and making it home to Queens became the bookend of the New Yorkers black issue and um that's what got me started uh it was it was I gotta say incredibly wrenching um you know to hear his story and you know and pasted it together over a number of interviews and I would I'd interview him and then my wife uh would um type up the note notes and you we a lot of weeping going on and but

[00:18:03] I knew from then that I was on the case and uh that you know whatever portion of my life was already spoken for uh a couple of months later I signed a contract uh February U uh for a book that was supposed to be turned in a year later and I scratched out February and wrote March or something April I and no idea I turned it in five years later so

[00:18:31] I had no idea what I was getting into but I just knew that you know this was that I was going to go all the way to the end of this yeah those stories by the way are so interesting to me I only know one um which is a friend of mine's ex-wife was supposed to be on one of the four flights I don't remember which one but she missed the flight um so she overslept she got to the airport but didn't get through

[00:18:59] Security in time so by the time she got to the gate they had already shut the doors uh I think the plane was even pulling away and so you have this moment where you're so upset like you in that moment can't imagine a greater tragedy right like whatever it is she was going to do what an inconvenience to because it was a cross country flight and then of course to realize that that saved your life I mean th those stories are you know they're they're s hard don't hear is that somebody else may have gotten that seat yeah and so there's another side to those the person who would have only made that flight by standby or something well you know your book is really two stories it's really a book of of two parallel stories that are each one very difficult to get through if I'm going to be honest I've read your book two and a half three times basically um and it gets more frustrating the more you get through it because you pick up new things in it that you know just seem so difficult to to swallow but at least the way I've sort of read the book is it's it's it's basically the history of of al-Qaeda how did this organization come to be um because most people when they think of al-Qaeda they of course think of Osama bin Laden but there's there are more actors to it right and there's a there's a long history that that goes back to

[00:20:25] Egypt and and as you and I were speaking a little bit before we sat down so much of what you wrote about resonates with things I knew about my childhood when because we used to go to Egypt every year and then there's this parallel story that's perhaps the most upsetting part of the book if that's possible which is the story about the intelligence yeah um I remembered shortly after 911 uh Thomas fredman wrote an article in the New York

[00:20:55] Times that said this was not a failure of intelligence it was a failure of imagination implying that it's not that our intelligence Community failed us it's that we could have never imagine this but I don't know that I can agree with that after reading your book yeah one bit I think this was a catastrophic failure of intelligence so maybe we'll start with the former um and it's it seems that a good enough place to start would be S katb so so who is this character and why is an important figure in the in the creation of al-Qaeda s was an educator in Egypt and um very Cosmopolitan in his way um he uh and he was religious but he wasn't you know at the beginning uh fanatical but uh he was a member of the Muslim

[00:21:55] Brothers which was outlawed in Egypt and Nasser came into Power uh in 1952 and the officers revolt and looking around for partners uh he decided that maybe the Muslim Brothers could be co-opted and so he tried to enlist s kutb in his in his governance uh and KB signed on for a little bit but the truth is you know the

[00:22:24] Muslim Brothers had a goal which was not to have a military dictatorship but an an Islamic one and uh and they you know they never really uh they never came to an agreement um and Sid cab actually was U it wasn't thrown out of the country some friends arranged for him to get out of Egypt at a time when it was really difficult for him and he got a job uh teaching in grey

[00:22:55] Colorado at this little College uh and it was you know I visited gy and I I I don't know how different it was uh in 1940s but uh when he first went there but um I think it you know it's it's it's a town that reminds you of America as it used to be you know lots of green Lawns innumerable churches you know just a scrubbed up Norman Rockwell type of town and could have hated it he just thought it was you the worst excesses of America I mean if only he knew and but he he was shocked by the behavior of the women uh he was very threatened by them and he was um I mean imagine he'd gone to Vegas or something right it's you know he did spend a little bit of time in New York which was interesting for him because his brother who was in Mecca came out of

[00:23:56] Mecca to interview to allow me to interview him said that he had never met a Jew uh until he got to America and yet he hated them you know there was this the Unseen enemy and then suddenly he's in uh you know in Manhattan and uh you know he's encountering Jews all over the place and then he goes to gy um it's it was a turning point for him he came back and wrote uh a very influential article about how dangerous America was and this was at a time when America was seen as the one non-colonial power by the developing world and it was held in very high esteem and yet that was an opening shot then came the Revolution and NASA reached out to um to cab to see if he could bring him into the government and that didn't work out at all they had totally different aims for the country

[00:24:56] Naser not OB viously a secularist but probably you know but he saw the you know the powerful trend of Islam in the country and he wanted to tame it in some way and he thought by co-opting S kab he might be able to and kab had written every Friday in the newspapers not just in Egypt but all over the Arab world they would publish uh his commentaries on on Islam and and the

[00:25:26] Quran um so so he was a a figure of note and at the time Egypt was mostly Sunni Egypt uh is divided into almost entirely Sunni Muslims and Christians uh you know the the Shiite minorities you know insignificant but um you know there is about a 10% uh nobody really knows but you know there's a smaller population of

[00:25:54] Christians and um you know like a lot of Islamic countries there's little to choose from on the religious banquet and you can be you know the the option is to be more or less religious and and you know piety is how you advance uh in a deeply religious society as Egypt was and actually became much more so when I lived there in 69 to 71 um you know my female student were not covered uh even at even at Cairo

[00:26:32] University it was rare to see women with head coverings and uh I was teaching and at the American University at the same time I'm in ela watre was a medical student at Cairo University and he was part of a an effort to get women to cover and to become more obviously uh religious so it was a a country in transition it's it's interesting so you were there you know my mom left Egypt when she was 22 and the day she flew out it was her first time leaving the country was

[00:27:09] September 28th 1970 and so when she departed from Cairo Nasser was the president and a young president he was in his 50s when she landed in Copenhagen on the news Naser was dead and she was in such shock because she you know Naser was like kind of a God to her generation right and he seemed indomitable like it just seemed like this is a this is a person who will be president of Egypt forever so so what was that so you were there exactly in the middle of that transition from Naser to saddat um what did it strike you as the implication of that was in terms of either the secularization of Egypt or the move move towards this more religious State you have to understand what Nasser stood for um in Egypt he was the first Egyptian to rule over Egypt since 25 200 years or yeah at least 2500 before you know

[00:28:17] Cleopatra and all the Greeks uh who took over as the fonic figures uh even king of of that they overthrew was Turkish y so you know suddenly you have an Egyptian not just an Egyptian this glamorous you know very handsome you know compelling figure uh extremely charismatic and uh an unusual figure in the Arab world in fact his appeal you know was so broad actually you know

[00:28:51] Egypt's essentially Annex Syria it was the United Arab Republic but the syrians had very little they just wanted to throw in their lot with the most powerful figure in the Arab world so his sway was unbelievable and um and it it was so powerful that even the hideously mismanaged war against Israel in 1967 which you know the Six Day War you might have well called it the six- hour War because it was over as soon as the

[00:29:23] Israelis bombed the air you know the Egyptian airplanes um it was a catastrophe and yet he survived that um so the idea that there would be a day without Nasser was just not something that occurred to Egyptians and I remember when it happened um he was actually moderating a a peace conference with the Palestinians at the time you know and um and he had a heart attack um and I you know I had a a a cook who came to my apartment uh that morning and he said the people are like sand in the street remember the the night that the news came out um I had not heard the news before hearing the ululating you know all over just it was eerie and but because it wasn't a singular sound it was like a a vast sound and U so as

[00:30:37] Americans we were counseled not to go out um I don't think that anything would have happened to us but it was the streets were weirdly empty and Cairo always had a problem with you know pollution you know uh and noise suddenly it was dead quiet uh the atmosphere clarified it was beautiful but unsettling uh and for 3 days you know you just didn't see anybody and then uh they had the funeral uh and we went up on the roof we lived in zalik which was an island in the middle of the Nile we were right across from the Russian news agency novosti and U so we were up on top of the roof and you could see the the the the parade forming and at the end it started at the end of zalik there was a revolutionary Tower it was actually there's a story on that the

[00:31:43] CIA tried to bribe Nasser with $10 million and he used it to build this Tower the Revolutionary tower on the island directly across from the Hilton so that the Americans could see where their money went so that's where the parade started the funeral cor and they they were going to cross the casel Neil bridge and um there were you know all the dignitaries around the world and you know what we could see was just a mass of you know uniforms and suits and stuff like that but we could also see this immense crowd of people on the other side of the bridge and they rushed in towards the Cortez as a and in the middle of the bridge they met the the the the mourning Kirin and the and the dignitaries and in the front of the the cor there were uh police with batons beating a path through people and the T the turmoil was so great that from where we were which was a mile away maybe you know we could see the bridge trembling and I you know

[00:33:01] I've often thought about how you know soldiers have to break ranks when they cross a bridge because of otherwise you get the Tacoma Arrow effect yes so I worried that the bridge might actually crack you know but they beat their way all the way through the mobs in the streets and uh I thought this this country will never be the same and and it really has never been uh I qualify that by saying it has never been although it has always been ruled by uh military forces U military figures with the brief exception of the uh the is

[00:33:42] Muslim Brotherhood president um and and then who becomes president is Anar sadad uh who was regarded as a joke in Egypt um he had you know been in the you know officers coup but he missed the revolution he was at a movie it was a double feature but he missed missed the Revolution and that was a story that hung around Anar sedat and people thought he was a fool and he wouldn't last and he turned out to be a significant figure you know because of him Egypt and Israel are at peace to this day um nobody everybody underestimated him um but he lived you know he had been in nasser's Shadow all that time so uh it it marked a turning point and it was Nasser I mean excuse me it was Sadat who expelled the Soviets uh you know up until that point Egypt had been a kind of Soviet military base and um we didn't you know the US and Egypt didn't have diplomatic relations there were only a handful of Americans actually there when I was living there now four years prior to um naser's death uh he had kutub executed yeah but you get the sense that he was that was reluctant he I don't I think he understood that that execution would make a martyr of him and there's probably nothing worse that you could have done than have made a martyr of this man uh didn't he have Sadat then as either prime minister or vice president almost try to get kutub to just ask for some sort of forgiveness so he could save face and not execute him kab was a hard case you know he would rather die than renounce his you know his stance and he told Sadat that um and you know he called their Bluff you know it cost him his life but it also gave birth to this movement because once KB was dead he became a symbol of the oppressiveness of the Arab regimes you know the dictatorships that Spann the entire

[00:35:56] North Africa all the way uh all the way to Turkey um it and what was the alternative the only alternative that people could see was the Muslim Brotherhood or some other form of islamism so it was KB's death that uh inspired for instance Iman El zaahi uman El zaahi his uncle uh was CB's lawyer and had been his teach he was a dear friend of KB and just before KB was hanged uh he gave zari's

[00:36:36] Uncle his b his his Quran which was you know incredible incredibly treasured and uh so when when Ian elahi was 15 he started a cell to overthrow the Egyptian government that'll show you the level of commitment uh that uh Al was born in and there's something else that's very interesting that I remember you know as I mentioned to you so much of reading your book put into context so many stories that I had heard growing up that seemed at the time disjointed but like because they sort of lacked the the clarity of the the full

[00:37:17] Arc but one of them was how Sadat upon immediately becoming president basically freed many of the prisoners that Nasser had put away so it seemed that Naser had a much clearer understanding of the threat of Islamic fundamentalism and I guess the question is what is it that Sadat hoped to gain by freeing these individuals Sadat unlike Nasser was very

[00:37:46] Pious and he thought nobody was more Pious than he he called himself the first man of Islam how about that and U and he thought because he was religious that he would have standing with people like in the Muslim Brotherhood um he totally underestimated you know the the fanaticism that had grown up in those prisons uh and not just because of s KB you know but you know one of the things that radicalized cab was when he was in prison soldiers came in and shot prisoners in their cells you know in his his question to himself was what kind of Muslim would do this to another

[00:38:35] Muslim and his answer was they are not Muslims and so essentially he is a phrase in Arabic called Tak fear yes which is to expel someone for their disbelief and um and so he he created the precedent that you know unless you believe as I we do you're not a real Muslim and once that door was opened the it led to the idea of terrorism and uh you know that's where you know zahi and

[00:39:10] Bin Laden got permission uh to become the terrorist that they became how far back does that precedent go if you go back to Muhammad where is the first sign of uh that it's okay to kill someone if they don't believe what you believe well you know there's a the question of killing someone you know there was a lot of tribal

[00:39:40] Warfare before Islam and Islam was really in part an effort by Muhammad to unify Muslims uh to stop fighting each other uh and you know Islam one of the meanings is submission you know submit you know accept your place and um but that didn't stop a lot of the infighting in in Saudi Arabia in particular uh the Ian uh were you know uh wild uh wildly fanatic uh tribesmen that uh the first king of of

[00:40:21] Saudi Arabia enlisted in his battle but then in order to subdue them he had to bring in British war planes and machine guns to shoot his own you know soldiers of the Cross so to speak in modern era you know it was uh Bin Laden who looked out at um you know in the in the TU Fury Universe there was a a a kind of

[00:40:46] Doctrine uh that that came from some of the discourse that you know first of all you have to attack the near enemy and uh then the far enemy and the far Enemy being the west and the United States but the near Enemy being dictators like Mubarak and so on the the royal family in Saudi Arabia so the Heretics the Heretics the the Shia yeah the Jews the West those would be the four stated enemies absolutely in basically in proximity yes but you know first of all tend your own house well it was Bin Laden who looked out and said the enemy is not far you know America is right off our Shores there are bases in

[00:41:32] Saudi Arabia you know they you cannot call them the far enemy anymore so that you know using the you know the the the permission that he had been given uh to wreak havoc and kill people at will um Bin Laden turned on America so going back to the early 70s so um zahi is in in school he's going through medical school school um saddat sort of saves face during the 1973 the yam kapir yam kapor

[00:42:04] War what you know some saddat is sort of romanticized in the west yeah right but what was the view inside Egypt of Sadat in the uh in in in the sort of mid to late 70s uh was he basically ostracized in the Middle East for for uh creating peace with Israel I mean that that can't have been popular with the other Middle

[00:42:26] Eastern Nations correct it wasn't popular in Egypt either well let me qualify that there were people that were tired of strife and wanted to make peace but you know the rhetoric in the middle in Middle East the rhetoric in the Middle East at that point was that Israel had to be destroyed and here was uh Amor

[00:42:48] Sadat saying no you know we're going to make peace with Israel um first he had to demonstrate that he was willing to go to war because the Israelis were so complacent they didn't they didn't see a threat and actually I don't think satat doesn't get enough credit for the daring uh you know there was a a kind of magino line that the

[00:43:11] Israelis had built uh you know on the they' taken all of Sinai and uh along the Suez Canal they built this sand Fortress that extended a whole length you know Cliffs of sand Top by artillery and little caves inside you know with machine gun imp placements and stuff like that it looked really formidable and um Sadat managed secretly to you know create this Army and Invasion force and how do they bring down that castle of of sand with fire hoses uh it was amazing how the sand just melted away but they had these high pressure fire hoses they gotten from Germany and they they within a few hours they had managed to cross the Suez Canal which the Israelis thought was totally impossible and you know with just it was a in kind of a mirror of the 67 war and um it wound up uh uh Egypt was essentially defeated uh by Ariel chiron's Army which surrounded them but they had made the point and um and at that point Sadat was a real hero uh it gave Pride to the Egyptian people who felt so humiliated um and one of the things that he had to counter was the lessons that the Egyptians had drawn from the 67 War and the Israelis you know the uh the

[00:44:53] Israelis thought uh well we really are God God's people you know look at this you know we were just before the war we were digging trenches for Mass graves in the public parks and now you know we've you know conquered all of our Arab neighbors you know within six days just unbelievably thrilling uh and so what lesson did the

[00:45:18] Arabs and particularly the Egyptians take which is we're not God's people uh why would he let this happen to us and the answer was we are not religious enough and so that answer resonated with so many people and that was you know the 67 war was a huge influence in driving people into radicalism and that was something that you know Sadat didn't fully take into account that they and of course eventually that radicalism would focus on him and so what did you describe him as I thought that was just hilarious the he described himself as the uh the first the first man of Islam yeah yeah the funniest concept ever because the reality of it is he would in the at the end of his as we as we drew close to the end of his life he would completely turn around and say no religion in politics no politics in religion he saw the damage that this religion was causing and said we must separate this this church and state and is that ultimately what led to the fatwa being brought against him well peace with Israel was a part of it uh there was also you know he was uh he was chiding you know he was really fonic in his behavior which is not unusual in you know people that rule over Egypt but uh he would you know he derided women who were covered as saying that they were wearing tints on their head and that really offended uh a lot of islamists uh and his wife I believe had pushed for the right for a woman to have a divorce right you know so they were really trying to bring modernity to Egypt yeah and it was ultimately the nail in his coffin it was a similar path that the Sha of Iran had yeah I was going to ask you about that because the Sha was basically overthrown in 79 or was it 78 79 and that that year was uh a catastrophic one for Islam and for Muslim countries it's the it's the year that the the Soviets invaded

[00:47:38] Afghanistan it's the year the the Sha was overthrown and it was the year that Camp David uh Peace Accords were signed so um you know and I should also say uh it was the year of the the the attack in Mecca where radical islamists took over the holiest place in Islam and and Saudi Arabia needed the French to come and help yeah they don't like to admit this and there's still no toll uh we don't know how many people died hundreds or thousands we don't know but you know there were snipers up in the minettes and so on and the the underneath the plaza there were there's a Warren of rooms and they stored weapons and food in there and um so you know there were plans maybe to flood them out and uh but they were holding hostages and so we don't really know what happened but you know what we understand what when I was researching this as carefully as I could um they bore holes in the plaza and dropped grenades down so a lot of innocent people were killed and um and then dozens were arrested and executed but it was a trauma on the scale of 911 in Saudi Arabia and out of that came a bargain uh between the royal family and the clerics which was you know the royal family needed permission to attack the mosque uh in in Islam is so holy that you're not even supposed to mow the grass you know every living thing should be untouched and here you know was a situation where totally out of control uh you know thousands maybe of people would would be killed and the the royal family did not feel they could do this without a fatwa from the leading clerics and in return uh the royal family agreed to allow uh religious figures greater stand in and more power within the society so upon that uh Saudi

[00:50:02] Arabia immediately became far more conservative and the clerics took control and you began to see the religious police uh in the streets and so on and that you know Saudi Arabia had been on a path not to not to liberalism but you know a more stable uh Society that was somewhat moderate but not fanatic but there were people once once the the religious authorities acquired power uh they used it but they also became far more fanatical themselves so the name of the organization that ultimately assassinated Sadat was Al

[00:50:50] Jihad correct this was the one half of what would become Al-Qaeda right the American intelligence calls it Egyptian Islamic Jihad but in Egypt it's just called Al Jihad how much of a role did El zaahi play in that in the assassination it was a small role uh he transferred some guns uh he was still a he was still a practicing physician yeah he was he was still a young man you know with but he had been able to organize police officers and soldiers and stuff like that into his his cell so uh but he wasn't Central to the assassination itself that's one of my of all the turmoil that we've discussed so far in the Middle East the first one that really that is sort of ingrained in me is when saddat was killed so I you know

[00:51:46] I remember that day very clearly I was 8 years old and I remember it so well one of my uncles was one of the generals stand in with him when he was shot as you recall everybody but Sadat realized what was happening and they all hit the deck and Sadat actually thought it was part of the parade and he actually stood to greet yeah these soldiers who of course were you know I you know I interpret that differently yeah I know you did in the book you thought he was standing to to to receive his execution my uncle always said that he felt that saddat actually thought it was part of the parade well who knows what thoughts were going through his mind but uh it was uh chaotic yeah and uh you know these guys jumped off the truck and began firing and throwing grenades and most of which didn't go off which was sort of a miracle a lot more people would have died a lot of people would have been killed I don't know why everybody on that reviewing platform wasn't dead but um but they were you know they came for

[00:52:58] Sadat and when I looked at the the news footage and the stills of that it it looked to me the Stills are harrowing yeah yeah he's standing at attention being looked to me like he was gonna go out you know unintimidated and that would have you might be right that would have been part of his character and of course he he was so vain uh he had his new uh italian-made uh uniform and he didn't want to ruffle the lines of the uniform with a bulletproof so he was unprotected in that way you talk about how the the men that were charged and even not charged basically the men that were imprisoned following that were tortured yeah and that out of that torture came a lot of the humiliation that ultimately fed what would become the the terrorism we all learned about 20 years ago for the first time many of us what happened to those men and and what what what did your research uncover about what what that period was like following the assassination of saddat it wasn't long after I mean Mubarak would have been immediately and stated as President right I I think we we we don't understand clearly the role of humiliation in human Affairs but it's very powerful and you know going back to the 67 War you know the humiliation I think you know gave birth to this rise in radicalism in Egypt and elsewhere um and torture is deliberate humiliation uh and we don't really know what happened to zahi U although he was probably electrocuted and stripped naked and you know and and humili in every possible way that you can imagine um and you can emerge from that totally broken or you can emerge full of rage and willing to do anything to exact revenge and you know I think that that prison population was divided along those lines there weren't people that weren't affected by it you know they were were people that were either broken or turned into something else and that something else became the seeds of alqaeda that you know that Al-Qaeda really began as Za's organization you know it was Al Jihad and they were when they got out they were on a rampage and you know they were killing people as much you know fast as they could and they tried to kill the prime minister they they they did kill some people they they accidentally killed this little school girl named sha who um you know they they this is a characteristic uh Jihad uh action so carelessly did they plan this assassination of the prime minister they just put the bomb outside a girl school and U and the only person killed was you know a school girl it could have been dozens of them uh but the city Cairo was infuriated and there were marches in the street and you know protest and zaty actually complained because you know he felt offended that uh that they were subject to so much abuse and uh and yet you know it was pretty clear that uh sha um was a step too far uh for for Jihad and um actually one of the killers lives now in London you know he got political

[00:57:05] Asylum because of the you know the fact that Egypt had a death penalty and uh and the British would take in anybody who is under a death penalty so um Sheamus killer is living in London still last I talked to him he was still there yeah something else that you point out in the book that I thought was so fascinating because it it's so obvious once you stated it but I'd never really understood it which was why couldn't the real resistance take place in Egypt but you point out that the Topography is not amenable to it yeah you can't really live away from the

[00:57:46] Nile yeah you basically the moment you get too far off the Nile you're in the middle of the desert it's not amenable to Guerilla Warfare and the milit had too strong a hold over the Nile from Upper Egypt all the way to the Delta and into the Mediterranean Sea so basically if they were going to create an army they needed to do it outside of Egypt and it seems that zahi realized that in in the mid 80s if not the early 80s correct and is that about the time that he left yeah he he went to Afghanistan first as a uh as a medical doctor you know answering a call that you know many heated and uh and then he came back and uh he affected some uh Afghan outfits and so on but uh I think he was very stirred by that um you know when the when the Soviets invaded U it was an electric alarm in the Muslim world you know that an

[00:58:50] Islamic country was being um occupied by a a secular government and um you know what was Russia's intention I guess the s a really good question because you know you could say that they were trying to beat a path to um the Mediterranean and um but it's a you know it's a long way you it it doesn't go directly there so you know they might have done better going through Pakistan um and Pakistan was nominally allied with the United

[00:59:26] States so that might have been problematic um but you know Soviet Union was an expansionist power and so but it it was crazy you know it was uh you know if you remember that period there you know there was a lot of turnover in the leadership and uh so the I I think that there was confusion about who's in charge and it didn't make any sense at all and u Carter Administration uh binski was the National Security adviser and he saw that as a huge opportunity to give uh the Soviets their own Vietnam and essentially that's what we did uh we supplied the maah hadine with weapons and then finally with stingers which you know brought down the helicopters and that was uh you know the Soviets didn't want to go mono aano on the ground U and so once they lost that air cover they they were essentially defeated which now brings us to the other half of the al-Qaeda Duo Osama Bin

[01:00:35] Laden I think it's well known by many people who have paid attention to the stories of al-Qaeda that he came from unbelievable wealth unbelievable privilege um but maybe for folks who aren't quite familiar with his his lineage who was Muhammad Bin Laden and why why did he have such an Empire what was the what were the circumstances of of Osama bin Laden's upbringing Muhammad

[01:01:00] Bin Laden was uh came from Yemen and there's stories about uh how he got there um but you know essentially he you know I think the most credible is he kind of hitched a ride on a boat that took him up to jida and uh he was a laborer he was blind in one eye he was illiterate and uh he was he put himself to work as a hand handyman and then did some work for you know the Americans were you know at that time working on a ramco building up the Saudi uh oil uh reserves and there were American companies in

[01:01:41] Saudi Arabia who were essentially beginning to build the kingdom itself you know the roads the hotels and so on so it was a good time to be in that business and Muhammad Bin Laden the the king didn't really trust the Americans uh you know and so who was King then was it fisel no this is before fisel but it was after ABD I think it well I think it was Abdul aiz when uh when Muhammad Bin

[01:02:08] Laden first got there okay uh it was you know the king of the first king of that lineage and uh he built a I don't know if he built the whole Palace but the King was infirm and if you remember uh at uh when in the meeting between uh Roosevelt president of Roosevelt and King abdulaziz in the Suez Canal

[01:02:33] Roosevelt gave him a wheelchair and um so the king liked having the wheelchair but he lived upstairs so he he got Muhammad Bin Laden to build him a ramp so the car could drive him upstairs and uh so that was you know a display of the genius that Muhammad Bin Laden had and then there was a a goal that um uh that had been uh from the very beginning of the of the Kingdom to try to unify the two sides of Saudi Arabia the Eastern the

[01:03:13] Western portion uh was divided by a mountain range and um on the other side of it was the Holy lands Mecca and Medina and jeda the one the major cities but it was cut off by the saratt mountain range and uh when fisel became king he uh was trying to get a contractor who would build a road that would unify the kingdom and uh you know the the main contractors looked at this steep Cliff face and just there was daunting you know how would you do that and so Muhammad Bin Laden this oneeyed illiterate Yemen laborer uh gave a bid to the King which didn't turn out to be accurate but you know and the King accepted and so the legend in is that he pushed a goat over the edge of the cliff and followed him down this you know

[01:04:16] Cliff face marking the path and that's the path that this road I drove down it I drove up and down it but it's a it's very windy and um the uh and and oddly enough you know beset with chimpan so you know there are a lot of animals along the way you have to be careful but it's a it's a two-lane road that goes down but that was one of the most important roads in history because it unified the kingdom and it made Muhammad

[01:04:48] Bin Laden the most famous non-royal figure in the Kingdom a real hero and um and he took advantage of his celebrity he had um a lot of wives uh some 45 children well 52 I think I think Benin Laden had 52 brothers and sisters so maybe 53 total and um some of the wives he would marry on Friday and divorce on

[01:05:15] Sunday you know so you know there was that kind of arrangement but um typically in Saudi Arabia in is under Islamic rules you're awarded four wives and the fourth wife is always a little bit of a threat to be discarded and it was the fourth wife that was the mother of assama and she was Syrian U and you know she was an alawite which is the sect that Assad the ruler of Syria is a part of it's a minority sect that is thought to be her heretical in inside uh Sunni Islam uh so that was by itself a mark against assama U and his father divorced her um and uh ass and but he arranged marriage for her and one of his trusted employees um who actually Osama became close to um and they lived in a little house in jeda uh off a street that's called macaroni street because there's a pasta factory nearby and uh that's where he grew up he was always Pious it wasn't a conversion uh he was he would play soccer and he would wear long pants and but he must have had some influence on these other kids because they eventually they adopted his long pants strategy and he would uh even when he was fasting which he he fasted two days a week two days a week emulating what he thought the prophet did and he's this is we're talking about about Bin Laden as a teenager absolutely he would uh make sandwiches for his soccer mates and uh even though he wasn't eating them and then you know they serve cakes and then play uh you know sort of Islamic games you know guess the names of the prophet's Companions and that sort of thing and um he also uh even though music uh is frowned upon instrumental music is frowned upon in Saudi Arabia uh he led this AC capella capella singing and I tried to get he taped some of them and I tried to find some tapes of uh you know Bin Laden singing but I I never could lay my hands on anything like that did you have an insight as to why he was so

[01:07:47] Pious well you know I think that if you want to stand out in a very religious Society like Saudi Arabia uh you can become less religious or more and uh you know in his environment um he was he was not going to become less religious so he I think he always had the idea that there was an achievement uh by becoming uh more of an authority I mean you have to bear in mind his father was an exceptional figure he died in an air crash but as and Bin Laden was young when that happened but very few people in Saudi Arabia in all of history have achieved the kind of status that Muhammad Bin Laden did who is someone who is not in the royal family I mean that was exceptional and I think that Osama being the son of the fourth wife and then you know cast out of the inner spell Inner

[01:09:00] Circle uh when the father divorced his mother he always wanted to distinguish himself and there was a you know horde of other children around to compete against and Sama was adventurous um some of the other Sons were adventurous but I think he you know one of them uh died nearby here you know in Central Texas he crashed an ultralight plane in a power line so it wasn't just Osama that was s of you know an adventurous type but um the uh early on you know he was racing horses uh he was uh drove very fast um uh not professionally but you know he was he he liked to drive and he was careless he had wrecks a lot um but he had his kind of impunity uh around him but he was and he liked to go out and camp in the desert by himself uh he was forging an independent identity even as a very young man he was drawn more deeply into Islam in his school uh apparently there was a

[01:10:20] I think it was a gym teacher who was in the Muslim brothers and um he impressed Osama uh and so that probably Drew him more into Islamic politics uh and he met other people that would uh be important to him uh inside what was a secret cell of the Muslim Brothers in Saudi Arabia do we know if he was influenced by S

[01:10:45] KB's writings oh yeah yeah yeah well there's no one who wasn't you have to start with that but s KB was a big figure and when he was in the University there there were lots of discussions about and there was a another head of the Muslim Brothers in Egypt uh who had a bit of a contrary View and uh sometimes Osama would take one perspective and sometimes the other but they were essentially arguing over kab and so he he was a huge figure he might have met no I I guess not because

[01:11:26] I I would have asked KB's brother Muhammad if he' ever met M AMA but I don't think so so when did um Osama first go to Afghanistan well he early 80s mid 80s well the invasion you know9 uh so AMA went to Afghan he said he went as soon as he could there's no evidence he went there in the first year or two but he might have been but there's just no evidence of it and um and he was inspired um he didn't stay long he came back uh but he became a conduit uh for money he was a bundler uh and Abdullah aam was the sort of Godfather of the

[01:12:17] Arab participation in the war against the Soviets and Bin Laden hooked up with him uh and aam just saw you know this uh tall enigmatic Saudi with a lot of money and a lot of prestige they just saw him as a cash machine which he was I mean he was played a huge role in raising money for for the war against the

[01:12:47] Soviets and that was his main task for the most part until he actually moved to Afghanistan and uh decided Ed to form an Arab uh wing of the war and it was totally feckless I mean it was worse than feckless they got in the way you know Arab Afghan Warlords complained about it uh they didn't know what they were doing uh you essentially they were just putting young men without any training at Great risk and affecting no real change in the war but from the perspective of Saudi Arabia Arabia here was a Saudi uh not a prince but a prince

[01:13:30] Ling in the sense that he was you know the son of the the famed Muhammad Bin Laden and uh the idea that Saudis would actually go out and fight was really titillating you know they weren't allowed to fight in there was you know a nominal Army but you know essentially there was no military tradition what was the scale of this so how many muhaj fighters were there well I don't remember the exact number there were uh fewer than a hundred I would say uh it was not but you also have to bear in mind that young Saudi men would sometimes fly up from Saudi

[01:14:19] Arabia for a few days they would be given a gun they would go out and they' know they' be not facing the enemy probably but they go out and shoot up the a tree or something and then they would go home and say that theyve been you know they've been fighting in Afghanistan so there was it's sort of hard to and the

[01:14:38] US had no forces there but the CIA was providing weapons to the madine correct right the the and they were also supplying money um and they would unfortunately we landed on this guy named hammed ghoul who who was um General uh in touch with these Afghan Warlords and uh he would parcel out the money among uh the seven Warlords the

[01:15:08] CIA call them the Seven Dwarfs but um he picked the uh the most radical of them so the money that came from American taxpayers went to empower uh people that would later become uh allies of the Taliban now the Talib didn't exist yet correct the Taliban were kids in school uh the Taliban the word means students in

[01:15:33] Arabic and I guess in in Urdu um and for especially for young Afghan you know boys oh and pakistanis as well they parents didn't have any money they would be sent off to these madrasas uh many of them on the board between Pakistan and Afghanistan and especially after the Soviet invasion there were a lot of Orphans and there were a lot of you know families that were unable to provide for their kids so they send the boys boys to U these madrasas where their main task was to memorize the Quran in a language Arabic that they didn't speak uh and often times these boys would be abused uh especially you know Warlords and so on would take advantage of them and the

[01:16:31] Really the the the Taliban came to power uh when a there was a battle a personal duel U between these two Afghan commanders over a boy and uh that was when Mala Omar who would come to be the leader uh who was a a minor cleric uh got on his motorcycle and began to organize and uh and that's where the Taliban arose it's it's a odd culture because uh there's some pictures of these boys you know at the beginning as they began to form into uh you know a military force but they put on Cosmetics they look very feminine you know with ey

[01:17:24] Shadow and lips and so on and so there was a it's hard to characterize it because I I I can't say that I understand it but you know there was I think in terms of absenting women so much from society that uh that these boys were sexualized and uh and once again I think humiliation played a role and hard to quantify but I think impossible to ignore and then the Northern Alliance at this point is is is is part of the Afghan government oh I don't really know I I mean there were this the government went through several irration and coalitions and um but the Northern Alliance would have been opposed to um the Northern

[01:18:19] Alliance was a patch to organization so they would have been inside the tent of government yeah so when did zahi and Bin Laden meet nobody knows you know I wish I tried really hard to find that out and I asked many of Za's uh colleagues um most people think that they met somewhere along the line in jeda where

[01:18:47] Bin Laden lived and and he was raising money for the majah hadine and and zahi went there um ostensibly to practice medicine at this uh U Muslim Brothers um Coalition of doctors and so on so it's totally plausible it could have been shortly after that uh in Pasha in Pakistan uh where Bin Laden set up shop uh so it it's one of my great frustrations that I was never able to Chronicle the moment when these two guys ran into each other and what they thought about each other mhm so as the as the Soviets ultimately withdraw which is what 89 is yeah on some level I think though probably not justified Bin Laden feels like a bit of a hero oh yeah he glorified himself and although by by all accounts he really hadn't done much he he mucked it up really is what did and uh got a lot of kids killed and you know just I kids young men uh but um you know in terms of

[01:20:04] Victories no he had not um but what he did accomplished was to create a legend around himself and around the Arab majah hadine and it's fascinating to me as a person that's always been intrigued by religious beliefs you know how these Legends um spread and how they fortified His Image you know there was the idea that if you fell in battle your body wouldn't purify yeah and uh that green birds would come you know Circle your corpse and I remember I asked Jamal Khalifa who had been Bin Laden's best friend for much of his life and and his brother-in-law and had been in

[01:20:57] Afghanistan with Bin Laden um really do you really believe oh absolutely you know I saw it with my own eyes uh it can't be true but it's hard to deny someone who speaks with such conviction and so that was the kind of thing that young people in not just in Saudi Arabia but throughout the Muslim world would be hearing you know the stories of these Fighters and U you know they they're Mighty Men and they you know they live in caves and they fight these technological powers and and they win and you know they are our our Muslim brothers and you know we should be doing the same thing and so and not only you know we have to contribute however we can so uh in the mosque and even in shopping centers there would be cans for contributing uh to the effort and so people did you know it was a very popular effort and

[01:21:59] Bin Laden uh was very Central in his his his name and his identity uh became Central to that cause I I call him saudi's first celebrity because there wasn't a category for bin Laden he wasn't Royal you know there in Saudi Arabia there's a and true of other Muslim countries to some extent but there's a Prohibition on human forms you know the you're not supposed to have pictures of of people and or animals for that matter and um but they're pictures of the king and princes all over the place and I remember when I was there there was a there was a legal battle going on on over the Starbucks image um because it's like a human form yes but finally in the courts they decided she's a mermaid and so she's neither animal nor human she's a mythological creature so Starbucks was allowed to keep their their logo but that's how seriously is taken and uh but here's Bin Laden uh he's not nobody he's Muhammad Bin

[01:23:17] Laden's son but that's not an unusual category uh he you know he has you know 20-some Brothers but there's nobody like him you know he he can go to the mosque and make a speech and you know people would pour out to hear him uh he wasn't charismatic in the traditional sense but I he was he had a kind of ethereal he about him he was enigmatic intriguing very handsome very tall um you know just uh had a kind of Elegance about him and that would turned out to be a real pain in the ass for the royal family because they weren't used to having a rival power someone who had a voice of authority and

[01:24:09] Bin Laden even at a very young age was that person now it I guess it would have been the summer of 1990 when Saddam Hussein invades Kuwait right and although I guess we wouldn't know it at the time you could argue that was certainly one of the greatest factors that would ultimately lead to 911 though it wasn't you can only know that in retrospect right and it's it's peripheral in that I mean we wouldn't understand it from our point of view because America and other allies rushed in to save Saudi

[01:24:52] Arabia bin Laden was trying to keep that from happening and so he went to the minister of defense and said I'll take care of this you know I'll bring my Al-Qaeda guys which were several dozen maybe you know um and um we together with my father's Earth moving equipment you know we will U enlist the people and we'll repel the

[01:25:19] Million Man Iraqi Army and uh you know the minister of defense just didn't laugh him out of the office it wouldn't be polite but he was def you know not taken seriously the first time I heard this story by the way was I had the the privilege of meeting Prince turkey spending a week with him actually really in Saud Arab hear more of that yeah and um he he told this story which was how

[01:25:47] Bin Laden was adamant that he based on his victory in Afghanistan which again means he believed his own hyp I think so right like he he actually thought that he moved the needle in Afghanistan well he def he defeated the Soviets so what would the Iraqis be by comparison that was what was going on in his mind and the disconnect from reality um but how humiliated he was when Not only was he not the one that was going to defend his country but these filthy Americans were going to come in and do this which included women

[01:26:30] Jews and Christians you know and they were going to spend quite a bit of time there right this was even though it didn't take long to get Saddam Hussein to retreat you still had to maintain no fly zones you still had to maintain a military presence there I I stop you a bit on that because we didn't need to stay in Saudi Arabia there were other bases and you know cutter and UAE you know we we could have gotten away but the Saudis had very nice bases and um but that it was the lingering I mean we promised we were going to leave when the war was over yeah why so that's a good point we it was it was promised that the US would leave why why did they not they were comfortable you know and I think probably the royal family felt happier having an American president pres there because the Saudis have always been insecure uh about their you know they're sitting on this golden egg and uh you know everybody around the world wants a piece of it so the Saudis suddenly they've got American Military there and that's not the worst thing in the world in their opinion but for bin Laden and for other people you know there's a you know there's a saying attributed to the prophet which was there shall be no two religions in Saudi Arabia well you know there are more than two religions and there were at the time of the Prophet but uh Bin Laden took this to mean only sunnis in of his particular stripe should live in the kingdom and everybody else has to be expelled and it was such a huge thing to have half a million uh

[01:28:20] Americans and other nationalities most of them not Muslim uh living in their country protecting how humiliating once again you know is it that you have to turn to these other powers we're not strong enough to do it ourselves uh that you know for bin Laden that was you know a big motivating force uh that's when he really sort of turned his attention to

[01:28:48] America and this is where as he and zahi are getting closer there's a bit of a difference between them right which is at this point zahi is still really focused on overthrowing Egypt overthrowing what he views as these horribly immoral corrupt Arab leaders but but Bin Laden is thinking far beyond that already yeah uh it wasn't just Z warry I mean there were a lot of nationalist groups in the Arab world uh focused on changing their countries and what Bin Laden did was to create Coalition and then redirect them to become an international terrorist group rather than just be stuck in their their nationalist uh orbits and and soy was one of those people you know given his DRS he would have just spent time trying to overthrow the Egyptian tyrants and as you characterize you know the corrupt uh ruthless leader that was true he was right about the nature of the rule uh but he was wrong about the solution it's funny I always talk to my parents about this stuff you know when

[01:30:03] Mubarak was like entering his 573 term as president right and I always said you know why and I would ask naively as sort of a youngster I was like why can't Egypt have an actual democracy like why do these elections have to be rigged and my parents for right or wrong and you have to remember my parents have a very different view of

[01:30:25] Egypt right so my mom views Egypt fondly right left reluctantly loved Naser my father on the other hand couldn't wait to get out despised Egypt never looked back hates everything about it and is the is the classic immigrant who wants to come to the west and you know just hates the corruption hates the hates the socialism of Nasser right Naser wanted to take every wanted to socialize the country um but they both agreed full stop that a country like Egypt had to be ruled by a strong man like the their view again I don't know if this is true but their view was you could never take Democratic principles and just Lop them into an

[01:31:10] Egyptian Society like it needs an iron fist to rule it and Mubarak was the least bad option that was basically the way they thought of him what what's your view of an autocrat leader at that of that era I mean do do you do you think that my parents in their assessment were correct of Egypt you know I I was wrong about Egypt

[01:31:36] I thought it was ready for democracy and um be they had a parliament back during the era of the king you know so there was uh even though somewhat forgotten but there had been you know deliberation laws were passed you know it it had the appearance of being uh a constitutional monarchy because the King was so indolent that he didn't couldn't stir himself to do anything but uh I my analysis was this is a sophisticated country um people have uh it's a it's a it's a country that is never going to dissolve like you know

[01:32:22] Iraq May fall apart that's not going to happen to Egypt it thinks of itself as Eternal and so it's always going to be one thing it's always going to be the most significant Arab country and they know it um so I thought well yeah this I was all for you were very optimistic in 201 I wrote a lot of I read a lot of what you wrote and I I had been affected

[01:32:44] I went back to Egypt to make a speech or a couple of speeches I spoke at the American University in Cairo where I used to teach and I and I spoke at um the uh at Cairo University where uh Barack Obama went to make his famous Outreach Outreach speech to the Muslim world and I remember was this was back during the election um this before the Arab Spring started but uh and during the primary season when Barack Obama and Hillary

[01:33:20] Clinton and you know uh were running for office and I was uh asking the the kids if you were an American who would you vote for you know how many here for uh Hillary Clinton all the girls in hij job raise their hand you know and uh how many for Barack Obama you know a lot of other people how many for John McCain one guy from the embassy and uh so but they were totally into the idea of democracy they were excited by what they were seeing and that there could be revolutionary non violent change was on their mind and one one young woman said in his very plaintive voice what happened to us I mean every Egyptian lives with the weight of history on the shoulders you look at the pyramids and you know

[01:34:15] Egypt was the the you know the center of civilization absolutely and it really was you know I mean China you you know but it was so powerful and uh and so much art and you know just it and and and and then a long slide into you know being just a tourist Kingdom so what happened to us and and also such an important pillar of science too that's the thing like I remember as a student as a as a youngster I was a I hated school despised school didn't didn't do well in school or anything like that and ultim I turned that around but a lot of it had to do with something my mom would say to me repeatedly growing up which is she would say because we're Coptic right so she would say you know we're defendants we're we're descendants of the Pharaohs like you know you are a pharaoh science and engineering is in your blood your ancestors built pyramids you know and she would just say these things which when you're a kid like you you kind of start to believe it after a while it's like well you know maybe

[01:35:20] Mom's right maybe maybe maybe I am smarter than I think I am um but but that's but it is it's also it's a society that that does have a very scientifically literate population yeah like you would think this shouldn't be hard to do well when I was thinking about that question that she posed to me that young woman um I thought when I was teaching in Cairo Egypt was a part of of what we call the developing world you know these were countries like India

[01:35:56] South Korea um Singapore you know it just uh so many of what these countries that became the Asian tigers you know they you know they roared past Egypt and I thought the answer I gave her was that her question made me think of my father in his generation he had come out of the Dust Bowl in Kansas you know broken farms you know just really poor and he went on to become a a banker in

[01:36:32] Dallas small bank but he spent seven years in Wartime in World War II in Korea and he and his generation built the most powerful country and economy in the history of the world and I said it takes a generation and there are Generations like that right now in South Korea in in in India in in places like the China that are making their country great but it can't be done by an individual and I think that's my argument against tyranny it takes a it takes a generational commitment and they have to have influence they have to have they have to know that they are a part of an Enterprise and they can't be suddenly ruled out uh and that is the failure of tyranny I think is essentially those kinds of people that would be transformative for a country are not given the chance to be the kind of leaders that they could be what role does religion play in this and specifically what role does Islam play in this is there something about Islam in its current level of maturity which maybe is akin to Christianity a thousand years ago um that is standing in the way of of this of the of the progress you speak of well Islam is you know has many manifestations and so uh it's different in you know Indonesia for instance a largest Muslim country a far more successful country than Egypt or Saudi

[01:38:07] Arabia um turkey also you know um but there there are manifestations of Islam that are really really harmful and uh it people are encouraged to uh adopt a kind of submissive attitude and of course Islam means submission so there's you know there's a literalism about it uh and and then if you're not it's not if you don't believe in it you have tyrants who will beat you into submission so you know they're they're two very powerful forces you have dictatorships that are ruthless justifying themselves on the basis of religion and then you have actual religious texts that urge you to be compliant and you know tyrants are quite Adept at using those kinds of instructions I don't think that I don't think it's true that you can can't have a modern country or a democracy in

[01:39:09] Islamic country I think Tunisia has been struggling to do that and you know they've had some turmoil recently but you know you see that they're actually the people in Tunisia want to have a democracy and they feel like they can they can be trusted with one uh but it is you know it's a belite on the Islamic world and you have tyrants from Morocco all the way to Southern

[01:39:35] China and um you know it's it's uh it's something that I hope that that religion outgrows at some point yeah I sometimes just wonder if it's really a time scale problem and we can't think about this in decades you know um well certainly think that's true because I've already spent decades hoping for Change and just not seeing it Blossom

[01:40:02] I Egypt is you know when I was there was far more secular far more uh accommodating you know much it you know when I was there you know Soviets were essentially an occupying force and um and the Egyptians really longed for a relationship with the w W uh they liked Americans even though we were essentially person n grada uh they like the fact that we horsed around with you know people we would talk to the help we would we know we we

[01:40:39] Democrats in person as in spirit you know just you know we we we liked being around people into it whereas the Russians in the news agency across the street they were incredibly insular and um I remember I used to it was it was odd because I used to play doubles with one of these Soviet guys I called us the big

[01:41:02] Powers but uh they would have these parties on Saturday night and you could hear them playing Teresa Brew records you know put another nickel in you know and they would be sitting on a couch with their drinks just sitting around glumly and then it around 1 in the morning they was spill out in the street all drunk and singing it looked awful but the Egyptians just hated them and it it was a great time to be an American in Egypt whereas after 911 it was entirely different the governments were friendly but the the people were very upset with America and it seemed odd to me because I mean you attacked us yeah you know uh a strong motivation for me was to go back to

[01:41:51] Egypt and find out what happened because because you know I remember it so fondly I just had a great time uh living in Egypt and and teaching these young Egyptians and also Palestinians and jordanians and some Africans and what's the answer you have you know you you talked a little bit about your mom and how she believed in conspiracies and things like that uh

[01:42:20] I asked this one Egyptian woman who was saying that the Americans did 911 to themselves I heard that a lot M I said how can you believe something for which there's absolutely no evidence you know you say that but there there's nothing you can point to that shows that you know there's any evidence or motivation and she said well in Egypt nobody's ever told us the truth and so we have to try to imagine for ourselves what it is so the question we always ask is who benefits and in this case we think America has been waiting for the opportunity to attack the Arab world and so you created this excuse for yourselves well that was her thinking and that's how conspiracies nurture themselves you know on these kinds of rationalizations that float above the world of Truth and evidence probably the same logic obviously the CIA killed Kennedy because had to figure out a way to get into

[01:43:27] Vietnam so yeah so let's go back to our good friend um it's the early 90s now he's been humiliated by his own government who have said thanks but no thanks we're going to have the Americans help us out here he goes to Sudan of all places yeah what happens in Sudan why doesn't he end up just settling down in Sudan and living the rest of his years there oh I wish he had at 92 to 96 Al-Qaeda became essentially an agricultural organization and

[01:44:06] Sudan uh Bin Laden in Sudan uh probably was the largest land owner he owned a considerable amount of property and he would you know do jobs for the Sudanese government you know build Highway ways and stuff like that and they would pay him with land um is whenever I think about Sudan I I went there to you try to understand that period in his life and I was trying to penetrate Sudan intelligence and so I was you know recruiting you know some some names of people that I've been given and I finally you know got made some relationships and they took me around and showed me Bin Laden's house and so on and this was a time when I had been traveling a lot and I had injured my back and um the uh it was very painful to take those long airplane flights and I took one of those big exercise balls you know where you have to blow up and you have to unbl it when you left the country but but in order to you know ease the the pain and um so one day one of my sudin contacts knocked on my door uh at a hotel that called itself the Hilton and um there was uh aad was the intelligence agent and he had this guy with him who was kind of um plump and he had one of those conical Indonesian hats that

[01:45:48] Muslims wear and um so come on in and you know uh Ahmed was very tired and he sat on the edge of my bed and his eyes were bobbing and I said I'mma just lie down so he falls asleep and he leaves me with this Al-Qaeda Guy and um and I'm you know I got my ball and I give him the office chair that's in the room and so who are you and he said well you can call me

[01:46:19] Lo and that was frustrating but uh I started asking him about Bin Laden he seemed to know everything and he especially in Sudan uh you know he knew all about Bin Laden's Enterprises the you know the the the he started raising seeds he he had a for while a bicycle importing Company B are usually used in sedan because the roads are all sand but the uh you know he had all these different

[01:46:48] Enterprises and this guy knew everything but he also knew all about you know fighting the Arabs mujahadin in in in [Music] Afghanistan and and yet I was at Sea I didn't really know who he was and so I went back to the US and started triangulating and I found Muhammad ly bayazid whose Al-Qaeda name was abar aluri and um he was the guy he was the guy who took the notes at the founding of al-Qaeda in May of 198 88 it's his handwriting I thought God I didn't have any idea who I had and uh so

[01:47:31] I flew back to Sudan and he wouldn't see me and uh that was you know so then I began to court him you know and finally he agreed and I flew back and um I said L why didn't you see me last time I mean it's a lot of trouble to come to cartoom and he saidwell I didn't know how seriously to take you the first time we met you were sitting on a balloon that was my my first Al-Qaeda interview it was a real Triumph but uh those years in Sudan uh at least according to lo you know they were kind of wonderful years for Al-Qaeda because they weren't fighting anybody um Ben Laden still had money and uh and he was generous in handing it out um the uh they would have uh celebratory dinners and they had soccer teams they played you know they had their own little league and uh you know people had dormitories and stuff like that people got money to get married it was they were settling down it was the US state department that decided this can't stand and um so they put pressure on sudin government to expel Bin Laden and the

[01:48:50] Sudanese government did that based on what he was a potential Terror terrorist a funer of Terror anyway what um hard evidence did the state department have at that time really none uh there were suspicions uh about that time uh CIA had opened up an office on Bin Laden or file in any case this is before the creation of Alex station that's where Alex station came from uh which was really the first sort of off-campus uh in the US station um but it was off-campus and ignored by the CIA uh they they called the people that worked there the the people the island of Lost toys uh you know there were people that were you kind of pushed out of their own departments and you know that was the the team the original team the and that team was led by Shore Michael Shyer yeah

[01:49:48] Shyer and what is it about him that had what is it that brought him to lead Alex station what was his conviction well Sher is uh a loose cannon to put it well certainly today he's about as off the rails as they come he wants to shoot Democrats yeah but at the time what was his conviction about Al-Qaeda well he was right about it yeah you know he was right that it was um you know it was a terrorist organization that uh could strike America and intended to uh he was right that they had reasons he

[01:50:32] I mean think you have to give Michael Shyer credit for seeing into the mind of Bin Laden and his followers and seeing how they looked at the world it's so foreign I mean when 911 happened the idea that a man in a cave in Afghanistan would attack America with was comical and Shyer didn't think so um so he was you know he was not a prophet but he was an analyst that could look at the tea leaves and see what could actually happen and nobody took him seriously that's another beautiful parallel in your book right is we we we've we've gone through kind of the history of the Muslim Brotherhood Al

[01:51:20] Jihad Al-Qaeda we hav't quite got to the point where Al-Qaeda and and and Al Jihad become one entity which will happen in the late 90s but as we move to the intelligence side which is the harder part I think to wrap one's head around you also have these two parallels between i49 and Alex station right and these two personalities between Michael Sher and

[01:51:47] John O'Neal yeah which are both right but because of their remarkable disdain for each other tragically both let this thing slip yeah um so maybe let's now shift for a moment and talk a little bit about Alex station and i49 the CIA and the FBI which by around this point in time the mid90s are starting to kind of pay attention to this threat yeah you know when you're talking about it I I reflect on the fact that the siege was built on this same premise that you know my mission was to write a movie about a woman in the CIA that was the the assignment and and that Benning became the woman in the CIA and then what's what was the the Soviet Union had fallen what was the problem you know and

[01:52:50] I realized the CIA had a realize enemy it was the FBI and so that's what the movie is about so maybe I was already primed to see it that way but I know I'd heard about the antagonism but as an American I can't tell you how disappointed I am in our intelligence agencies and the their failure to protect our country that's their mission but they got so caught up in their their institutional and personal antagonisms that they allowed 9/11 to happen and

[01:53:27] John O'Neal um lived a big life you know he was a a flamboyant you would never think of an FBI agent I mean to me FBI agents were kind of like Mormons in terms of their dress and their sober you know demeanor and so on Le the stereotypes John O'Neal wore these you know Gucci suits and he had these transpar parent black socks and kind of uh you know almost ballet slippers and he had U an office that he had personally decorated most FBI offices are are uh the furniture is all made in prisons so all of that goes out and incomes you know this luxurious office and U he has a uh on his he always has a fresh flowers and he has on his coffee table this book tulips the men the flower that drives men wild I mean this is not your typical FBI agent and he set out when he was assigned to New York station to conquer the city he wanted to meet everybody of any importance and he did he he gave his new secretary a

[01:54:42] Rolodex with all the names of the people that he wanted to meet in the next six months and he went down that list so he had tentacles in every part of the city and he thought of himself as a sheriff and he you know when when the Embassy bombings happened um the FBI was given the task of trying to find out you know this was a crime against America yeah we should we should probably take a moment to make sure people understand the difference in the mission of the organizations right so the FBI is law enforcement right so think police right they're the top police force the CIA is intelligence right and it's easy to see

[01:55:35] I suppose how they can have different priorities yeah so let's use this example that you're you're going to talk about which is the the bombing of the American Embassy in Kenya which was 98 yeah okay now 224 people were killed number of them Americans and more than 100 people were Blinded By The Flying glass I mean it was horrible horrible tragedy when Americans are killed on foreign soil is that clearly in the purview of the FBI yes that is law enforcement they have to get permission from the country that they're going into but uh but in a country like Kenya which is an ally right this is a relatively straightforward request that the United States FBI would be able to go in there conduct a criminal investigation right and bring to Justice people to stand trial in the

[01:56:33] United States yeah that is completely within the law and so that's the way it's supposed to work you know the FBI being the world's Premier policing organization you know it's supposed to be uh on the on the case and so um as it turned out there were only six agents in the 50,000 member FBI who spoke Arabic and one of them was Ali sufan born in

[01:57:02] Lebanon and it was during this period of time that uh sufan began reading Al-Qaeda literature and piecing together what was actually going on and he's the one who wrote a memo that got to you got O'Neal's attention that U you know that this was probably the Mover behind that and O'Neal had an eye for talent and you know he reached out and just grabbed this young man and brought him in put him on i49 Squad somebody who would be his eyes and ears in the Arab world uh when did i49 get formed I don't know I'm not sure exactly when it was and was it specifically anti-terror yeah that was his goal um but you know i49 Squad was made up of a lot of people you know the end of the

[01:57:58] Soviet Union caused a lot of disruption in our intelligence agencies because you know they they've been you know guys on the i49 squad some of them spoke uh uh some spoke Russian some SP you know spoke uh Eastern European languages polish and so on and they and they their mission was to recruit people that were in the embassies in New York and so on to try to you know and then suddenly all that fell apart and so there was a then the rubble of you know the absence of the Soviet Union i49 Squad was built up of enlisting a lot of people who had no experience in dealing with the Arab world there's a very interesting parallel between the transition in both human capital and Military Capital we're going to talk about the USS coal but you're very deliberate in the way that you write about it about the way you write about the bombing which is you describe in excruciating detail the strength and might of that ship uhhuh and you're deliberately vague about the skiff that blows it up to demonstrate I think the enormous asymmetry that took place yeah the point being this USS coal was an unbelievable warship for traditional Warfare right and yet was defenseless against Guerilla

[01:59:29] Warfare right and that basically means there was kind of this decade lag after the Cold War where the military industrial complex had not adopted to what the new warfare was but I think what you're saying which is you got six people that speak Arabic in the entire FBI and the CIA you know also has their you know tentacles back in the Cold War well that's basically the same thing right it's the it's the it's the human and intellectual skill set that's for the wrong war and it seemed like it just took a while to to catch up unfortunately it didn't catch up right I mean I think that's part of the story it never did and the the coal bombing uh it was a very telling moment uh you know October 20th I think uh 20 amazing two weeks before the election yeah now and this is not you know really remarked upon in in the campaigns but 19 Sailors died um and the ship you know it was a stealth vessel you know but there was no hiding it it was in the middle of Aiden Harbor in Yemen which had no business being I mean Yemen is far from an ally and you know the whole area was riddled with you know uh jihadis and you know people that were intent on doing harm to the US and there was this very appealing Target um and there was a failed attempt to bombit uh the little skiff was overloaded with the with explosives and sank but um then then they pulled it off and in some ways it it prefigured 911 you know that kind of imbalance of forces that you were talking about you know that you know the coming out of the blue who would who would ever have expected it U you know that was common it's always been common in you know ports that you know little boats would come out and try to sell Trinkets and stuff like that or deliver food and so the sailors were used to seeing boats coming toward them um but they had no idea you know they were waving at the at the people that were about to kill them what was involved operational for

[02:01:52] Al-Qaeda to pull off the embassy bombing in Kenya and then the USS Cole because obviously they were they were prologue to 911 they were practice runs um they were never the end goal um well I mean I guess you could argue Bin Laden Bin Laden's objective was to draw the us into yeah I think he thought after the aacy bombings that he that would do the trick and you know it was infuriating to him that we ignored it so and and then the coal bombing the same thing uh it had to be something more spectacular to get America interested in him and the embassy bombing took place after Al Jihad and Al-Qaeda had merged yeah yeah they uh and some of the operatives some of the main operatives in the Embassy bombings were zat's men so uh the it was a you know both of these were you know catastrophic events that that for whatever reason America was not prepared to pay any attention to why do you think that is with all the benefits of with 21 years of hindsight why is it that neither George

[02:03:05] W bush nor Al Gore during their entire campaigns including right you know including a campaign that included the uh explosion on the USS coal yeah why was this why was this not a priority if it had happened here it would have been a different story but it happened elsewhere and I think that's what you know that's one of the reasons Americans were so vulnerable is our own huis and in the sense of is isolation that we have historically always felt but why wasn't it enough that it had happened abroad they were still us lives yes they were and they should have been counted more dearly but they weren't and I you know it's similar with our Wars don't you think you know I mean we have Wars people die uh sometimes there's a tribute to them in the paper and you see their pictures but not often and so it's cost of doing business it this you know we are not as there's a there's a gap between our role in the world and the people we think we are and I think this was especially true before 911 the reason Bin Laden attacked us is you know the he he felt surrounded uh he felt America was encircling the Islamic world and they they were under threat and that what why would we do that well obviously our our goal would be to destroy Islam and then there was at the same time this mandate he had in his mind that Islam has to rise again you know once it was the superpower you know it went all the way you know into middle

[02:04:51] Europe and and to Southern China you know it was an expansionist power and that it should resume that role so you know there was the sense of being threatened by the superpower and the feeling that Islam should replace it and that was I think the dynamic that was driving him and nobody in uh I don't I can't say nobody in America but very few people in America would have imagined that such uh Preposterous dreams would motivate uh you know somebody like Bin Laden and actually be able to put into effect an attack on this nation that was seemingly invulnerable that was so distant how could you even reach it and how could you touch it in a way that would make it suffer yes what Bin Laden wanted America to suffer and uh and he also wanted to humiliate America because I think he understood the power of humiliation now going back to O'Neal and

[02:06:01] Shyer they agreed on one thing which was Osama bin Laden was a really bad actor and needed to be taken seriously yeah in fact you could argue that no two people believed it more than these to I think that's fair one who headed the cia's Alex station which was in charge of anti-terrorism and the other i49 which was the FBI's response to that but beyond that they didn't see anything eye to eye fundamentally O'Neal believed that Bin Laden and other operatives of al-Qaeda should be brought to Justice in the court of law in the United

[02:06:39] States Shyer and colleagues believed these people should be assassinated right um an attempt was made to assassinate Bin Laden in 1998 after the bombing in k it was a bit of a debacle it didn't amount in anything right why is that was it failed intelligence well one thing here's the thinking you know that was going on inside at that time Clinton white house uh they hit us twice well we should hit them back twice you know we this is the kind of thing you do with nation states right you know parallel responses so uh we'll bomb training camps in uh in Afghan Afghanistan and will hit this Factory in cartoon that we think is manufacturing poison chemicals for

[02:07:28] Al-Qaeda actually it was making Veterinary M medicines and it was one of the main factories in the whole country very poor country and we killed a night Watchman you know it just had nothing to do with any of it but we bombed the camps in Afghanistan fingers crossed Bin Laden would be there well he wasn't uh he was on on the road to go there and then changed his mind and they went somewhere else so it might have happened but it didn't but the point was look what we can do you hit us we'll hit you back well that's exactly what Bin Laden wanted you know it the failure of imagination that you referenced there was a failure of imagination U but it was coupled with uh prejudicial ideas is about who we're dealing with and a tremendous absence of knowledge about the cultures that they you know that our adversaries came from so we just didn't understand and we couldn't understand their language we didn't know what was going on and so yeah is not a not a surprise that our imaginations didn't you know rise to the to the task because we didn't know who we were dealing with and we could not figure them out nor did we really spend very much time worrying about it let's just deal with him as if it was Russia that did this and we'll strike them back proportionately and um you know Clinton did have the idea you know he spoke to one of his military commanders about sending in ninjas you you know drop repel down from Cobra helicopters and that that sure surprise

[02:09:14] Bin Laden and uh on balance it wasn't a bad idea that was probably the right thing to do go directly in there and you know and but you know we were still in the remote control uh phase of our Imperial you know Rule and and I think that that's why partly why we didn't take you know the embassy bombing seriously you know we that's not the way we do things we send drones over we send you know uh f-16s or we send bombers over and we do it you know uh

[02:09:51] Ely and we don't dirty our hands we don't bloody our hands uh and so I think people just thought it would be a nuisance and you know that we would take care of it so is the call as the planning for the coal bombing is underway the planning for 9911 is also underway these were parallel not serial operations two men come to the United

[02:10:19] States January 15th 2000 who are they these men are khadal midar and noaf alhazmi Saudis there's two Saudi guys uh they scarcely speak any English at all uh they had been in a meeting in quala lour with the coal bombers and um so the coal bombers went off to uh do their thing and then they they fly first of all to Thailand and then they fly into la and um so how can they do anything you know they're in a country they don't understand they they don't speak English you know their mission is to go train as

[02:11:04] Pilots but they would not qualify because they couldn't even speak enough English to go into a class so this is the first mystery what are they doing here and um as it happens that very day that they arrive U there is a u a fig Saudi figure named baumi Omar baumi who happens to be at the Saudi Consulate in La talking to the minister of religious

[02:11:36] Affairs that's kind of significant because you know they are the as a result of the mecca catastrophe Saudi put Saudis put uh these imams in consulates all over the place and they had a lot of authority so anyway Omar bayi leaves the Saudi consulate and he goes to u a middle eastern restaurant where he happens to over hear these two guys speaking in a Saudi accent it's according to him and the Saudi government a total coincidence do you believe that no not at all no I think in in uh you know the families of the victims of 911 are suing the the Saudi government trying to get U more information about the people that are involved in that and baumi is one of the people that they have on their list of people to talk to but baumi is such a generous fellow that he offers to help them find a housing in San Diego where he has a place and so he fronts them some money he sets them up in San Diego baumi and other people in his Circle uh begin receiving money from the wife of the Saudi Ambassador in Washington

[02:12:55] DC um ostensibly for an operation for the wife or so you know these you know but it's significant thousands and thousands of dollars and um baumi takes uh these two guys NOAA hosby and midar to meet u a cleric in this Saudi mosque in in San Diego um who is anoir alaki who later becomes you know the the voice of radical Islam we finally killed him in Yemen but uh whether he was uh an Al-Qaeda connection has never been established but wouldn't it make sense you know in any case and and what what is what is your thought on the money that was coming directly from the wife of the Saudi ambassador the Ambassador bandar um was very close to you know the bush White House he was he was sort of the dean of the Diplomatic establishment so there was a a plausibility thing how you know would you really see such a thing happening from the Ambassador himself but it stands that you know these Saudis were getting money sent to them in San Diego by bandar's wife and now his daughter is the ambassador of the us so you know there that has never been I think satisfactorily accounted for another thing that's going on you know they arrived in January 15th um in March the CIA finds out that they're in the

[02:14:46] US uh probably you know Prince turkey you know Prince turkey told me that he had informed the um the chief of station in Riad the CIA man and Riad about that so that's probably where it came from so in March this is uh 21 months before 911 almost two years the CIA knows that Al-Qaeda is in America and this is at a time when they they say their hair is on fire about you know about Al-Qaeda that we're under threat they're going to the White House and yet they know that Al-Qaeda is in

[02:15:25] San Diego and moreover um mid's wife is in Yemen she comes from a very Al-Qaeda Jihadi family her name is Hoda alada and um the alhada household because it's such a hot spot we've got wires on yeah so I think it's on the CIA is listening to the phone calls 14 occasions the NSA is getting calls to this Al-Qaeda house in

[02:16:02] Yemen from San Diego do you have to draw a picture you know what's more disturbing than this is that in October after the coal bombing when Ali safon is questioning kuso and the other suspects he asks specifically well he he kind of I think through that questioning comes to learn of the meeting that took place in Malaysia yeah and asks explicitly on at least three occasions for information from the

[02:16:41] CIA about these two guys in the US and he is stonewalled it's not casual either the a request like that goes to the director of the FBI who sends a a letter to his counterpart the director of the CIA formally requesting information about in this case this meeting in quala lumur do you know anything about it no is the answer no information in fact the CIA actually covered the meeting they recruited the Malaysian police to take photographs and stuff like that so they got pictures of the participants and they hide this information from from the FBI and you know going back to the you know the mission of each of these agencies there was the the the story about The Siege was who was fighting they were fighting over who had control over terrorism in the United States and in real life the FBI won that battle so they have the authority CIA does not is not supposed to operate in our country but the FBI has the authority has a warrant on Al-Qaeda and Bin Laden and all his for followers so how is this not in the clearest legal sense obstruction of justice it is obstruction of justice the the CIA obstructed Justice uh when

[02:18:11] Ali safan was investigating the coal bombing you know they they hid information about the planning and they hid information about the quala lur meeting uh this is a murder investigation 19 Sailors so so at this point Michael Sher is gone correct he has been relieved of his duties at Alex station yeah what led to that well he was relentless in pressing uh this the agency and trying to you know get rid of Bin Laden there was a there was a moment where he thought Bin Laden might be at one of the camps in Afghan istan and he said uh and the reason they would that he might be there is that a lot of the royal family from the UAE was coming to to bustard hunting this this endangered bird that is popular um and so let's bomb the camp and uh we'll kill all the princes but we might get Ben

[02:19:14] Laden well that was the kind of thinking that Michael Shyer was capable of yeah which again the UAE is an ally I mean it would be hard to Fathom that yeah and we were just at that moment selling them you know a whole Fleet of F-16 so you know there was a financial investment and not doing that as well as in addition to the absurdity of the scene but that's the kind of thing that that

[02:19:38] Shyer would propose so who took over Alex station when Shyer was terminated the the woman that um that took over the the station um is is uh you know in FBI view um a villain you know but she and shy are later married and uh so it was it was an office romance it was an extension of Shyer anyway yeah um now one of the things that's interesting about Alex station is it had a number of i49 agents that sat within it physically right so these are FBI agents that are sitting inside Alex station but they were kind of handcuffed because they were privy to the information that the CIA had but they weren't permitted to share it with their colleagues at FBI one of the things that struck me as odd is that none of them broke rank right like you you you see an Edward Snowden you know a decade later who you know goes completely Rogue and decides for right or wrong this is his conviction this is what he's going to do about it this is in the life this is in the best interest of American lives and yet amazingly none of the FB

[02:20:50] FBI agents sitting inside of Alex station who presumably saw what was happening didn't think I'm willing to jeopardize my job here and maybe face criminal charges to get information because they saw the wires coming in they saw the requests repeatedly from the FBI from suon saying who are these people what happened in Malaysia why is money leaving to go to these people why is this money coming to the United

[02:21:20] States did you ever get an insight into why the FBI people inside Alex station were were were muzzled you know there was a it was more of a legal conceit they called the wall and the idea was that information should not travel from the intelligence world into the criminal one and vice versa um there was really no law there was people thought it was a law but there was a it was a custom and then FBI had its own Intelligence Division um and so it was part of just is like grand jury testimony you know it's notos it's supposed to be sealed you know it's kept kept pure and secret um but when you're faced with something like that the only alternative you know is to break the law and there can be very serious consequences and it's a lonely thing to do but that's really the only thing you can do what I can tell you is how broken those people are by what happened um they knew what was gonna they knew what was underway and they lost their boss you know John O'Neal died as a consequence of their reticence to say anything I'm not holding them responsible for 911 but I do hold the

[02:22:54] CIA responsible for it if they had been transparent with the FBI if they had said we have these Al-Qaeda members in America uh the FBI had the authority they had the warrant they had everything they could follow them they could tape them they could you know clone their computers they and they could arrest them they would all these things that they could do but they were kept in the dark and of course question is why and I've asked you know I how many people in the CIA were you able to interview uh that were actually working in the CIA

[02:23:42] I there was a there was a moment where uh I think it's time has passed enough that I can say this uh I wrote an article about U I'm El zaahi for the New Yorker and the CIA asked to talk to me and so um I was picked up by an FBI agent who and who worked at at the CIA and driven to CIA headquarters and gone up seventh floor and there was a conference room and I met with Alex station uh there were about 20 something people there and uh the the meeting started off in Arabic and I said you know I've could you speak everybody here speaks Arabic and they had learned it in the last couple of years it was I was impressed by that but

[02:24:44] I was not impressed with their intelligence you know I was a reporter on the ground you know going around talking to people and I wasn't trying to hide information from the CIA I publish it you know it's not what I find out I want people to know so I didn't feel like I was betraying sources or anything like that by talking to the

[02:25:06] CIA um what I did want was a little bit of information from them in return and what they confided was that Ben Laden was alive at that time there was a lot of talk uh I'm guessing it was 2003 it might have been might have been earlier than that because I went to Egypt in I guess in the it must have been 2002 um Bin Laden was keeping his head down and so um you know there was a lot of talk that maybe we got him or that he was sick you know and um but you know that the intelligence agencies at least my experience with

[02:25:54] American intelligence agencies is that um they tend to trust information that has been stolen in other words you know waps you know stuff that people are saying not knowing supposedly that they're being listened to reporters have a different posture we go out and talk to people and ask them what they're up to and why and you know where'd you come from and you know those sorts of things you don't normally get on transcripts and so uh they apparently tape my phone you know one of my sources said he read a conversation I had uh he came in on his laptop at the agency um it was a conversation I'd had with Za's cousin and um so the legal Authority they had to tap your phone was because of who you were speaking to you're not supposed to tap

[02:26:56] Americans so that was if if that had been a tap on my line um then you know or if I were talking to you know as I had been to Za's cousin um they should say individual a you know and so I'm not identified and um but you know obviously I was and I thought at the time oh those Egyptians you know they they're on top of U you know Za's cousin they sent this as a gift to the

[02:27:31] CIA and um the uh but then I you know then I a couple of years later learned you know that um we had been you know they had the American intelligence had been taping Americans and some reporters and I obviously I had had an a visit from uh there's a terrorism Squad uh even in Austin and uh they you know a couple of guys came over they wanted to talk to me and I thought they wanted advice because I had talked to FBI agents before to give them a little background on Al-Qaeda and I thought that's what this was and one of them was a from the FDA but he was on the terrorism Squad and he walked into my office and there are all these books on now alqaeda and there's you know a whiteboard full of Arabic names and you know he was terrified his hands were trembling and uh what they wanted to know was uh about a call that I had made to England and um and it was a 44201 number you know and it just sounded like business number in London and I said you surely you know who it is but I looked on my

[02:28:51] Rolodex and it was a barrister who represented some jihadis and um and it turned out you know then they said did you know a person named Caroline Wright who's my daughter she was in college and they thought it was Caroline calling this Barrister to get to these jihadis and I thought this is our intelligence you know it was you know and then uh

[02:29:20] I as I started thinking about it it was like wait a minute how do you know it's my line how do you know that you know that that Caroline would how do you know about Caroline at all you know and so you wouldn't have gotten that if you hadn't been listening to the call and I was really outraged as an American citizen but also shocked by the level of incompetence that I mean I was grateful they came to clear it up

[02:29:50] I I have to say they at least did that but the pr the presumptions that they had were so absurd that I could see how we got ourselves into this fix the two hijackers the future hijackers in San Diego uh the FBI their lying on what was going on is the CIA knew they couldn't operate in America but the Saudis could and so they struck a deal with the

[02:30:18] Saudis to try to follow these guys and turn them here they are in our clutches we have an opportunity to penetrate Al-Qaeda which is not something the CIA had been able to do and uh although young men from all over the world were simply walking into the camps and becoming Al-Qaeda members but they thought that the Saudis would do them that favor and then the two hijackers disappeared and the CIA lost them and it was then in

[02:30:49] August of 2001 just a couple of weeks before 911 that the CIA went to the FBI to ask them to find these guys that they had lost and it was too late uh the FBI never did find them so Muhammad at is an interesting character um of all the 911 hijackers obviously he was the the senior figure but he was also such an interesting and unusual character right like it's hard to make sense of his motivation um an educated man yeah um a

[02:31:37] Pious man but you know one of the things I've always struggled with is what is it that these guys believed was going to happen you know you go back to the story about the the birds circling and the flesh not rotting do you believe every one of those 19 men believe they would be greeted in Paradise by virgins and do do you think they literally believe that I think so uh it may have not been the preponderant motive for them although martyrdom seems to be the the highest motivation right martydom even if you're not going to paradise and getting the virgins and all of that uh martyrdom has its appeal for uh especially for young men who have really little opportunity to make a dent in the world and here you can go off and change history all you have to do is sacrifice your life so the martyrdom might be you know the carrot but it might not be it might just be that you know they wanted to prove a point and they wanted to go down in history and they have you talk about how terrorist organizations were allowed to legally operate inside of Germany provided that they were yeah foreign and not domestic terrorist organizations it's almost an unfathomable statement C can you help make sense of that well you know Germany has a tortured history and you know the it's problems with fanaticism uh on German soil has you know historically been a corrective so you cannot uh very easily be a fascist in

[02:33:33] Germany now um you know there are fascists in Germany but you know this it's it's sort of an underground thing other countries uh you know there's this sense in Germany of of implicit neutrality we don't take positions on things like that and so if you're opposed to your government and you flee to Germany for

[02:33:59] Asylum what you do with you know in relation to your home country is your business not ours just don't screw around with you know with our country and that was it's not just Germany you know um there Europe was slow to awaken to you know the threat on to their own countries in part because they like I you know in England you know terrorists were actually brought into England because they were escaping the death penalty in Egypt and they still live uh with subsidized rent and such a thing uh you know in in London uh one of my sources is a driving instructor in

[02:34:41] London um and he killed this little girl sha in Egypt in his attempt to kill the Prime Minister uh that kind of mentality uh is all came about because people just didn't feel threatened and uh and I think to some extent that explains why uh these Terror groups were allowed to grow up inside the borders especially of England and Germany and

[02:35:09] Spain as well when did ATA come to the United States I don't remember the exact month um his his cohorts had begun to assemble and so I think he was one of the last to arrive he was in Spain uh coordinating with some of the Spanish Al-Qaeda guys um to what end we're not really sure but then you know he flew into America of course um unlike the other guys his his English was pretty good so his English is good he's one of the four Pilots how were they coordinating inside the US what did they communicate by did they did they speak on cell phones did they use email how did these 19 guys organized in four groups communicate well they did use email and cell phones and what you have to understand they weren't really hiding you know they it's nobody you know the CIA knew that Al-Qaeda was present and the al-Qaeda guys didn't know the CIA knew that uh so sensibly they just lived openly uh you know they had driver's licenses and stuff in their own names

[02:36:30] U eventually the FBI would find that they were listed in the San Diego phone directory um so you know they weren't in hiding they didn't feel threatened uh and they took advantage of that freedom so after the election um Richard Clark who's also a very important figure in your book gets a demotion why is that that was not clear to me in the book well he was he had been under Clinton the kind of terrorism Zar and um when the Bush

[02:37:11] Administration came in they didn't see the need for that uh and their their view was about the big picture we're talking talking about China and Russia and so the people in their NSA and you know Secretary of State and Ki rice and so on uh you know that's what they're they came from the old school uh Clark told me that when he talked to KI rice to try to alert her to the danger of al-Qaeda he had the feeling she'd never heard of the organization it's hard to imagine that she didn't hear of it at all but she clearly didn't take it seriously enough to take his counsel and so he was pushed down the ranks um and Bush was you know I don't think he took it seriously until um the Saudis um threatened to break off relations with uh the us because of Israel and they that woke him up he was very concerned about that but then there was a CIA memo

[02:38:22] I think it was dated August 6 2001 this is the presidential Daily Brief that was titled uh Al-Qaeda set to attack in the US right and so it couldn't have been clearer and this was about the same time the CIA lost those guys in San Diego so suddenly things are moving and they're out of the cia's control now during the 911 Commission wheni rice was asked about that memo

[02:38:53] August 6th right so 5 weeks before 911 yeah the president of the United States gets a briefing that says Al-Qaeda is going to strike on us soil and of course when Congress questioned her it was sort of why was this not taken seriously her response was if I recall something akin to this was dated there was nothing new in here this was speculative there was no real intelligence am I am I remembering that correctly yeah such

[02:39:25] Dodges were characteristic of a lot of the people involved in this massive intelligence failure you know I I've asked people in the CIA you know people in high Authority about those hijackers for instance and no we didn't really know they were I mean it was just incompetence actually you know we you know there were memos that we didn't read and you know it was in yes it was in the memos but you know it never really came to the attention of people in authority and in other words there's a fog uh you know pixie dust thrown in your eyes whereas nothing could be more incendiary uh to the very same people that are ringing the alarm Bells saying

[02:40:05] Al-Qaeda is on the war path and is coming our way and then they say well you know we didn't we weren't really paying attention to that and the memo never came to our attention you know this was you know CIA was well aware by this time you know there was the Embassy bombings there was a coal bombing there was in then you know they become aware that Al-Qaeda is in America now so they're moving onto our soil and that's the origin of that particular memo is that CIA knows they're here and so they're obviously they're gonna do an attack here now O'Neal said this to condar Rice before he was fired forced to resign and she seemed to indicate that this was not a high priority because it I think in the in the words at least used in the uh in the U dramatized version of this this was swatting flies right this was what we've got a couple of al-Qaeda guys in this country that's not strategic that's not relevant um one of the things that's just so mindboggling to me about this story is how yeah incompetence is I mean this is a obviously a big part of this but it's the personality conflicts that got in the way I mean another character in the story whose role is really quite sad is Barbara Bodin yeah um then

[02:41:33] Ambassador in Yemen who did not get along with John O'Neal which I guess you can't falter for that I can John O'Neal struck me just from everything I've read about him and I know you did not have the ability to interview him but you're doing you're reporting his based on interviews with everyone who knew him he struck me as a lover or haate guy is that a safe a polarizing yeah you either absolutely loved this guy or you absolutely hated this guy but I never got the impression that anybody wouldn't think he was competent yeah uh Barbara Bodin seemed to have a thing about men and guns and she was offended that the FBI came to

[02:42:17] Yemen with a bunch of armaments and um of course it was dangerous U and and O'Neal was trying to take care of his people and they were authorized to carry weapons but she was offended and made them give up their long guns and she kicked him out of Yemen she did which is another real setback in the investigation at the time he could be I mean taking her side I I'm sure she perceived O'Neal as a swaggering misogynist and um you know uh and she wasn't going to have any of that um and she felt that she had a role as the ambassador to cultivate a better relationship with the yemenese and here he was coming in kicking up all this dust alienating everybody with his

[02:43:11] American big footing and uh so enough of this you know I I can do without him and it was a terrible blow for for O'Neal and I I think you know that in some ways led to his sort of disgrace at the end where he had to go to a retirement conference and he took some papers out of the office he shouldn't have taken but he was doing work uh in Florida at this retirement conference and then left his briefcase in the conference room and and somebody took it he he got it back and you know the only thing it was taken was like a silver cigar cutter but um but and the papers were still in there but you know he turned himself in and uh he had a lot of enemies inside the FBI and they were not going to miss the opportunity to use this to get rid of him now he had many job opportunities after he left the

[02:44:13] FBI one of them was a job in the government again in the White House correct or at least that was something that Dick Clark hoped he would take it's not clear that he wanted him to replace him he couldn't think of a better person and U O'Neal had lived above his means for many years I don't know how he got away with it um but he was deeply in debt and um and I think he was also you know deeply wounded by his experience with government and so he wanted to get out and make some money and and there was money to be made for him um you know with his experience you know he the job that he settled on was head of security at the World Trade Center and I know that and listen when this whole this whole Adventure started for me by reading obituaries that were streaming online right after 9911 I was trying to find a way into the story something that would humanize it and um

[02:45:17] I thought I I was looking look for you know people who died in 9911 and see if I could find a narrative and on the Washington Post site about six days after 911 I think was this obituary of John O'Neal of FBI head of counterterrorism recently retired been on the job for a month it was more than that it's spelled out that he had taken classified information out of the office and um

[02:45:49] I thought I didn't know if he was a hero or a goat but his life could tell us something about why we failed he was the head of counterterrorism in New York he's the guy that had the warrant on Bin Laden but instead of getting Bin Laden Bin Laden got him that was the way I looked at it it's one of those things Lawrence where if if this weren't a true story yeah if you had written the looming

[02:46:17] Tower as a fiction I don't know that the editors would have let you end it the way you did right I don't think they would have let you have John O'Neal actually die inside the World Trade Center a month after being forced to resign from the FBI because he was kicked out at The Shins and not able to do his job I thought when I read that oit that it was a supreme irony but I don't see it that way now he told his colleagues you know that some of them said to him John you'll be safe now because they already hit the

[02:46:57] Trade Center because they been bombing yeah and um he said no they'll come back to finish the job so I think he instinctively put himself at Ground Zero and in that sense I see it as a Greek tragedy you know he in some ways anticipated his fate and went to meet it he and he actually left the tower that day and went back inside to rescue people yeah yeah that's that's the thing he he walked back into the building um as as many Heroes did yeah if September 11th took place on December 11th if it were if the mission were postponed two months do you think that would have been enough time for the FBI to figure it out how how close was the

[02:47:52] FBI to doing this despite the incompetence of the CIA if not the outright negligence of the CIA well if this it's hard to calculate how much they could have done but they there's no reason to think that they couldn't have once alerted in August and given three or four months to work it out no reason to think that they couldn't have Tracked Down the communications if the American intelligence uh Community had been helpful to well because remember the other thing that I always feel like they were so close to cracking was once they had the list the CIA list of suspected

[02:48:38] Al-Qaeda operatives and the list of Arabs in flight schools and they crossed that list that was just a matter of time it seems like it and you know there were you know several cases like you mentioned the flight schools in Arizona in Minnesota you know there were these weird things where you know these Arab wouldbe pilots who wanted to learn how to fly but not how to land you know so those are really uh puzzling things now of course it was nothing like this had ever happened before it seems crazy but on the other hand it had been Envision but you'd think like all it would have taken taken would have been a handful of these guys show up on a cross list and that manifest gets sent to TSA or whatever was TSA TSA back then I don't know what it was called but like there would have been a watch list that said you because as you said these guys are getting on airplanes with their real names they had real ID well also you know there were you know there's one of the FBI agents in Phoenix you know actually wrote I think this was a guy that did that that you know they could

[02:49:49] Envision crashing into buildings you know that's spookily preent and then there was you know secret uh you know the 911 families had sued to get the 28 pages that had been suppressed in the 911 report and we finally got them although there's still some redaction in it and in there you see uh Saudis on airplanes doing trial runs you know walking you know getting a ticket in the first class compartment and walking into the cockpit and um and

[02:50:27] Oh I thought this was a bathroom right and um so and then they one of them was so provocative in his actions that they actually landed the plane uh to stop the flight put down at the nearest airport and you know had somebody come out and interrogate two I think Saudis and they said no we're we're going to a party at the Saudi Embassy and they gave them a number in the Saudi Embassy in

[02:50:53] Washington um well that's damning and no wonder it was suppressed if you're trying to protect your relationship with Saudi Arabia but it hasn't been explained uh but these were clearly trial runs and the CIA knew about them that's why that was in the 9/11 report you know these these were this is intelligence that had been surfaced so there was Intelligence around that something was cooking and even the CIA you know uh George tenant was telling the the White House they're gonna attack us they're coming for us you know uh that's the thing with tenant I can't understand from your book I gotta be honest with you I'm really conflicted and confused on the one hand he seems to be in lock step with Richard Clark in saying this is a big deal and he seems incredibly frustrated with the Bush

[02:51:50] Administration that they're not taking this more seriously and he seems to believe that this is almost something they're doing out of spite like whatever the previous president did we're absolutely going to do the opposite right but at the same time I think how is it then that under your watch your organization was so derel you know he's never really been able to produce an credible answer and you know

[02:52:21] I'm trying I've I've tried to imagine what was going through his mind uh if it's the case that he did seriously believe that Al-Qaeda was a threat and that he had been striking a deal with the Saudis you know it was a risky deal but you know one that had the potential for a huge payoff and then it gets out of control and just as it's getting out of control he is dram atically you know shouting you know pay attention al-qaeda's on the war path you know we got to so it's sort of like the arsonist who as the house catch is on fire is actually the one that calls the firefighter yeah I think that's a fair comparison I I don't know what's going through I want to be fair to him yeah you were not able to interview him he wouldn't talk to me and he's never really dealt seriously with this subject um I it's not just George Tennant but he's responsible he he was the person who oversaw the American intelligence community in one of its greatest catastrophes in our history and not that it's been so Sterling since then but you know it was an unbelievable failure uh and there are so many points yes it's true Monday morning quarterbacking and all of that but I think I'm being fair enough to say the CIA knew what was going on they hid the information from the FBI had the CIA been transparent and worked in tandem with the FBI CI that 911 would not have happened I think that I think the facts support that and so you know no there's never been an accountability for this not any and you know I in fact you know

[02:54:15] George denett got the medal of freedom and you know all these other things accolades you know there's a I'm not saying that he belongs in prison although I I can understand why people might say that but he should be held accountable as should everybody in Authority at that agency so so I wanted to ask you about that which is given all that we know today has anyone inside the

[02:54:43] CIA been charged with a criminal offense for obstruction of justice no no they were promoted uh you know people that knew about this uh uh were given Plum assignments and um I asked one of the directors about um has anybody been held accountable and uh he said well yes uh you know I I've held people accountable well who uh you know for what and he he wouldn't specify but there was no evidence of it and uh I asked about it was a question about torture mhm um and you know the two hijackers in San

[02:55:30] Diego uh and maybe one other thing and I said you know this is a history of the CIA you know not all under your Reign but you know partly you know has anybody been held accountable and uh he quarreled with some of my facts um W without actually saying that they were wrong and then I said so in other words nobody's been held accountable and then he said no that's not true I've held people accountable myself but I don't know how to credit that um you know the the most conspicuous people got promotions yeah I mean let's just think about it through the lens of the family members of 911 right so we had a 911

[02:56:13] Commission [Music] um what what came of that for the family members well it was frustrating for the family members they it was presented as being the whole truth and nothing but the truth and then it came out that there were parts of the 911 Commission that were suppressed and the 28 Pages most notably and of course they were a lot of pages redacted but and the 28 pages that were suppressed dealt primarily with the Saudi the really because again I remember even at the time one of the things that was odd was you know the Saudis you know being given air clearance to leave yeah um how do you make sense of this I I I this is a this is one that I have a hard time wrapping my head around which is why would the Saudis have why would anybody inside of Saudi Arabia had wanted this I'm I'm talking about not obviously Al-Qaeda but I'm talking about anyone within the royal family anyone within the Saudi intelligence Community

[02:57:16] I mean there's no doubt to me that Prince turkey was a good guy right this is a guy who I can't imagine there was any part of him that would want to see Ben Laden and his organization succeed so what is the what is the what's the explanation for for how any of the the quote unquote Saudi good guys could have stood by and knowingly watched this happen or Worse supported it financially or otherwise if we think about you know these things as an intelligence analyst you know know just imagine um you know here are the facts you know so where where are the Saudis in this and why are they behaving like this um I think that the Saudis thought for one thing they gave us the information that Al-Qaeda is in

[02:58:07] America um perhaps if this FBI's scenario is correct that the that the CIA thought that they could turn these guys guys they work out a deal with the Saudis where they're going to run these people you know they'll use them as potential recruits and they fund the bomis and other people that are sort of their supervisors so they give them money to keep the operation going and um and there's a certain uh ambition on the part of the Saudis to show how what a great job they can do and also these are Saudis that are in America and so they want to try to keep control over them so I can imvision that but does that explain how they would actually how the ambassador's wife would send money to it would explain if baumi for instance is a Saudi intelligence operative and his job is to oversee these guys oversee them to prevent them from attacking on us soil oversee to penetrate their cell and understand what's going on I see and I don't know if the Saudis knew that they were planning to fly planes into buildings but they were up to something so what could it be I see so that's a more plausible explanation which is that again their failure of imagination was they had no idea that these Saudi kids could accomplish something as Grand especially given that pair you know it's hard to imagine that you know they would take them that seriously on the other hand there they were I see this makes a bit more sense so so going back to my analogy they're not really acting as an arsonist there's somebody who accidentally sets the house on fire but then realizes oh I just set the house on fire I better call right call but I also better make sure I'm nowhere near this fire get here I'm not going to stick around to say I was doing this and that you know one always hopes for whistleblowers and somebody to come clear the air and there you know documents to surface that and none of that has happened you know so far uh I may be wrong about all this it could be simply incompetence which explains so many things uh but there were people like those FBI guys and that you they knew something was going on and they were alarmed and you know and they were also shut down when they tried to you you know air their concern so obviously it was important enough and dozens of people in the CIA at high levels read these memos so I long for the day when somebody comes up and says this is what actually happened but I you know it's it hadn't happened so far in 20 years and I think that the the longing of the

[03:01:23] CIA is to bury it in institutional memory in heaven never surface Richard Clark apologized to the family members of the the the 911 victims how many other government officials apologized publicly I don't know of any um there was an awful lot of scolding going on but what made what made Dick Clark's statement so cathartic is he took responsibility nobody else did that I always found it amazing that he became sort of a target of partisan hit jobs yeah I know which is I mean I've read quite a bit about him I obviously never had the privilege of meeting him but never came across to me as a partisan guy actually actually served presidents of both administrations yeah I I was serve George H Bush before Clinton I mean uh I was on Shan Hannity's show one time and and it seemed like one of the main things he wanted to do is attack

[03:02:29] Dick Clark I wasn't prepared for it at all and uh you know I I mentioned that incident where you know he said that Ki thought that had dismissed Al-Qaeda and and Hannity went off on uh on Dick Clark and I said but he's been a wonderful public servant you know I mean he you may think ill of him but you know he's a master bureaucrat and he was one of the ones that was you know ringing the alarm about Al-Qaeda you know I I it was I don't know it we live in a culture that's just full of people that like to attack others and you know but Dick

[03:03:13] Clark you know you can you can be puzzled over some of his actions uh like he was the one who authorized the flights for the Saudis to leave the US and I'm sure that he envisioned you know retaliatory attacks on members of the Saudi royal family or Bin Laden's family who were present here um and that's totally plausible but U was it a wise thing to do I don't know what were the days after 911 like for Ali suon oh

[03:03:57] God it's hard not to think about who he was you know this young guy an Earnest immigrant who is probably the most valuable person in the FBI at that point he's in his 20s he's been given I think he was 26 when he became the lead agent for the coal bombing huge responsibility and he is deeply intelligent and he is also totally conversant with Islam and with the politics of the Middle East such that you know when he would interrogate

[03:04:42] Al-Qaeda guys and they would bring up stuff uh about Islam is pulled out the Quran said show me where show me that in the Quran and then he could recite the Quran himself yeah in fact during his interrogation of Abu jandal I mean he basically won him over with his knowledge of the religion he knew how to interrogate people without torturing them and in fact during

[03:05:08] Guantanamo um when they started water boarding he called the director and said I'm either going to arrest these people or I have to leave and the director said leave we don't want to we're not going to be a part of that he's a seminal figure in our history in some ways he's the guy that identified U through his interrogations who the al-Qaeda people were you know he got the names you know through his skilled interrogation techniques and all the time the CIA was hiding something from him which was the meeting in koala lour where the coal bombers had been present and photographed and you know those photographs were where tons of cash had been transferred Ali knew about the transfers but he didn't know why yeah and you know and who who are these and but he was beginning to get some names from his interrogations and so that was some of the stuff that was flowing up in his request to the CIA for more information and you know he's flatly denied and um then 9911 happens and all he can think about is he has to get back to America and of course he's lost his mentor he he's Lo yeah he lost

[03:06:32] John so he gets on the plane and then he's told by a CIA Representative no you have to go back go back into you know your office in Yemen um and they give him a Manila envelope and in there are the pictures of the people that were at the koala lumur meeting and suddenly he know and there was one picture that he knew uh and he knew that you know there an alqa operative U and this has been withheld from him you know had they given him that just those photographs uh that he had asked for uh back when he was doing his you know you know starting his investigation of the coal and began to piece together what had happened uh the FBI would have been able to break open the case right there

[03:07:31] and he went to the bathroom and threw up and uh and he went to work and that's when he got the names of the al-Qaeda guys and and you know he he essentially solved the crime uh from that office in Yemen one

[03:07:59] man and history could have been so different if if the CIA had listen you know exceeded to his request and there was nobody better prepared to take advantage of it than Ali suan

[03:08:18] Lawrence it's hard to believe this has been 20 years yeah um I want to thank you for an unbelievable unbelievable investigation um just an amazing amount of research um it's hard to imagine what you had to do to write this book how many trips you had to take to take into the lion's den um and at the same time how infuriating it must have been to to to learn the set of events um I I can't think of anything I've ever done in my life that would be so upsetting right like I think of I think of anything I've ever done that's upset me that in terms of like learning that something happened or didn't happen or this person wasn't competent and it led to this you know like the dietary guidelines in the 1970s like none of that compares in some ways to this um but I also think that you know you've you've you've created a place in history for a lot of people who wouldn't otherwise be recognized yeah and I think the Ali sfans of the world are probably people who would you know not become household names and and look I I hope that as we sit here at the 20th anniversary of you know one of the most consequential dates for most of us um that people will take time to go back and reflect on the history of that um and reflect on the on the people who who were trying to make a difference um I guess I'll close with one last question which is what do you think the future holds with respect to this type of asymmetric Warfare be at

[03:10:09] Al-Qaeda or fill in the blank you know uh you know pick your favorite organization that operates in the same mindset um is this something that is going to be part of our world for the next Century I think so um know just I mean there are innumerable terrorist groups around the world and in our own country you know the white supremacist most notably but Al-Qaeda set a template you know a small group highly empowered by the kind of Judo moves of you know using technology against the countries that developed the technology but now we have you know Al-Qaeda you know which was on 911 three or 400 guys uh now the estimates 30 to 40,000 members of al-Qaeda and its Affiliates you know from Morocco through the Sahel up through Saudi Arabia to India to

[03:11:10] Southern China you know there are Al-Qaeda groups all over the place their intentions haven't changed uh they haven't been able to pull off the highly successful attack um in America that would that would equal 911 but many smaller attacks and not just in America but other country many other countries with technology I especially worry about drones um you know small groups can have a tremendous you know a far greater influence and Power um and then you know I've been writing about the pandemic um I worry that you know these kinds of episodes can be suggestive uh there are groups like omin Rio uh was a Japanese cult that uh really wanted to you know destroy much of the world with uh diseases or atomic bombs you know they they and a lot of very capable scientists were members of it um Adam waen division one of the white supremacist groups they have a philosophy of you know wanting to eliminate much of the population and so that it Narrows down only to white people uh and biological warfare is part of the you know the goal of some of those groups uh it's dismayingly easy uh to create diseases and um you know I was talking to U who's the guy in James Bond that creates all the weapons is m is that the oh I'm not sure all right I think it's m anyway I talked to this American version of that and he didn't show me the good stuff but I asked him this was several years ago um what worries you um and he said what really worries me is those high school kids that are now creating computer viruses will one day soon be able to manufacture biological viruses just as easily and that day is on us now um so I worry about that a lot and you know I think you know we we live in a hazardous world uh a world is constrained by a lot of loss of freedom because of that and you know it's you know it's we have to keep in mind the idea of freedom in the country that we used to be and hope that one day we can return to it we also have to be sober minded about the challenges and I don't think our children are going to live in a world without terrorism or our children's children I think that you know terrorism is going to be a factor for a long time to come and I don't you know I don't finally know given the proliferation of Terror uh how we're going to put breaks on it I mean you can think of it from two stand points right you can think one of it is you reduce the drive for it right so what are the factors that are contributing to terrorism what is the humiliation what is the disenfranchisement of the individuals who go on to to perpetrate these things so what are all those things what are the forces to reduce them at the other end of the spectrum right that's is the is the kind of offensive strategy which is how much better can our intelligence agencies be look every person who has run for president since since 911 has said look at the success we have not had another attack of this magnitude on us soil is there something to that is that is that I mean that yeah presumably that's not been through a lack of effort on the part of al-Qaeda or others correct well we always tend to look over our shoulder at what happened in the past and we have to keep in mind what's happening right now you know the terrorists proliferate they move around they adopt new ideologies is is a fluidity about this and we're going to see eruptions of Terror um some will be of small magnitude but you know I've just been writing about you know the massacre in in El Paso in 2019 um 23 mexican-americans killed this is the largest attack on Latinos in our history and um you know it wasn't

[03:15:48] Al-Qaeda but it was terrorism and uh you know it's that idea is so seated into our culture now that um you know things can you know no doubt things change over time you had school shootings you know for instance that's diminished but uh you know the whole mass shooting thing started here in Austin with the UT Tower shootings in 1966 so in a way it there was a wave that was created and emulators came along and uh and then you know currently it seems like uh school shootings have diminished as have drive by shooting so it it these memes get into our society and I I don't know how other than uh being displaced by a new meme you know that they get removed from the consciousness of people that want to do harm but I do think that we are doing a better job of containing terrorism and you know we're far more alert to it but

[03:17:02] I do think that we our intelligence agencies have to improve they the pandemic was a a catastrophic intelligence failure you know they this was a national security threat you know we've lost you know more than 600,000 Americans if a if a nation had attacked us and killed half a million of our citizens we you know we've been totally on a different track but we have to take new things into account and when we're talking about our Safety and Security it's not just terrorism you know Public

[03:17:38] Health the natural environment global warming all of these things you know we have real challenges ahead of us and so far to date we are not performing adequately to put them at rest I know I said that was my last question I guess I have one more in all of your research have you come to believe that these relatively small terrorist organizations would have the capacity to acquire and actually utilize nuclear weapons I think nuclear weapons are kind of hard you know they're when the Soviet

[03:18:17] Union collapsed you know there were a lot of loose nukes it was a and and and and Al-Qaeda tried to get hold of of a nuclear bomb and it turned out to be a fraud right but uh but they're they nuclear weapons tend to be beyond the capacity of the people that we've dealt with in the past that doesn't mean that there couldn't be people in the future who have that capacity and would be willing to you know but but you're more you would say biological weapons would be a far greater concern in terms of massive you know we're talking about on the scale of hundreds of thousands of lives or millions of lives and some toxins

[03:19:01] Anthrax is you know a good candidate um you know I think we have to be really really careful you know Anthrax has come out of you know our own fort Dietrich um so we have to be always CA I think you know we can't live our lives in fear all the time but you'd be nuts not to pay attention to the fact that there are dangers out there and there are people that want to cause harm and I think we have to as we it's the absence of unity in our community that threatens us the most now because we're not we're not together on this and uh you know there are there are people that would cheer on such uh actions and you know what kind of country Have We Become in that case I seem to keep coming to a real down conclusion I was about to say I you know I'm looking for a for for an optimistic way to to close this out and

[03:20:02] I I guess the only thing I would say is I hope that this week people can can basically pause for a moment and and sort of reflect on people who lost their lives people who made sacrifices as a result of that and if nothing else just to remember that I mean I I'm not sure that that there's something actionable I can do with that other than just be grateful um and and at the same time be sad so simultaneously I think experience these two extreme emotions you know I it occurs to me though that tragedies often have surprising surprisingly good consequences and you know or let's say benefits for society and you know if you look at at our recent history in this country uh with 198 flu um I would not say that we took advantage of that we tended to forget about it but then came the depression and in the middle of the depression we made ourselves into a different country stronger more compassionate more resilient we could do that and then you know World War II once again took a challenge uh and you know transformed our country and you know since then you know we had 911 and we invaded Iraq and tortured people in Guantanamo so a tragedy is an opportunity and do you think we squandered this one I thought we squandered 911 terribly um and it's it's the consequences of what we did to ourselves after 911 are greater than what was done to us unquestionably you know the invasion of Iraq the trillions of dollars we spend in Afghanistan you know just all of that you know inconsequential in terms of lives loss but you know we we made huge mistakes but we're capable we've shown ourselves to be capable of triumphing and you know we've got another opportunity now now and I hope that we take the lessons that 9/11 have given us in pandemic and try to make ourselves into that country that we want we once were and want to be again Lawrence thank you so much for making a lot of time to talk about this
