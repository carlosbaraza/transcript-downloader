## Transcript

[00:00:00] What I really enjoy about this type of discussion though, Sue, is one, it's the story of your career, but it's also the story of oncology. You are just a remarkable inspiration, period. As a physician, as a as a business leader, I have been a fan of yours for so long. People felt like you just needed to hit the cancer hard. You just needed to hit the cancer smart. Hard wasn't the point.

[00:00:23] A lot of people might not realize you're on the board of OpenAI and you're the only person in medicine on that board. I think using AI more and more on pieces of the clinical trials process so that if something takes time, it's because it's benefiting a human. The other thing is you and I both know if you have 500 patients in a trial and you look at safety, that's so limited. Why don't we follow safety in every patient on the

[00:00:52] Exactly. ongoing ongoing so I think the opportunities in clinical trials are massive do you think this is the most important thing that from a promise perspective that AI is has brought to medicine since so far yeah I do so far and and so what do you think would be the next mega unlock I define culture in a really specific way um that when you come to work you feel like the atmosphere the the surround sound brings out the best in you and that you have some ownership of tweaking it if it doesn't.

[00:01:28] Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Atia.

[00:01:37] Sue, thank you so much for making the trip um out to Austin. Um really really was excited to meet you last year. Um, and uh, you know, just an just an honor to spend part of a day with you and then realize that I could somehow twist your arm into coming on the podcast. I'm happy to be here. I look forward to it.

[00:01:55] You've had just an unbelievable career. You are an absolute giant in in many ways, but I I love to always kind of give people a sense of how someone got to where they got. So, if I recall, you grew up in Reno, is that right? I did. Yes. And you went to high school and college and even medical school. I went to to uh um I went to Catholic school for 12 years in Reno. That's uh I I explain that when people wonder if I was at a casino for my childhood and then I went to University of Nevada uh both to undergrad and to medical school. And then uh was it then that you ended up at

[00:02:30] UCSF for your residency? My dream, you know this with residencies, my dream residency was internal medicine at UCSF. uh my first pick and I got my first pick and went to UCSF as an internal medicine resident. And that would have been what year that you landed there? 1982. Okay. So, remind me where we were in the

[00:02:53] AIDS epidemic in San Francisco in ' 82. What was known? If you read MMWR, uh that's 1981 was the first uh um indication. In 1982, we knew um that there was uh something happening especially to gay men. Um but there was a sense it was homosexuals, hemophiliacs, and Haitians. remember that the three H's. And um it was there was so much mystery still involved that um uh I was and my colleagues were in a study to look at drawing our blood to see if we had been infected as a result of treating patients. And what were they presenting with at the time? Because again, this is it's hard for anyone of even my generation. You've never seen a drug naive patient, right? You don't like all of my experience with HIV which was a lot in in Baltimore many years later but but everyone was on something. So So how would these men present to you as a as a medicine resident? Pneumstus pneumocystus corini pneumonia was the number one diagnosis. So that's what you saw in the hospital that um brought patients to attention. But it it became increasingly tell folks why that's so unusual. Oh, it it was a a disease that imunosuppressed patients could get very rarely. Most clinicians had never seen it before. Um uh what had was also clear is that there were many other infections that were not as um as obvious or life-threatening as pneumysis was when we saw it right away. Um what was interesting from an outpatient perspective was um capsi saroma and tell folks what that is. Capsi saroma is a really um unusual purple colored tumor that's mo very visible um externally it caused nodules um in patients with HIV infection it also caused internal organ involvement and patients would have um they they would cough up blood or they would vomit blood um uh but what was really sad and difficult is the combination of cexia and capsiar coma meant that everybody knew you had AIDS.

[00:05:18] It was, you know, you sort of wore it. Um, and what was interesting for me was that this this old-fashioned capacity saroma was fundamentally different than what we were seeing. We also saw non-hodkkins lymphoma um in numbers much smaller than capsi saroma. Um, but capsi saroma was a very big problem in San

[00:05:40] Francisco. It was very um uh common in gay men. Um, and it was common in the population we saw. And was there ever a sense of fear among the medical staff that we don't know what this is, we don't know how it's transmitted, and therefore we don't know how to protect each other or ourselves or, you know, other patients for that matter. Like what was it like? It's it's hard for me to imagine that given how much we take for granted today. You know, I think it's probably a reflection of my own personality and my own wish to be a physician that my memories of those days are much more about sadness, about my patients and about people my age um uh dying or being pretty clear they were going to die. There was I mean a story that that brings it to life is many um patients started selling their life insurance because they were sure they wouldn't live long enough and they wanted the money now and then when the anti-retroviral therapy came along they wish they hadn't um which is a good thing to have. Um but I was just really sad. There were fears about um the residents and about contagion. But in

[00:06:50] San Francisco, there was such a wish to help the patients and such a good um spirit about playing a role in in helping that um we all persevered. But the the first patients I took care of in the hospital, I remember very well in 1982. We were gowned, gloved, masked, had a cap on. It was like we were going into an operating room. Yeah. Got it.

[00:07:14] So, it's You didn't know if you were I mean, for all intents and purposes, you were acting like this was Ebola without Absolutely. Um, and so you finished your residency in internal medicine. Did you go directly into your fellowship? I did a chief residency at uh at the university hospital and um I think that was the first uh that I knew I really liked managing. I really liked uh interacting with people and helping people succeed. Um so I did that for a year. Um and then went into my oncology fellowship uh after that year.

[00:07:49] And why did you pick oncology? Oh, I to this day I love oncology. I mean it just it is if you love medicine and I do and you love patients and I do it. It's the combination of um you get to call on your compassion gene and your nerdy science gene. And um when I was in Reno at the Reno VA, I had an attending um uh Steven Hall and he was the oncologist who was teaching me about medicine. third-year medical student and I loved everything about how he showed up. I loved his compassion. I loved his intellect. Um, and after that I had in in my mind this bug about I wanted to be like him. You know, I can really relate to that. I when I was in my third year of medical school, I went to the NCI for three months with Steve Rosenberg. Oh.

[00:08:52] And um it was the exact same experience. Um and and and I remember learning many lessons from Steve. One of them was that um cancer a cancer diagnosis and of course as the at the NCI as you know nobody's showing up with stage 1, two or three cancer. By definition every patient there is showing up with metastatic cancer and they've progressed through all standard treatments. So these are people that have six months to live and maybe 10% of them you you actually come up with a durable remission for. But he he said, "Look, you know, um uh you know, cancer will do one of two things to a family. It will take a strong family and bring them much closer together. It will take a fractured family and blow them wide apart. And so, you know, as a as a doctor, as a nurse, as in anybody in the field of oncology, your your ability to kind of be there for that family is as important, potentially more important than it is in any other specialty of medicine. Ah, that's really well said. I love that. Tell me a little bit about the state of oncology in the mid 80s when you're embarking on your medical oncology fellowship. Help people understand what the world of cancer looked like roughly 40 years ago.

[00:10:04] Let me talk about breast cancer. That's um uh a a cancer that is such a good example. The the common therapy that was used um cytoxin methtate 5FU were very old, decades old. Um there were no new chemotherapy drugs. Hadn't been in a while. Um the field was um uh stifled, I would say, in terms of of um medical oncology. there wasn't a lot going on. I was really interested in cancer epidemiology.

[00:10:38] Um that was something to me that um it asking the question why did people get cancer and couldn't we do something about it seemed really important to me and um I wanted in the second year of my fellowship to study um the relationship between hepatitis B and hepatellular carcinoma and to understand that better and to think about the viral link with cancer. um the mentor I was supposed to work with um ended up not coming to San

[00:11:10] Francisco and so I decided to go to Berkeley and get a master's in public health as a backup strategy. I really scrambled um because I didn't want to waste a year. What was the nature of the program? It was a three-year fellowship with a research track on the side because obviously UCSF is such an academic place. It's a very academic place but you could do two or three years and many people went into the lab.

[00:11:34] Um, I uh didn't want to go into the lab. I wanted to do epidemiology. Um, I wanted to learn more about statistics and epidemiology. I thought I wanted to do it um because I wanted to be a cancer epidemiologist. Uh, and to this day, I still think that is one of the great opportunities um to make a a big impact, but you have to be funded. So, I'm I'm a pragmatist. And so the good news was that all that learning at Berkeley and at UCSF in EPI and biostat I brought to drug development clinical trials um have a lot in common with doing epidemiology.

[00:12:18] You brought up the example of Hep and carcinoma. Was it understood at the time what we now know or how little it was. It was yeah the um Palmer Beasley one of the fathers of that relationship was the guy who was supposed to come and um so there were uh preliminary papers and something relatively early but it was emerging science. Do you recall what the incidence of hepi uh was and heepsi back then? And you know I don't um the if you weren't in Asia it was actually I think relatively low. Mhm. But I believe increasing which is partly why the vaccines are so important. Tell me about how you wound up in Uganda. After I got my uh masters in in uh public health, I became the oncologist at at uh UCSF in the university hospital um for the AIDS clinic. So all the patients, this is

[00:13:14] Moffett. This is Moffett. So the San Francisco General had a very well-known program run by oncologists for AIDS patients who were in the safety net hospital. Um but in the university hospital if you were very sick and you had capsy saroma you saw me um and my husband because we had just gotten married um who was an we were interns together he was in the lab in ID doing uh immunology work. M so um the uh two of the chiefs of medicine at UCSF were approached by the Rockefeller Foundation who had started to become worried about heterosexual transmission of HIV.

[00:13:55] Remember I talked about the Haitians and the the hemophiliacs and homosexuals. One H wasn't heterosexual. And so there was a lot of disbelief about African HIV. And in fact, some people thought it must be um uh gay sex, but people are too embarrassed to admit it. Um there were other theories, but um people just did not understand what was going on in

[00:14:19] Africa. And so the Rockefeller said, "We'll give you a grant at UCSF. We'll uh grant you money to study heterosexual transmission of HIV." And this was through an epidemiologic contact tracing lens, not necessarily going into the lab and trying to figure this out. not going to the lab but really looking at EP and and particularly there was a hypothesis that if it was heterosexually transmitted there was something to do with sexually transmitted diseases um and that there was something about increasing your risk if you had untreated STDs sexually transmitted diseases. So, um uh the we were asked to go um UCSF had no global health. Um just uh to put this into context, um we had a a flat and two Honda Civics. I still remember this that uh we gave my dad power of attorney, we sublat, and we sold our

[00:15:13] Hondas and moved to Uganda, which I'm I'm laughing in part because I had never been east of Chicago. I mean, This was this was a uh pretty dramatic thing to do. And it was only and I'm sorry, you, your husband, and who else? That's it. That's the team. That's the team. That's the dream team. That's the team. That's the team. And and Uganda was a place where on the positive side of things, the NCI had set up a collaboration with Uganda Cancer

[00:15:44] Institute where they did some really great things in lymphoma and um Burkett's lymphoma, if you remember those stories. and um and one of the physicians at UCSF had been associated with that um John Ziegler. So there was a connection to the Uganda Cancer Institute um and so on the good side of things there was that and there also was and is the antebi viral institute. So there was some infrastructure there.

[00:16:10] Unfortunately most of that in infrastructure had been ruined by the Idiamin uh regime not long before we went to Uganda. So when we went there, it was pretty lawless. Um there were uh uh roadblocks you had to stop at. It was um it was difficult to live there. Um it was really tough. And what about safety?

[00:16:31] It was um I would say now that I'm used to being in more safe situations and older and wiser, it was probably not that smart the way we live there. Um uh but we weren't we weren't um uh reckless, but it was um it it seemed dangerous like when you were in the car to have a carjacking or your money go missing or things like that. Um was

[00:17:00] Idamn still ruler? Idiu was gone, but when we were there he made that attempt to come back from Saudi Arabia and go back to Uganda, but it was thwarted. So um so that was good news. Uh so Nick, my husband, uh reestablished the sexually transmitted disease clinic and attended in the internal medicine ward. Um and I like to say I doubled the population of oncologists in Uganda when I was there.

[00:17:28] So um my colleague Edward Ambidi who's Ugandan um put all his focus on the pediatric unit um and I put all my focus on the adult unit which was so many cases of capsy saroma. It was give me a sense of what this meant. So we're talking late 80s now. We're this is 89 90 and 91. So where we're remind me is ACT out yet?

[00:17:54] Not yet. Okay. Just on the brink. Okay. So we have nothing and what is the approximate uh conversion? So for a patient who develops AIDS, what fraction of those will go on to develop KS? If you were in Uganda at the time, um gosh, especially amongst males, but also males and females. It's so hard to give those numbers, but

[00:18:22] I would say about a third of the one uh patients who who sought medical attention probably had chaos, some chaos. And what was the prevalence of HIV AIDS in the population in Uganda? Depend on the population you treated, um it was double digits in the country as a whole. Wow. If you were 16 years old, if you were a 16-year-old girl and you went to the STD clinic, you had a 50% chance of being HIV positive. 16. And most of those girls was their first and only sexual partner. So what that meant is it was Russian roulette to have sex in

[00:18:58] Uganda then. I mean worse than Russian roulette's one in six if you've only got one bullet in the chamber. This is you got the bullet in one of the two chambers. Yeah. Yeah. And the best business in town coffin maker. Like we would go we would drive back to where we stayed and you would see if you've ever been in an African village like they'll prop up the coffins made of wood and you just see them because that was that was what was done. It was you know the feeling of being scared and sad in San

[00:19:29] Francisco in 1982. Multiply that by a thousand in 1989. It was terrifying. If we hadn't gotten ARVs, this was killing people. But you know, the same time the first time we went back to um San Francisco from Uganda was 6 months after we had left. I went back to the capacity saroma clinic that that I had um uh led and said to the nurse, "Oh, you know, you ask about your patients. I had so many great um guys who I cared for. All my patients were dead. all of them six months. So the the sense of how bad HIV was before anti-retrovirals, it's impossible to overstate it, just impossible. Um and when we were in

[00:20:22] Uganda, there was it was really clear that you could see someone's immune status with a good physical exam if they had capacity saroma. I wrote a paper that I think is a is a good paper if you do global health and you have limited resources. It was a paper that had one observation. If you had capacity saroma on your soft pallet in on the roof of your mouth, you had HIV. 100% protective. It it doesn't capsy saroma. There's a Mediterranean form and an African form. It happens on your skin. It can cause elephantiasis but it doesn't go in and you know the mouth is just a a surrogate for your GI tract.

[00:21:06] Doesn't happen unless you're imunosuppressed with and to be clear these patients weren't necessarily dying from the KS directly. It was that's a that's a proxy for how weak their immune system was. I assume they were ultimately dying from a pneumonia. Many would die from pneumonia. there was was severe cexia and then they were prone to pneumonia and other problems. But capacy saroma in the lungs or the stomach can also cause um bleeding and you can die from that. And again what did you know at this point in time about HIV because the virus had been identified by this point. Um what was what was known and what was unknown? So we knew um we knew most of the clinical syndromes associated with HIV. This was Gallo. Was it Gallow who um uh yeah Bob Gallow was one of the Mier was you know they had a fight over who who who deserved the credit. Um but yeah, we knew about HIV then um and and we knew the biology and we knew as soon as we got to Uganda and examined patients that this was heterosexual transmission of HIV. Um and we knew that untreated uh STDs were a big reason um and that was a very important thing. Is the reason going back to these 16-year-old girls is the reason that the sexual heterosexual transmission was so high because the viral loads were through the roof because today if if if a person had if a male with HIV had unprotected sex with a female it would not be that high would it? It wouldn't be that high. No. So the the one of the really important aspects of

[00:22:53] STDs is the high frequency of herpes and shankoid really open lesions that are very very if not if not it's one two punch super high viral load high viral load and transmissible. Yes. Yes. So we knew all of that. Now we also knew that some of these uh were treatable that um both uh medication also um Musevanany the the still leader of Uganda um had this very funny campaign called zero grazing.

[00:23:32] So they they do a raise a lot of cows and this is very important in uh Uganda is is having a herd of cows. It means you're a an important man. You know, Musevio wears this hat like he's raising cows. So, zero grazing. The farmers and many people knew what that meant. One wife, one partner, you know, no grazing.

[00:23:51] And so, there was a pretty good uh public campaign. We did a lot of condom distribution. And so, the government was receptive to this. Yeah. They understood the science. They understood the epidemiology. And they were completely on board with the campaign. They were very on board there. They also knew that this was going to be a geopolitical problem for them if if people were dying in the prime of their lives at the rates they were. They they got that. This this was really clear to them. What other countries in Africa were afflicted to this extent? In East Africa, there was quite a bit. There was a there was a lot of HIV in Kenya and there were programs like the one that we had in Kenya, uh

[00:24:31] Tanzania. Um there were others where it was more unknown. um I think uh not talked about but the um I mean the program I know about uh most today is the program my husband's been working with for 15 years which is Elizabeth Glazer Pediatric AIDS Foundation. They work now I think in 12 countries in subsaharan Africa and many of the the southernmost countries are heavily affected by HIV still. Can you estimate in a year how many people died from AIDS in Uganda when you were there? Oh, no. I can't estimate it. I guess the point is it's a staggering number. Yeah. And it's and and yet there were so few of you that were on the front lines. If there's 16 million people, it wouldn't have surprised me if there were a million people who died. I mean, it's that kind of numbers. The um I'm probably exaggerating, but not by much. And and I think that the the sense of feeling overwhelmed um is just really important. Um what I realized I was doing um I don't know if you've interacted with people in the military u much but you know they if they were on the battlefield they triage. I triaged the they I triaged in

[00:25:47] San Francisco. Um if you didn't need chemotherapy but you had capsy saroma I didn't see you like I only saw patients um uh the simple one was vin christristine vin christristine is actually re reasonably good against uh ks um I used it in Uganda a lot it does cause some neuropathy but um if you if you're careful about how much and then bleomy again you have to be careful because of the pulmonary toxicity but old good oldfashioned vin christristine and bleo and um texl tel was approved uh for capsy saroma um after I left Uganda it wasn't a drug um before then but yeah no I would I would see the patient and I would literally ask them and their family can you walk if you can walk if yes you're too healthy for me you're too healthy we'll delay there was triage because I only had on the shelf a certain amount of of chemotherapy how did you manage the personal toll of the the grief and the death of of seeing this because I I mean look I think every doctor to some extent goes through this um where you you you try to sort of compartmentalize what you're seeing. Um but the truth of the matter is virtually no doctor can really comprehend what you were describing there and and how how did you process that? I have this philosophy which I I don't recommend it for others. It's just my philosophy. I love um people. I love interacting with people. I love getting to know the patients who I care for and it makes me happy to think I'm helping.

[00:27:26] Helping might be helping them get better. Helping might be helping with their pain or they can talk about dying with me because it doesn't make me scared. Um so I get a lot of joy in trying to contribute. Um and even if I feel overwhelmed and if I step back and think how can how can we cope with this um my coping is more is leaning in.

[00:27:51] Yeah. Yeah. Just and and does does your husband share that? Do you do you I mean do was there a yin and a yang to the relationship where you supported each other in a way that that that was helpful in that? Because again, I I I I do understand what you're saying and I appreciate that there is uh that there is an that there is a joy that comes from helping people, but I but I can I can also at least personally say that there are moments when it breaks down and you feel so overwhelmed by sadness.

[00:28:18] Yeah. No, I think the Well, first of all, my my husband is more introverted um and probably gets more sad um but we are also a good team because we are there for each other. And I think it's it's a special thing um done in small amounts, not too much to be able to come home and say, "Boy, that was tough.

[00:28:43] Here's what I dealt with today or can you I need to tell this story or I want to talk about this." Um the other thing we did which is I think so important is because I I I do drive a lot of joy in trying to help. Um but I'm not a martyr. I don't believe in it, you know, like, okay, you worked hard, I worked harder.

[00:29:03] You suffered, I suffered more. I hate that, you know. So, we went we went to Greece. We still laugh about going to Greece and eating our way through Greece for a week when we were in Uganda. And uh we had a couple of other good trips. threw in on a a hilarious safari to a um a place that was Moya Lodge that had been closed to all tourists and was had just reopened and uh it was so great. We saw hippos and elephants and we realized we were the only what you call in Uganda a mazongu which is a white person there.

[00:29:41] So it was it was a grand adventure. So we had some grand adventures and played tennis, enjoyed friends. So we we did um as much to keep our spirits up as one can. And so you came back to the US after about three years. Uhhuh. And did you go back to UCSF? Well, we wanted to go back to UCSF, but we had not um uh uh kept our academic careers going as much as we should have. Um we didn't publish enough and they didn't have a global health program or money for us. taking care of a million people with HIV wasn't wasn't enough to justify coming back to

[00:30:19] UCSF. It actually wasn't. Uh so we said, well, gee, you know, when the chief of medicine outlined for us the plan for us to stay, a large part of it was taking care of patients to pay our way. Yeah. So we said, boy, taking care of patients, we know what that looks like. So we went into private practice in San

[00:30:37] Francisco. No, we moved back to Kentucky where Nick is from. Okay. So, we moved back to Kentucky and um I was uh in a twoperson oncology practice with a former classmate of NYX uh in Lexington. You were doing at this point oncology unrelated to not necessarily focusing on HIV and AIDS related cancer, breast cancer. I I was doing good old-fashioned

[00:31:02] American oncology. Okay. Yeah. And I hadn't um I didn't take my oncology boards when we went to Uganda because I was in Uganda. So um I still sort of laugh about taking the uh Dvita oncology book with a yellow Sharpie. And I reread uh the big oncology book twice. Is this the Devita Helman Rosenberg book? Yeah, of course. Yeah, it's brown these days.

[00:31:30] I think it's uh and I reread it twice and to took my boards and and did fine. So, I was ready. This is unbelievable. So, you're sitting in in Kentucky practicing garden variety oncology and and then you So, so talk to me about what that's like. Is that that just must seem I mean that's completely orthogonal to what you've been doing for the past couple of years. So, so so so different.

[00:31:58] And um I think the good news was that um and and Nick was in a practice where he was more like a hospitalist. You know, they somebody get a fever in the ICU and they'd call that ID group. Um and uh and my practice was a two-person practice. It was very classy. I saw a lot of lung cancer. It was Kentucky, you know, so there's a lot of smoking, a lot of people from Appalachian. Um uh the I actually like taking care of patients.

[00:32:28] So that part I liked but I really missed the kind of intellectual research um collegial stuff uh that I was used to at UCSF because we had been there nine years by that time you know because we were still UCSF faculty when we were in Uganda. Um so Nick was called about um Brislmmy Squib search for an expert on HIV because they were trying to follow ACT with uh the next anti-retroviral. I think it was DDI and

[00:33:05] D4T were both in development then. And so they recruited Nick to come and work at Bristol Squib out of private practice. And Nick said, um, I won't come unless you have a job for my wife. And they said, no, we have a nepotism clause. We don't allow couples to work at Bristol Myers Squip. So he said, fine, I won't come. He's a good husband. This is this is one of our favorite stories because it's a true story. So So they called him back and they said, "We really really uh want you to come because we want this program to do well." And um could your wife be a consultant? well, would she agree to be a consultant and not a full-time employee? And he said, "Yeah, that'll work." So, we moved to

[00:33:50] Connecticut and um he had a a job and I was the trailing spouse. And I can just see what this looked like. I'm making this up now. Yeah. Oh god. We've got a an LMD. You know what an LMD is, right? We got this lady from Lexington, Kentucky. She's in private practice oncology and we're stuck with her. Um, let's have her do drug safety on taxol because you know we have this new drug and it's really busy. It looks like it might work and so we'll put her on drug safety. She can't hurt anything doing that. So, but but I mean it's Did they not understand what you had spent the last couple of years doing prior to being in Kentucky? Did they not know what you had done in Uganda?

[00:34:36] So they I don't think that registered because there were so many people there who were very um traditionally trained at NCI or at Yale or you know wherever they were and they were traditionally ch trained in oncology. You know my experience in Kala in Uganda didn't make an impact. But here's what was funny.

[00:35:00] Nick and I didn't have a statistician. You know as I told you we just the two of us went. So, we brought this a little compact computer and all the SAS manuals and you know it's we we didn't have a TV, we didn't have newspapers, we didn't have anything. So, we taught ourselves how to do SAS programming. And it's when when I got to Bristol Myers Squib, one of the really interesting things about taxol is it causes severe neutropenia, but it's short. It's like this short severe neutropenia. And so I wanted to study that because I thought it was really important and why people weren't really getting maybe let's take a moment. I I always have to remind myself tell people what taxol is, how it works and even just just give them a quick what what is neutropenia? Why would we care? So taxel is when I talked before about how few new chemo drugs there were. Taxel was one of the first new chemotherapy drugs. So taxel is a product of the utri and it's a microtubule poison. Um it is if you think about it coming from the utri and you think about sap think about trying to dissolve sap in water and give that to a patient that's plenty hard. So the the dissolving fluid that's given with taxol um and the reason we would give somebody with cancer a microtubule inhibitor is because that prevents cells that are dividing. You can't divide they they can't they need these microtubules when they create new cells and we want to block that and and we want to block that. So this was not just a good way to block uh cellular division which is so important in cancer therapy. It's it's really important because it's very different than some of the old chemotherapy drugs and if you're resistant to those old drugs here you have a brand new mechanism of action. So that's a terrific thing but it it's it's not easy to dissolve it. So the dissolving agents are like soap. they dissolve the the uh taxol and when the national cancer institute tried to use it some patients got severe allergic reactions from that and they got scared and put it on the shelf. So Bristol

[00:37:13] Myers Squib went to the National Cancer Institute and said you know that drug might really be active. we're willing to carefully go back in the clinic and test it and give people uh agents to to counterbalance the allergic reactions and see if we can get away with it. So they did that and they got an approval in ovarian cancer, a brand new agent. Um now taxol was really exciting because first ovarian and then breast cancer were these indications where we had not had new drugs or really any drugs that were active in the case of ovarian for a long time. Um and I because I was the safety person I was really trying to understand and put into context all these safety issues so it was possible to safely treat um patients with these drugs. And when I went to the statistician, so it had it had already been approved. It had been approved for ovarian cancer when I showed up. So now you're doing postmarketing surveillance on safety doing postmarket surveillance on ovarian and putting together a US submission and a European submission for breast.

[00:38:21] Um so I started talking to the statistitians there about how I wanted them to program to get the data we needed for the safety label. And I'll never forget the guy looking at me and saying, "Do you know how to do this?" And I said, "Well, I had to learn in Uganda because I didn't have somebody like you, you know." So, it was sort of funny that that I was very happy to prove myself.

[00:38:46] It didn't bug me. It It I It made me more feisty. Like, I'll show you. I'm I'm not uh I'm I'm not underdosed in the kinds of things you need to do in this place. And by the way, I loved every minute of being at Brislquib. They were pros at cancer drug development. They were pros at monitoring safety and I thought it was so much fun because you got to make drugs. What was the pharma landscape like in the early 90s? So you had Bristol Meyer, you had

[00:39:20] Fizer, you had Merc, you had Merc, you you had um uh Novartis. I think Noardis was a combo of a couple. The the it it was smaller, much smaller. And cancer was bristlar squib. I mean they had made cis platinum, carbo platinum, they had a lot of those drugs and they the the people who had made those drugs were still there and I was really happy to learn from them. I I felt uh um very lucky to get to be around these folks who knew about taxol. So we got tax approved in um the US and in Europe for breast cancer. It became uh Bristol

[00:40:00] Squib's number one drug and I became the project team leader for Texol. How long did it take them to thank your husband for forcing them to bring you along? Too long. It it was uh he he he uh um he really enjoys that story because he he he you know like all good family stories it it gets embellished over the years and he tells the story like that that that uh he told him you should actually want her you don't know this but you he's a good husband but we uh we learned a lot. Well, it is. I mean, when you when you pause at where we are in this story, to think of everything that would come from this moment forward and to realize there's a scenario under which nobody knows everything that's about to happen and you're a you're an oncologist in Kentucky right now. That's right.

[00:40:55] That's right. I'd be better at tennis. Yeah. I had more I had more free time. But yeah, no, I think that's the the thing that I love to mentor. I think it's really uh underrated to to listen to students and hear what's on their minds and I remind students about the role of serendipity and I think I'm a poster child for the role of serendipity.

[00:41:20] So you left Bristol Myers Squib in 95 95 and you went to Janentech. Tell me where Janentech was in its life cycle then. And so Janentech had been around for a while, but I mean when did Genentech get founded? In the mid70s. 1976. Okay. Give give folks a little bit of a history of Genentech. Genent's a storyried company, but also a different company in that it was founded on a new technology. Yeah. Genent's a really interesting um company because it claims to be the first biotech company. There's some cedus uh back and forth about that, but it was based on genetic technology.

[00:42:00] That's where the Genentech name came from. And what Herb and Bob, the co-founders of Genentech, wanted to do is kind of do a proof of concept um uh that you could use genetic technology and make medicines, make big medicines, proteins, antibodies, medicines that would almost certainly have to be injected rather than swallowed because they're large um and they're uh protein so you break them down if you swallow them. But their initial goals were focused on insulin which they outlicensed to

[00:42:34] Lily and Fizer um and growth hormone, human growth hormone. So before Janentech, uh when you were a parent and your child was short, you needed to give that child um growth hormone that came from cadaavvers and that had a risk of uh this slow virus disease and that was the um uh not a good trade-off for for parents. So the concept of having recombinant of having humanlike growth hormone was a really wonderful thing.

[00:43:08] So, Genentech's first drug was human growth hormone and the um it was a tour to force. It was really amazing that um uh in the late 70s they were able to to do this fermentation and purification because they had to prove to FDA it was pure human growth hormone with no contaminants. Um and it became famous for that and and people were excited and thought this was cool. tell people kind of briefly how this worked. What was recombinant DNA technology? How what were they putting the gene into? How did they get the gene to make the protein?

[00:43:46] Like it's such a we take this all for granted today because we have it's tricky. Yeah. Yeah. But but it's it's so incredible. So what you what you see if you go to Janantech or a company like Janentech is you see these tanks and the tanks are like a cell ICU, you know, like an ICU for a cell. So the the cell is the you you what you're doing is you're teaching the cell to make at very high amounts growth hormone, way higher than your cells or my cells would. Very high. And then you're teaching the cell through this genetic engineering to secrete it into a medium into this soup that is really a lot of growth hormone.

[00:44:32] And then you're taking away the cells after they secrete it. You're purifying that growth hormone and you put it in little vials. And that's the process of biotechnology. And you can trick a cell into making almost anything you want. not completely but almost anything you want and make it very much like human which is neat. So you don't have to go to a human to donate you growth hormone because or in the case of insulin I mean they were using insulin from pigs and insulin that made allergies and expensive. So human insulin really changed how you thought about treating uh people who have um uh diabetes. So,

[00:45:14] Janentech made growth hormone and and Janentech sold growth hormone and set up something I actually think is a really neat thing that Janentech uh did which people said, "How do you know that by giving uh kids extra growth hormone, it won't cause leukemia or, you know, a fourth arm to sprout out or so, you know, weird things to happen." And

[00:45:34] Genetics said, "Well, we'll follow every child." So they set up a patient registry, one of the first patient registries ever, and followed every child until they reached their final adult height and the physicians and their staff entered this into a computer. And so this is an amazing amount of information. So if the FDA ever asked us, do you have this with growth hormone? Do you have that with growth hormone, we had not an example, not like you, you wouldn't even do statistics on it. every child ever treated with Genetics growth hormone. Do you have a sense of how many kids that was over the Oh, hundreds of kids, thousands of kids by now. Yeah. Yeah.

[00:46:14] And um so Ganentech got really good at that. And in fact, when I went to Janentech in 1995, the chief medical officer of Ganentech was a pediatric endocrinologist, an expert on short stature and and growth hormone. But it's a pretty small market. This is, you know, uncommon. So, Janentech decided that they uh um they would get but by this point it was being used rampantly in sports. Yeah. And the FDA was not happy about that and and pushed really hard on on Janentech to um to control that use. Was it being used by this point also pretty heavily in HIV? Right.

[00:46:52] People were using it in HIV. They were using it in sports. Anything where you wanted to, you know, have more muscle mass. Um that's exactly right. Genche had done some studies to look at whether that was a good idea and none of the studies came out um successful. Meaning there was no benefit to an HIV patient being on growth hormone. Benefits did not outweigh risks of like having increased blood sugar and some other things that would happen. Yeah. Um, so, so one of the aspects of Genentech that happened in the early years before I was there is they learned how to make enzymes. Same genetic technology telling the cell make these enzymes and some of the enzymes actually got outlicicensed to make um commercial enzymes like that you use when you wash clothes and things like that. Um so that wasn't core to

[00:47:43] Janentech but um they had an enzyme uh activator that could break down blood clots. Did they go after that knowing what they were doing or was this a bit of a fishing expedition where they realized in the process of trying to do many things that oh my god we can actually make tpa which you'll you're going to explain in a minute why that changed the game of cardiovascular medicine. It was intentional. They had a really great um there's a a clinician uh researcher Dave Stump who is a clotting expert. Uh he's he's he monk on the hem side and so he was there and really pushed them to do this. Um and uh the the concept was that if you could break down the blood clot, you could cure the heart attack. You you could save lives.

[00:48:37] And um the the interesting thing if you are interested in doing trials is they started the concept of a large simple trial. This was early on and people people in cardiovascular Gene Brunwald and his uh his followers had started these large simple trials. So Janeta kind of bet the farm on this TPA and the farm was that they could change the outcomes in 30 days. there'd be more people alive than dead if they were treated with activ. Um, and two of the people involved in the studies, you probably know their names, were Rob

[00:49:14] Caleiff and Eric Toppel. They And where was Eric at Scripps at that time or where was he? He was at the I think he was at the Cleveland Clinic. And they ran a group called the Timmy group and they did all these studies named Timmy. Um, and so they did this big trial and it worked that if you treated with Activase, you could break down uh the blood clots. So,

[00:49:38] Genentech started this franchise in in cardiovascular and again did this really interesting patient registry to look at 30-day outcomes for postmarketing. Um, but stances came along and so the franchise of Janentech and people who were treated with TPA really went down. Um, and the stroke indication was tricky. You have to be there. You had to ensure it wasn't hemorrhagic or you could make things so much worse. And so the stroke indication on paper was really cool, but pragmatically was really tough for hospitals to to execute. Genetic also made another enzyme like molecule DNA pulyme for cystic fibrosis. Um, and that was approved very tiny. um you know it decreases how thick your your secretions are. Um but with Vertex's uh um CF drugs it's also been scooped. So the um when I came in 95, genetic was really struggling. Um they had those three drugs. They had growth hormone, tpa, and uh pulyme, and they needed to show people. Why did they out license insulin? I think they needed the money. Got it. I don't think they have the scope to even make it. And why did you decide to leave? So you've got

[00:51:01] Bristol Myers Squib is just crushing it. You finally earned the respect you deserve. You've got this struggling company, Janentech. Was it the opportunity? Oh, yeah. Yeah. For for sure it was the opportunity. I will tell you if you were me in 1995 sitting down with Art Levenson and he was the head of research then and he was talking about the future and oncology and what the plans were.

[00:51:29] You'd have gone too. You'd gone to it. it for sure it was an opportunity. Um we were doing well. I I will say that um further down on the list of pros and cons was uh west coast is home. I mean Connecticut was kind of snowy and cold. I didn't come over on the Mayflower, it turns out, but I mean I loved people at

[00:51:54] Bristol Myers Squib. I loved the job. Um uh and back to San Francisco. In San Francisco. Yeah. Yeah. So that that was a big deal. But I believed art when he said we're going to be a cancer company. So what was the first thing you worked on? Uh thrombopotin. I they hired me to work on thrombopetin. Interesting. It was going to be the third leg of the stool. Uh EPO so for make your red cells go up. Uh

[00:52:25] Nupagen for your white cells and uh TPO for your platelets. And it was a big race. Amjen was in the race. Who developed EPO? EPO's. Uh, Amjen. Amjen. Okay. Yeah. EPO and Nigen. Got it. Okay. Yeah. So, they were the And you know, Amjen and Janentech had always been kind of uh rivals. And uh when when they cloned um thrombopatin at Janentech, like everybody know, you know, I read the paper and then they called me did I want to come work on it. It was that kind of thing. Yep. And when you clone it, does that if you publish it, that doesn't give you the right to I mean it's a race for everybody. So let me ask a silly question. Why do you publish the results of the cloning before you've gone and made the recombinant protein yourself?

[00:53:15] So you patent it. Yep. Then you publish. Then you uh make the recombinant. Okay. So once it's published after the patent, you get to make it. Got it. Okay. and Janentech, one of their their um great assets started by her Boyer is they publish. They don't stop the scientists from publishing. They get the lawyers in there quick and they make sure that they protect the IP of the company, but they want people to publish. Very academic. Uh so thrombopolitans um uh EPO and Nupagen are as if you design them to to make recominant forms and give them for cancer patients or other patients who need them. Uh thrombopoin not so much. It it it's it's a just to make it simple. If you said, "Okay, your platelets are going way down from your chemotherapy and I'm going to give you thrombopetin to make them go up." They they um come back up really late and they go too high. So yeah. So

[00:54:21] I'm making you at risk for a blood clot by giving you a million platelets, but later than you need to, and you're recovering on your own already. So the and was that known only once you started developing and you understood the kinetics of it once we looked at how it worked in patients? We we knew better than we had before. Um the the kinetics of really recovering from not all chemotherapy as you know causes your platelets to go low. Yeah. So you can't give it prophylactically because you don't know who's going to get thrombocytoenia. Right. Right. And this tricky thing about going too high if you're wrong it's not um and and it's a problem. What do you do? You plasma the patients if it's if you've overshot if you well or or not plasma platelet you could platelet them I mean there are remedies but um you don't want to do that it's so anyway so thrombopolitan proved to be very very difficult drug um and I learned a lot about uh well actually I learned a lot about the uh cancer equivalent or the uh product development equivalent of tulip mania. When everybody's so excited, you get excited, too. And it's like, oh, so

[00:55:35] I I did learn a lot. Um, and uh, and I I've often reflected on what might happen that I'm not thinking about now. But what also happened is that the the labs at Janentech had been working on herptin on tresstuzumab for a while. And um Art became the CEO. Art Levenson became the CEO in '95. And he wanted to push on on having

[00:56:05] Tresstuzumab her septin get into the clinic. And um tell folks how that drug worked and what what it was for it. it the so tresstuzumab or I'll call it herceptin because it's less of a mouthful is a an antibbody like you and I have antibodies that fight disease in our bodies and it's an antibbody that um targets this protein called her two and her two matters because about one in four women with breast cancer have too much of it and when you have too much of

[00:56:42] I if you've if you've got too much her too from the time you're diagnosed your median average survival is three years. If you don't have too much of it it's seven years. So you know what matters. So the concept with this antibbody is turn that off. Whatever bad thing that drives it down to three years turn that off and go back to seven years. It's pretty simple concept. And what why do you mechanistically do you think that the overexpression of her two was impeding immune clearance and by putting an antibbody to it you would exacerbate like what was the what was the thesis at the time for why overexpression of her two was cutting life expectancy down.

[00:57:22] The thesis was that it was telling the cell to grow that it was giving a growth signal to the nucleus to say grow more and if you could shut that off you'd grow less. Really simple. Now later we armed her septum. We put a a payload on it. So then you could say both changed the grow more signal and you've got a little bomb on there.

[00:57:47] So so you do get a twofer. In fact another company has one uh Astroenica that's so powerful with a bystander effect you don't even have to have overexpression. So, so, so that um antibbody was um I'm talking about it now because anybody in breast cancer knows about her too, of course. Yeah. You see it on TV and direct to consumers. Yeah. But I think and what I what I really enjoy about this type of discussion though, Sue, is um one, it's the story of your career, but it's also the story of oncology. It is. It's the story of modern oncology.

[00:58:22] So, so you're one of the few people whose careers takes us through the walk of modern oncology. And I mention that because it seems impossible. There was a lot of people at Janentech who were negative about herptin. Did not think we should invest. The dogma was that antibodies were all hype and that they'd been overpromised as smart bombs, smart missiles, Time magazine, all of this, but that they had flopped. What was the biggest failure at that point commercially?

[00:59:00] I don't think the things had even been commercialized. I don't think they had gotten out of the clinic that that people just weren't seeing benefit. Um and and so the the people and I have a very good friend who's an oncologist and um he said you know you just can't treat a solid tumor you know a solid tumor versus leukemia or lymphoma with an antibbody you need something more powerful and remember what was happening at the same time is if you if you want to talk about the history of oncology the amazing thing is being at ASCO, the

[00:59:38] American Society of Clinical Oncology, and two different rooms. One room we hear that her septin is going to change forever how we think about antibodies in breast cancer. It like way better than we thought, improved survival. the other room doing bone marrow transplant for breast cancer and having the South African group who who published a paper saying it worked retract the paper and go through and talk about how much of it was fraudulent fraud fraud fraud. So at the same time this nearly toxic, nearly you know lethal bone marrow transplant for breast cancer was debunked at the same time as we said at what we call now a naked antibbody. No payload, no chemo. You give her septin, you're going to help that patient with breast cancer. Just an antibbody like welcome to modern oncology. It was it could not have been more clear. I almost forgot the BMT stuff. It's so archaic and and it it was it was a um distraction because people felt like you just needed to hit the cancer hard. You just needed to hit the cancer smart.

[01:00:55] Hard wasn't the point. So where does I mean we've got to be getting close to avasten now too, right? Yes. So we um but but don't forget retan. So when I said people didn't believe in in you could you could treat a solid tumor, they thought you could treat lymphoma because we did. So antibodies were so um disliked. People did not believe in antibodies that in 9596 IDC was going to run out of money.

[01:01:29] So, IDK had made an antibbody to CD20, a very important marker on on all uh lymphas and they were going to run out of money. So some of our business development folks talked to them about uh Janentech doing a deal with them on Retoxam and that you know I think uh it is impossible to overstate how important retoxin is in lymphoma. You I often think when I'm in product development of patients I've cared for. I had this great 83 year old pharmacist who I when

[01:02:09] I was in practice and he had uh a lymphoma that was low grade. It wasn't really, you know, he was a little tired. He was fine. And so we did watch and wait. My not favorite strategy of oncology. Let's watch and wait as you dwindle. He'd be a perfect candidate for Retoxen. Just like perfect. Four doses.

[01:02:32] You can repeat it. It's and it just in fact it works so well. Here's when I change my mind on antibodies. Somebody runs in my office and said, "Oh, we have a case of tumorlyis syndrome." So tumorlyis syndrome being somebody got retoxan. They had a lot of lymphoma and the cells are breaking down so fast their kidneys can't keep up and they have to be dialized. Oh, that's only an antibbody. no chemo, no no payload, nothing. That's when you know you've got a good drug.

[01:03:06] And how many cells in the body, how many types of cells in the body express CD20? Um, it's mainly a B cell. Uh, but it's not as specific as CD19, is it? I think 19 and 20 are CD both uh B cells. I'd have to look at I know CD19 is on the B cell, but I don't I didn't know the uh Okay. And um and this is we were talking about this earlier. This is chimeriic.

[01:03:28] It's chimeriic. Yeah. Yeah. So tell folks what that implies because that's another wrinkle in the story. Well, that's the other thing that I think is you know there's so many dogmas that we believe until data proves us uh otherwise. So one of the warts of of retox was thought that it was a chimera that we would it had too many mouse parts to human parts and that we would cause um uh human anti-chimeriic antibbody hacka um and FDA was very concerned about this. So we measured and measured and measured and it it uh turned out probably because the patients had lymphoma that they didn't get hacka. They very tiny numbers and they not clinically relevant and you can treat them a lot. Yeah. I mean you can treat patients over and over again.

[01:04:13] Herceptin's 93% human. So not a chimera but not fully humanized. Um, and none of the patients treated with antibodies that I've seen, uh, not with genentic or IDC antibodies have really had problems. They've had other problems based on target related problems, not based on the antibbody. And the CD20 antibbody was just also a straight naked antibbody. Straight naked antibbody targeted for an immune destruction. It's targeted to destroy the CD20 positive cells. But it turns out that if you have lymphoma, you've got a reserve in your marrow of other CD20 cells of more um immature that grow up and replace. So it's not like you're really um at a huge risk for um untored reactions from your

[01:04:58] CD20. And why do those patients with marrow that's still producing CD20 positive cells not go on in a constant state of lymphoma requiring? In other words, why is it that you can treat this and create a durable remission? I can guess. I don't know if if anyone's done a formal study. I do think at some point in uh oncology treatment if you have a tiny amount of disease left, especially something like lymphoma, you may take care of it yourself. So, it's just getting rid of enough of the diseased B cells till you immune till you get the load down your load low enough that the immune system can wipe out the clone.

[01:05:36] And honestly, if it comes back, that's the other thing that I find really interesting about antibodies. The dogma with chemotherapy, if you are on taxol and your tumor comes back, I wouldn't give you taxol again, right? If you're on her septin or rettoxin and your tumor comes back, in a heartbeat, I'd give it to you again. Yeah. Yeah. It I mean, it's it's a very different thing than chemotherapy. What was the price of these drugs at the time they came out?

[01:06:00] Was were these the first chemotherapeutic agents or they're you know you kind of want to distinguish them from traditional chemo but were these the first oncology drugs that came with big price tags? probably they were that um I think taxol kind of went to that next level and then they went the further level compared to today's prices um low but rettoxin I think uh more than herptin because it's used people started using it more like you use four times or eight times and recurring um the rettoxin uh sales went very high very fast and about this time.

[01:06:44] Um, we get um the whole anti veg story, right? Yeah. Yeah, that was so Judah Folkman over at Boston He's at Boston Children's. Boston Children's. Yeah. Yeah. I never had the chance to meet him. Oh, you didn't meet him? I've never met Judah. Uh, he he wrote a fantastic book that I read in medical school. Uh, poured over the book. I'm blanking on the name of it. Do you remember the book? It was his I mean, it was his story. Yeah, I remember. Again, a beautiful story. Um, I'm smiling because

[01:07:11] I had a word for for uh Judah Folkman talks which I heard many of. He was a phenomenologist. He would say, you know, I this patient had this, so it must mean that he he just like connected dots all the time. He was an amazing um I mean, some of it made no sense to me, but some of it was like, "Wow, I wish I thought of that."

[01:07:33] He was just a really uh fun person to listen to. So he he um I used to tell this story so many times. His thing was the cancer can't grow larger than a BB if it doesn't have new blood vessels. That was that was his thing. It's stuck at a certain size. And so VEGF is the primary way vascular endothelial growth factor is the primary way that you grow new blood vessels if you're a tumor cell. So people went crazy about this hypothesis. It was not it was more than the tpo that I was describing. Um because it was Judah Folkman and he's very compelling and very charismatic and just because the hypothesis really it's logical. It's logical. It resonates. It sounds like a good thing. What you know the saying that I love is that the that it's the description of science as um a a beautiful compelling hypothesis slayed by an ugly fact.

[01:08:38] That's perfect. Yeah. Well, we um Napo Ferrara, also a great character, um an Italian uh um OBGYn who came to Janentech and and worked in uh one of the labs made uh an antibbody actually same backbone as her septin to VEGF uh and mostly human mostly human again I think about 93 94% uh human and so we um decided we should go after uh an antibbody for VEGF as our next big oncology program. I still remember, by the way, uh one of the things that um Gwen Fe, who's a great clinical oncology uh trials expert, was in charge of the program. And Gwen and I talked the day before the first patient was going to get treated with anti-vef. And Gwen said, "My nightmare is that all the blood vessels fall apart. We've just put that into someone's body." And I said, "Well, you know, we did all the tox studies. were like, I don't think they're going to I don't think it's going to be that bad, but we have no idea what I mean. It just felt and I'm sorry, this was before the first phase one patient. This was the first phase.

[01:09:55] This is the first phase one. So, you're going very low dose. We're going to do this. The first time it's going into a human. The first human dosing of anti-veg and we knew how important VegF was. So, we were scared. And this is like also mid 90s. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, this is all happening when you arrive.

[01:10:12] Yeah. It had just gotten there. I mean, what a time to be at Janentech. Yeah. It was wild. It was wild. Wow. So, so we're into the clinic and we're and we make progress and it's really um uh good news and lots of studies and we're ambitious. We want to do a lot of different we wanted to do lung cancer and we ought to do breast cancer and colon cancer. How are you picking the cancer to study something like this? Her receptin's obvious because you're targeting a receptor. Recept and retoxin were easy.

[01:10:41] They're easy. You know what you're doing. But here you you could be targeting anything. Um there is one tumor where VEGF plays a seinal role and that is renal cell carcinoma and yet renal cells are really tough to study. Um it's it's just it's not set up clinical trials wise. Why is that? Um you've got the IL2 stuff going on where you've got you know 10% of people will respond to it but 90% won't.

[01:11:07] It should be easier. It just wasn't um I think it's it it may be the sites and where the clinicians are who care for it. It may just be that pragmatic, but we kept trying we kept struggling to figure out how to do a good uh renal cell study. But we thought we could do a breast cancer study because we had a lot of networks of breast cancer uh patients and particularly patients who weren't eligible for herptin because many of them weren't. Um so we wanted to do a latestage breast cancer study because if we could help these patients we would find out right away you know because they were sort of they had already these were patients with metastatic breast cancer metastatic breast cancer who had already progressed through everything everything right so really tough tough high bar. So and the standard you're going to hold yourself to in the phase two is 50% shrinkage. We wanted to have um at least 50% shrinkage. We wanted to change time progression because then we could let's this is a great time to actually hit hit pause. I wanted to do this later, but this I think this is the right drug to go through two things.

[01:12:18] One, even though I've done this probably half a dozen times on the podcast, you should never assume somebody remembers it. I want people to understand what the difference is between a phase one, a phase 2, a phase three study. Also understand what's preclinical. Um, it's not intuitive to people why it costs a billion dollars to get a drug to market and why it can take a decade. Um, and then within that, if you could just embed enough of the details about decisions that you can make that will make or break you, right? You how many times has a drug failed because the experimental design, the wrong patient selection, the wrong disease selection.

[01:12:57] Yeah, you have got to line up four pieces of Swiss cheese just right to get the pen through to hit it. So, let's Sorry to interrupt, but let's go back to you got Judah Folkman talking about VeF Ve Vef. That then turns into well, if we made an antibbody to VEGF, okay, so there's your idea now. Yeah, start the clock and start the dollars. Yeah. So if you um if you start with a target often in oncology today we'll start with a target.

[01:13:30] There's two things you have to to start with. One is what's the best way to turn down or turn off that target. Is it a small molecule? Is it an antibbody? Um tell folks the difference. How do you think of small molecule versus antibody? Where do we draw the line? So, here's a really simple way I think of that helps me. Small molecule is chemistry. Small molecule is it can be not always a pill.

[01:13:57] Uh um a small molecule you're you're impacting on often pathways or enzymes or things that happen in the cell. Um a large molecule, whether it's a protein or especially an antibbody, an antibbody's biology. an antibbody you're trying to do something that may be immune in nature or you use the antibbody as a delivery device. You're getting something to the cell. Um it's a a company like Janentech um and many modern companies really like antibodies.

[01:14:34] I like antibodies because when something happens it's on target. It it doesn't tend to be offtarget. small molecules that chemistry tends to have surprises in negative ways offtarget like liver toxicity or kidney toxicity. This is the way I I do it this through cardiovascular medicine to explain to people the difference between a statin and a PCSK9 inhibitor. You have these two very common drugs that are used to lower cholesterol. But a statin is a small molecule.

[01:15:05] And I don't say this in an insulting way, but we use the terminology it's dirty, right? So it it does block an enzyme, but it's got all these offtarget things and your liver function gets whacked. You get insulin resistance. Some people get horrible muscle soreness. Right. So 5 to 10% of people taking this drug are going to have a side effect that prevents them from taking the drug. Right. Right. I've never seen a person yet who couldn't tolerate a PCSK9 inhibitor where you inject an antibbody into them that binds to a protein and shuts it off. That's that that's really a good example and that that the choice of molecule is driven by that. When I was first in product development, there was this thing of oh you need a pill especially for chronic indications. You need a pill um for um compliance, right? Who would take an injection for cardiovascular for cholesterol? Look at obesity drugs.

[01:15:59] Turns out a lot of people would take an injection if they want to. But once you have your your selection, you you need to make sure you can make it. Y and one of the critical things for a biotech company, if it's a protein or or an antibbody, is the smallcale production of it in small, they call it a mini firm, uh the mini firm has to resemble what is actually going to be used because the next thing you start doing is a bunch of models. Judah Folkman giving a great talk doesn't mean you believe that blocking VEGF will help cancer. So we do models in mice. We may do larger animals. Um we do fewer animal models than we used to because they're really limited. Um I would rather have a great target with good biology than an animal model. But it's still helpful.

[01:16:50] It's still helpful. And then the the critical thing is the preclinical work that you do. What FDA is going to want to ask you, and they should, this is not them being bad. This is them being good. They're going to want to ask you about toxicology. What's your safety plan based on biology of edge off? What are you most worried about? I'm most worried about bleeding. It's an antibbody. I'm most worried about an allergy to the antibbody. Did any of the p the uh um talk studies show allergy to the antibbody? What are you going to look for and how are you going to look? How often are you going to measure the patient? So the pre-clinical safety plan is really important and based on what you find in toxicology. The other thing that's essential is and especially modern oncology if you have a targeted therapy you must have a diagnostic and that is wicked hard because you've got the therapeutic and the diagnostic at the same time. Now things like CD20, things like VEGF are very ubiquitous. So it's not really targeted in the sense of her two um where we needed a diagnostic but if you need to have that we had a what we called a clinical trials assay for her septin that wasn't to be marketed.

[01:18:05] So you you did you guys have to have somebody in parallel developing a clea certified assay that a pathologist was going to use or did you do that inhouse? We had an in-house clinical trials assess that we used all the way through phase three which was because you could quality control the hell out of it was fine. There was nothing wrong with it except it wasn't approved. Y so not fine. Yeah. So when we went to FDA they said we're not approving her septin until you have an approved diagnostic.

[01:18:34] So who's whose responsibility is like how do you encourage the world to make that happen? So we went to do a known you know we went to several diagnostic companies and do said we'll make you a iminohistochemistry test for her too and her subtest is made by do y and but we had to go back and correlate that with the clinical trials to make sure that it was the same as the why did you guys do that in parallel was the cost too great and did you want to derisk the drug before you sunk the cost into that we were we were too inexperienced to realize we should have I see okay so nowadays we're doing in parallel. Oh, for sure on parallel. Yeah, for sure. It was it was a mistake. So, how long just to again go back to kind of helping people think through the arc of time from the moment you guys hit uh go decision on we want to do this, we want to pursue this path. How long until you file the IND? Oh gosh, it could be years. It could be two, three years because you're doing animal models. You've got Now, if you hit the Maybe tell folks what the IND is so they understand why that's an important milestone. So, the investigational new drug is asking the

[01:19:38] Food and Drug Administration permission to ship an unapproved drug across state lines. If if you and I wanted to do something in Austin, um, we could actually do it, which is sort of weird when you think about it, but most people don't. So, we're going to do the Peter Sue drug. It's going to be amazing.

[01:19:57] We're going to set the lab up right over there, but the moment we want to run a clinical trial and ship it and get it out of the state, You got to have the IND. So the investigational new drug is the request. And what happens is that you bring take all this information I've been talking about that that you know you have a molecule. You you trust the the way you're uh producing the molecule. You you understand the biology enough. You have a safety plan. You know what's uh uh and you have a phase one protocol. So phase one is has one purpose. We're all greedy. I've been there. It is only for safety. Phase one is, is it safe to give humans this molecule? Is it safe to give it once? Is it safe to give it multiple times? And there's an art to knowing where to start the dose because it's an escalating dose trial. That's right. But you're extrapolating from what you learned about toxicity in a totally different organism. Yeah. That never translates one to one to the organism of choice.

[01:20:58] It's absolutely true. And it's not uncommon. And you see people all the time backing up on the dose thinking, "Oh, that was more than we needed um or more than we wanted." But phase one um with a good pre-clinical package, a good IND, phase one should be uneventful. Y and because we are greedy in oncology, we always look to see if anybody responds just because that's what we do. But phase one often, to be fair, has some really tough patients who are trying something and have tried a lot of other things. So the patient population um uh can can be tough to find any efficacy in phase two is where things get so so phase one I always think of phase one is it might be a year that you're in phase one if you're doing really and typical cost given the relatively low numbers of patients. Oh gosh in the tens of millions. Tens of millions. Y yeah tens of millions. And then you get into the 20s and 30s and 40s of millions with the phase two depending on how big your phase 2 is.

[01:21:59] And phase two I think is um that's where people can use their intellect I think in many ways. Phase two you start to look at what's the right dose and schedule. Um very very important to get the right dose and schedule and what what's the right outcome? What's the right patient? who do you want to treat?

[01:22:21] And and really what phase two is supposed to do is with one exception, phase two is supposed to get you ready for phase three. You've got a dose, you've got a schedule, you've got a patient selection criteria, and you've got a hypothesis of where this is going to be a drug. Um the the exception in oncology is sometimes you want to get an approval off phase two. Um when we tested uh anti-vef in breast cancer in phase 2, we wanted to use that as an approvable study because we would go in and say look these patients have it can be a contingent approval but these patients have nothing else to do. Um and so I think that can happen especially targeted therapy where you've got the perfect target and FDA's um feeling good about it too. That can be a phase two study but most of the time you're getting ready for phase three. So where were you guys with uh antivf in phase two? You had breast cancer and did you do colon? We did colon but not the kind of study that I just mentioned for approval. We did a traditional phase two in colon. So what happened is the breast cancer study failed and um I was so disappointed. I was so hoping that that would work. I still remember that day.

[01:23:36] Um it for me it was like oh we need it we need more better drugs for breast cancer because I often heard from people when her sept you know when they're the three out of four patients through her septin wasn't for them. um uh if you looked at your stock that day, it also looked really bad cuz all the hype about

[01:23:54] Avasten um uh was there. But in colon cancer, we had a phase two got ready on the dose and schedule and then we went to a phase three study in colon cancer. Much more traditional um just plus plus minus uh five of you and the usual suspects. Five of you in the usual suspects plus minus a vast and that succeeded. And that was a that was a stage four or stage Yeah, it was only stage four. Only stage four. And what was the different? This was a this is a median survival study. You're not doing overall survival, correct? That was a median survival study. Actually, I don't remember all the details of that one.

[01:24:30] The the I feel like it was eight more months of median survival. Does that sound about right? That's probably right. Yeah. Yeah. It was it was the first new thing in colon cancer for a while, too. So, people were pretty excited. Now, at this point, I'm in medical school just down the street. I'm at Stanford. And I remember we had a big discussion about this. I'm in my first year of medical school. And the discussion we had in class was,

[01:24:52] I think at the time, Avasten was $100,000 for the treatment, extends median survival by whatever, but I think it was eight months. The UK said no. The NHS said we are not paying for this. Because at the time the NIH uh pardon me, the NHS had this $100,000 quality adjusted life-year hurdle. Yeah. So they were, which is understandable, right? That's how you throttle supply side economics. They said, "Look, we can't pay for a drug. We can't pay more than $100,000 for an incremental year of quality adjusted life here. This is only giving you eight months." That's why I know it was less than 12. And so the NHS flatly said, "We're not paying for this." And I do believe people in the UK could pay out of pocket for it. You can get it out of pocket, but not through the National

[01:25:33] Health Service. That's right. People in Canada could not because you couldn't have private insurance in Canada, though. You could come to the US for treatment. And so, of course, this just became a great topic of discussion for med school, you know, freshmen. Um, what was your thought at the time of, you know, have we moved the needle enough?

[01:25:51] How do we think about the economics of this? I had a a lot of different reactions. first of all with a vest and it was the first time I remember reading and I think it was one of those curtain raiser um things in the Wall Street Journal for the breast cancer study. It and the the title of the headline was um Avasin might help breast cancer patients but can they afford to take it?

[01:26:19] And I was shocked that it was the first time I had read and as long as I had been at Janentech um that somebody couldn't afford one of our drugs like that that instead of saying oh isn't that cool herptin avasten it was too much money and that felt really important to me and really uh um not good. Uh we had as a company a philosophy that no patient should go without any of our drugs because of an inability to pay. So we had a bunch of patient um uh what do you call those? Patient support programs, whatever. Um so we had a bunch of different things in place. So

[01:26:59] I knew we had those programs, but that doesn't help the patients in the UK and it doesn't help the overall cost because we're actually supplementing, but the cost is still really high. And we started to have a lot more discussion at the executive committee about the price and how we would think about it and how we would price the drugs. Um because that was like I say that was not um uh not good. How did you go straight from

[01:27:24] Janentech to being a chancellor at UCSF? Well, I just because I want to stay with the story. I want to continue the arc of your career because we haven't even but we're at the halfway point, right? We're like we're onethird of the way into early days. Yeah, we're in the '90s. So what how did you given the incred like you are truly on the cusp of what is happening in oncology and biotechnology and now the same institution that said you can't come back here to have a clinical appointment after saving the people of Uganda is now offering you the highest post essentially outside of a provost I'm guessing right I I don't even know where the highest post it is the highest post okay so so that's that's kind remarkable and and does that just speak to the what what they saw as the vision of that institution which was you know few people have learned what

[01:28:19] Sue has learned in the last 10 years and we want that type of leadership here so first of all on the Genentech side of things Ro bought us that's right so they had that was 99 years that was 2009 oh 2009 oh my god okay I'm off by a whole decade. I thought that was sooner. 2009. So the um which was not what we wanted.

[01:28:44] We like it was a it's a hostile takeover. A hostile takeover. Yeah. They they call it in the business world a squeeze out. Squeezed us out. Um and uh so I knew I was going to leave. I knew I was going to do something different. um and UCSF. Uh I had been really close uh with the chief of medicine who was my chief of medicine when I was an intern,

[01:29:12] Holly Smith. Do you know Holly Smith? No, I don't. So Holly Smith is a was a South Carolinian Harvard trained amazing person and between him and Bill Ruer who founded Chiron who's a biochemist they decided a long time ago that UCSF should not be a backwater uh medical school and should be a serious medical school. So Holly on the clinical front and Bill on the scientific front just decided they would start recruiting people to have a great institution like a pretty amazing thing.

[01:29:47] Um and that was starting in the 80s. It was probably Yeah. 80s 70s 80s. Yeah. And so I was still friends with Holly because uh um I was really uh I just think there's so many wonderful things about Holly that I admired that um I was still friends with him. So Holly called me and said, "Mike Bishop is stepping down um of Bishop and Varmas that that

[01:30:14] Bishop of Nobel of Nobel fame. Y and you should be chancellor." And uh of course I said to Holly, you know, I'm not a professor. Yeah. But other than that, um, and I said, "Well, if if, uh, um, if they're interested in in me that, you know, I'd be open to talking to them." Um, and so, uh, they were, and I went through the interview process. And what I'm sure that when you're going through that, sorry to interrupt, too.

[01:30:47] They must be because you're now interviewing with the board of trustees. You're they have a a search committee. Yeah. Yeah. And and so they must be asking you to present a vision, right? They're not interviewing you to make sure you know how to use PowerPoint. Yeah. Um do you remember what the vision is that you presented to them? What I do remember and I remember if you remember 2009 was just post apocalypse horrible recession and California being um particularly in a bad place. So, I just talked to them about how I think about um managing people, how I think about making sure that you use whatever assets you have maximally. I admitted that I had never done fundraising, but I had done a lot of work with um Wall Street and I could talk. Yeah. Because you were le you were the president. What was the what was your title at Janentech before you? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, and I did uh a massive amount of investor relations.

[01:31:47] Y cuz Art didn't like traveling or talking. So, um my kind of guy. Mine too. No, we were a good uh partnership. But but you know, I also said, look, I'm not you know, if you think about running the faculty meeting, I'm probably not your guy, but that's what the provost does, you know. So, um, so it was I think they really thought they wanted somebody who could work on the business aspects of of the campus.

[01:32:14] We needed to finish Mission. You're really the CEO of the system. Yeah. And you manage the hospital CEO and you know, it's a big hospital system. There's no undergrads at UCSF. Um, so, uh, that was that was what they were looking for and and I thought, well, why not? Were you nervous? I mean, when they called you and said, "You've got the job." Were you Did was there a moment where you thought, "Have I bit off more than I can chew? This is a huge responsibility." I was really concerned.

[01:32:46] I was really concerned about and I also realized because some of the faculty were pretty negative when I first started because you're an outsider. I mean, you I mean, you were an alum, but you weren't coming up through the ranks as the hotel, you know, as the CEO of the hospital or something. That I think is interesting. I actually think they were just as nervous as I was about money and they weren't convinced that I knew how to get them money because you know if you're running a program you need money. It's the mother's milk of doing science. So tell me about the budget of UCSF because it's a state school presumably California provides what what fraction of it?

[01:33:22] Almost nothing. So what's the benefit of being a UC? The brand is you know the the there's a kind of curriculum thing. There's some things like that. So, in that sense, you and Stanford aren't that far apart. Not that different. I mean, the most important things, you've got clinical income, you've got NIH driven income, right? You've got other grant income, and you have philanthropy. So, just show me the P&L on those things there. So, so NIH is bringing in how much? Oh gosh. Percentage wise roughly of the money that you use every day. You know, there's this discussion of overheads now. It's probably um gets up to a third A third of the revenue for general operations is coming out of the NIH overhead probably. And then clinical revenue, clinical is a lot, but a lot of it goes back to the hospital. You know, it's a not for-p profofit. They spend it on the hospital.

[01:34:15] Okay. And then philanthropy is some direct, some into the endowment where you're living off the interest. Yeah. And that's basically what your revenue streams are. Those four. That's the revenue. And then the tuition is, you know, tiny. Well, especially because you don't have undergrads, right? Yeah.

[01:34:30] Right? Because the number of of students is really low. I didn't even apply to UCSF, by the way, because it was I just knew that as a non-cal I mean, I was not in California. When I was applying to medical school, I was told, you know, it first of all was such a great medical school that I was like, there's no way

[01:34:45] I'm going to get in as a non-Californian. Uh, so I didn't even apply. So, the funny thing for me is, uh, but you did and you got in. I did. Well, there's a story there that, you know, we talked about me being at University of Nevada. What we didn't talk about is my first year at UN University of Nevada, my my uh um youngest sister was born. So I lived at home and helped my mom uh the in Reno. And so there's like seven of you, right? There's seven of us. Yeah.

[01:35:17] And number seven was born when I was uh a freshman. So uh uh it was kind of crazy. Um, but when I went to medical school, I used to have like this sign on the stairs, be quiet, I'm studying down here. I was like probably a giant pain. But I wanted to go to San Francisco. My dad was born and raised in San Francisco. My grandma lived in San Francisco. So, even though

[01:35:43] I was kind of, you know, still pretty young um in terms of of ever living outside the the home, I I knew San Francisco and wanted to go, but uh UCSF had never taken a University of Nevada, a University of Nevada student because we were a pretty new medical school. I was only in the second four-year class.

[01:36:04] Oh, wow. Yeah. And um I was excited like like my head would blow off. like I wanted to go to UCSF so big time. So, I'm going back to UCSF. And the really good news, what saved me as chancellor is philanthropy. It turns out that we needed people to to um care about the mission and the projects at UCSF right at the same time as the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world and the venture capitalists of the world. and a lot of people had come into a lot of money. Um even though the overall economy was bad, it was coming back and um we we had some spectacular successes and my successor

[01:36:52] Sam Hogood continues to have that kind of success and people are just really generous. So if you Americans are hands down the most generous people in the United in the in the world, the Americans uh I think that's that's a very um demonstrable fact. No, it's um I'm big on New Year's resolutions among other things. One of my New Year's resolutions that I just I have a mini list. One thing that's always on the list is be more generous.

[01:37:21] And you know, I'm not I'm no Mark Zuckerberg, but I can be generous in other ways. I'm sure that you must deserve some of the credit for that. I don't think it's just that a bunch of people in the Bay Area came into money at that period of time. What was the approach you took towards philanthropy? Um, and how did you how did you reach uh reach donors that maybe previously hadn't been involved in in UCSF? Because again, you know, one of the things that's working against you is you don't have an undergraduate, right? So

[01:37:49] Stanford has a big advantage uh over you in which you've got a lot of people that are coming through doing engineering degrees, doing CS degrees who are going on to create enormous enterprises. But the people who were going, anyone who's an alum of UCSF went to graduate school there. There's no business school.

[01:38:07] There's no law school, you know. So, so you're missing out on a lot of these. Don't forget the hospital. The most important donor base is Grateful Patients. Yes. Um or people who love science, technology. I hired um John Ford who had retired as the head of Stanford's fundraising. Got it. So, he was your head of development up to to the Northeast and he was my head of development. And I talked to John. I said, "How do you do this? Teach me how to be a good fundraiser." And he talked about um tell people your hopes and dreams. Tell people what you're excited about and ask them what they're excited about and see if there's a match. And I think that was really important. And then I also think that the the because I had been at Janentech and I was sort of gregarious and knew a lot of people and people knew that I had a decent business savvy. I wasn't going to waste their money, you know, and that we were very um committed to use the money wisely, especially in the hard times and um do special things at UCSF. So, I I I think it was um I was surprised that I I sort of worried that

[01:39:17] I would um be sad if people said no, that I that it would be weird, especially if I knew them well. So, I would um I' I'd get myself psyched up for the beginning of it and then by the end I'd be like, "Oh, that's fine. Next time if you're you know, if you're in town, let's talk again and maybe it'll change or whatever." But it wasn't um it was actually fun. and I got to talk to and meet um a lot of great people. What percentage of your time was spent externally versus internally?

[01:39:49] Probably 40% externally. A lot external. And what was the internal focus then? The working with the team, you know, so there's a whole So who were your direct reports? The provos, CEO of the hospital, lawyer, all the deans. Um that that was really important. Um and then part of it was um uh you also um monthly we met with all the chancellors um with the president of the university. It was

[01:40:17] Mark Udolf at the time and then uh um he he stepped down after uh a while. But the the chancellor's meetings were funny because they all had undergrads. So I almost felt like I was squirming like are we done yet? And then I I thought it was just really important. I my favorite thing every Friday lunch, Mission Bay, they had a science talk and they'd have some, you know, pizza, Chinese food, something.

[01:40:49] And you'd look around the room and it'd be like Bruce Albert's um uh uh Liz Blackburn. There'd be four Nobel Prize winners in this little cramped room listening to science. And this would be something you did as a scientist, not necessarily as the ch like the chancellors weren't doing this all the time. I just go over on the shuttle bus, eat eat a slice of pizza, and enjoy. Yeah. Amazing. It was really good. So then let's get to the next chapter. What what all of a sudden um in 2013 2014 leads to the next transition to being the CEO of the Bill and Melinda

[01:41:24] Gates Foundation? Well, uh to my surprise, um I uh I think I got an email or I think it was an email from Melinda. Um did I have time to talk? Um and UCSF throws a big event every year that's kind of friend making, fundraising, everything. and we give out um awards you recognition to people whose um uh whose work we respect a lot.

[01:41:56] So I had invited Melinda the year before and thought she'll never come. You invite people like the throwaway invite and she accepted and came actually came with her mom and dad even better. I thought that was nice. Uh, so she sent me an email uh and she said that she and Bill um wanted me to look at being the next CEO of the

[01:42:21] Gates Foundation. And I was surprised. I had not, you know, expected that. And um so I started having discussions with them. It was actually funny because I uh I went up to Seattle and they were having all this hush- hush, you know, this is very uh cloak and dagger. So, I went to their house um to uh because I had had a meeting with Melinda and I needed to meet with

[01:42:52] Bill and it was Halloween. The kids are coming and going and it was kind of crazy. Um and so I had talked to him and and I talked to my husband, you know, my husband worked at the Gates Foundation. He led the HIV and TB programs about five years before. Was he still there? No. No, you had gone. He was commuting to Seattle, which was dreadful. Um and uh so but he knew the Gates Foundation.

[01:43:22] So he and I were talking about this and I was like, "Oh god, you know, I'm only been at UCSF 5 years. It's not I' I've just found where the bathrooms are, you know, that kind of thing." Um and it was going well. I was happy with that. Um, so they got on, they asked for a teleconference and they got on the phone and especially Bill made this big pitch that only that that a lot of people could do the UCSF job with all due respect as Bill would put it, but I was the only person who they both wanted and who could do this job. I was perfect for the job and it's really important for the world and I needed to do it. was I assume that the rationale for that was there obviously their focus is um on global health global health and you have the background in the clinical side the research side the epidemiologic side the management side so there's kind of those are four legs of a chair were there other things that I'm missing that they felt were kind of essential pillars I think now I I think it was less obvious then but I think now they had started started to kind of have desperate views of how the foundation should operate.

[01:44:38] Melinda's been really all over women's issues, you know, all over. And Bill would do, you know, another run at polio, you know, it's like they they they passions. They the the goal broadly that all lives have equal value, which by the way I think is a wonderful thing. um they share but they come at it from different ways and so I think that the the thing that resonated for me is that

[01:45:07] I could see both those points of view but those points of view don't strike me as mutually exclusive for an organization with enormous resources right yes and no um I think it's one thing to have enormous resources it's another to know where one of the most important um assets they have is the time and energy of Bill Melinda you know, they actually show up, things happen.

[01:45:33] So, how did you weigh this decision? I thought that I could add value. I thought I would learn a lot. Um, and I did think that that UCSF would be fine without me. I felt like we were back on our feet financially. I thought that Sam Hogood, who was the dean of the School of Medicine, I had a ton of respect for him and thought he was the obvious person to take my place. Um, and that it would be okay. Were they surprised? Were they Did they try to talk you out of this? I don't think they did. I actually think they had a lot of respect for the

[01:46:09] Gates Foundation and thought, "Oh, well, that's a cool job." At least the way they showed up with me. Maybe when I wasn't there, they did. Okay. So, you head up to Seattle now. Yes. Um, what's it when you show up to the foundation? How many employees are there? What does it look like? What what type of, you know, it's a it's a not for-profit, but does it run like a for

[01:46:28] Does it run like Microsoft? I mean, how how does it how does it operate? It's it's a couple thousand. It's a big foundation, big building, big foundation with people all over the world now. You know, it's uh I was surprised. Um, there was a lot I wasn't surprised by, like the global health stuff. I knew what they were doing and I thought it was interesting and great. And the the challenge for me was the um Bill's endless appetite for things like learning things, uh driving things, funding things, and me feeling like I could get my hands around like a strategic plan, a budget, like there was it was a little um uh it was a little bit like, okay, this the the staff would be like, "Bill's going to love this. Let's present that." You know, it was that kind of feeling and lots of money. Um, so I I kept trying to get my hands around like, okay, what should we do so it's just a little more orderly, you know, and we get a great return on our investment.

[01:47:41] Um, that was the the most important focus. I feel good about that. I actually the funny thing was I sent the finance team to Janentech and we had this really great portfolio management um process that we put in place when I was there and they still use it apparently um and because I recommended to Bill we just have a portfolio management process pretty simple everybody knows how you make decisions what money's up you know what we'll do and we can use that here doesn't need to be bureaucratic it's uh and Bill so we don't need it it's all in my

[01:48:19] I remember that conversation and I thought if it wasn't you, I would think that was a smartass thing to say. But I actually think you're just being honest. So I I I encouraged him to understand that just because it was in his head didn't mean that the rest of us were there. So, so we had our uh we we had a little a little more um uh ability to to make things, you know, orderly,

[01:48:48] I'd say. But it's just it was a wild ride. It was six years of a wild ride. What was the most difficult thing for you to um to impact that you wanted to to change? uh meaning you know was there a global initiative that you wanted to get your hands around that you just couldn't do organizationally or technically or bureaucratic like what were the challenges? I would say that the the um far the opposite that from a like the things that I felt like I knew about I felt like really good about like you know the TV stuff there's a HIV cure program now that I'm really psyched about. Um the so technically I felt really good. Probably the hardest thing for me was the people side of things. I have a very um strong sense of how people should treat each other and the competencies that managers should have. And I'm not willing to move on that because you're, you know, a technical expert. Um and I found that if you do move on that, it just changes the culture and and I struggle with that. And say say a little bit more on that. Is that because in the not for-profit space you have a different talent pool than you do at

[01:50:11] Janentech or or No, I think it's cuz u Bill really likes technical experts. I see. And if if he likes the technical expert, he doesn't want his CEO to come and say anything. But they Yes, they are very smart. And what how is the organization uh what what is what did the org chart look like? So I assume

[01:50:32] Bill and Melinda are co-chairs. of the board. Y and then as the CEO, what did who are your direct reports? Is it organized by a bunch of GMs in different programs? Yeah. So there's a TB person, an HIV person, a polio person, a malaria person, global health person, there's a global development person, there's an A person. Okay. So under global health, you then have subs. You then you have the subs. Yeah. So global health is a big job obviously. That's the biggest

[01:51:00] P&L. Yeah. It's the biggest P&L. And then um US education is a pretty big job too. I don't even realize I guess I Yeah, I'm not as familiar with the portfolio, but the the one that has been a is now a uh financial services for the poor. Um so it's a pretty broad um group. What's the annual budget? 8 billion. Wow.

[01:51:25] So much money. It's amazing. What are things that you could not have done there in that role had you not had the leadership roles at Janentech and UCSF? I think more the people side of things, you know, the the ability to understand um uh when I'll tell you a little story that we I I remember there was a employee who was really struggling at

[01:51:51] Janentech and her boss I was his boss. Yep. And he kept talking to me about how she was struggling, how she was struggling. Could we do this? Do we need to give her fewer reports, more reports, make her job harder, make her job? Like, we couldn't figure it out. Couldn't figure out. Performance was struggling.

[01:52:07] You mean performance was struggling. And just like not acting like she had been. We just couldn't figure it out. And finally one day she said, "Oh, I'm getting a divorce." And after a little while things got better. And I thought, you know, not everything's work. Not everything's work. So I think as a manager like I really care about people thriving at work. I really care about it. And when I went to Gates Foundation

[01:52:32] I think I understood better given Janentech and UCSF that um a very important principle work never fills in for home ever. It never makes up for bad home. So if somebody needs a timeout or is I always think how can I improve work and sometimes it's good to just understand that that's not always the case especially if you're working in global health or global development you might be in South Africa you might be in China it's rough and so just thinking a little bit about how people can show up in ways that m it's $8 billion how do they maximize the benefit of that $8 billion and what can I do to enable that and are you basically only able to affect that through your interaction with your direct reports and just hope that that's the infusion of culture that then trickles down because it's hard to go two levels below your management and yet the people who probably need this compassion the most are people you're not even going to meet. Yes and no. Um, one thing about traveling a lot or having, you know, you have big events or things like that is is you meet people on trips and that's different people throughout the organization. So, I think there are opportunities. I also set up meetings like when people would have a a grant that needed to be signed, the business process was it would show up on my computer. So, I changed the business process so I got the group that that uh could fit around the table in my office and we would talk about the grant so I could interact with more people that weren't my reports which I really liked.

[01:54:12] Um, so I do think it is mostly through your reports but I think there are ways that um uh at a senior level you can interact with people culture- wise. Yeah, the word culture is is is something that that I think it's very misunderstood, right? When you think about the culture that you wanted to bring to the Gates Foundation, I'd like to understand what that was and how successful you you think you were able to to to be. And I say that because you were in an organization where you also had very powerful other present people whose culture was also a part of the organization.

[01:54:51] So for me, um, I define culture in a really specific way. Um, that when you come to work, you feel like the atmosphere, the the surround sound brings out the best in you. Um, and that you have some ownership of tweaking it if it doesn't. So that that's something that you feel like you can control because if you're the in thousands of of people or hundreds thousands, tens of thousands of people and you're the CEO, you're not going to do that. But that you set up that culture.

[01:55:28] One of the my favorite um stories from Janentech was being at uh product development meeting that um my uh successor as medical officer Hal Baron was running and Art and I both attended just because we loved it and we wanted to be there but we weren't decision makers. We were just attendees which is kind of odd, right? the person who's the decision maker is sitting in the presence of the two most senior people in the company, but you're leaving it to him to make the decision. Yeah. But in this case, there was someone who um the discussion was about her septin and how how well the test to find who was her two positive performed. And if you got more patients, you would get more commercial, right? But you would have patients who wouldn't benefit. And someone who I won't name said, you know, but if we have a a test that does like this, we can get more money. And as if in unison, Art and I both rose up from our chairs and said, "We never do that.

[01:56:31] We don't do that here." Done. Like everyone kind of sat down and we weren't the decision makers. But see, that's culture. That's like, you know, if you wondered, it's right where the decisions are being made and everything else. that that for me is is culture. Um the other one that because I'm in so many meetings and was in so many meetings at Gates Foundation, I had a practice that it I would sit Bill would be there or Melinda would be there but often Bill and me there and you're presenting and Bill's peppering you with questions some of them very tough um in a very tough way. I would look at you. You got this. I would just I I can't tell you how many people

[01:57:19] I actually didn't even know I did it that I would nod. You were the coach. Smile. Coach. I would also stall. I Hey, hold on a minute, Bill. I think he's he's just getting ready to answer that question. You're talking over him right now. You know, just in nice way, not confrontational. That for me is culture. I want you to succeed. I want you to know I want you to succeed, you know, and I want if somebody's, you know, it's it's the guy who runs the foundation, it's the two people who are the chairs. And so it's going to be scary. Um, so if there are, that's why I think that bringing out the best in people and giving people agency to do that on their own means that if somebody sees Art Levenson say that's not the way we do it here, they'll go down the hall in a different meeting and say, you know, I heard Art say, I think that's really powerful. Yeah, that's really powerful. So this brings us up to kind of 2020 and was were you at the uh the foundation when COVID hit? I had announced that I was leaving and you know literally packing the house as

[01:58:32] COVID hit actually a few miles from us the first case in Washington state. Yeah. Nursing home. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Um le let's talk a little bit about co right so um I've talked before about this idea of the difference between science and advocacy and I still haven't really wrapped my mind fully around it other than kind of a sense of lost opportunity with co um what are your and what do I mean by that well on the on the one level there was so many pretty incredible things that happened with respect to the speed with which a vaccine could be developed that really made a difference in terms of mortality for a subset of the population.

[01:59:20] Um but a lot of that's overshadowed today by the lingering doubts, the lingering suspicions, um the mistakes that were frankly made. And my fear is I'm not convinced we're better off today in terms of preparedness for a pandemic than we were in 2019, which seems like an unimaginable statement given what we've been through.

[01:59:47] So, do you think I'm too pessimistic or how do you feel? I do not think you're too pessimistic. I am absolutely horrified. Horrified. It it is it's shocking to me that the the narrative has is in the place it is today. Um, and the and I'm honestly still processing how we got here from there because it's um, it is a really bad place. And I think you're right. And I think if it happened again today, it would be the way it was with worst of co but even worse because trust and um and also the the um the need to have sides and winning and losing. I mean I I don't remember um health and medicine being winning and losing and sides. um as I've been in this business for 40 years. It's just weird. I don't get it. Yep. I I I concur with all of that.

[02:01:11] Um and I do wonder what it will take to restore confidence. I I I you know, look, we could sit here and talk about mistakes. It might be that the medical community and the scientific community need to be more vocal about acknowledging mistakes. And I do think an enormous mistake though it's understandable to me why it happened because so much was happening so fast but I believe deep down it was an enormous mistake to be the head of science to be the head of advocacy. I think having having Dr. Fouchy as being both of those hats was a cataclysmic error. No. And it's not about him. No human can do that.

[02:01:56] A scientist has to be an impartial observer of fact who is happy to change his or her mind in the presence of new information with no attachment to what has been said in the past. Yeah. An advocate has to be driving policy and action and sometimes they have to settle for the best you can do. Any port in a storm. Yeah. When you put those two hats on the same people, I worry that you lose all trust. And I I do wish the medical community could have an open and honest discussion about that. And and I would I would say that not if but when we will have another pandemic. There's zero doubt in my mind.

[02:02:41] Bird flu is working hard on it right now. We will absolutely have another pandemic. I hope it is decades from now, but we will. I hope somebody will remember that lesson and say we want our chief communicator of the of the state of the science to be completely uninvolved in telling the public what to do simply there to report what we know today. Today we think masks work. You know what? We just did a study and we realize they don't work worth a lick. Yeah. Today we believe vaccines prevent transmission. We just did a follow-up survey. They don't prevent transmission.

[02:03:18] It's okay. It's okay. And I think that's a very forgivable position. I think the public would welcome Look, I just told you about bone marrow transplants for breast cancer. Yeah. I if you tell people, look, here's what we thought. We thought, you know, harder harder treatment was was better for people.

[02:03:37] It's now proven that it's not. I mean, that that science changes. People know that. But you're right. I think that that being honest and open when it changes and how it changes um matters a lot. It really does. I also think you didn't say, but I would add to your recommendation, which I think is a really smart one. Um the pace of communication, the the social media and misinformation or just, you know, stuff gets out there really fast. and having something slow doesn't keep up. Yeah.

[02:04:16] And I don't I don't have a solution to that. I mean the the great example which is a very good example and I don't know the solution is in two in in in sort of May of 2020 if you suggested that this came out of the the the Wuhan lab. I mean you were kicked off social media, you were kicked off YouTube, you were kicked you were in the doghouse that was misinformation. Well I I think almost any observer today would agree that that was actually information. But where do you draw the line? Yeah. How do you And this is one where I don't have I don't have an insight. This is so far above my pay grade. Yeah. I don't think it's a matter of kicking people off because actually I think you enhance that and you you may be wrong but being part of the dialogue. I'll give you an example that I've been reading the last couple weeks. Ivormect for cancer. Yes. Very disappoint. I mean it's it drives me actually I'm glad you brought that up. I wanted to have a discussion about this.

[02:05:16] Okay, finish your point and then I want to make a broader point about oncology. Let's So, so my point's a simple one. The nature of is a vacuum. Yeah. So, if you say I'm not going to kick off people because the example of the the lab is a good example, but I'm not going to remain silent. Yeah. So, here's what

[02:05:34] I know about that thing about the lab. Here's the facts. Here's the publication. You know, I think that that the absence sort of seeds that space to people. I feel like the antiax, specifically things like autism, many people have seated that space on social media because you are kicked in the butt if you don't. So, I do think you can't leave a vacuum. Yeah, I think that's a great point. I'm glad you brought the ivormectin and cancer thing up. So, a couple of my patients, which is a statement, right?

[02:06:09] I'm going to acknowledge that my patients are educated and affluent people for the most part. A couple of my patients have sent me clips of various people claiming that Ivormectin is curing people with stage 4 cancer. Now, because they're sending these to me in text and I'm really, really busy, I'm responding in a rather glib way, which is usually using phrases like, "This is effing bullshit."

[02:06:41] Um, but I'm always but I usually follow it up a few minutes later with a text that says happy to discuss and usually they say no Peter I just needed to know that this was nonsense. Uh but I also agree that I don't think people should just be taking thing on on faith and I really want to be able to offer so so I think let's I wanted I made a note that actually I wanted to discuss this exact example and hopefully we'll be able to clip this particular segment so people understand why this is such a an idiotic statement. So to believe that Ivormectin cures cancer and to listen to the stories of multiple people with all sorts of different metastatic cancers that are cured, you're almost dis explaining that cancer is a single disease.

[02:07:25] So explain why just at face value the idea that anything could cure multiple forms of cancer is an impossibility. It is an impossibility. There's no doubt about it. The the every um every cancer has very specific biologies that allow it to grow and spread and cause humans problems. And that's why you don't go to the cancer doctor. You go for prostate cancer. You go for gastric cancer. You go and that's because the biology of each of the cancers is different. And when you go even one step further, as you've alluded to, it's not just that colon cancer and breast cancer are as different as kidney disease and heart disease. It's that breast cancer with an estrogen receptor that lights up versus a HER two new receptor that lights up versus no receptors that lights up. Those pretty much have nothing in common other than the fact that they originated from the mamry cell of a woman's breast. Right?

[02:08:33] So we use anatomy to describe where where the tumors are. But you can it is not irrational to use different doses of medicines in combination with other doses. The the thing that we went over is the pre-clinical phase one, phase two, phase three is meant to give whatever cancer patient whether let's in this case I think prostate cancer has been talked about a lot all the information they deserve on both safety and efficacy. Does it work? Does it shrink the tumor? Does it help them live longer? I haven't read anything about ivormectin doing that in patients and what the side effects are and how it could harm patients. So I I want patients I think patients deserve that kind of information. The other issue I have with this type of rhetoric is the next line that follows is the pharma companies all know this works and the reason they're keeping it from you is so that they can make more money giving ineffective drugs. Now again I'm going to offer my point of view on this but you being the veteran of some of the biggest pharma companies in the world feel free to correct me. I think pharma would be happy to have a drug like ivormectin that cured all cancer because the first thing they would do is put a slightly different modification to it to make it more efficacious and more uh uh basically less side effects and they would patent it and they would make all the money in the world because if they're if they're able to make $100,000 on a drug that extends your life by eight months, I promise you they will be making millions per drug if it's curative. So again, ju such illogical arguments are put forth and it drives me sort of bananas.

[02:10:28] But if we want to go back and say how did we get here? I think when my friend Joe Rogan took ivormectin for COVID, which when Joe asked me what do I think? I said, Joe, I think it's a totally safe drug. I'm pretty sure it has nothing to do with why you're feeling better today. I think you're feeling better today because you have an amazing immune system. You're an insanely healthy human being. You did 10 other things, two of which might have worked. I'm pretty sure the ivormect had nothing to do with it.

[02:10:57] That said, the medical the medical community didn't say that to him. What they said is, "You're taking horse dewormer, you idiot." Well, that was a strategic error. Yep. That's an awful way to talk to somebody. And Ivormectin might be a horse dewormer. It also happens to be, and I looked this up, Sue, there is no drug on planet Earth that has been taken by more human beings than

[02:11:20] Ivormekin. And it might have the fewest side effects of any drug out there. And look, there may be human conditions for which Ivormectin helps works beyond Yeah, exactly. beyond what we know. And and I think that's an opportunity for somebody to study it. Good for them. But but again it's this there's something about the elitist nature in which that was handled that has now created this terminal effect of ivormectin is a cause celeb for I mean pretty soon someone's going to say it cures Alzheimer's disease I'm sure you know it's just well

[02:11:55] I I think it's it's a drug that's an anti smartyp pants drug. Yeah, that's a great way to put it. That's that's what it is. And that's to me that's heartbreaking, right? Because the answer should have been and and again I I talked about this with Joe very openly on his podcast. I said, "Look, I've looked at all the RCTs of Ivormectin and COVID. There's no signal except in and my memory could be off on this, but there's a little signal in this Brazilian trial, but the methodology of that trial was horrible.

[02:12:24] So, I have to believe this is not working." Mhm. that this is, you know, it's a good try, right? All about trying. It was a great idea to take offthe-shelf drugs and see if they worked. Nothing wrong with that. We've done that for other things. When they don't, we have to move on. And by demonizing it and by demonizing the people that felt it might work, we find ourselves in a situation right now where it's it's very irrational. the the uh one of the things that I've did over the last four years is is participate in the president's council of adviserss on science and technology and co-chared a report on uh the future of public health and we ended up thinking that we focusing on the workforce um one of the remedies for the issue you and I just talked about is having a broader set of people who we think of as the public health workforce. Um, and I think people who are interested in ivormectton, farmers, you know, people who are up close and personal to some of the things with this bird flu. Um, there are a number of different folks who would be really interesting to involve in public health efforts and we typically don't. Um, and so I think that's one of the um, one of the ways that we can go forward in public health is to think about how do we define public health and what does it look like? Yeah, I I agree with that. Public health has really struggled in some ways. You've had these incredible success stories and then some awful failures.

[02:13:59] It's uh um, on the surface it's such a great thing. I think that's why make America healthy again resonates for people. People universally want how could you disagree with that want to be healthy. They want their families to be healthy. This is this is a universal thing. And and how to capture that and make that real, not ivory tower, but real for people who just want their families to have a chance at being healthy. I think that's a real positive.

[02:14:30] I want to talk a little bit about AI. A lot of people might not realize you're on the board of OpenAI. Um, and you're the only person in in in medicine on that board. So, talk to me a little bit about how that came about. Um, and I and I want to obviously talk about the implications of that, what you're excited about and what you're afraid of.

[02:14:51] So I joined um the OpenAI board almost a year ago now um when they had um had had in November of uh 2023 what they call the blip which is uh CEO fired board changed uh over um and I have been um so impressed by the intellect, the commitment, the sense of responsibility of folks at Open AAI. Um, I hope this is um this is maybe a little crazy, but here's what I hope. If I had a top two things for AI, one is in some of the things we've been talking about in product development. I mean, I love product development. I think it is the best job on earth. You get to make new medicines for people who are sick. Who wouldn't, you know, you go home and tell your mom and dad that they're happy?

[02:15:52] Yeah. So, so what if we could take the tool of AI and make easy the things we can make easy? So, you don't use AI to change a clinical trial. I still want to know does your tumor shrink? Do you feel better? Do you have side effects? But there's a lot of study reports, there's toxicology reports, there are a lot of things that are labor uh and paperwork that are actually very important to establishing the safety uh especially, but also the efficacy of a drug. I think using AI more and more on pieces of the clinical trials process so that if something takes time, it's because it's benefiting a human, not because we just couldn't do it fast enough. So the clinical trials I think still has some uh opportunities for that. What tell give me a time and money sense in terms of savings because I this is a very important question. How many

[02:16:52] Yeah. If you said that there's the the entire clinical trials program for a drug is six years, let's just make that

[02:17:04] upd and you believe AI can do that right now. I mean or we're on the path to that. I think we could be on a path to that. Yeah. Now the the challenge of it is going to be if you say this example I like to give because it's it makes sense for people. If I'm changing fiveyear survival, if this is sort of a mature established thing, I got to wait 5 years. Y I can estimate things and I can work with FDA to make sure if people can benefit. And you could argue with a regulatory change in the FDA. If we said greater emphasis on safety to approval, greater emphasis on postmarket surveillance for efficacy, we shift this thing a little bit. Now you could say at 3 years we're trending. you get a provisional approvement approval and now we're going to follow you. Like there's an example like Paxlovid in my mind.

[02:17:54] Yeah. You could argue maybe should have been pulled. Maybe it wasn't as effective as it looked in the trials and that doesn't mean they were wrong to approve it because it was any port in a storm. Right. But after the fact we could have been oh you know what no harm no foul it was safe. You can always do that. Yeah. Right. So maybe we do that for maybe we do that for oncology. I think that the other thing is you and I both know if you have 500 patients in a trial and you look at safety that's so limited. If you have a much more AI driven, why don't we follow safety in every patient on the exact ongoing ongoing. So I think the opportunities in clinical trials are massive. The other thing I would love to see is a change in the things that cause burnout of nurses and physicians and others in the hospital. Um, this is across the board, not just in clinical trials. Not in clinical trials. This is healthcare.

[02:18:44] Yeah. Health care should have tools where it's easier to you just decrease the the load, the burden on both caregivers and families. I think that that should be doable. I mean, it's not that hard. I think that that is absolutely correct. Um, on the nursing front, there's a there's a huge demand obviously. Um, how much of this do you think of absent robotics? Right. So, robots can really change the game. I'm not close enough to that. Are you? I'm not close enough to the robotics of it.

[02:19:20] Yeah. So, I don't I don't know how long until a robot is doing what a nurse is doing, but um when you think of medical and chart reconciliation and things like that, is that where you think the greatest opportunity is? I think it is when you're trying to connect all the dots. That's the thing that to to what

[02:19:39] AI does so brilliantly is it just takes a lot of data and it comes out with observations and if there are ways that that can assist at the bedside that's a massive improvement especially when people are changing you know even me University of Washington to UCSF it's so hard to change caregivers to change health systems those kinds of things can decrease workloads but I also think it's the kinds of things where an clinical observations could be AIdriven.

[02:20:13] So the Nobel Prize last year was awarded for protein folding AIdriven um analysis. How explain to people why that is significant and and where do you how much do you think that particular achievement is is is going to advance biotechnology and what remains ahead of it as far as even greater molecule selection? Yeah. No, the these guys what what they did is they made possible um and and we talked about pre-clinical.

[02:20:45] This is pre preclinical. This is how you even This is figuring out what you're going to do. Figuring out what you're going to do if you can make figuring out what you're going to do much much faster, which they did. um you're going to have the opportunity to The way I think of it is you've got like a mountain of opportunity, but it's shown a light on just a limited number of things where you can see the opportunity and take advantage of the opportunity. I think it's a start, but I think they've done I I'm think it's great that they were uh recognized. Do you think this is the most important thing that from a promise perspective that AI has has brought to medicine since so far? Yeah,

[02:21:26] I do. so far. Yeah. And and so what do you think would be the next mega unlock? Would it be on the data front? Uh would it be a predictive model? Like how could we shorten a clinical trial by 60%. You know, anything where AI can help us with outcome measures. Outcome measures. I I told you that my husband's an HIV doc. When we were both at Bristol Myers Squib, I was doing 2x two measurements of tumors on

[02:22:00] X-rays for taxol. And he was looking at viral load. Viral load allowed us to have 20 HIV drugs in like five years. Is crazy how good it was. I want a viral load for everything. You know, I don't want a 2x2 biomarker. We need a good biioarker for more things and and you were talking about all the different co uh um types of breast cancer. So think about what you just talked about with breast cancer that you have er positive,

[02:22:31] ER negative, her two positive, triple negative, you know, there's all these what if actually there's 15. Yeah, there undoubtedly are, right? We know that probably are. So then you're in 15 trials, but you only need 10 patients in each trial because it's so obvious you have the perfect remedy for each of those patients. You know that you there's a I always think of it as switch is on, turn it off, and you see clinical benefit. Anything we do that sets up like that, especially if we can not just measure switch on, but switch off.

[02:23:03] That's why viral load is so powerful. Sue, what's your level of optimism or pessimism around liquid biopsies? And do you think that AI can help us with these? I have been um pretty negative um based on the data. I just have not seen the data that suggests to me that um we're and is this on the sensitivity front? Yes. Yeah.

[02:23:31] Um and so I'm Can AI help us? Possibly. Possibly. It seems it the problem is just really hard. Yeah. I was about to say, do you think the problem is tumors don't shed enough DNA? I think that appears to be the problem because if they did, I think it would work. Yeah. Um, and it's also, so that's the most important problem. The other problem is something that I think we all tend to to underestimate. Um cuz I love the concept of prevention and you know I

[02:24:08] I think that the make America healthy again in part is we'll go to preventive therapy and stop all these and and you know I understand that in oncology we've often celebrated tiny successes but you can't have big successes before you have tiny successes. I I don't um I don't think it's easy to do early detection. I think early you know the only two things that are well now three colon can colonoscopy works uh for cervical cancer a papsmear works y um even better HPV vaccine is my ad um and now you can do a spiral CT for lung cancer

[02:24:51] I'm not even using one handful of fingers and we've been trying to do early detection as long as I've been an oncologist I would add to that I agree with you by the I would add to that PSA in the hands of someone who understands what to do with it. So PSA by itself pretty bad. PSA density when you know prostate volume and PSA velocity when you have serial measurements starts to become very predictive. So you take a man who does not who has not had a pro prostate biopsy and you stratify his PSA according to PSA density the ability to predict if he has a gleon 3 plus 3 or 3+4 or 4 plus 3 is really quite high and at least you can then stratify those patients more quickly into a PHI or a 4K and ultimately decide do they need a multiparametric MRI and you go down that path. So, it's not turnkey and I completely understand why they've said we're going to make no recommendation.

[02:25:45] Mhm. But I do take comfort in knowing that, you know, I take it's sad to me, but I take comfort in knowing way too many men are dying of prostate cancer. Um, it it should not be the third leading cause of cancer death. Um, and yet I understand that it's a big ask to get every doctor fully up to speed on the algorithm. You know what you just said? That's something that uh, you know, if someone wanted to start a company, they could simplify that and make something more turnkey for patients. There's way when you go through the four leading causes of cancer death, two of them don't need to be on the list. Colon cancer and prostate cancer don't need to be on the list. They shouldn't be on the list. A lung is going to be a hard, you know, I think we can reduce it a lot, but it's going to be awfully tough and breast is still really tough cuz it's not haladian. It doesn't have that straightforward progression from polyp to cancer. No, it's true. And I Well, that's the neat thing is you can just take out the palip. I mean, that's always been the beauty of colonoscopy.

[02:26:48] So, what is your level of optimism that we could ever So, so instead of just talking about a broad liquid biopsy, let's just talk about breast cancer. Mhm. What do you think it would take? And do you think it would be a protein? Do you think it would be DNA? Do you think it would be RNA? If you had to guess, what would be the earliest signature in the blood of different breast cancers? Where would you put your money? I think it'd be interesting to look at protein. I I think that would be um Think about how that would change breast cancer treatment. It would it would be tremendous. Yeah.

[02:27:26] Sue, I I it's funny. I I I say the following deliberately not acknowledging your gender because I'm sure you hear all the time, Sue, you are the you are the most remarkable example of a woman in medicine. But I but I would just say I gender aside, you are just a remarkable inspiration, period, as a physician, as a as a business leader, um as as a as a public health official. Um,

[02:27:51] I have been a fan of yours for so long and when when I walked into that room, you know, last year and saw you sitting there, I just I was giddy. Um, so so thank you for humoring me and making the trip here to talk about this. I'm delighted to talk with you. Really enjoyed it. [Music]
