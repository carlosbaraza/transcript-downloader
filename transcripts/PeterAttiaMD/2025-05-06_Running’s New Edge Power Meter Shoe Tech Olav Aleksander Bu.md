## Transcript

[00:00:00] Is there is there some major disruption where we just have this dramatic change in technique to have a bigger positive impact on frontal surface area than the negative effect it might have on propulsion? Yeah. So this this then touches up on let's say uh one of my favorite areas and that's bio feedback.

[00:00:21] In cycling we have extremely good tools for bio feedback today. You have a power meter and you have a GPS. So just these two combined for example speed and power like we we talked about last time when you were out riding 200 W constant and basically you see you're getting faster. So you you have this direct bio feedback because you as long as you ride enough you will basically start to get a very good feeling for when you sit at a certain power and you start do different things. Some you creep up like half a kilometer power or one like for per person when they start cycling or they cycle a little bit like for them they it doesn't become interesting enough yet because there are other things that is basically more challenging for them to to master. But for people that do a lot of biking like yourself, it it's it's it's it's where you exactly start to pay let's say attention to those let's say even half a kilometer per hour, maybe even you're getting below that as well where you start to really pay attention to this. Um and then over time simply was because wind and other factors makes a difference too. Running this is also a place where we have really good bio feedback tools. You have your watch you're running and you can have a look at it. And now we have also really good power meters in running as well. How does that work? So most of these are there are some of these power meters in running today that requires some of them requires an insole. So you put basically an insole inside and they basically measure the forces a force plate. Yes.

[00:01:38] Inside your shoe. Yes. Yeah. And then you have other ones that are more motion capture devices. So they basically you rather input your body weight and since basically when you're touching on the ground with one foot you're basically carrying your whole weight there. So as long as you have a good enough motion capture device that are capable of let's say detect or that are able to capture the three-dimensional accelerations you can then basically also say some well you know you know the force because you basically have to carry your weight. So that's how you so but so you can directly measure this with a force plate um insole or you could indirectly do it with motion capture but I assume the motion capture only works on a treadmill. You're not going to be able to No. So the motion captures today they are become so small they are basically a small device that you attach to a shoe and they are when we validate these in are these commercially available products both of these. Yes. So if you if you me if you if you go to a laboratory and you basically test this you will basically see that so we have been for a long time been working together with stride. uh I started working with them when they were in beta stage and we've gone through there but basically they are so accurate today that when you when you um measure first of all do you have any idea how much you just ruined my wife's life like do you have any so how many minutes do you think after this podcast am I going to be on my computer ordering these devices jamming them on her shoes you know she's she's running the Boston

[00:02:58] Marathon next year and uh I'm convinced she's actually going to run it faster than she did her first Boston Marathon 20 years ago because she actually now works with a running coach and her qualifying time this year um was only 1 minute slower than her qualifying time 19 years earlier. Um and again it's just because she's more structured in her training. Not because she listens to a word I say. She doesn't. But she's like finally at least agreeing to use heart rate and velocity for tempo training. So now like she's not listening to this podcast obviously. She one of her friends will probably hear this and tell her to listen, but she is now we we're going to implement power training for her running and she's going to curse me all day long cuz she doesn't want data.

[00:03:42] But how could you not do how is every runner not doing this? I I think this has to do with a lot with with tradition and also that even when power meters were introduced it's easy to look back and say like why why why didn't we have this before or even how power there's so much information we can extract from a single power meter today which is I say beyond people's uh comprehension still we only use the power number that is there and we use it even in a one-dimensional context FTP for example or critical power uh the amount of information you can get out of this is crazy Because we are not going to talk about this today. I think we still kind of use normalized power and other no way we never use it. No, we only go by raw numbers. I only work by raw numbers all the time. So I don't condense it down to a single metric. I use only raw numbers. But the the implication here is that uh even when you look at studies that are looking at gross gross efficiency for example in the old days or even today uh there are like one thing you consider as a net mechanical power. The interface between basically looking at your gross mech or let's say gross uh gross efficiency is where you take V2 and we already there most people understand that okay you have a difference between net net uh net oxygen consumption and gross oxygen consumption you would ideally like to have the net oxygen consumption but there are other things there but in cycling actually also what you only consider there is the net mechanical power you don't consider the gross mechanical power and should you really look at the let's say on your biochemical efficiency you you should not look at the net mechanical power you should look at the gross mechanical power but that's even before we start to get into vectors power vectors force vectors and other things uh even in a threedimensional plane as you do cycling because this is something we can extract from the bometers today. So in running, so in running, yes. So one of the things you have you have more degrees of freedom, there's more inefficiency, there's probably a lower relationship or a more strained relationship between between gross and net power. This is maybe one of the reasons for why it is not as widely adopted uh in in running as it is in cycling because it is still debated what really is running power?

[00:05:45] How do you really quantify it? uh and this is something that even I I even discuss with with the with the team at the stride. So when we we are having our regular calls and we are diving into the topic then even we also sometime um I would say have our different opinions on on on how this really should be looked at because if you want to translate this into running then you have to look at only at let's say the propulsive power like could you imagine seeing this in I mean have they put these in Olympic sprinters and seen the power numbers there? No, it has, let's say, put this way, commercially available, this has its limitations because since you do motion capture, you need to do a little bit of filtering, you can't you can't take out because it's going to be so much noise. Exactly.

[00:06:28] Because as you said, you have so many degrees of of freedom. If you're going to output all let's say all the vectors that basically you were able to measure with let's say just with strain gauge based power meters on a bike today, people wouldn't be able to utilize. That's why you condense it down to a single power me let's say single number that is there for most people. But if you had that if you had that force plate chip in their insole, you could at least capture uh force normalized to weight with each step, right? Yes. So what you what you can do and this is validated.

[00:06:56] So if you for example run on a track, a track which has force plates or you run on specialized treadmills that has force plates integrated in them, you will basically see that the curves are the same. So this is the way let's say this is the external validation of the device is good. uh both in terms of that it captures uh the the the force curves but also here with when you have motion capture devices you can also capture the foot path as well. So this is something we can visualize in 3D today after the event when you are doing running. We can see what happened there fresh fatigued throughout the race when it's technical and other things. But I think the reason why this is not as widely adopted is because in science this is still debated on how do we really capture how do we really capture and quantify uh mechanical or power for running. Stride have taken a smart approach to this uh to make it let's say commercially viable and that is that they output it as a um let's say call it a metabolic power. So if you actually went on a treadmill and you went running and you looked at it versus your oxygen consumption you will basically see that this this measures perfectly with cycling that's without having a bicycle near you at all. So you can say well this is what you expect. So when you're at a certain power then with this would have a certain metabolic cost. But what how I use it as I I don't like it because I don't like let's say modeled numbers. I want to have raw numbers. So in my case I basically I'm extracting basically the let's say the net and the gross mechanical power or the positive and the negative mechanical power because these are the components I want to have because I have view to master I have metabolic devices. So I I don't need a metabolic equivalent. I want to have the raw because I'm using as an interface to gorge the difference like for example on a Formula 1 car.

[00:08:32] What really matters in the end there? What hits the ground? Yeah. What really matters in the end there is how fast can you go around the track for the full event with the a certain amount of fuel because there's a limitation to how much fuel you can have in your car. Like that's the that's the true input and the true output. Your engine output in this kind of is actually secondary. It's easy to think that we won't have the biggest engine but big engine without efficiency is still bad. So this is the engine it becomes more of a device to measure let's say you look at the power and you look at how efficiently are you able to translate this fuel out into speed over let's say the event or velocity. So uh the for me having access to the net mechanical power and gross mechanical power and then you have the metabolic devices this allow me on the one side look at when we change something in running. So let's say you change for example your shoes or you change your your training you can now I can have a much more granular understanding of am I influencing the biomechanical part of of of the training or is it the biochemical part of the training but in order to do so you have to have that interface that basically let's say distinguishes between gross mechanical power and net mechanical power and the interface between gross mechanical power and net mechanical power is only the let's say work efficiency like how efficiently are you working but not metabolizing or or moving because you all in the end you have to take this power and and and and be able to output into into into velocity.
