## Description

Alex Hutchinson is a sports science journalist, author of the book Endure—which explores the science of endurance and the real limits of human performance—and former competitive runner for the Canadian national team. In this episode, Alex tells the story of his “aha moment” during a meaningless track meet that catapulted his running career and seeded his interest in the power of the mind. He then explains the science behind VO2 max, the difference between maximum aerobic capacity and efficiency, and extracts insights from examples of extreme human performance, such as the recent attempts to break the 2-hour mark in the marathon. Finally, he brings it back to what this all means for the everyday person: optimal exercise volume for maintaining health, how to avoid acute and chronic injuries, how to diversify your exercise portfolio, HIIT protocols, and much more.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast with Alex Hutchinson:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode explores the science of endurance, human performance limits, and the role of the brain in athletic performance. Alex Hutchinson, a former competitive runner turned science journalist, discusses his journey from physics PhD to journalism, and shares insights from his book "Endure." The conversation covers topics ranging from VO2 max testing to injury prevention, high-intensity interval training, and the future of marathon running.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- VO2 max plateaus indicate physiological limitations in oxygen utilization [00:45:00]
- Highest recorded VO2 max was 96.7 ml/kg/min by Oscar Svensson [00:55:00]
- Training can improve VO2 max but may decrease efficiency [01:05:00]
- Bed rest can cause 10-20% loss in aerobic capacity within weeks [02:00:00]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal recommendations:
- Include both strength and aerobic training [01:45:00]
- Maintain consistent activity to prevent dramatic fitness losses [02:00:00]
- Be patient with training progression to avoid injury [01:55:00]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Monitor acute vs. chronic training load ratios [01:50:00]
- Include high-intensity intervals as part of a balanced program [02:10:00]

4. **Exercise & Movement**:

Training methodologies:
- 80/20 rule for endurance training (80% easy, 20% hard) [01:15:00]
- Four-week rolling average for tracking training load [01:50:00]
- Importance of strength training for longevity [01:45:00]

Recovery strategies:
- Avoid complete bed rest when possible [02:00:00]
- Take planned breaks but maintain some activity [02:05:00]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"Training is mature by the 1960s - all the other stuff we worry about, nutritional aids and compression devices and ice baths, I'm not saying it doesn't help on an individual basis, but you can't see it in the record curves." [02:20:00]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What is the optimal ratio of high-intensity to low-intensity training for health vs. performance?
2. How can we better quantify the relationship between strength and longevity?
3. What are the best metrics for tracking training load in recreational athletes?

The transcript continues beyond this point, but these are the key highlights from the analyzed portion. Would you like me to analyze any specific aspect in more detail?

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia

[00:00:10] alex thanks so much for uh making time today to sit down and be part of our inaugural uh video podcast here this is uh i hope it's not a long run for a short slide so far it's been a long run but i have a feeling it's gonna be a long slide too well thanks for having me on peter i i really appreciate it and uh yeah this is gonna be fun so about two years ago was it two years ago okay yeah it would have been it would have been like february of 19 i read your book endure which i literally couldn't put down i think i read it in two days um and i was i just i mean it was it was fantastic um and since that time i've become such a huge fan um you're a very prolific writer i don't know how you do it if you just go to sort of you know search your name and go through all the magazine articles you write it's uh it's just a wonder you can do so much uh there are so many things i want to talk about today um but i want to start with just a bit of your background because you know you don't have a typical background right you have a phd in physics yeah yeah probably the the least useful phd in physics anyone has ever ever attained but yeah no i come from a different place in some ways i would say um you're a collegiate runner and we actually have some friends in common because i think we're of the same generation um remind me did you go to did you go to waterloo did you go to guelph where did you go i went to mcgill for undergrad and then and then grad school in england okay but yeah we come from the same same part of the world it's a it's a small pool so i think we've interacted with a few of the same people yeah and i think um some of my friends probably ran cross-country against you and you know ran track and stuff like that so for how long was track sort of your passion i would say it was the most important thing in my life until i was 28 um at that point and until that point i was still i would have put anything and everything aside if it meant like you know i mean i'm embarrassed to say it now i i made my brother reschedule his wedding for for a track meet um after 28 i kept training seriously until my early 30s i still run six days a week train race all that but yeah 28 was it was until then it was the most important thing in my life and when did that start what age were you was this like sixth grade you know i mean how serious were you in grade school yeah i mean i i like to say i did win a race in senior kindergarten i beat steven mills who nice kid but the big kid and i was like wow i beat the big kid um so i've always been the guy who liked to run around and i ran elementary school cross country uh which involved showing up for a race once a year and and i did well in that um i started i joined a track club when i was 15 the university of toronto track club with the idea that i would train for three months because i was in a lucky position because my birthday was up after september 1st so i could compete with the people a year younger than myself and i thought well let's you know let's use leverage every edge i've got i'll train hard for these three months to see if i can stomp on these grade nines and uh it worked i i ran well and i kind of got hooked and realized that i wasn't gonna quit after three months where did you go to high school in toronto i went to a school called university of toronto schools which is a very very small school it's academically focused um from an athletic perspective the really nice thing is if you want to be on a team you're on the team like it's uh the qualifying process for school teams was going through the hallways and basically like press gangs trying to get enough people for a team so when you went to college obviously mcgill is a great academic school in canada they don't have athletic scholarships was it a difficult decision to say hey i'm going to stay in canada for university or try to go to a u.s school where i could sort of parlay some of my running talents to actually get some money for school yeah there's a couple of factors that that played into that one is that i got mononucleosis in my last year of high school i missed basically my entire final year of high school so i was a very very good like grade 11 runner and then back then in ontario there were 13 grades but the high school i went to uh only one up to grade 12 basically so i graduated from high school without ever having competed at this as a senior in high school so i wasn't good enough to that that's a long rambling way of saying i wasn't good enough to get a scholarship to any reasonable place uh in the united states so that that discussion wasn't even really open to me um whether i would have it's a it's an alternative scenario that i i would have been attracted by the idea for sure um but that door wasn't open to me anyway and when you showed up at mcgill what was sort of your specialty were you i know you were a miler were you how how competitive were you at the 800 how competitive were you at 5k and other distances away from the mile i was a 1500 meter runner when i showed up and with the assumption that i would be moving up to 5000 you know any minute now that i didn't i didn't have a lot of sprint speed i was a strength oriented 1500 meter runner as it turns out the coach at mcgill was a x 400 meter 400 800 guy and his his training was very um sprint oriented it was it was long recoveries and all-out intervals and so i actually ran better at 800 than i expected i would but uh it was pretty clear that 1500 was kind of the low end of my of my sweet spot i had so many friends who ran um and many of them said that the 800 was the most painful race there was and i i guess in swimming that's comparable to the 200 and i think there's something to be said for that that that uh sub two-minute all-out effort is really an unpleasant uh physiologic existence which we're going to talk a lot about that physiology but would you agree with that having run so many distances 100 100 the most painful race that i could run was the 800 and you know i and i also think about this in the context of workouts specifically you know at mcgill talking about more sprint oriented workouts longer rest these sort of hard two minute efforts if i wanted an easy workout the the intuition would be like oh you want to ask your coach for more recovery or whatever and i it was the opposite for me it's like if if the workout seemed too hard but can we cut the rest in half because then i know we're not going to be in that very high lactate regime which is you know 800 meters to a two-minute all-out effort is the single way to get the highest possible lactate levels and so to me and to me that's synonymous with with extreme suffering i i'd rather run a marathon than an 800 in some ways yes i found um when i used to tweak around with lactate levels i found that my personal best best as the highest lactate was doing a 200 im in swimming so 200 200 individual medley because it's upper and lower body with all four strokes it's that 200 so you know two minutes of unbearable pain um you could get your your personal best lactate could be achieved with that personal worst call it and yeah i think that's something a lot of people don't there's a there's an assumption that the longer equals harder and it's like man no there's a whole different world of of pain that you can get into in the if you're willing to push yourself hard in those those two minute efforts two to ten minute efforts call it now in your book endure you talk about a very interesting almost a throwaway meet you know we would call these dual meets and swimming right um and it was sort of again i don't know if this was the turning point for you but but it's sort of as you read it it comes across as a moment when you first realize there's more to this than just the numbers like there's something going on in my head that is changing the speed that i run in was that i mean i want to hear the story i want people to hear the story but was that a big aha moment for you or was that just the first of many steps along a pathway i'd say it was a huge aha moment for me at the at that time but i'm not sure i understood what the aha was i knew that this like this is strange and in hindsight i realized that this is what was that and i'm sure we'll we'll dig into this but it was you know this this started my movement away from just like we can calculate everything from physiology that that endurance is a little more complicated than the equations that you might start with well tell the story because it's i mean again you write about it so eloquently but it's it's kind of hard to believe especially as someone who i'm not a runner and i'm not you know i'm not good at anything but i still understand physiology quite well and as the story is unfolding you're thinking there's a mistake um so so yeah walk us through that night so yeah as you said totally meaning meaningless meat um didn't have any big goals but i was at that point this was third year university and for about four years almost three and a half years i'd been running between 401 402 403 for 1500 meters 1500 meters is about 17 seconds shorter than a mile so we're talking like as a it's kind of like the poor man's four minute mile it's a significant barrier for runners but it's not at the level of a four minute mile and so for me it was like that was kind of a career goal i wanted to break four minutes i if i could get into the threes uh i i felt like okay i could i i would have achieved something significant um and but like i said ever since high school i'd been running very close couldn't quite do it and at this meaningless meet there was no competition whatsoever it was going to be i was going to win the race no matter what um and sort of at the last minute i said well i might as well go hard and just see what i can do and and it's i'm unlikely to do anything special in this context but i'll go hard and uh this indoor track is 200 meters long so you get splits every about 30 seconds and i came through the first lap and the time keeper called out 27 seconds for 200 meters which is it's about five seconds faster than four minute pace which is an eternity an absolute eternity 27 seconds is extremely fast and it's a terrible way to start a 1500 meters race if you're trying to run sub four minutes um and so i had you know conflicting motions of like oh god you idiot with oh i actually feel surprisingly relaxed but i need to dial it back because presumably alex you'd run 27s in practice as splits and you know what 27 feels like and so on some level you're thinking i feel really good because this doesn't feel as fast as 27 right yeah so you you absolutely have a you're dialed into what 27 should feel like but you and this is maybe an early clue you also know that nothing feels the same in a race that there's some magic that happens in a race and something that should have felt impossible will feel relaxed and so you can kind of dismiss those those discrepancies and say well this is the magic of the race we don't know where it comes from but it's the magic and same thing in the second lap i came through in 57 seconds which is way too fast but i still felt relatively like good and third lap 127. and so at that point the two things were happening one is that i realized i was having a really good day and two i realized that i the splits were no longer meaningful to me because you know you memorize the splits for the races you think you're going to run at that point i didn't know what 127 extrapolated to and so the best decision i maybe made in my racing life was like stop listening to the splits this is a special day run put your head down and go for it so i i did stop listening to the splits and i i hammered home and i ran 352 um which was yeah nine seconds faster than my personal best at the time and again you really have to emphasize that a one second personal best would have been a a huge victory for me and you know you don't nobody pbs by nine seconds uh after they've been training hard for four years five years so it was just absolutely mind-boggling and you know to cut to the chase the the the post script of the story is you know chatting to one of my teammates afterwards who had taken my splits for me so that i could as as you do you put them in your training log and you plot them in lotus 123 and you analyze them obsessively for months so i wanted to get my splits and he's like yeah pretty good race and i was like yeah i can't believe i went out in 27 seconds like you didn't go out in 27 seconds you were like 30 seconds what second lap 60 seconds what so at the time my theory was that uh this was a median quebec in sherbrooke and so it's like oh the guy was maybe translating from french to english and there was a three second lag maybe he just missed the start with his watch i don't know what happened but he he he basically tricked me he fooled me into into thinking i was having this amazing day and uh and and then i did and so that was what and and in itself that was like a very bizarre circumstance and then the question is what happens after that do i become a four-minute runner again or can i run 352 again and the answer is neither i ran 349 in my list next 1500 and i ran 344 in the race after that which qualified me for the olympic trials that summer so that's why i say you asked was this an aha moment and it's like i knew right at the time it's like something has changed and somehow so i knew it it changed my career as an athlete but then in hindsight i realized it also changed my understanding of what this whole endeavor was about and what we were trying to optimize yeah that that's i mean again i still i still sort of struggle with that and of course you want to extrapolate that does the same thing apply to strength sports well presumably it does right could you easily trick somebody into thinking you know someone who thinks i could just never break 500 pounds for a deadlift and they're sort of forever stuck at 495 pounds but is there anything really preventing them from dead lifting 550 pounds which would be as much of a breakthrough if they simply believe that that's how much weight was if they simply believed that it was only 475 pounds on the bar um so i i should add a post script here is that the book came out my old coach from high school who i've you know i continue to stay in touch with he's a very big influence in my life he read the book and he's like show me your training log like which lots of people have said right like come on this wasn't all in your head and i was like okay here's my training log you you remember it check it out you tell me was i ready to run 352 because there wasn't a big discontinuity in my training it wasn't like i knew i was fitter i knew i should be able to break four minutes but there wasn't like i suddenly uh was doing workouts way faster and he looked through it and his conclusion was you know what alex you were in shape to run mid 350s for sure you were not in shape to run you were not doing workouts that predicted 344. so in a way the first breakthrough might have been a lot in some ways just catching up to the ways i was holding myself back the the way you know i was i was overthinking things stressing out all these things that people do in competitive scenarios um i caught up to what i should be doing and then that gave me so much confidence that i kind of slingshoted right past where i should have been and i was able to you know there's always a conversion between what are you doing in in workouts versus what can you do in races everyone should be able to do more in a competitive scenario than they can do on a rainy tuesday night in stoke or whatever and i i think the best conversions i ever had the time when i was competing the farthest above my sort of baseline workout fitness was in the months after that breakthrough because i was just riding that high and i believed i was you know semi-invincible and then so this is 96 right yeah so you go to the olympic trials for the 1500 how did you run there uh it's it's on youtube it's the worst it's it's horrible i i came i can't remember who's dead last or 11th in the final i made the final which was okay and the you know when i look back to it you can see me on i'm on the standing line next to graham hood who's the canadian record holder at the time and so the camera lingers on graham hood because so you can see me the whole time and i just look i i think i might have written this book i can't remember but it looks like i i'm i'm like waking up from a dream and looking around and you know in my pajamas or something like that i just you know i don't belong i'm there you know i don't believe i belong there a year later i came back to to the national championships and by that time i'd had a year to consolidate no no i belong i'm a guy who runs in the low 340s and that time i ran well i ran i ran i came forth that was probably my that was my best finish at outdoor nationals um and it was it was just took a while for my confidence to fully catch up to me i think that was so there was yeah that was how that played out and did you end up running the actual mile the like the 1604 or whatever the the sort of the non-metric mile because you would have by that point broken the four-minute mile right if yeah you're poking your finger into a raw wound oh god i'm sorry if you take my best 1500 uh and you plug it into the official conversions tables it suggests that i would have run four flat point zero one okay uh i i i deprecate those that entirely i don't believe it at all i'm confident that on that day i'll go to my grave saying i would have run 359.9 that day but in terms of miles you know the thing is there aren't the miles just not very frequently run i ran two competitive miles in my career uh won an indoor mile uh indoor like early season when i was in college and then about four years later uh so 97 i ran my best i was that i got a knee injury was out 98 99 2000 2001 i was trying to come back and it was a slow process and i ran a mile in oregon at uh hayward field which is the sort of uh most famous place it's a good place to go sub four but i did not i ran like 406. i just wasn't back to my to my champion and those are the only two miles that i ran in my career you also and i regret it i it's it's a big thing like four minute mile is it's a very big thing how many people have broken four minutes for the mile roughly in history it's a good question i'm going to say i think it's a few thousand it's it's fewer than more people have stood on top of everest i think is is the thing that people tend to say i i i think that's still true i think there's something like 800 or 900 americans uh and and globally two to four thousand i could i could be wrong but that's my my gut memory so by the time you're you know in into the mid mid to late 90s you're now a phd student i'm guessing did you go straight into the phd program i went straight there and i did a phd in britain where phds are it's kind of a phd light uh they're it's not as rigorous as a full north american phd i mean it's it's hard in many ways but it's it's different so i did a three year phd from 97 to 2000. and what was the itch you were scratching there were you a phd student in undergrad i've heard i'm sorry were you a physics student in undergrad yeah yeah so i studied at mcgill you have to choose pretty early and so i declare from i did a uh pretty much all physics in second third and fourth year um not neces i mean i enjoyed it but this was one of those things for me that i didn't know what i wanted to do and one of the pieces of advice i got coming out of high school is if you don't want to don't don't know what you want to do do the hardest thing possible because you can study physics and then become a journalist but you cannot study journalism and then become a physicist or you know in in there's it's it's there are there's a gradient and you can't you can you can only slide in harder yeah yeah exactly so that you know and the memory that i have i have a brother who's who's five years older than me so he was finishing university when i was finishing high school and i had actually applied in i think i applied to mcgill in history initially but my brother had a friend who was finishing up in physics at mcgill and she she told him that in her class there'd been like 60 guys and five 60 men and five women starting the program and they graduated four men and four women i thought that sounds hard i'm switching my my uh my major to physics so that that's kind of how that started um and then coming out of undergrad i really just didn't know what i wanted to do i applied to a bunch of things again in a variety of fields but because i studied physics and undergrad the best opportunity i got was to go and do a phd in physics and i thought it would be a reasonable way of allowing me to continue my running career and it would be a chance to go overseas and see a new culture and have fun and uh and you know and i was i was certainly willing to give physics a shot i was considering physics as a career but my decision was was framed in a way that even if i left physics which i did end up in in in the end doing i had zero regrets about spending three years in england uh studying physics how did your training change when you went to england versus canada what were they what were the sort of most what were the biggest changes you experienced yeah that's actually a really interesting question because there's some huge culture changes in terms of the actual like how much do you run and stuff not as big a deal but you get to cambridge and i you know i show up for the first meeting with the team and i meet the the the training secretary and i'm like what do you mean training secretary well he's the guy who who's gonna set our workouts what do you mean what about don't we have a coach like no the the student the the athletic scene there is student run so there's there's kind of a continuum in many things between the us at one extreme britain and at the other extreme and canada is often in the middle and so sports in the u.s collegiate sports are a big big deal as you know as you know and um sports are not collegiate sports are a medium deal in canada and they're not a big deal in in the uk and so going there was a you know an iron open opener in many ways it's like we're going to the national championships so we have to hire you know we have to rent a van and then arrange a youth hostel where we can sleep the night before the championships like that that's not how collegiate sports work in the u.s it's not even how they work in canada but the the flip side is you you have a lot of autonomy and you take responsibility for your training and your success you're not uh a sort of acolyte or baby just being sort of fed what to do from from day to day and so i you know i don't have a systematic study just to support this but i think the the retention in terms of the lifelong retention the people the way the the extent to which people develop lifelong habits and lifelong love of sport and activity and competition i think is much higher because you learn to be autonomous in university as opposed to the classic thing in the us is you're there for four years you're representing your your college and then college ends and it's like all right i'm gonna go work a job and and there's no feeling that you you haven't do there's no encouragement to to stay involved in in sport and you haven't developed the skills required to self-motivate self-organize you know book that youth hostel or whatever the case may be so um that was the that was the biggest change i'd say so as you're wrapping up your your phd in physics um you have to make another decision right which is am i going to go back to the us or canada do a postdoc and then get on presumably an academic track um do i want to take this and move into industry where i can utilize this because obviously at the time there was probably no shortage of things that phd in physics could have been doing in silicon valley or wall street right both would have been the heydays um what you know or do something altogether different so how did you how did you approach that decision yeah so i mean you're right this was you know making these decisions in 99 and early 2000 and my phd was in semiconductor physics it was you know it was a good time to be in semiconductor physics and and there was also there's definitely the pull of both consulting and finance which is you know just the same way that it happens with ivy league uh students in the states in britain if you're at oxbridge they're lining up to to offer you vast sums of money um like i said at the top running was the most important thing in my life until i was 28. so uh i considered some job offers um but i wanted to focus on running and i was very very fortunate to uh i have parents who who who had a house they were willing to have me move back in and see what happened so i spent and at this point i was coming back from this three-year injury process i was so i had been on a trajectory that i thought was pointing you know favorably but in 98 but then by 2000 when i was finished my phd in early 2001 um i'd been out for a few years and it wasn't clear and i just wanted to give myself one year to see if i could get back on that track of someone who might have a shot of making the olympics so i moved back home i did some tutoring of high school students but basically i uh i ran and i went to the library and i checked out they had a couple racks of uh world classics so i basically went through their entire rack of classic books you know 19th century literature 20th century literature all the stuff that i didn't get to do as a physics student as you know as an undergrad this is not a this was not a liberal arts program where i had had time to pursue a bunch of things it was all physics and math so i spent a year running it was fun i qualified for some national teams i read a lot of books and i did a lot of thinking about what i wanted to do and after a year i hadn't made the progress running wise that could justify like well that could pay for an apartment for example so i was like yeah okay i'm 25 now it's it's or 24 or whatever it was um i need to do something else and so at that point i ended up applying for some postdocs and i ended up taking one at the university of maryland uh sponsored by the national security agency in quantum computing and uh you know again it was sort of a hedge bets it was like i'll i'll take this and because the research sounds really interesting and the people are fun and it may lead to a physics career but it sounds fun enough and the one thing about academic life is if you're if if you choose you can make other other things like running your priority and so i i i went and i trained with a very very good training group led by a guy named matt centrowitz senior whose son went on to win the olympic gold medal in the 1500 in 2016. and uh so i spent two and a half years there in physics kind of giving physics and a shot but also be as a way of you know as much as i say running was the most important thing in my life until i was 28 it was never the only thing in my life and i also always wanted to be continuing to develop in other ways and and sort of um making sure that my cv wasn't going to be too empty uh at the inevitable point when i when i had to move on so so yeah so i took a postdoc at that point and went back into physics and then when you get to the end of that period of time presumably is that when you pivoted to journalism as the next step and if so i mean how in the world did you gain the confidence to do that because um that's i mean we've we've established that the gradient generally points in one direction and physics might be harder than journalism but i don't know that that's necessarily true at the individual level right and yeah it doesn't it doesn't impress anybody that you can you know solve the navy or stokes equation if you're if your job is to write an article um so it's always hard to kind of write history in retrospect because you see the patterns that you didn't see at the time and so i'm never sure how accurately can i can explain why i decided to do this but there were a couple things i did have the starting of an interest in journalism i hadn't pursued it earlier i wasn't like doing student newspapers in college or anything but i liked the idea of writing and i'd actually this is one thing that marks me as unusual i think as i had enjoyed writing up my phd everyone else is like oh i love doing experiments but i hate writing it up i was like man those experiments were hard but it's kind of fun trying to explain why i was doing what i was doing which is very hard to explain so i kind of thought i might like writing and i'd written a couple of it's it's a stretch to call them freelance pieces because they're basically like i'd written a back of the magazine piece for physics world and i'd written a piece for athletics magazine which is a track magazine in canada and then i applied and so i thought i'd like to give journalism a shot so i applied for a bunch of internships and as you were saying um you know it actually doesn't work as clearly as you might think i didn't get any of these internships and i thought okay this is my my hopes of trying journalism or stalling how am i getting you know do i need to sit up late at night and write articles and prove that i can do it and i ended up kind of deciding that it was a credentialing issue and both a credentialing issue and an urgency issue i needed to jump into the deep end and force myself to survive as a journalist and also have some way of showing people that i wasn't just a dilettante even though i was at the time but i needed to show them that i was serious about journalism that that i had decided to do it and then i was going to learn the basic skills so from when i was in while i was doing my postdoc i applied to a few different journalism schools for for master's programs and uh uh that was helped along by the fact that this was 2004 by this time and uh i was it was gonna i was timing it in such a way that it's like well i'm gonna give one last shot to make the olympics and if it doesn't omit trials or end of july i'll start journalism school right after that but what ended up happening is i got a stress fracture in my lower back three months before the olympic trials which meant i was out for 10 weeks and then i did about two weeks of jogging and then went to the olympic trials and just sort of as a farewell to running um but that made it easier because i knew that at that point my olympic dreams were over were officially over you know some might say they they were over before they even started but um so the you know i've been deciding that i didn't want to continue on with physics and i was considering journalism and then the end of running marked a natural transition for me at least the end of that part of my my track career um left something i wanted something else to be passionate about to be um to sort of pour that part of myself into and i guess the one other story i'll relate is that i actually remember at some point that year we were working long hours in the lab you know sometimes it was 12 14 hours in the lab and i would leave to do my runs or whatever and i remember coming into the lab one morning you know after we'd been there late oh we'd all been there late the night before and one of the guys asking me like oh did you see that story in physics today about you know whatever i was like no no i was in the lab for 16 or you know 14 hours or whatever it was yesterday i went home i did not think about physics i had zero interest in reading about physics when i got home and i kind of realized oh wait that's what some of these other guys do they love it it's their passion and that's great but it's not mine and so i needed to find something that uh or i wanted to find something that that that i wanted to keep doing where the you know where the work and the play overlapped a little bit and i you know i thought about things like music that i care about a lot and about running that i obviously care about a lot i thought what is the a possible way that i can have a chance of maybe pursuing some of these interests of mine in a professional way and journalism seem that that's what i think what pointed me to journalism is that it wouldn't be easy but there may be a chance that i could end up writing about running or travel or music or something like that now at this point alex you've obviously got tons of athletic experience as a runner your background in physics means you're there's nothing quantitatively you can't understand had you at this point delved into the physiology of running or was that not yet something you had really fully explored the depths of yet by the standards of what i would say now is no i didn't have a clue i knew nothing now i i was the kind of guy who when i got into running in high school i got books about running and you know one of the first books i got was tim knox's the laura or tymnosis lore of running which is 900 and something pages in the first 300 pages or so or physiology i didn't really understand the physiology when i went through it but i was you know familiar with the terms and there's some other i'm looking over at my my shelf right now i can you know access i've still got my original 1990 copy of lore of running right there and there's a book called better training for distance runners which is written co-written by a physiologist which so i had read all that stuff and i had this so i i could i could talk this sort of uh i don't know how to put this i i could i could talk about vo2 max and lactate threshold with with uh with other people who were interested in this stuff but i wouldn't say i had a deep understanding of where it came from i i had a superficial uh acquaintance with the concepts so begins another apprenticeship basically which is now you're you're getting to learn physiology as you start to write more and more about these topics yeah and then there was a you know it this was not right away i will say i did one year of journalism school and then i had 16 months as a as an intern at a newspaper called the ottawa citizen which had a great internship program at the time and i was you know covering car accidents and uh dog fashion shows and and you know what have you i learned to write i learned to write on deadline i wrote you know 250 stories or something you mentioned being prolific like when you're the the lowest man on the totem pole at a daily newspaper you learn to write fast you know multiple stories a day um and then you know my internship finished and i became freelance uh not because i had a bold vision but because there were no jobs and you know initially my first contact through a friend was with the bottom line which you may your subscription may have lapsed but it's canada's accounting monthly um so i went to some conferences on like forensic accounting and stuff like that um and so i didn't immediately because in a sense i was running away from physics and running was still a bit of a you know a tender spot i sort of poured so much into it so i wasn't looking to necessarily immerse myself right away in these things and it's only i would say it was about 2008 so a couple years after i finished journalism school and after i finished my newspaper internship that i started to to get into writing about uh the science of running to sort of bring those two interests together go back to that internship at the ottawa citizen i want to understand a little bit more about what you learned in journalism school as it pertained to teaching you how to write and then what you learned sort of during that internship where you're you know you're on the ground right it's the it's the uh it's the rubber meeting the road so to speak what were the two different skill sets there and uh how can somebody i'm asking this for purely selfish reasons by the way how can somebody who's constantly interested in improving their writing learn from that if they're neither able to go to journalism school nor uh take a formal internship for a newspaper where they have an editor that's you know giving them feedback constantly presumably yeah so i i would say what i got out of journal journalism school was an understanding of the the jargon for one thing but also the the forms we tend to think of writing as as a you know you you think of what you want to say and then you write it down um in high school a lot of us learn the you know the the hamburger essay there's five paragraphs an introduction then there's three main points and there's a conclusion and in each you have a topic sentence in each paragraph so there's this really rigid uh structure and what i don't think i realized until i went to journalism school is that there are underlying forms for most of the articles we read and a news story has a very specific form used it's called the inverted pyramid uh in a feature article with the kind of thing you read in the new yorker or something it also has a certain form now for good writers that form is invisible and that form is also played with and your expectations are are uh you know dashed sometimes you you think you know where the story is going and then it goes somewhere else yeah and so on and so on the point isn't that that you need to be slavishly uh sort of following those forms but you need to understand what the forms are so you can understand when you're deviating from them you're doing it on purpose and you can understand what a reader's expectation is even if the reader himself or herself doesn't realize what that expectation is and so there's things like yeah you need to have a billboard paragraph that tells the reader what to expect and it depends anyway i'll i'll just sum up by saying that i learned about form now learning about form is not the same as as mastering the form and so you go to to an internship at a daily paper and actually you know good internships hopefully you're getting an editor who's looking at your stuff and you're getting a little feedback but the real the reality is it's it's a you know it's a daily beast and there's not a lot of time for that but you're writing um sometimes three stories in a day but certainly typically a story a day you're rarely getting more than a day to write a story and you're getting a sense from from editors and from other people of what's working and what's not and you can see what's working and what's not and so uh there's the just doing it part of it but i think that would have been harder to benefit from if i didn't have a sense of of of what the structures are uh that that you're that you're trying to transcend you're trying to be more than just plugging in the pieces of a of a jigsaw puzzle but i mean i i give a talk on science writing a while ago to some some postdocs and uh and some gra and grad students and i was you know really the the main point i wanted to get to them is that every piece of writing has form whether it's a uh you know a grant application or a uh you know a scientific publication or particular particularly a lot of scientists are interested in communicating their their uh their results to a wider public and they have to understand what the you know if they're writing for a newspaper op-ed page what what is the form and i and i guess the other thing i say said in that context is also understanding who the audience is so and that those two things are are interlinked if you if you understand who the audience is you understand what their expectations are in terms of what the piece is going to flow like so anyway that's what that boils down to is is obviously doing lots of it but also trying to look at the writing that you like the stuff that when if you if you see a book or an article that that that you like or that explains things clearly trying to trying to break down like so what are they doing here what what makes this work you know did they have a particular you know a a particularly good introduction section or you know whatever the case may be so reading critically i guess is what i'm saying i almost wonder if it's somewhat like athletes where you could have the same debate about good writers being born versus made you know i in terms of scientific writers i i think sid mukherjee is incredible um and i read his stuff and i i it's no different than you know watching a remarkable athlete do something and you sort of think to yourself there's probably no way ever that i could write like that even if i devoted the every waking moment in my remaining life to this study any more than i could swim or bike or run as well as you know the most amazing athlete i see doing those things do you do you think that there's a parallel there i i think this is parallel that i would extend the parallel which is that um we can look at michael phelps swimming and say i will never be able to swim like that but it's a mistake to then say swimming is all genetic and therefore i am doomed not to get better at swimming than i am right now and and most people don't come anywhere close to fulfilling their quote unquote genetic potential so for sure and i you know especially when i read fiction or when i read non-fiction by good fiction writers who know how to write non-fiction if it's not to get too confusing and and the the the level of language and uh uh just imagery to be honest it's sometimes a little depressing to me because it's i feel the same as you i'm like yeah there's nothing there's no amount of you know workshops or practice that will make me write like that and so i think another thing is just to kind of i don't know this maybe this is to defeat us but own who you are and so i know that for me i'm not a poetic writer but what i hope to be is a very clear expository and explanatory writer so i will never paint the picture that that that i really admire in some other writer's writing but hopefully i can i can excel at another uh aspect of it yeah now that that's actually a great way to compare the two um so so with that let's let's go into some of this stuff around um well let's just start with sort of something you've already alluded to let's explain what it is talk about how much it matters and then kind of get into some examples so let's let's start with a term that many people have heard before but i don't think most people understand what vo2 max really means and eventually we're going to talk about running efficiency and lactate threshold we're going to get into all this stuff but let's let's make sure people understand what vo2 max is both in an absolute term and then in a manner that we normalize it by by weight um and uh what it is and what it isn't how it's measured and how it matters and maybe we'll even talk about some notable exceptions sure yeah so vo2 max is the one physiological parameter that anyone who's involved in endurance has heard of and and has some sense of and the the sort of the first order analogy is it's kind of the size of your engine so physiologically vo2 max is telling you how much oxygen or how quickly you can take oxygen from the air into your lungs pump it get it into your blood pump it to your muscles and then have your muscles use it in the metabolic processes that will provide energy to move you to do whatever you want to do so it's a rate it's how much oxygen per unit time can you process absolutely flat out now the the sort of backstory here is it was it was first sort of discussed or measured in the 1920s by a guy named av hill who was actually a very good runner and the observation that he made is if you have someone you ask someone to go out and run at a gentle pace they'll consume let's say two liters of oxygen per per minute then you tell them to speed up now they're doing three liters of oxygen per minute tell them to speed up again and now they're going pretty much maybe not as fast as they can but they're going fast and they're losing four liters of oxygen per minute so you tell them to speed up again and you measure it oh they're only using four liters of oxygen in a minute just like last time so speed up again and they're still just using four liters of oxygen a minute there's a plateau there's a point at which even though you're working harder you're not using any more oxygen and so this plateau looks like it's a physiological limitation and it probably is in some you know it's a controversial thing but basically you've reached a point where no matter how hard you push yourself you can't get more oxygen and so you can still go faster because you're starting to use other forms of energy but this is the limits of your aerobic system this tells you well what it tells you what we can get into it's not clear what it tells you but it tells you it tells you exactly what i just said it tells you how much how much oxygen you can use does that tell you exactly how fast you can run no there's there's a there are a lot of other factors but it's that tells you what sort of aerobic engine you have to play with now people have you know talk i mean i remember in high school i mean we would sort of talk about well which athletes have the highest vo2 max is it the norwegian cross-country skiers is the professional runners and cyclists and things like that but people are usually used to hearing these numbers reported not in liters per minute but in milliliters per minute per kilogram so give an example so people understand those differences because we usually talk about the outliers is a as a number that's a a bigger number than two liters or five liters it would be you know sort of 75 80 milliliters per just explain to people how how those are different sure so i i'll use my own numbers when i you know typically when i was tested i could get about a little bit more than five liters per minute so 5.15.2 if i remember correctly um now if you compared me to a rower the road would make me look pathetic because the rower would be using seven liters a minute or or more um but the rower is also huge uh you know twice my size or whatever and and and so that doesn't necessarily mean that that rower is better at using oxygen for me because the roller has way more muscle and so the rower is is the amount of oxygen reaching any given muscle cell may be lower so if you want to compare apples to apples between athletes of different sizes you divide at least for a crude approximation you just divide by weight and so the numbers we usually hear are rather than liters of oxygen per minute it's milliliters of oxygen per minute per kilogram of body weight so for me five liters of oxygen per per minute works out to something like 80 milliliters of oxygen per minute per kilogram of body weight um so and you know there's a whole rabbit hole to go into is to say well why are we dividing by whole body weight because you know there's a bunch of things like skeleton you know there there's not just on organs and stuff that don't scale the adipose tissue doesn't matter i mean you could argue a better comparison would be total liters per minute divided by lean mass divided by time uh or normalized to time and then you're you know you're at least getting the the metabolically active tissue presumably yeah and and you know there's papers where they do things like let's divide by weight to the power of 0.68 or 0.7 which is another way of getting it effectively it's a way of approximating just the lean mass the metabolically active tissue so and you can go down that rabbit hole but as i suspect what you'll want to get to is it's like at a certain point it it doesn't matter that much anyway so we don't need to to uh like you can't just measure someone's vo2 max and know how fast they're going to race so it's it's it's useful but it's not it really especially for comparing between people now comparing within yourself it tells you something if you've increased your or if your vo2 max is decreased but in that sense it doesn't matter what what you're dividing by i remember there was a guy that i used to ride with and this was not that long ago maybe five or six years ago when i was still you know somewhat competitive at least with myself um and uh actually it's funny my number was just like yours except i was heavier so i was about 5.1 to 5.2 liters but i weighed more so that worked out to about 70 mils per mig per kig was my vo2 max his was 55 to 60 but i there was never a day that i could ride faster than him not one there's simply and i always felt like although we did the test so many times i kept feeling like the machine must have been broken on him like i knew my 70 was about right because i'd been tested so much and that was lower than it had been when i was younger so it seemed appropriate but i was always convinced that that there's no way he's only 55. the reality of it is he may well have been and he may have simply been a far more efficient athlete which we're going to get into um before we get to the story of oscar svensson let's talk a little bit about historically what people have believed the limits are of vo2 max yeah you know what we don't i mean we don't even have to go very far historically to get into a whole mudslide of of confusion and debate and and and disagreement um there's a there's a lot of places along the way that that could in some circumstances be the bottleneck uh normally people tend to assume that um so what what is it that causes vo2 max to plateau is essentially what i think what we're talking about and and just one thing i should add here it's like why is that interesting it's because you think well if you want to measure endurance just have someone run a mile or whatever you know as hard as they can but any test like that depends on motivation depends on whether you pace it right there's all these factors that come into it the nice thing about vo2 max is that in theory it's independent of uh of motivation that's why peop that's why scientists like it because it doesn't matter if the if if you know the the the subject doesn't really care about the study if you see a plateau you know that's that's a property of their body and not a product of whether they were excited about the study so the question yeah the question is this plateau what is it that causes it and it could be in the lungs it could be the heart it could be the circulation it could be the muscle's ability to extract it and then i don't want to pretend that i know the answer because it's still controversial that the picture that emerges is that almost every part along this cascade is engineered right to the point more or less to what it needs to be and so if you perturb any of those uh those elements it could you can get limitations so for example the conventional wisdom is that your lungs are not a limitation you can always breathe enough in and so then the question is can you diffuse enough oxygen from your lungs into your bloodstream and so on and so forth um there are situations where and it's been for decades it's been conventional wisdom that the lungs don't respond to training because they're overbuilt uh there was just a paper published a big review uh in the last month or two arguing that you know in some cases the lungs aren't overbuilt and one of the situations is highly trained endurance athletes they can be limited by their ability to uh to get enough oxygen in and you can also run into situations where an athlete is so fit their heart is so strong it can uh it pumps blood past your lungs so quickly that it doesn't have time to fully stock up on oxygen you get something called exercise induced arterial hypoxemia so this this is usually an issue at altitude but in elite endurance athletes is actually about half of them exhibited even at sea level so they're already running into a limitation just in getting oxygen from their lungs to their bloodstream and then at every stage of the way there can be limitations if anything is knocked off kilter uh and certainly right down to the ability of the muscles to first extract the oxygen from the bloodstream and then the to to make use of it metabolically in the in the mitochondria so it's there isn't one single answer which is why you get these debates because everyone is cons i have evidence that this is the limit it's like yeah but i have evidence that this is the limit and that's the limit and they're all the limit yeah i've always wanted to see the experiment where you took a group of athletes maybe this has been done and you you run them all to max and then you reduce the fio2 of the incoming oxygen so normally we do it with room air so you're getting a the fractional inhalation of oxygen is 21 and the way of course just for the listener the way these things work is the the way they're calculating how much oxygen is being consumed is they're measuring the uh the concentration of oxygen on the way out so you're calculating the delta and so i've always thought well wouldn't it be interesting to start selectively dropping fio2 21 20 19 18 now presumably if the lungs aren't the limitation you should still see the same absolute delta and you could at least start to eliminate one of those variables which would be fio2 and capillary exchange and then you start pointing to some of these other variables again i'm sure somebody has done this experiment but i don't know what it yielded yeah probably not with the the fine tooth comb that that you're suggesting people have compared you know 21 to 10 or whatever and 15 and uh yeah it's hard i mean it's interesting it's it's interesting when you go to altitude or you know or the equivalent when you reduce the amount of oxygen uh funny things happen like there's you know the the first thing you would think would happen is like you can't get enough oxygen so you're gonna be go anaerobic sooner you're gonna produce more lactate and yet the opposite happens there's something called the lactate paradox if you if you try and exercise to exhaustion at lower levels of altitude you actually give up when your lactate levels are lower than you would at sea level and so and and there's debate about what causes this and even whether it's a real thing but the the picture that that makes sense to me is is that it's these things are not just about how much oxygen is making it to the muscle it's also like what is that what is your brain oxygen level and so you're getting these other circuit breakers that are starting to come down that aren't even on this path from mouth to lungs to to blood to muscle there there's other factors that are saying whoa wait a second oxygen is getting a little low so we're going to actually cut off the supply to the muscles or reduce it in order to make sure that we don't get stupid so like prior to oscar how because i want to talk about this kid his story is so interesting and you wrote you wrote a great article about it and i've read many articles about him including articles in you know physiologic journals um you'd had a couple sort of freaks of nature out there in the 90s right so 90 plus milliliters per um per kilogram per minute of vo2 max um what happens in sort of a garden variety day of december 2012 do you remember remember when this uh when he shows up to a training lab he's how old is he he's like 17 or something like 17 i think he was he was a former downhill skier um who had taken like a talent screen uh to see whether he'd be suitable for something like cycling and he's i think he'd scored just untrained just off off the downhill slopes he was 74 or something like that 74 milliliters per kilogram per minute and uh and so that he passed and and so he they started training as a cyclist as a teenager and then you know pretty quickly scored 83 then 85 then 92 and uh that then he ended up scoring the initial reports was he were that he scored 97.5 but i think when the science scientific journal came out they said it was 96.7 um which either way was still higher than had ever been recorded in human history and well and so and you know one thing we should we should say is there are reports of people in their 90s but reports vo2 max high vo2 max numbers are they they sprout very easily uh because it's hard to do these tests right and in fact a lot of the tests that people the garden variety machinery used to do these tests is not designed to handle seven liters of oxygen per minute and so uh you get spurious results and you get so the the previous king was a guy named bjorn daly uh a norwegian the greatest cross-country skier in history who in the late 90s reputedly tested 1996. 96.0 or 96.6 depending on who you ask this was never published in a journal this was basically uh the the norwegian ski team leaked it to the press as a kind of pr move and i asked a guy who who was working in norway at the time and he said they didn't believe the machine he he he didn't believe the machine was correctly calibrated but he think he figured they decided that it was a good pr move anyway so so when we're talking about high numbers and there's you know matt carpenter 92 kelly and jorney every there's a lot of people who have high numbers virtually none of them are published in the scientific literature the highest values you know you go back to the 70s where uh some some of the great runners were tested and you get you know steve prefontaine was 84 and there aren't a lot of published values above the high 80s so 96.7 is like it's higher than the rumors but it's way higher than the verified number so the first thing they did the next day is they disassembled the machine the the metabolic cart and send it back to the manufacturer to get it calibrated to find out if they you know are we nuts is this real is this true and it came back that yeah it's working and all the numbers all of the other people yeah exactly all the other tests that were done in that day were all within line yeah so you know so they figured this is real and so they they eventually i mean this the story is longer after his retirement they they published the data and shared it which was pretty cool well i think the other thing that was very compelling was he was tested again several months later um he'd put on two and a half kilos so his number came down into the 80s but his absolute level of maximal oxygen consumption had barely come down he went from something like 7.2 liters to 7.1 liters but the number came down from you know call it whatever it was 96 and change to 89 and change which was accounted for by the gain and weight which again is effectively like repeating the test and getting the same result i agree to me to me that's actually the number one piece of data is that that test that off season test a few months later later in that year it's like okay well if he's doing the same amount of oxygen we understand that people can put on weight and lose weight but the absolute value of 7.2 or whatever is suggests that this was a real number um and and you know the other thing to say is after he has at 17 or whatever it was after he clocked that 96 a couple weeks later he goes to the world junior championships and wins the time trial there so on the surface it's like that goes to show if you have a big engine you're going to be a superstar but of course the flip side of that and where i the reason i brought this up was to say why do most people listening to this who might even be able to recognize the you know the best time trials in the world the bradley wiggins of the world you know no longer active but you know the the people who go on to win grand tours and stuff why don't we know this guy's name yeah so he turned pro uh you know when he turned 20 uh with an he was with an under-23 team called joker he was an okay cyclist he did he had some good results he had some bad results uh i think it probably didn't help that uh you know he got a lot of attention for this vo2 max value so i think the expectations were probably out of line with with what was reasonable both from his own expectations and uh and other people's and he ended up retiring i think he was 23 maybe like he took a break and then he officially announced his retirement when he was around 23 uh went back to university and he's done he's gone um so the aftermath was that there was a a paper published i don't know i think it was about a year ago that sort of reanalyzed or responded to when they published his data and said well let's look at not just his history of vo2 max values let's look at his efficiency at each point along the line so over the course of three or three years or whatever it was where he had multiple vo2 max tests and you see this expected pattern he starts at 74 and he goes 80 something 80 something 90 something 96 and then he comes back down the ladder you know by the time he after he retired from cycling he was back down to 77 so he's right back where he started that's that's a simple story but if you look at the efficiency you get a much more interesting story which is that he started out at his most efficient when he was untrained and the more he trained the less efficient he got meaning that yeah he could he could deliver more oxygen to his muscles he could he could deliver more aerobic energy but he he used more aerobic energy in order to maintain a given pace so let's make sure folks understand how that's calculated so now you look at a different graph where on the x-axis you show wattage which is the universal metric of output in cycling and on the y-axis you show oxygen consumption and so now you're looking at a graph that says for a given output how much oxygen how much input do you need to get this output and an athlete over time should get better and better for a fixed wattage you want to see what's called pvo2 come down so power at a given vo2 should actually come down as you get better in running this would be the vvo2 you want to get faster as oh as so for a given oxygen consumption you want velocity to go up just as you would want power to go up i might have said it backwards earlier but i think you know what i'm saying and and so i i got to be honest with you i was actually very surprised by that i would have i wouldn't i would have been less surprised if it had been unchanged but i was very surprised that it deteriorated yeah and there's lots of debates about whether you can improve it but to actually see it get worse was was so clearly and so kind of monotonically there was an inverse relationship was definitely surprising and it actually plays into a long-standing debate which is the question of is there an inverse relationship between vo2 max and economy or in efficiency so if you if you build your engine bigger do you necessarily end up with a less efficient engine and this debate's been going on for a couple of decades now and there's still no consensus and one so one way of because if you look at if you just take a bunch of elite athletes and you uh measure their economy whether it's runners or cyclists and and you measure their vo2 max you tend to see an inverse relationship the people who have the highest vo2 max tend to have slightly lower uh slightly worse economies and and people and the people who have the best economy tend to have slightly worse vo2 max there's a lot of possible explanations for this one is that you don't tend to hit the lottery twice so if you happen to have a vo2 max that's 92 then you're not you're you're not that lucky you're not going to have the best possible economy and if you're only looking at elite athletes that means that everyone else there is going to have something special so if they don't have the best vo2 max by definition they have to have a great economy because they have to have something that's exceptional and so you see this inverse relationship that either you have good economy or you have good vo2 max and just to be clear that's because we've selected for people whose dot product of those two things is the best in the world yeah to be in this to if you're looking at elite athletes they have to have won at least one lottery but they're unlikely to win two lotteries because we're already looking at the point zero zero one percent so it's it's it's highly unlikely that you're going to have hit the lottery twice but so what the oscars fencing data points to is is a different explanation which is that there's actually a trade-off that if you're optimizing one physiological parameter it may come at the cost of the other physiological parameter that uh the training he did which we can sort of surmise must have been pretty good for increasing vo2 max because he got such a high one may have actually been bad for his economy not in the sense that his you know his legs were wobbling or he was had bad you know motion but at a metabolic level that and there was a paper published um so the again in response to this benson uh case study reanalyzing his data and pointing to a potential cell level explanation of of what's happening to certain enzymes at a given point the biochemistry frankly is beyond me you know to to uh to fully understand but basically what they're saying is uh if if your mitochondria are being stressed to the if you're if you're doing a lot of training that requires very high like vo2 max level outputs your your metabolism your cells need to make choices to produce high output instead of to be as be as efficient as possible and over time that's what you'll get better at and you'll lose that efficiency and so you'll you'll pay a slight penalty for for optimizing your training for vo2 max yeah so that was that was that was kind of my take which was not knowing more about his training was what would happen if you took that engine if you took that that genetic gift and instead of maximizing on vo2 max and pushing him from i mean a guy that gets out of bed in the morning or falls off a log at 74 is a freak of nature but instead of pushing him to 96 you train him and he he'd get up to 85 or 90 maybe but you put much more effort into sort of zone two where you're right at lactate of two so you push him and by the way for him that would be like if you looked i remember looking in the paper and applied physiology i mean you know he's spending a lot of time in the three to four hundred watt range but he could have probably been in the sort of 300 to about the 300 watt range where he's still just under 2 millimole of lactate but he's dramatically increasing mitochondrial efficiency and if that represented two-thirds of his volume um yes he'd have a lower vo2 max but he might have been a better cyclist yeah i i think certainly putting on the hindsight spectacles i i you know 100 agree whatever he did he he paid too high a price for that vo2 max i mean just by definition it didn't work out and and it it certainly again we don't know exactly what his training was but um that makes a lot of sense to me and i think and i think it it sort of a agrees and you've talked a lot about this but uh with the sort of prevailing wisdom among endurance athletes is that yeah you know 80 of your training should be easy conversational pace and and you know what what what means you use to to to figure out what pace that is it may may depend but or may vary but uh yeah he needed to be doing something that was going to uh at l at worst not penalize his efficiency as much as as much as he did i mean i i just remember even as an adult like whenever i wanted to go and have a vo2 max test just for ego you wanted it to be as high as it could like i would alter my training for four weeks and lose a couple kilos like it's lose two kilos and start doing four to six minute all-out intervals that was the recipe for raising vo2 max so abandon all low end and it's four minutes all out six minutes mild and but those are killing workouts those really crush you um so yeah there was just like kind of a formula to make it happen so so let's let's pivot now and talk about something you've also written about that i find completely amazing from a physiologic standpoint which is the sub 2 attempt and the incredible effort of kipchoge so i don't even know where to begin this story but again let's just assume for a moment that listeners aren't familiar with who kipchoge is aren't even familiar with the difference between an official marathon versus a contrived nike marathon um start from the beginning okay so the very beginning i'll give you the the medium long version of the story the very beginning is that in 2014 i wrote an article for runner's world it was about 10 pages long i spent months on it analyzing the prospects for a sub two hour marathon and you know talking to a bunch of experts crunching data blah blah blah what would it take and at the end of that article my prediction was uh that it would be physiologically possible to run a sub two-hour marathon and that it would happen sometime around 2075. so that that was my context and and the con you know the i'll i'll take ownership of the of the prediction but that's that's the general sense was that yeah it's possible but it's not gonna happen for a long time and just to be clear alex what was the world record at the time and did your prediction speak to an official marathon or any form of marathon yeah yeah so i i was thinking about marathons as they are currently run although in my article what i said is look if if we're gonna if it's gonna happen it's gonna happen on an optimized course you're not just gonna go to any old course so you're going to choose a course that optimizes temperature it optimizes terrain it optimizes curvature so there's a lot of things you know you knew right away the way marathons were run and mostly continue to be run there's fat on the bone in a way that there isn't in sports like track or uh you know if you look at the tour de france there's fat on the bone but no one cares about the time compared to track cycling where everything is optimized so marathons is are this kind of anomaly where they're run in a tour de france style in a very uncontrolled environment with which differs from from race to race and yet we care about time so um and i think that's maybe an anachronism that's going to fade away a little bit as we realize that you know you can you can run a lot faster if you optimize the course but anyway to answer your question the world record was 202 57 by a guy named dennis cameto so we're talking three minutes away from a sub two um if you say how long did it take us to to come down three minutes um well one in in the mid 80s it was 1986 the world record was 206.50 by bolina densimo so we're talking a a time scale 86 now yeah i call it 30 years to go four minutes yeah or yeah exactly so we're looking at and and of course the things are getting optimized as we go so the cur you expect the curve to be leveling out the you know there's less and less low-hanging fruit to get so in 2016 uh i i heard i got an assignment from runner's world to to go report on this top secret nike project um which ended up it was it was something they called breaking two it's a race they held in spring of 2017 and their mission was basically they'd spent about two or three years 20 people full time working on it trying to i i don't know how to say it to engineer a sub two-hour marathon and so they had a started with a huge talent search they sponsor a large fraction of the world's best runners so they brought 20 something of their best runners to labs to measure their vo2 max and their economy and various other things and uh picked three runners and then they they they went around the world uh testing possible courses they ended up settling on a formula one race track in northern italy there was monsoons yeah it was yeah with with uh which which i think is where they the the highest speed ever reached that's yeah so so if you i'm obsessed with formula one so if you uh if you're interested monza is the fastest formula one circuit you you don't look at the maximum speed you look at the fastest average speed so monday has the fastest average speed of any formula one circuit there are other characteristics that make formula one circuits interesting which have the highest g-forces which have the highest straightaway speeds those things but yeah manza has the fastest highest average speed and of course doesn't have much elevation change which is probably even more important right yeah so they use the the junior loop i think it was called at monza so not the full one because that was the straightest possible with just the the barely perceptible curves i think it was about a mile and a half loop or something like that um it's also like that you know it doesn't have much elevation change it's it's close to sea level but it's not close to the sea which makes the weather a little more predictable um they they optimized a lot of different things you know they're trying to optimize the nutrition the enraged nutrition the aerodynamics they're like doing things like sticking bump adhesive bumps onto the legs of the runners to to try and reduce the air dyna the the drag when they're swinging their legs back and forth some of it's a little ridiculous um some of it was significant uh the two significant things were they were gonna have uh i think it was one two three four five five pace it was five or seven pacemakers running in front of the the yeah so basically uh yeah uh blocking the wind for the the chosen runners for the whole way now you can't hire someone to run a sub two hour marathon in order to run a sub two hour marathon so they had to have runners dropping out every couple laps and new runners swapping in that's not allowed according to the rule the official rules of marathoning so that's the main reason that this race that nike had planned was it was not an is not considered a world record because it doesn't obey those rules and then the other the other factor the big factor is they introduced a new uh a whole new type of shoe that had a curved carbon fiber plate embedded in the sole that improves running economy in other words it allows you to burn less energy to sustain a given pace by about four percent on average so put all these things together and all of a sudden it's like we don't actually need the runners to be that much faster than 202.57 if all these things we've come up with work we should be able to slice three minutes off the time with the shoes and the drafting and the course and the weather and all these sorts of things um the three one of the three runners they ended up selecting elliot kipchoge is was the reigning olympic champion and he was also probably the most consistent and the best marathoner in the world at that time he was i think he had the second second or third fastest time in history at that point and then they had a couple other guys who had good good lab values one of them had that the best running efficiency ever measured um but neither of those guys ended up being a factor kipchoge ended up running two flat 25 at this nike breaking two race so 25 seconds uh two and a half minutes faster than the world record didn't run sub two but was that was considered a victory because it was like nobody thought anyone would even with all the sort of science and tech nobody thought that it would actually add up to a human running that fast so then there was a sequel in in 2019 uh funded by the petrochemical company ineos instead of nike in in vienna which basically replicated most of what breaking two had done they only brought kipchoge in they had a few different things they had a new pair of shoes um which is what became a very very controversial and this time kipchoge ran 159.40 um so he ran us up two marathon and and it's it it uh has sort of galvanized and polarized the running world because uh kipchoge is the the greatest marathoner in history i would say but these these events uh left a bad taste in in the mouths of a lot of people both for their the sort of circus-like quality but also because of the shoes the shoes became uh very controversial because it's not clear whether shoes that make you four percent more efficient with a carbon fiber plate embedded in them are within the spirit of the sport or within the rules of the sport i mean this sounds an awful lot like where swimming was in 2008 and 2009 when the tech suits from basically 2000 to 2008 had gotten so quick that by 2009 fina said this is going to be the this world championships in 09 will be the last time there are technical suits and away they went and actually there are still some world records that stand you know 12 years later uh nearly 12 years later from from those two the the surprising thing to me is that is that all not all of them stand because at the time i remember interviewing some swimmers and saying so you know how does it feel do you think you will never again set a personal best there was this sense that uh banning those suits would just completely uh change the record book um but it has turned out that swimming has continued to advance i guess there's advances in pool technology and stuff like that but uh um but yeah it's exactly analogous debate you know what role should the equipment play in a sport that is not like formula one that is who's who's inherent uh attraction is its simplicity but to play devil's advocate right i mean um would with the current running shoes you would wear if you were out to if you were to go out and run a marathon would they offer a four percent efficiency over leather you would strap to your feet it's a good question i i think they would they would raise my chance of getting to the finish without injuring myself because cushioning is is the big advance the better now or maybe the more sort of pointed analogy is um cinder tracks in the were common until the 60s then you have all weather tracks i mean it's it's it's it's apples to to to to pears or whatever um so i think yeah look at cycling right i mean consider a bicycle today versus a bicycle 20 years ago not 100 years ago just look i mean if you look at the the the the bikes ridden in the late 90s versus today they they're not even the same thing i mean they're they're not even close well the hour record is such a classic example of that because cycling did try and say you know what let's make it about the cyclist not the cyclists we're going to all ride the 1972 eddie merc special and for the hour record and the response to the cycling world was like okay we're not interested in the hour record anymore forget about it it's it's uninteresting to us to go ride this stupid 1972 bike um and until they change the rules again in whatever it was 2015 or something and all of a sudden everyone's like hey all right now now we're interested in so yeah yeah i mean i think the the key the key that that i would say in agreeing with you is that anyone who thinks that the progress of the sport over the last 10 years much less 50 years much less 100 years is all about well we've learned more and we're digging deeper is kidding themselves technology is baked into the improvement curve changes in circumstances environment and technology are baked into those curves right from the get go now you can still you can acknowledge that and still say yeah i want the i understand the curve's going like this but i don't want it to go to drop off a cliff and the world records have been absolutely knocked silly in the last two years since these shoes have become common i i still think it's you know i i think it was a tough call to i don't think it was obvious that you could ban them until they'd already been used enough to realize that oh wait this is real uh this is a big advantage by which time it was kind of too late to ban them because the thing is i mean as a guy who follows this stuff relatively closely i'm used to press releases every year if not every day that promise to upend the sport and this is going to be the newest greatest latest best thing it's you know so you ignore that stuff and so even if nike had said hey by the way um just a heads up to world athletics we've got these shoes and they're crazy are they you know is it okay that we introduce them and all the ingredients of the shoes were had are things that had been used before so there was nothing like there was no like coiled spring in it carbon fiber plates had been used before including to set world records so there was nothing it's just nike got the recipe right they got it so right that it it changed the sport and it in the long run things will settle back into parity and we won't worry about it but there is a period about 2016 to 2019 where it's like if you didn't have the right shoes you probably weren't going to win the race and that is a little unfortunate so where do you i mean where do you think this all fits into your prediction whatever year that was 2014 i mean where do you when do you think two hours will be broken on a legitimate road course with full marathon rules that will constitute a world record so that means it also has to be a marathon that ends and starts in the same place it can't be a you know one and done downhill like boston or something like that um is that do you do you revise your estimate of whatever year you gave oh yeah for sure no it's not gonna be 2075 which coincidentally was going to be my 100th birthday so maybe that was subconsciously influencing me but the answer depends on what you define as legit is there something illegitimate about holding a marathon on a loop course i i i don't see it i mean marathons you know it used to be they were a big deal in like madison square garden back in the late 1800s you know there's nothing inherent about saying you shouldn't run it in a circle um yes we love the big city marathon experience and it brings the people together yada yada but if you're trying to break the two-hour marathon the goal is not to you know be inclusive um so there's things like that uh here's another thing they did they said we don't have a start time we're not we're not starting saturday at 7 a.m we're starting sometime between friday at 7 00 am and sunday at 7 00 a.m or whatever and we're going to look at the weather forecast and we're going to make a call the day before like 12 hours before so we can get the absolute optimal weather is that cheating or is that smart having a launch window so there's a lot of things like that the key thing i think is two key things one is pacemaking you can't have people jumping in halfway that's the number one thing they have to change for me to consider it like a legit sub two hour marathon so you're gonna have to attract like the second best runners in the world to go and to have them work together so that you know one group is leading through halfway and then the the second group is going to lead uh you know to 30k or some something and then they're going to drop out and the the chosen runners do it alone so you're going to have to optimize that to do that you're going to need a ton of money and more generally you're going to need a ton of money to put on event i would i would estimate nike spent tens of millions of dollars on its breaking two race so my 2075 prediction did not bake any of that stuff into it but now that we've had a sub two and now that the official world record is 201.39 if i'm remembering correctly you know we're within shouting distance of the two hour i think some of those other factors may come together that someone tries to put together a breaking two style race that still falls within the bounds of legitimate so i would say that could happen anytime in the next 10 years when's it going to happen just like it's a race we showed up to berlin or boston or new york or whatever and someone happens to run sub 2. i think that's still a long way away because again the progress has not been in humanity the progress has been in understanding where the fat on the bone is and cutting that away systematically so if you take away all technology what is the difference between roger bannister and the fastest miler today again get rid of shoes get rid of all of that um as a species we have not evolved so how much of that difference is technology how much of it is training uh everything else you'd bake into it i mean what what would be the buckets you would you would classify as the improvements and what is the i don't even know what the mile record is today mile record's 343. so 17 16 seconds okay yeah so the for banister to today the biggest bucket bar none is training uh banister is reputedly an under reporter he there was this sort of whiff of amateurism where you know admitting you were training too hard was not uh it was it was not done but even if you take with a grain of salt as reports you know it was sort of half an hour a day go out and do 10 by 600 or 10 10 by 400 meters so we're talking like you know four or five miles a day five six days a week maybe he was doing more than that sometimes but he was training at a level um a very very light level um and even one of his contemporaries was emil zatapek who was a a check runner who's just a legend i mean yeah absolutely like you know arguably the greatest runner ever yeah exactly he was starting to push the boundaries of how hard you could train he was a guy who was going out and doing 60 by 400 instead of 10 by 400 and so it's not like nobody understood the training worked but banister versus today it's training is the difference cinders maybe a second a lap like the the track quality the quality of the spikes negligible and nutrition yeah for a mile it's not just not that big a deal for a four-minute race um if you fast forward to the 60s by the 60s you've got people like jim ryan who ran 351 for the mile as a teenager he's training like a beast um most people could not handle even modern milers would not dare to train as as hard as he trained um as a result he was doing so when i say so roger bannister was 10 by 400 meters emil zatapec was 60 by 400 meters but they were mostly really slow he was it was like another form of endurance jim ryan was 4 40 by 400 meters but they were all hard they were all they were all as you know close to as hard as as as bannister was doing on what recovery ah you know what i i i i don't want to claim that i remember but we're talking like one to two minutes probably or 400 meter jog like and and lots of intervals of he was it was a very interval based program and but hard really really hard and what would he run those 400s in like how many of them would be sub 60 seconds all of them no i'm not not substitute he he'd probably be doing those in like you know 66 64. i i yeah i so i don't i don't know that the exact times but it's at that volume in the context of high mileage he was doing them at you know at a at a pace that was extremely challenging not the sort of zap style of just kind of let's get tough and not not worry about the pace that's affects the guy who's like uh do you know in the laundry tub just doing high knees in the laundry tub he was a or holding his breath between uh uh phone poles on his run so he was all about just making stuff hard whereas ryan was taking that to a systematic level we're going to train hard but we're going to do it systematically with with his coach bobby timmons and uh i'd say you can't make much distinction between the training of the 1960s and the training of today there were there were people who were training probably as hard in the 60s and if you take jim ryan's mile 351 cinders subtract 4 seconds 347 the american record's 346.8 or something like that so by the 60s training was mature and all the other stuff that we worry about all the you know nutritional aids and and you know pneumatic compression devices and ice baths and stuff um i'm not saying it doesn't help on an individual basis but you you can't see it in the record curves or anything like that the the those things don't show up those don't leave a mark in the big statistical picture um do you ever do you follow horse racing at all do you ever follow like the times that horses run and things like that that that's a cl that's exactly the the comparison i was thinking of which is that they've stagnated since the 50s right like well i mean the secretariat is still the secretary it is hands down the fastest horse that's ever run and i read a very interesting argument on oh i don't know it was probably on nate silver's 365 a few years ago that actually made the point that we're getting further from secretariat now because we're actually seeing less diverse breeding of horses so so you're just bringing less genes to the gene pool and of course secretary's genes were pretty unique right it was an x-linked so it was a sex-linked x chromosome gift that he had genetically that's why his male offspring didn't do anything special but his female offsprings that would go on to pass x chromosomes to males a generation later actually were somewhat special um but secretariats times were unbelievable i mean you know when you think about it through the lens of even running like to run a mile and a quarter and to negative split by mile all five miles um you know the winning secretariat's you know winning times at uh at belmont i mean i like i don't think any horses i don't think any horse will come close to that um and and it's important to to note that whatever amount of money we have in the running world that is compelling us to or allowing us to you know optimize nutrition and training and yet there's way more running in horse racing like if if there was if there were physiological advantages that allowed us to run faster they they would be using those on horses so like the the post post training massage or whatever if that helped horses they'd be getting it or they probably are yeah so going back to kind of your experience let's bring it back to this idea of what you're now learning about endurance as you are are back as as a journalist now and you're you're fully ready to go back and visit your running routes uh in the research for your book what are you learning about your experience on a on a rainy night in quebec and how are you able to put that in the context of what the limits of endurance are so i guess the start would be you know maybe to pick up the thread even a little earlier is you know i finally started to write about running and i was doing it in a very conventional way the the sort of what heart rate should you do your tempo run at and and and things like that but what it meant is that i was starting to look at at the literature and uh and and reading some papers and i came across a paper and again you know maybe 2007 2008 it was a debate and i think it was in the journal of physiology and the topic of the debate was does dehydration impair endurance performance and i just remember being like what is this like april fool's what of course dehydration impairs endurance performance and it was a pro and con and the con was tim knox arguing it was a a very notable contrarian physio scientist let's say from the university of cape town and he was arguing that no we've not we have not shown that dehydration itself impairs performance thirst impairs performance if you're thirsty but if you drink enough that you're you're not thirsty and even if you're dehydrated even if you've lost a bunch of weight that doesn't impair performance and he went through all the literature all the famous studies that show dehydration and mayor's performance going back to the second world war and you look and it's like well they were all thirsty they were all like stuck in a sauna and not allowed to drink so we don't anyway all of which is to say all of a sudden i was like oh wait one of my fundamental tenets of one of the things that i thought was beyond debate is debatable and so i started reading a little more and following this thread and i re and i discovered that knox tim knowks had proposed this idea called the central governor model which was in a nutshell it's that when you run as hard as you can or exercise in other forms as hard as you can the reason you stop or the reason you slow down or the reason you aren't able to go faster is not because your legs aren't capable of going faster it's because your brain is protecting you it's it's sort of putting on the brakes before you push so hard that you know your your heart runs out of oxygen or whatever the case may be um and this was highly controversial it was it was a fringe theory at the time uh but that's when i started to make the connection to like my race in quebec my 1500 breakthrough and and my whole the whole career of like why do why why do i have a good race one week and a bad race the next week even when the physically there's no nothing different like why does it feel like sometimes i'm able to dig deeper if it's just multiply your vo2 max by your running economy divide by your lactate threshold or whatever what like there shouldn't be any change these things don't change from week to week and so that got me interested in the role of the brain now the central i should let me just jump ahead and say the central governor model people don't really talk about that anymore it's it was a model that emphasized the importance of the brain in understanding the limits of endurance which has then led to a whole bunch of further research which is what captivated me because it's like no nobody needed another article on vo2 max is about his oxygen or whatever although i shouldn't say that because i've written a few articles about vo2max but um but but what struck me is interesting and what even in like by 2009 i was like this is a this should be a book about this that tries to explain this uh to all the people like me who i know are interested in this stuff but haven't don't realize that there's this debate going on in the literature about how do we bring the brain in not just in a sense of like you have to really want it to try really hard but to understand how the brain is influencing or controlling or playing a part in determining the limits of endurance where do you think this fits into health so there's i mean this is clearly uh an important topic when we're talking about sports right when we're talking about endurance sports like you know running and cycling and swimming the purpose of the sport is to be fast is to have endurance and speed at that right combination um many of the people listening to this podcast are no longer competing you know you're still competing but most people aren't i don't compete at anything anymore um but i hate the term but quote-unquote cardio exercise or endurance based exercise we would still agree is still an important pillar of health so how do you how do you think about that and and more importantly how do you think about what you've studied applying to health and one of the things i want to talk about because it's so interesting of course is at some point does exercise become counterproductive and maybe even what are the benefits specifically you know for example energetics uh efficiency with metabolism and how that can fight disease so uh in any way you want to start that discussion like how do you start to think about it uh both scientifically and even personally yeah so that's a big bite to chew on that's you've mapped out the next uh three hours of our conversation yes um so one thing i would say is i mean look i don't want to oversell it and say you must understand you know your br your absolute limits in order to be healthy but i do think in terms of if we think about the barriers to exercise the barriers to being physically active i think for a lot of people um there's a if you interpret the distress signals you feel when you start exercising as signs that your body is reaching its limit that's a very distressing thing you use you know if you're like i'm going to start an exercise program i'm going to start brisk walking i'm going to start running and you feel you're panting you're out of breath your legs are burning you're like i'm going to die and you stop and so i think understanding that these it's not so much about how to change your limits but understanding what those limits represent understanding that they are not signs that you're gonna die these are just this is just information this is and because i would say and i haven't thought this through maybe it's not true but i would say off the top of my head any meaningful form of exercise that's going to do you substantial amounts of good is going to involve dealing with discomfort uh in in one form or another and if you can get to a place where you understand that the feelings of discomfort are not signs that something is going wrong with your body but they are just information they are telling you where you are on the road to reaching your limits and you don't have to go to your limits but you also don't have to stop you're allowed to just interpret that as information and say okay understood i'm out of breath but i can keep going so i think to to me at least that that's a useful insight to take to take from this now you know we could we can get deeper then into you know you've raised some some very interesting and controversial questions about you know how much exercise is good what kind of exercise do we need to do i don't know where you want to start with that well let's because we don't have three hours although i i mean when we meet in person and share a meal we certainly will take those three hours but i let's start with um two opposing points of view with respect to exercise so one point of view says the exercise longevity curve is j shaped so at what at the you know far end of the spectrum no exercise is you know a really bad thing for mortality as you increase exercise mortality improves improves improves improves improves improves and then it kind of gets to your best all-cause mortality and if you continue to increase exercising beyond a certain volume this is generally discussed in volume of exercise you actually see a little uptick in mortality suggesting that once you go beyond a certain point again i want to stress this is in volume of exercise you don't get any more benefit and you may actually have more harm and a lot of times this is harm that comes in the form of cardiac dysrhythmia it could be even atherosclerosis through endothelial damage fibrosis things like that there's another body of literature that says no it's more or less a monotonically improving curve and again we all agree that at one end of the spectrum having you know really poor cardiovascular fitness again we could measure this in vo2max or something like that as that improves and you get fitter and fitter and fitter and fitter all-cause mortality goes lower and lower and lower and there is no j to that curve how do you think about reconciling those and i want to point out at the outset this is a discussion that only really impacts like one percent of the population because 99 of the population are on the side of the curve where they could always benefit from exercising more but you know you for example might be one of those people who's in the one percent where i don't know what's your weekly mileage right now i i fortunately it's only probably about 20 miles so even uh even james o'keefe would would give me a pass yeah yeah so um so walk me through how you think about that because i have to be honest with you um i'm i've seen examples of you know those athletes who go a little bit too far who probably have a genetic susceptibility to dysrhythmia and then they go on and get these dysrhythmias um but at the same time they're few and far in between so i don't i don't i'm still a bit on the fence about this one again just purely from an intellectual standpoint i don't think it applies to me anymore it probably did at some point so it's it's a good question it's an important one and there's a couple a few things i want to say first i'm a runner right so so take take what i say understand where i'm coming from i'm also a human like i don't want to die so i'm try i try to look at this data as imp as dispassionately as possible so but but i i obviously i my knee-jerk reaction is like let's find holes in this data that suggests running is bad so i get that on the table second there's no doubt that there is a reverse j curve if you try to run 28 20 hours a day it's not going to be good for you so like it's nothing is good for you if you push it far enough so the real question is where do the extremes or where does the the uptick happen um third thing i want to say is the this this the data on this is showing that you know you do a little bit you get some benefits and the more you do that it gets worse and worse one really interesting thing that came out of that and there were a few studies in about eight years ago that showed that is that actually the the dose you need to get most of the health benefits is very small and i do think that's an important message you do not need to train or for or run marathons in order to be optimally healthy at least to within the you know the 90 or whatever you're going to get most of what you get from a very modest amount of exercise and so that's a great message so okay now then can you quantify that by the way in terms of in terms of running let's let's put some numbers to that if you're talking about a person who maybe was active in high school and college but you know they're they're 10 or 20 years out of that they've been caught up in the challenges of starting their career starting their family etc they wake up they're 40 years old and their waist is 5 inches bigger they've got metabolic syndrome they're not in dire straits it's not like they're gonna die in the next 10 years but they've got the message which says hey the one thing that is really missing is your exercise what what would you say if if they came to you and said alex just tell me the minimum effective dose i don't want to run any weekend races i like running i used to love it uh or rowing or whatever their activity is how many hours or how many miles do i need to do a week to just get the benefit some of the better you know 80 of the benefits for 20 of the efforts yeah so so the the cooper clinic study which was like 50 000 people or so uh that came out four five years ago their number was five to ten minutes a day i don't fully believe that but that that was their number so they're talking you're talking like an hour a week um i i and and that's just you know going out for a run i personally will maybe we can get into this that that's not my definition of an optimal exercise routine i would include some high intensity stuff uh you know and strength is another thing but um so they're they're making some claims about a very very low minimum effective dose personally i would say so i said like i said i'm probably running about 20 miles a week right now which is six days a week you know half an hour with a couple of hard days i think that's on the to me that's on the low end of of i think i would be healthier if i did more at this point um and it's just you think you would you would actually be healthier i know you'd be a better runner but would you be a healthier would you would you live longer i think i think i would now i think if i if i had to the first thing i would do if you know if i was if i had instant motivation powder that i was going to dust on myself i would get i would up my strength my my strength training routine that would be the first thing i do if longevity was my first priority oh i'm sorry i misunderstood so you wouldn't necessarily run more you would take extra time and add it in the weight room or do something else no i would run okay like if i was prioritizing i would prioritize strength first but i think if i could also if i also changed you know i i think for me because i because i'm come from a background where i'm already i'm used to running 20 miles a week doesn't stress me very much you know i it just slows down my decline i i think i could benefit from let's say one long longer run a week or something like that i this is the gut feeling let's not you know i don't wanna this is not supported by anything other than my gut but so the five to ten minutes a day it might be it's definitely the right place to start if you're the 45 year old you know sedentary you know getting back into it but i think you'd you might want to push something a little higher that a little higher than that um or certainly if you're doing if you're doing 60 minutes a week i wouldn't do it in five to ten minute chunks i would do some 20 minute chunks or whatever and what do we know about injury prevention in that person that probably they're gonna get injured because they're gonna because they're gonna find that they're no matter how metabolically unfit they are they're probably gonna find that they gain metabolic fitness more quickly than they gain uh you know tendon stiffness and and and muscle strength and things like that so in a sense that's even more reason to to sort of take that guideline seriously i mean i'm talking about running which because i love you're less likely to get it if you go cycling or something like that that's obviously there's other other ways of mitigating the the injury thing but yeah from so but let me let me just cast some doubt on the on the j shaped thing the there there were two main studies on which this whole j curve hypothesis was founded one was the copenhagen uh study and and one was the cooper clinic study the copenhagen study initially it came out saying running is great and more running is better and then they re-analyzed it with a new co-author and and they concluded that running too much or too fast was bad that was based on uh there were two deaths in the in the group that ran too fast like this is not the confidence interval was essentially infinite like but there's a more serious problem and that and it's one that affects the cooper clinic data too which is that when you're when you have a big study of 50 000 people who are just randomly selected they're not all the same they all have different characteristics so you have to find some way of adjusting for various characteristics and without going too far down the rabbit hole basically they statistically adjusted initially at least for things like cholesterol levels weight uh blood sugar levels blood pressure because you want to come you know it's meaningless if you compare like we had this you know the non-runners died sooner than the runners but they were also 20 pounds heavier and had all these other risk factors so you want to equalize it but there's a problem that if you equalize it you're a bit you're you're essentially saying well what are the health benefits of exercise if you don't do any exercise because the health benefits are of exercise or precisely in helping you regulate things like blood pressure and blood sugar and controversially but i would say weight also um so essentially i mean to me that was statistical misconduct like that that so you're saying if you take the the people who exercise and you subtract you basically penalize them for having lower weight better lipids better blood sugar better blood pressure so you you bring them in line so that they're just as overweight and just have all the other red risk factors then you see this j-curve now when they actually published the data in a peer-reviewed journal two years after it was presented they had eliminated that that statistical method and the j-curve had disappeared you no longer saw the j-curve now you know i don't i don't want to just dismiss and say well therefore there's nothing to see i'm just saying that if we're talking about where the curve happens if you do that kind of statistical adjustment which is the equivalent of saying like i want to know whether smoking causes cancer but i can't compare the smokers and non-smokers because the smokers have more lung cancer so let's artificially equalize it and pretend that the smokers just have just as much cancer that i mean that you can't basically statistical terms you can't adjust for a variable a mediating variable a variable that's affected by the thing you're trying to measure so i'm sorry no no no no i mean as you can tell this is this is the topic i get excited no no it is and i've read what you've written about it which is why i wanted to bring it up i have a slightly different take on it which is less about everything you've said and more of the practical issue because the practical issue is the one i get asked about a lot which is am i exercising too much right this is the person asking the question and so again let's pause it for a moment that 99 of people are not exercising too much and don't even possess the fortitude to exercise too much right they don't the the the pain tolerance isn't there the obsession with exercise isn't there so for for 99 of people we'd like to get them to exercise more or stay the same we're dealing with one percent of the population many of whom i know and one of whom i used to be that were kind of the hyper exercisers here's the bigger point i would make it's probably less relevant whether or not they're spending too many hours cycling swimming running etc usually people in this sense it's not the number of hours they're spending it's the portfolio allocation of how they're spending it that's the bigger problem it's that they're not well-rounded and they're not actually in pursuit of longevity so the reality of it is is training for the tour de france going to increase your longevity absolutely not no way like those guys finish the tour anemic osteopenic their upper bodies are emaciated their posture is horrible there's nothing about that that is setting you up to be an octogenarian that kicks ass nothing whatsoever so they're physiologic marvels but their health span sucks right so that's using that as an extreme what how would we extrapolate that to the 40 year old who just can't hang up the dreams of being a professional athlete who's out there you know running or riding or doing all of that stuff non-stop but at the expense of maybe not doing some pilates to work on core strength i hate the term but you know what i just for people understand like not working on stability not spending any time in the weight room really working on strength not varying the intensity of their workouts to work different energy systems so to me that's the bigger issue with people who are exercising too much it's probably not that they're at the little tip of a j that may or may not exist it's that they're squandering their time it's like having all of this money but you're invested you have a lousy portfolio yeah okay i i i i agree with a lot of that one thing i'll say is is the important question you're you're put you're implicitly asking there is what's your goal right like what what are you training for well i said longevity this was all predicated towards living a longer healthier life and meaning and so not winning races or whatever i i would 100 agree if someone came comes to me and says uh you know i want to optimize my exercise program for longevity like i said before there's no there's no way i would tell them you should be training for a marathon that's not because i think training for a marathon is bad but like you said it's an opportunity cost of of other things you could be doing that a lot of other things you could be doing that would probably work better that so i i think it's really important to disabuse people of the notion that um in order to optimize your health you should run a marathon but i where i bridle with this whole the sort of the the the media coverage of the that that stream of research is that that's different from saying that people who are training for a marathon because they want to run a marathon or because they want to run a marathon as fast as possible should should stop because that's bad so it's like of the of the of the category of people who have unhealthy behaviors who we should intervene to save them from themselves it's like people who are training for a marathon to me are not even close to being in the same category as people like me who are sitting at a desk first for eight hours a day or whatever the case may be so it's like there's a difference between optimizing and avoiding like serious problems and and and i i the one other thing i should acknowledge is and you alluded to it is there are other issue potential issues with with lots of endurance training and arrhythmias is one of them and there's there's better evidence that that's that's a real thing um so you know like th there may be a price uh there may be downsides to to to training really hard on balance overall i would say i don't i don't lie awake at night worrying about people who are running 50 miles a week yeah you're right uh you you should worry far more about people who are eating poorly smoking who are stressed out of their minds and don't have coping mechanisms for them yeah there are there's a there there's there's not many people that you should be worrying about more or less rather yeah and and if i think of the people i know who who let's say run the equivalent of 50 miles a week or more i i can't think of any of them who would say i'm doing this because i think this is what i need in order to optimize my my health span or life span you know they obviously hope it's healthy but i think if you're if you're training for a marathon most of them are doing it for for competition or not you know self-competition in a way and and it sort of reminds me of some you know you discuss this a little bit i think in in your conversation with james o'keefe the the sort of what's great about tennis and badminton and volleyball or whatever what's the social social element of it and i think sure on average running is a solitary sport but for me it's it's my primary social outlet it's where i meet my friends it's where i uh you know get together and and catch up on the week on an easy run so it's like i think that's true for a lot of people who once you get into that 50 miles a week not for everyone but for for a lot of people it's a social element it's it's pleasurable it's a stress reliever so it goes beyond the the you know if you're if you take that away um i'm not sure it nets out as positive you know one of the things that i i think is i don't know that we'll ever know an answer i don't know that we'll ever have an answer to the question but i think one of the challenges of trying to reconcile all of these disparate data sources is it's all apples and oranges with respect to the metrics right it's you're comparing hours of exercise a week to mileage run to you know true measures of fitness like vo2 max i i guess the question is and i've thought a lot about this i'd be very curious to your thoughts if you could reverse engineer where you want your vo2 max to be when you're 90 what should it be because if you have a sense of what your vo2 max should be when you're 90 you kind of know what it needs to be when you're 80 70 60 blah blah blah all the way back and you know at that point it's not necessarily about how fast you want to run a mile though you may say look when i'm 90 i still want to run a nine minute mile i don't know but it really starts to get into the activities of daily living and how much pain are you willing to tolerate to walk up two flights of stairs with your groceries and and i suspect so i know for me and i don't know i don't know for me i hypothesized for me that when i'm 90 the real risk is that i won't be able to get up out of a chair more than that i won't have the the vo2 max and there are you know people they've i don't know i don't remember the exact numbers but there are thresholds of vo2 max below which they hypothesize that you can't i can't if it's like 18 or not or maybe it's nine or something like that where it's like at this point you're you've crossed the sort of mortality where we think you're going to die in a few years because you can't do activities of daily living so there is some research into that but for me as just my personal i i can look at myself and say you know what alex you far before your vo2 max is too low you're going to be the guy who falls on the floor and can't get up and so you know again from a health perspective that's why i said you know the next thing i if i had you know magic motivation dust it would be like you need to put on some muscle mass and for other people it would be totally different there are people i know who don't necessarily exercise a lot but who just have a lot more muscle mass than me and it's like you need to uh you know make sure your aerobic fitness is is taken care of and maybe you don't need to worry as much as as me about muscle mass so there's yeah but i mean i agree you you figure out where you want to be and for all those different things so i'm doing exactly what you said except i'm doing it for muscle mass and i'm like oh this trajectory is not good and and of course part of that's predicated on the idea that we know there's an inevitability of decline so if you do nothing you're going to lose x pounds of muscle per decade on a if you're lucky with a tailwind if you train really hard you might be able to reduce it to this amount of loss and if you really go crazy you might even be able to keep it flat but you know here's the scenario under which um that occurs what do you think is the uh i mean i assume there are pretty clear tables on what the decade by decade drop of maximal aerobic output is there are i mean the problem with the tables is that they they they draw a nice smooth line you lose i think it's nine percent per decade or something like that is at least in the once you get into your 70s it gets steeper there's a inflection point the the sort of revised thinking is that that's that works on a population level but what actually happens is the decline is not that steep uh for any individual but what happens is you have certain events in your life you have to get an injury and you're you're stopped training for six months and then you're hosed yeah so either you have reduced activity for six months or you have bed rest for a week which can be disastrous uh and you lose seven percent in the course of a week and you only get two percent back and so it's this punctuated decline and so i mean that puts a lot of emphasis that sort of points to the idea of really taking care to avoid to to the extent possible obviously to avoid these sort of events because you can actually in the absence of those those events the decline doesn't have to be that steep you can you can hang on probably better than people used to think can you say more about that because i i don't think this point can be stressed enough realistically how much aerobic capacity maximal robot capacity can a person lose with a couple weeks of inactivity and what's the difference between being bedridden versus going on vacation to europe where you're not quote unquote training but you're still walking every day like neither of those is exercise per se but one is active and one is complete inactivity that bed rest is terrifying uh there's a guy named luke van loon in the netherlands who's his focus is his muscle muscular strength but he's done a bunch of bed rest studies and he i saw him give a talk once and he had this great anecdote about you know they'd spent a whole it's really hard to get old people to put on muscle right but they just managed to finish this two and a half year study where they got i can't remember some fairly large number of septuagenarians octogenarians to do strength training and they'd put on like two and a half kilograms of muscle which is a huge victory and they were feeling really good about it and then the results came in for their one week bed rest study and they'd lost like 2.6 kilograms of muscle in one week so it's like they did this like herculean effort to to shepherd these people through strength training for for a long period of time with full support but man whatever it is you you know grandma gets pneumonia and is in in hospital for for a week bam she's lost a year of training or or what you know whatever the case may be so i i don't have the numbers at hand for v2 max i think it's like up to 20 50 maybe 10 to 20 in that range if you if you stop training for a month it depends where you're starting though like it's a if if you're if you're well trained for a short period of time you'll lose it quickly if you're if you haven't been training then resting doesn't make any difference and if you're well trained for a long long period of time then you have structural adaptations that are going to take a lot longer to disappear so um you know there's no one number for ever anyone i and and the one thing i i would add is that this is not a recommendation that you should never take a break from exercise that you should be obsessive and and train 365 days a year certainly if you're training hard like if you're if you're if you're training as a as a marathoner say man you should take a a week or two off and off doesn't mean bed rest it means play a couple games tennis go for walks chill out go for some bike rides or whatever but uh you so you shouldn't be terrified of like missing a day but you should be terrified of bad dress and and of totally i mean luke van loon one of the things he said is like if you're on bed rest you know hospitals should be forcing you if you're at all possible to walk down the hallway to get your meal even just walking down the hallway is infinitely better than not moving at all got never more um sort of relevant than what we're seeing today with so many people in hospitals and and a lot of the you know the isolation stuff that's that's going on um let's go back to something you said about strength what what do you think matters more strength or muscle mass so there's a study i wrote about recently i i would hesitate to claim it as the absolute truth but but that analyzed i think it put together like six cohort different cohorts with a total of about 50 000 people so so pretty good data um and they found that uh strength was actually a better predictor than muscle mass um so it's it's better to have the functionality to be able to push yourself up out of the chair than it is to have a bunch of muscle if you're not good at using it i'm sure that's that that's maybe not true at the margins if you lose enough muscle mass um then you know that that then you become limited by your actual muscle mass but i think for a lot of people they have enough muscle mass but they're untrained the neuromuscular connections are not optimized and so they're just they're not strong even though they have enough actual flesh there and and was that for all-cause mortality or yeah yeah so that's interesting i mean i don't i don't that that doesn't sound like an uh you know a crazy conclusion i i i generally try to say look i think both of these things are important for different reasons right i think of strength as as you described that it's that functional it's the difference between the person who slips down the flight of stairs but has the strength to grab the rail and prevent that you know from being a lethal injury or the type of injury that puts them in the hospital for a month um you know grip strength is just so highly correlated at least with survival and i think a lot of it has to do with that kind of stuff getting up out of the chair getting up off the floor at the same side or the flip side of that is i think muscle mass speaks to some of the other physiologic things like glycogen stores and glucose disposal and glucose homeostasis in general insulin sensitivity um so again i i i you know i rail against the idea that you know people say i just i'm okay being strong i just don't want to be big and it's sort of like the myth of accidental muscle you know i wish i had that problem it's like oh i looked at a gym and i accidentally put on 10 pounds yeah i hear people saying that and i'm like yeah i wouldn't worry about that um anything else about injury i mean you've written a lot about this in terms of different you know competing theories around injury um and do you think how much do you think it varies by sport and and i guess most importantly what is the implication for people who tend to get injured in life not you know they're they're walking down the street and they pull a calf muscle versus they're you know out there doing your tempo run yeah so i for me so i've been you know willingly or unwillingly embroiled in lots of debates about injuries over the last decade and a half and a lot of them focus on things like running shoes the proper running form you know is is is the height of your insole gonna affect your risk of injury and that stuff's fun and and it it's it's not it's not zero impact but i think to me there's a a guy named ben onig who's a sort of famous biomechanist who's done a lot of work on running injuries and stuff and his take in one of his studies was that look 80 percent of running injuries are what he would call training or originally a result of what he would call training errors so yeah it's nice you know there's 20 percent to work with on you know shoes or whatever you know if prehabilitation and balance yada yada most of most of what we need to worry about is doing too much too soon that's a you know and that's an oversimplification but uh certainly when we're talking about overuse injuries uh you know i'm not talking about like getting tackled on the football field um so i mean i i really think especially for people who are so for people who are starting out an ex or ramping up an exercise program just that that that that patience is so important and that understanding that you will probably overestimate what you can accomplish in the short term and you'll probably underestimate what you can accomplish in the long term but if you do and if you fall into that trap you're dramatically raising your injury risk because you're going to try and ramp up too quickly because again you can gain metabolic fitness more quickly than you can alter the structure of your joints and ligaments and and things like that so i mean that's if there's one takeaway message it would be like it's it's not about the magical gadget or the the new way of of running or the um you know the the measuring device it's like just be patient be smart you know you get home you've you have something that's aching you don't want to miss the next day's session then you don't want to become it's always a a balance right between being am i being lazy or am i being safe well you you want to err on the side of safe certainly until you start getting a better handle on which aches and pains are normal and which ones aren't um i mean there's a whole another we you know we can get into things like you know balance training or training load monitoring you know well let's yeah let's talk about acute versus chronic lifting i mean i used to have an um a program called training peaks that would track this for me so it saw every single day how many miles i rode and it actually did it more by kilojoules than miles so it was total energy expenditure but um if you were giving someone some guidance some rules of thumb if they were becoming active and we'd have to get into the formulas but just using the principles of acute versus chronic load balance how would you help them think through everything you just said with these metrics so the the background is that the the rule of thumb that they used to teach runners is the 10 rule never increase your your mileage more than 10 and it's a rule that makes no sense at the at the margins like if if you start by running one mile then you know you're never gonna get above five miles in your lifetime or whatever but uh this is basically the idea is trying to avoid the too much too soon problem now this idea of an acute chronic workload ratio is a sort of more sophisticated version of that and the idea is how much are you doing now versus how much is your body used to um and you know the the the way that the papers the the academic papers do it is what's your weekly load whether you do it in joules or miles or minutes and what's your average weekly load over the last four weeks and this is when they started publishing this i was like hey that's i designed my own training log back in the 90s and printed it out and that's the two things i had at the bottom was kilometers that week and average four week average kilometers and it's not because it gives you why did you why did you settle on four weeks by the way as opposed to three weeks or five weeks how did you arrive at that do you remember yeah you know there was no deep thinking involved it was basically a week versus a month um and you know you can you can argue it that yeah you need at least you know you need a decent amount of time because otherwise you have one week where you miss a couple days due to injury and then all of a sudden your four week average is totally skewed or if it's a three week you know or something and five weeks six weeks you know at a certain point you're moving so far back that your body don't no longer cares what you were capable of doing eight weeks ago or at least not as much so four weeks it's just a you know that it's kind of a for if if you've done something for four weeks in a row you and you're feeling okay then you can you kind of assume that yeah your body's able to handle that load and so then this allows you it's just a quick way of seeing if there's any deviations it's like oh my you know my this week i did 50 more than my four week average that's that's a bad bad sign uh it doesn't mean you're going to get injured there's all sorts of contextual things you have to consider in it but having that as one input into your larger matrix of all the things that you're considering like do i feel any aches and pains am i what's my absolute load not just the ratio but is this more than i've ever done before and you know all the you consider all those things and i think that acute to chronic ratio or just to put it more simply keeping track of how much your how hard you're going now versus how hard you've been going in the in the previous month uh or how much you've been doing let's say is useful now i i should add that there's controversy in the literature there's a bunch of people who say that the supposed predictive value of acute chronic workload ratio as a statistical artifact um it may be it may not be i'm not too worried about that to me this is not about uh statistical predictive power it's just about keeping an eye on on trends and and it's uh knowing if you're if you're way out of whack with what you've been doing uh before and as a general rule you know let's say if you're 20 higher that's a time to start making sure you know what you're doing yeah or just you know and backing it off maybe that next week yeah i mean i i you know unless you have some compelling reason to think that you can handle that if you're if you're exceeding 20 then probably uh um yeah be cautious and ideally back off so you alluded to it earlier but let's talk a little bit about high-intensity interval training um getting a lot of attention today obviously you know most people are familiar with what a tabata is though tabata himself is not the guy that actually designed the the protocol but everybody still refers to it by his name um where do you think this fits into the hierarchy of uh again not a specific athlete who's you know training to run the mile or the marathon uh but a person who's trying to be healthy how much of a how much of a shortcut efficiency gain is it um again let's let's use the tabata interval as an example where you're going all out for 20 seconds resting for 10 and repeating it eight times and by the way wouldn't we argue from your research and endure that you can't technically go all out for 20 seconds that you're you're really i've started when i do all out intervals i now limit them to 10 seconds because i actually started paying attention and realizing i was subconsciously pacing myself at 20 second all outs but anyway that's that's i don't know what you think about that um that idea but i remember reading in your book that that wasn't it the case that we technically can't go all out for 20 seconds it certainly doesn't seem that way and you know like look usain bolt or world-class sprinters don't go as fast i mean it's complicated by the curve but they go they don't set world records on route to 200 meters they're pacing themselves even for 20 seconds yeah um i just have to tell one quick story about tabata please i uh i was i was at a conference uh and at the poster session where the researchers are in front of their posters talking about it and i was it was a research on the uh from the mcmaster group which has popularized uh high intensity into interval training and one of the postdocs was there explaining his interval high intensity interval training research and someone came up and asked him a question and handed him his business card at the time and i i noticed the postdoc he looked down as he was answering questions he glanced down at the business card and his eyebrows just went like halfway up his forehead and i peeked over and was like oh that's tabata that's cool i didn't realize this was a real person so he was he was there uh you know asking questions about intervals anyway um where do i think intervals fit um i think they're super important when when circa 2008 when high intensity intervals started to be a big buzzword i was like how is this a buzzword that's how runners train like one of the studies out of the mcmaster group was like let's do 10 times a minute it's like that's the roger bannister that's what that's how he broke the four-minute mile in 1954. what's new about this but it was new to a lot of people a lot of people were like i need to go 45 minutes i need to go an hour i need to do this i need to do that um so there there is let me put it this way i guess what i was really getting is the is the compression of that right it's the i don't know if you saw this well i'll let you finish this but then i'll i'll bring it to where i'm going which is what are the limits of how much you oh how low yeah yeah but yeah yeah well i'll just i'll just say that as two general points one is that as a runner one thing i know is that you will never ever run fast relative to your abilities if you don't do interval training um the second thing i would say is you probably won't run as fast as you could if you only do interval training now some people do do only an interval training but that's usually they're doing it so slowly that it's not different from just doing a sustained thing so to me when you look at the studies it's like let's compare eight weeks of three interval workouts a week to eight weeks of three 45-minute sustained sessions it's like okay that's interesting it's it's useful to know but i i really don't think that's what is optimized and what we should be comparing is what what about one short in sprint interval session one medium interval session and one 45 minute session that's or or you know some portfolio is to me because there's pretty clear evidence that you get you can get to the same or some of the same health outcomes you can get the same improvement in insulin sensitivity sensitivity say but the mechanisms may be different if you if you're doing a sprint interval session versus or if you're doing sprint interval training versus sustained training and so it's like well if you've got two different mechanisms let's hit them both because presumably we're going to get a little one plus one is going to be at least equal to we know 1.2 or something like that so i'm i think interval i would 100 recommend to anyone that they should be including some form of interval training in their uh routine if they're interested in health or performance i i wouldn't necessarily recommend it's the only thing unless that's what they want to do i i would i would put it as part of a portfolio and as far as the sprint stuff goes but we can talk about this but it's like it it has been funny to watch the the uh it's not like one up and ship it's one downman ship how short can we make it's like okay i thought about interval training for a millisecond last night look i got fitter it's amazing well that's only a it's only a a slight exaggeration from a study that came out recently from actually from from here in ut austin um ed coyle who is a physiologist and and published a study looking at four seconds all out 56 seconds of rest so it's on the every minute on the minute but only four seconds all out and this was done i believe for 15 minutes and then they progressed to basically four seconds all out twice a minute so you go four seconds all out 26 seconds of rest repeat you know for 20 minutes something to that effect um again i you know here's my take on these things it comes down to a concept you raised earlier which is there's an opportunity cost to them it they're usually comparing that to doing nothing and is that better than sitting on the couch yes but if you gave if you gave me 40 minutes a day could i come up with a more efficient way to get a benefit i probably could and then it becomes a question of what's the efficacy versus effectiveness of this intervention and i think that's the other piece of this right which is i think people like you and i like exercise so much that we get to focus all of our effort or interest on efficacy what is actually going to do the best produce the best results when adhered to perfectly but i accept the fact that many people don't enjoy exercise and therefore the real world applicability of a problem becomes its effectiveness it's not what can be done in a laboratory for six weeks when you're a paid subject it's what are you going to be willing to do on your own when you have to rely on your own sprinkling of motivation dust day in and day out and so i guess on some level that's where i've become a little bit more accepting of the fact that hey if people are willing to do shorter interval workouts provided they don't get injured that's always the fear i have when people jump right into these high intensity interval workouts without any of the foundational strength that goes into it if the alternative is doing nothing well then it's better but i guess secretly i just hope that i can convince people that they're better off learning to love exercise which again i think is why a book like yours is so great right it explains like how we evolved and you know the the more we can think about reconciling what we are today with what we spent a million years becoming uh perhaps the less foreign that feels so i i think you've put your finger on exactly the issue which is it's yeah it's not about what does better in this lab context it's it's what will people do and i actually i'm a little bit skeptical that four seconds at the intensity that you have to do those intervals is more acceptable to the average person than than let's say one minute so going back to a little history of on the hit stuff the the first hit protocol was wingate test which is like 30 seconds all out and anyone who's done a wingate test you know if you do it in the lab they're screaming at you it's like you know we're going to shoot your mother if you don't go as hard as you can and you get every people puke after wingate tests so the the original protocol was four wind gate tests with seven minutes rest because that's how hard they are going back it's like what we were saying earlier about how hard an 800 meter race a two minute two minute race can be compared to like a marathon you can really suffer in those 30 seconds and so when they're like well okay it works in the lab but in real life what's what are people gonna do their answer initially wasn't like we should make it shorter it was well the intensity that people can actually get to in real life we should that's where the 60 second on 60 second off protocol came from because it's like it's easier for people to accept 60 seconds pretty hard than it is to expect them to imagine the you know homicidal drill sergeant behind them yelling at them to get all of it out of themselves in 30 seconds now you're going down to let's say there's been 20 seconds there's been 10 seconds there's been four seconds it takes it's hard it takes a lot of motivation you have to be 100 on to get the most out of this 4 second or 10 second or whatever interval so there's a lot of debate understandably about like okay well which is it that people will do would they rather do 20 minutes at medium or you know 40 minutes easy or four seconds hard i think there's a lot of debate because there's different there's a lot of different people people like different things and some people are love that that power thing and that that's great and again like you said it's i don't think it's as good as doing a mixed portfolio of things but i think it's it's pretty good and if they'll do it that's great but i i think the the assumption of this race to the bottom of how how short can you make the interval is that people like it more and i'm not sure that's true for everyone i love your comment about i thought about in high intensity intervals for a second last night um i i will say this one of the things that i think is a big challenge here is most people aren't clear on the the why they just want to do the what you know this is sort of the going back to my pet peeve of people confusing strategy for tactics um and i don't i think if people don't understand the benefits of the different types of exercises and why you're doing them you know actually reverse engineering what the purpose is so you're thinking about the 90 year old version of you in a chair he needs to get up well that gives you the motivation to do strength training and if you didn't have the aerobic conditioning you'd start to think well once i get up out of said chair what do i want to do oh i might actually want to go and walk around the block with my grandchild oh what would that involve well at my house there's a hill and that hill goes from here to there and what if i want to stick them in a wagon and pull them like that's actually going to require aerobic capacity and that hill is pretty short so it's actually going to be pretty intense like it actually requires a near maximal effort for me and so i just think that the more people can tether what it is they are doing this for to something real it becomes a little easier to do these abstract workouts because otherwise like what are we doing right like once you stop competing in something which is you know a fraction of the percent of the population it all this exercise stuff becomes abstract and frankly you know the the prac the the practice of medicine doesn't do a great job communicating the why right i mean most most people know they should exercise but i don't think they've really had a great explanation as to you know for example fighting cancer when you're fit is probably a lot easier than fighting cancer when you're not fit simply based on the energetics of your immune system most people don't know that and therefore it's a bit abstract why they should be exercising so much yeah i mean you could say the definition of insanity is is telling people that exercise is good for them yet again and hoping that that on its own is going to convince people to to exercise it it's clear that doesn't work so i think well you know what you say is right you need to to to uh to make it visceral and and to relate to things that people care about and so that people care about different things so you have to understand what each person cares about and and then find out what what the right exercise for them is that's gonna it's gonna connect for them last thing i wanna ask you about alex is basically the the merger of the two careers you've had um i've probably been pretty critical of your profession which is uh science journalists um or journalists who cover science let's put it that way um because truthfully i think most of them are really bad and i think many of them actually border on negligent and uh i think they cause on some levels more harm than good to the public um how i mean obviously i don't put you in that category and there are many people i don't put in that category who i think are excellent at science journalism but but they're in the they're in the they're really in the minority um so most of the sensationalized sensationalized um you know and and frankly even the news stories that just don't have the the detail that i think should at least be covered in a news story given the understanding that very few people are going to go back to the primary source and read it places an enormous responsibility on scientific journalism do you think there's a systematic way to make this process better oh that's a that's a heavy question the problem is or at least my perception is the problem and this is self-serving since i'm a science journalist is that journalism now follows the audience you know and i started out in 2006 let's say just at the point where news organizations were first starting to be able to see how many people clicked on a story and this was you know one of the great catastrophes of of of journalism in some ways because it's it's terrifying to find out what people click on uh it's it's unhealthy for the news organizations to find out what people click on i i can remember so that the big newspaper in canada is the globe and mail and you know early on as as newspapers went online they started to you know people realized it's kind of nice to have what are the top 10 most clicked on stories so then you can go and and i remember when the globe as far as i remember i might i don't know the exact timeline but shortly after they introduced this feature i was like how is it that the top 10 stories on the globe and mail website like three of them are about britney spears two of them are about like you know it was just like i thought the global mail is supposed to be the kind of highbrow newspaper in canada and it looks like it's a bunch of simpering morons who are who are clicking but like then i look at what i click on sometimes and it's like sometimes you're just tired and you click on the sort of craziest thing so anyway sorry i'm drifting off the point here which is that

[02:25:27] to fix science journalism you you need or to encourage good science journalism you need people to read good science journalism and i i think newspapers are realizing that following the audience has turned out to be a bad move because they've ended up losing the trust in audience but by giving people what they thought they wanted you ended up basically giving them crap and then having people recognize that they were being fed crap and then kind of rebel against it so like where i started my journalism my science my sport science journalism career in some sense was i started a blog on wordpress in like i don't know 2008 or something where i was just like you know what i can't write this in a newspaper article but on this blog i know there are people who are interested in the details of what the study says i'm going to have the key figure from the study and i'm going to say how many people were in this were you know how many subjects there were and what their characteristics were and what the intervention was uh and that's that's the blog that became it got taken on to runners world in 2012 and then moved over to outside in 2017. it turned out there was an audience for that um which which is encouraging so i think i guess i'm not answering your question at all which is how do you fix it but i i i think the the the finding an audience that appreciates it is is or at least having some i don't know let's see what am i trying to say here that that the news organizations aren't going to insist on scientifically qualified journalists unless there's there's repercussions or feedback when there's bad journalism and i think the initial signals were the opposite they were actually getting feedback that the less complicated it was and the more sensational it was the more feedback they got so maybe you know to try and actually give one concrete answer to your question is that the move away from advertising and towards subscription-based models i think has helped and hopefully will continue to help move away from like just let's do what's most sensational to let's do what's most let's give people a filling meal that you know that they're not going to be hungry 10 minutes later so so maybe that trend is is is a good one in in some ways yeah and look i i don't know that i expected you to have an answer because this is a question i've thought about for um a decade actually probably around 2011 is when i started really becoming frustrated with journalism and science um which is not to say that's when it started i think that's just when i began to notice it enough and realized that the signal-to-noise ratio had fallen to zero and i you know and of course to this you know if you ask my friends there's no better way to drive me nuts than just to forward me a headline and without even a question like as though somehow i'm supposed to read this idiotic headline and know what your question is of me but uh yeah look i still get three of those a day so um anyway alex this has been this is this has been awesome i have like i said i've wanted to sit down with you for a couple years since i i read endure and i can't recommend it highly enough i i find it riveting um i think you're you're you're a great writer and a great storyteller and that that's to me i think one of the gems of reading a book like that is you you're reading about science but you're also reading it in the context of amazing stories personal stories stories of other uh individuals so thank you very much for that contribution and and and all of your amazing stuff on outside which i i again i can't get over how prolific you are and it's just it's it's gem after gem well thanks peter it's been a a real privilege to have a chance to to talk to you and i've
