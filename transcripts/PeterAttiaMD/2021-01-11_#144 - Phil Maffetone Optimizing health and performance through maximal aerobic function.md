## Description

Phil Maffetone is an author, health practitioner, and coach with decades of experience helping everyone from amateurs to world-class athletes optimize their health and performance. In this episode, Phil explains the importance of developing the aerobic system, defines maximum aerobic function (MAF), and explains how to determine your MAF heart rate. He then demonstrates how to integrate that into a training protocol which is designed to help people move faster at a sub maximum heart rate and increase fat utilization as the primary source of fuel—emphasizing the importance of nutrition on one's capacity to oxidize fat. Phil also extracts training insights from the amazing feats of world-class marathoners, explores the impact of a low-carb diet on one’s capacity for high intensity exercise and anaerobic performance, and explains the downstream effects of being “overfat.”. 

We discuss:
00:00:00 - Intro
00:02:30 - Phil’s background in running, and training insights from a six-day race  
00:11:00 - The difference between being “fit” and being “healthy” 
00:18:15 - Defining the aerobic and anaerobic systems, and why VO2 max doesn’t predict performance 
00:24:00 - Defining maximum aerobic function (MAF), determining your MAF heart rate with Phil’s 180 Formula, and why a strong aerobic system is crucial to health and performance 
00:37:30 - Using the MAF test to track and improve your aerobic fitness 
00:40:00 - How increasing your sub-max pace at a given heart rate can increase your maximum pace 
00:43:00 - The impact of nutrition on one’s ability to use fat as fuel while exercising
00:51:45 - Phil’s nutritional approach with patients, the concept of “carbohydrate intolerance”
00:58:00 - Assessing the impact of a low-carb diet on high intensity exercise and anaerobic performance 
01:04:45 - Extracting insights from world-class marathoners 
01:13:30 - How being “overfat” affects health and performance, and ways to decrease excess body fat

[00:00:03] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia this podcast my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness full stop and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level at the end of this episode i'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to peteratiamd.com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode [Music] my guest this week is phil maffetone phil is an author a coach health practitioner he wears many hats and many of you will probably recognize him as he's written a number of books the 80s 90s and today basically covering a number of aspects of exercise sports medicine biofeedback nutrition i first probably came across phil's work when i was in college and i was interested in aerobic training trying to improve my cycling performance at the time and became pretty interested in the way he was advocating for a very low intensity relative to what i was doing approach which of course today in hindsight seems to be quite the logical thing to do the phil's background is in biology he has a doctorate in chiropractic and he also has trained in chinese medicine and kinesiology he was in private practice for about two decades and he's now a consultant along with continuing to write doing independent research and lecturing in this episode we talk about his journey you know how he became interested in this both as an athlete himself and then ultimately as a coach we get into what is maximal aerobic function and this overlaps very closely in fact you could argue this is a very similar way to describe zone two something we speak about in a previous podcast but coming at it through a sort of different lens and using heart rate as opposed to lactate to measure it we get into the importance of fuel partitioning in addition to different levels of intensity we talk a little bit about marathon times and how they've changed over time and what that probably tells us about training so i hope you'll enjoy this episode without further delay please enjoy my conversation with phil [Music] all right phil thanks so much for making time so late in your day you're in uh where are you are you in portugal right now i'm in lisbon portugal and you know they don't have dinner here until nine or ten at night which i usually skip so it's just past lunch for me it's great to be with you so thanks peter for for having me well i've been wanting to speak with you for quite some time and we've got a lot of listeners who have been excited about getting you on a lot of questions have come about we've talked a lot about aerobic efficiency on this podcast because obviously it's such an important part of delaying the aging process so even if you take it out of the context of performance i think today we'll we'll sort of talk about both of these things sort of performance and health but it's obviously something that you've been working on for such a long time it's been kind of central to the work you've done but i kind of want to go back and give folks a bit of a sense of how you cut your teeth on this stuff so you're obviously an avid runner yourself correct i've been running since yeah since high school i guess and from track and field in high school and college and then when i got out and into practice i thought you know this road running stuff looks interesting i'm starting to see patients let me let me see what's going on and i you know i jumped into a 5k and it was a complete disaster because i was a track runner and what do we know about distance and gradually i progressed to the marathon i trained for a six-day running race on a track because i had been working with some ultra runners stu middlemen in particular and it looked like such an exciting event i thought this you know i'm gonna do this then i can you know my bio could read i've run everything from 200 meters to six days i thought that was cool of course i was by that time i was so busy with with treating other athletes that i was just not able to get the time on the training all the training was on a track because the race was on the track yeah tell people what a six day race is yeah a six day race is a running race where you run on the track and the person who accumulates the most miles or kilometers is the winner you can run as you please you can start and stop anytime you can sleep if you want if you can stay awake good luck and i i trained some people and it was for me a fascinating thing clinically it was really akin to having a a mouse in a lab where you you know you do something to this mouse and then you put them back in the cage and have them run on the on the wheel for a while then you take them out and you do something else measure something and you know it was such a great learning experience for me and it was a great opportunity to really hone my skills of observation in terms of gait and talking to an athlete finding out when they really were tired unlike what they said it was just so many really fascinating things and then the idea of doing the race seemed quite interesting and i just ran out of training time and so what is the ideal strategy in my mind right now i'm going through multiple ideas for how one could approach a six day race and you know one idea that comes to mind is you simply walk 18 hours a day and sleep six hours a day or you know you walk 20 sleep for and never put yourself under incredible duress but also never go too fast the sort of slow and steady wins the race approach and then alternatively you can see something crazy where you you know actually take out a reasonable clip and run for you know an hour and take an hour off but of course in that scenario you don't really get a full recovery so what did you discover was the optimal scenario for covering the most amount of ground in six days what i discovered was you you start the race by walking and now you're the only runner who's walking the gun goes off everybody starts running you're left walking and that was always a kind of a comical scene for me and the runners i worked with stu middlemen in particular who has the maybe still has the american record for that distance they were a little embarrassed in the beginning but the strategy was to start slow gradually run faster start jogging gradually hit a certain plateau using the heart rate that maximum aerobic heart rate that we can talk about at some point so very easy relatively easy relatively low heart rate and then now you're two hours into the the first run maybe three hours and then you start cooling down and you take a half an hour to cool down basically just the opposite of what you did in the beginning and now you can get off the track and take a very short break and then get back on the track and do the same thing and that segment would sometimes be elongated in the beginning in particular because people are kind of jittery and they want to do something taking a break is not something they want to do and so there's no hard running certainly there's no high heart rate high intensity training you do see that in in other athletes and that's how the days go by that's it so you spend a fair amount of time walking and with stu in particular as an example stu really liked the idea of going for 36 hours without sleep and i said okay let's try it and it worked out well so we did that and then we took a longer break before getting back into a 24-hour cycle i tell you the interesting thing for me is that it was exhausting for me because i really had to be awake longer than than he did because i couldn't sleep when he slept because we had a specific time frame for him to sleep sometimes as short as seven minutes and i needed to be awake when he was waking up because sometimes he didn't know where he was and so for me it was quite a stress it was quite i mean the circa you know you're interfering with your circadian rhythm so much that you could literally hallucinate after day four by day five potentially and i've i've done that so it's a very different kind of event than most runners have ever experienced yeah it sounds a lot like ram the race across america in cycling which i interviewed a guy named mike trevino a while ago who has done ram a number of times and his stories are are very similar to that and again very different strategies that many cyclists will take but there's nobody at the end of that that's not in a significant world of pain and the hallucinations can lead to crashes and all sorts of crazy things and it's pretty high stakes racing it's a obvious indication of significant brain stress but i think the key is to like with everything else individualize it with your athlete and and like i said stu had this idea that he wanted to go for 36 hours which we had talked about a lot beforehand and that became part of the strategy because that's something that he wanted to do and the way we did it seemed like we weren't going to sacrifice his health much and so it was okay for me and i think in in whether you're on a bike or running or whatever you you need to as a coach as a clinician and in that kind of race i served as a clinician because i did things like biofeedback neuromuscular biofeedback obviously there's significant stress in that area of the body you still want to allow the athlete to voice you know how they would like to do this race and then you want to voice how you think it should be done you come to some meeting of the minds but for me it was always i'm not willing to sacrifice the health of this athlete because that's that's against what i do as a clinician as a coach i want him to perform his best and he was running about a hundred miles a day for six days that's that's not a bad performance wow at what point did your thinking start to transition from the training of peak athletes to sort of a broader set of metrics or parameters that could be applicable to health or did that not occur in sort of the fashion i've sort of described it it occurred the opposite way i always loved sports i loved sports myself i competed at a very high level i played other sports and in undergraduate school my goal was hey i want to study and get out into the world and my goal is to help people it was my goal was to help people with their health and i knew there was this fitness thing and i wasn't sure how it goes together but i i i didn't focus it the athlete component was not really there in in those early early days when i got into practice and started seeing athletes who were injured they were local athletes who were you know they were they were five 10k runners half marathon runners some of them were marathoners you know this was the the boom in the 70s and there were a lot of patience because there were a lot of injuries and so my focus was why are they getting injured and i would gradually see better and better athletes locally that led to two things one some of those athletes got really good and and attained a national class level and and then they referred people that they knew who were professionals and i started seeing pro athletes who were in running of course because that was the big thing back then but there was this thing on the west coast called the triathlon which just fascinated me to death because i was a swimmer and i was a cyclist and a runner and to have three events to work with was just it was exciting and i started seeing some local people who were you know i was in the new york city area so i was on the east coast where it took a while for the word of triathlon to get there and when it did there were some athletes and that was a lot of fun as well so this is now sort of late 70s right when the triathlon movement starting in hawaii kind of migrating over to california and the west coast yep and it was still new it was crazy and all we all we really knew about it were these these three guys in a bar who were arguing about who's the better athlete the swimmer the cyclist or the runner and you know blah and that i don't know how accurate that story is but supposedly that's that's how the event started and interestingly enough early on there was a double iron man i worked with somebody who who did that but yeah that was late 70s and then into the 80s and by then i was seeing some professionals in most sports by then certainly by them by the mid 80s i had seen professionals in all sports and by the mid 80s what fraction of your practice is professional athletes or athletes competing at a very high level versus normal people who are coming to you saying i'm overweight or i have diabetes or something like that gosh i have to you know by then my clinic was so busy i was taking on associates so i had other doctors in the clinic you know my goal was for them to treat the local patients i had because i was now starting to travel with athletes which i hadn't hadn't done mark allen was a patient of mine by that point and i think it was 83 i'd been doing some sports clinics on the road in various cities san diego was one and that's where i first met mark and paul and newby frazier and some of those other folks who were just getting going and so by the mid 80s i was on the road a lot and certainly by the mid-80s i was in boulder every summer because that's where a lot of athletes went and so i went there so by that point most of the patients i had were competitive athletes who i was working one-on-one with and i was doing a lot of lecturing starting to do a lot of writing as well so at what point did you sort of i would say congeal the idea that said hey we need to train at a lower level of intensity for longer periods of time you know we're going to get into obviously the methodology but i want to talk even broader than that which is did you look at athletes and say wait a minute something's a muck here these people are training too much or either either volume is too high or intensity is too high but something is off and we need to do something that's sort of counterintuitive which is dial this back in one or both of those metrics was there did you sort of see that in the 80s oh i saw it before the 80s i saw it quite early because i was seeing these people who were were able to run a marathon in whatever time and that was like wow this guy could run a marathon what an example of optimal health well it wasn't because they were broken down they were getting sick you may remember i mean back then you know it was a badge of courage to have a high white blood count because you were a runner and i i started putting all these things together and it was pretty clear that something wasn't right cooper's aerobic revolution was not something wasn't working you don't just go out and train and and everything falls into place these people were falling apart so that that was in the 70s when i started seeing that and i was having a hard time understanding that relationship between being healthy and being fit and when i ran the the new york city marathon in 1980 and i crossed the finish line it just hit me these athletes are fit but unhealthy and that whole concept of fit but unhealthy and fitness and and health are two separate definitions and they need to be balanced whether you're a grandmother who goes out for a walk four or five times a week or you're training for the race of your life as a professional it's all the same and many of the things that i developed like the the maf test for example were never meant for athletes they were meant for the average person because i thought whatever we're doing to this person to help them get healthier we need an indication not just a blood test we don't want to know if their blood picture looks better you want a functional test we want a functional test that at the time didn't really exist and so the functional test for me was that they were going to be able to walk faster at the same low heart rate than they could a month or two earlier and that was that was the big thing and then soon after that i said hey wait a minute these guys are running faster now at the same heart rate and i i thought wow this is this is interesting can you give folks an explanation let's assume that people aren't entirely clear on the nomenclature between aerobic and anaerobic fitness this will allow us to i think more accurately talk about what sub-maximal means and maximal and all of these things people have heard the term vo2 max but i think it's important to give a bit of a context for where that'll fit on the spectrum so can you explain to folks what we mean by aerobic and anaerobic systems yeah and and i don't want to go into the the microbe definition which is where a lot of us have learned those terms you know there are aerobic microbes and anaerobic microbes so the anaerobic microbes are without oxygen and when patients would say well i i want to do some anaerobic training i'd say well what is what is that is it well it's without oxygen i said you mean you can hold your breath while you're doing the intervals and so we need a better definition and my definition became fat burning was was associated with aerobic and all of the factors that are associated with fat burning so the aerobic muscle fibers and the mitochondria and the ability to convert fatty acids into energy into atp and anaerobic was the glucose side and that was simple enough it wasn't scientific enough but it was simple enough for what people needed to understand and especially when we can come up with a heart rate that says well if you go over this heart rate you're drifting into that anaerobic state and if you stay under it you're in an aerobic state and therefore you're training your body to burn more fat as an energy source and therefore you're going to store less fat and and you're going to get rid of any excess fat and so on and so forth can you explain to folks what the vo2 max is because i want to spend some time explaining why it's not a great predictor of much despite the fact that it certainly produces boasting rights it produces for sure boasting rights it's a number that people talk about everybody talks about it and hardly anybody gets tested and almost nobody gets tested with some regularity so they could do something with the numbers we can define it academically which doesn't tell you much but it's a test that is was developed a long time ago and so there's a lot of tests around and the real question is what does it really mean and i'm not sure it means a whole i didn't do many of those tests so i you know i had an academic education and and i knew about vo2 max and i knew about all this traditional stuff the 220 formula which i used in the very beginning because i thought that was the science of of exercise physiology and quickly learned it wasn't and vo2 max was right there and and vo2 max became the tradition i think it was the tradition back then i don't remember when it was first developed it was by hill wasn't it back in i actually don't know who developed it in 1920s but for listeners i think it's it's a relatively straightforward test to administer provided you have the machinery and the machinery is complicated because you have to be able to isolate gases very well specifically oxygen and carbon dioxide so the test is normally done on either a treadmill or a stationary bike where you can control the resistance or the the load that the athlete is under the challenge is creating an airtight seal around their nose and their mouth because what you're really doing with the test is you want to measure how much oxygen is coming out of their respiratory system and how much co2 is coming out because you know how much is going in and therefore the difference is the amount of oxygen consumed now if you're sitting here at rest you have a vo2 an amount of oxygen that's consumed and the purpose of the test is to ramp up the level of exertion until you reach the maximum level of oxygen consumption so vo2 max is simply the maximum amount of o2 consumed and the difference between a very fit person and a non-fit person is the fitter you are the more oxygen you're able to consume and that's basically a function of your muscles it's what can the muscles do so i think a lot of people erroneously think this is a test of the heart and lungs but it's not really a test of the heart and lungs right the lungs is where the gas exchange is happening the heart is the circulatory pump it's really a test of what your muscles can do in terms of utilizing that oxygen and to your point it's how much fat oxidation can happen because that's where you're utilizing the oxygen is in the mitochondria to oxidize fat but all of that said the research actually says that you can't predict marathon finish time by vo2 max you're right and people don't like hearing that because they have this idea that this set now this vo2 max is directly associated with performance so they need to rev up their vo2 max by doing hard training which will get them performing better and that you know that's where the whole system breaks down that's the problem we have this vo2 max is a it's something we we have been worshiping and we're worshiping the wrong thing so tell folks what maf stands for maf stands for maximum aerobic function and in essence the goal of being healthy the goal of being fit is to develop the aerobic system this is what our ancestors did this is how we got here we developed a really incredibly powerful aerobic system by doing the things in our lifestyle that drive that aerobic system to develop which includes eating more fat not eating much carbohydrate eating moderate amounts of protein maybe even relatively small amounts of protein for the earlier humans because we were we were not the hunters in those early stages but we we certainly ate a large amount of fat and we didn't sprint after animals we jogged after animals and so all of that is how we we developed we developed bigger brains bigger bodies we developed bodies that had great longevity and a higher level of health to match that longevity and it doesn't take long when you start reading about this and and it was really an anthropology course i think that i first started reading this kind of stuff and it was really quite fascinating because i said well if that's what they were doing why are we doing all this other stuff now and that sort of got me thinking about this as an undergraduate student because it seemed pretty clear what our ancestors were doing and the fact that they were doing it for so long you know just what happened between some time ago and now how do we get into the mess we're in and so the concept of maximum aerobic function has been really with me for for quite some time when i was working with runners which is almost all the athletes i worked with certainly in the 70s i started talking about the pace that these athletes could run at with this given heart rate that i had come up with this aerobic heart rate and i called it the maximum aerobic heart rate and so the pace they were running was the maximum aerobic pace and how did you come up with that heart rate that heart rate was derived in combination of a physical exam in my office i want to know how healthy they were i want to know about their history what did their labs look like their posture their strength and so forth and then they i would go out to the track and i would monitor their heart rate i'd monitor their gait while we use different heart rates and so i'd see them at a 120 heart rate i'd look at their gait i'd say this is it's a pretty good gait and then we'd go to 130 that's a pretty good game maybe even a little better and then go to 140 and i'd start seeing irregularities and then i'd bring them back to 130 and i'd see a nice smooth gate again and i'd put all that together and i'd assign them a certain maf heart rate and they would go train and then i would test them again to see if it correlated and it was a long process and it was it would not be for two or three years when i developed a formula which i never used personally because i always wanted to do it manually but they correlated so well and you may have heard me say i was lecturing one day about this and how i came up with this heart rate and what it meant and how people were benefiting from it and somebody said well how do we come up with that heart rate and i i didn't have an answer and i started realizing that well there's probably some simple mathematical process that i can go through to use the the athletes i had i already know their heart rate let's plug in the numbers and the 180 formula was born i tweaked that for a couple of years and the formula you see today is basically the same formula that existed in the early 80s let's go through it in a bit more detail just to make sure folks understand what we're saying you're saying that a person is going to be at their maximum aerobic output so meaning they're going to be maximally fat oxidizing at an approximate heart rate of 180 minus their age plus or minus a few modifications so i believe there are a handful of these if you're recovering from an illness or you're kind of in an over trained situation you might actually need to discount that by another 10 right it might be 170 minus your age correct the key is that you want to individualize it so you begin with 180 minus the age which has no meaning like the the 220 formula that you know you subtract your age from 220 and they say it's your maximum heart rate or whatever yeah your max heart rate and of course it's not most of the time so 180 minus age has no meaning it's just a means to the end but you now want to individualize it to your health and fitness needs so if you're recovering from an illness if you're severely over trained if you're in rehab you want to subtract another 10 from that but if you're not in that category and you only have the typical two or three colds a year you might have asthma or seasonal allergies you might be over fat you might be training for a while and then you kind of you lose time you can't train and then you get back into it and not in that category you subtract another five all the way to the competitive athlete who has no health problems who has been progressing quite well they can add five to that number so in the you know that formula what's important for people is to follow the formula and be honest that's the hardest part is to be honest so if you're on medication for example you've got to subtract your age from 180 and you've got to subtract another 10. and what kind of meditation does does it matter doesn't matter that's the thing people will say well i'm only on this and that's not really affecting my heart rate or or i don't have to be on it or i i don't know what you know if you're on medication you subtract 10. and if you get healthy along the way by training this way and now you can get off your medication well now you could redo the formula because now you're no longer on medication you're healthier let's have a look at the 180 formula again and modify it as needed you know it's like doing a a history on a patient the most important thing is that they be honest because if you don't get the right information you're you're in trouble so it's kind of amazing to me by the way that you were able to do so much with heart rate back in the 70s and 80s what what did you even use for heart rate monitors or were people just manually checking their heart rate doing these tests well yeah i began manually checking heart rates there were some finger units that were not very accurate there's some clips you put on the ear they were not accurate unlike the ear buds that are used today picking up the heart rate in the ear in the ear canal is a good measure and i finally got a heart monitor that was used in cardiac rehab in hospitals and it was a big obnoxious you know double strap one went over the shoulder one went around the chest and it had this box that was in the middle and it you know all you got was the heart rate you could see it in this tiny window and you can hear the thing beeping and it would be several years before the wireless monitors came out which i think was late in 83 maybe and when i first started using this heart monitor i had one in my office it was like having you know i had a stethoscope okay and i used it when i needed to use it and so i had this heart monitor and i would use it go to the track put it on an athlete we'd use it take it off put it on another athlete and i silly me i thought well okay once they feel what 130 heart rate or 150 heart rate is like they'll be able to train that way well that didn't work so then i started lending out the heart monitor and then i had to buy another one and then i had like three of them you know it was like you have three heart monitors yeah i have three in my office it was like the old you know 1950s people had one television and if somebody had two television it was like you mean you have two tvs wow that's you know you know then people started buying them they said i'm gonna train with this because when i train with it i feel better i'm not tired i'm you know my back doesn't hurt anymore and blah blah blah it progressed that way and then when the wireless heart monitors came out everybody wanted to buy one which was interesting so the formula the math formula of 180 minus age and then adjusted based on all the factors is a way to basically gauge the intensity how did you then prescribe volume and how did you not only prescribe the volume there but determine how much volume to add in that was at a higher intensity that's an interesting question it really began early on when i had no intention of coaching i didn't want to be a coach i you know i want to be a clinician and fix people's knees and help them you know get off blood pressure medications or whatever and with athletes i thought if i could just keep them from getting injured they'll just perform better because you know that seemed to be the thing that slowed them down getting some physical injury and i realized that i was treating symptoms i was i was really you know was against my nature to to do that i was i was fixing some runners knee and they'd go out and train and then i'd see them again in my clinic a month later with the same knee problem i said well what what did you do he said well i just did my normal training and you know eventually i said well let me look at your training and people would write down their schedules and i would start looking at it and i realized that i didn't i needed to have some input on this schedule because what they're doing was excessive they were literally over training and so i became a coach and i didn't want to be like a regular coach where i'd give out a schedule i wanted them like i said earlier with with with stu middleman i wanted the athlete to be part of the process you know i wanted to say well what would you like to do with your training and they'd bring in their schedule and i'd look at it and i would just say let me get this straight you work 60 hours a week you have three kids and a house and you do all these social things and you're trying to run 100 miles a week that doesn't make sense you either have to get rid of your kids get rid of your family get rid of your job or reduce the number of miles you're running and so you know i i got a lot of laughs and we we went on and i found that people could do a lot less training at a lot less intensity and perform in a race a whole lot better and it didn't take long to see that you know it's like a taper when you taper you get stronger well when you cut somebody's schedule down they can get more out of their training and so it it worked that way and so the the big issue was really this aerobic system stuff how do you build the best aerobic system of course i had been familiar with arthur lydiard who was a patient in my clinic actually at one point and so i knew about this concept of the aerobic base and and it just seemed to make a lot of sense and what i found through working with a number of patients that if they if they do their traditional two days a week of interval training on the track they never got faster at the same heart rate like these other people did who seem to excel quite quickly from from one month to the next they could be running starting at a nine minute a mile pace at their maf heart rate they might be running 830 a month later same heart rate months later now they're running at eight minute pace okay so i want to pause there for a sec so when the athlete makes progress when they're doing their maf test which again i just want to remind everybody because we're we're talking about both an maf heart rate but then the maf test and these are very important concepts so let's go back so i figure out either through a very bespoke manner or using the formula that my math heart rate is 130. i go out and i'm going to do my training at 1 30 and i'm running a 9 minute mile the question becomes while keeping my heart rate at 130 can i get faster can i go from a 9 minute mile to an 8 30 mile to an 8 minute mile and if i can do that while staying at 130 by definition i have become aerobically fitter and more efficient correct correct now is there a point at which you begin to adjust up the heart rate and say peter i want you to now train at 132 or do you keep me at 130 and see how far we can drive that down until i plateau how do you make that decision i keep you at 130 because i've determined that 130 is a good number for you because you're progressing now can we cheat a little bit up to 132.1 133 and only to find out two months later that you're back to where you were i don't want to spend that time because at some point i've had enough experience to know that's not a good use of our time so we're going to stay at 1 30 and we're going to allow your body to develop that aerobic system the question people often have is well how do i run faster at the same heart rate it doesn't make sense and the answer is that you're you're able to generate a lot of energy from fat you're you're building the aerobic system so you you're increasing fat burning now you have more energy you have you have the steam engine the more wood or coal you throw in there the more that engine can can go and the faster it can go and you will progress and you'll month after month get faster and faster at some point you will hit a plateau and and early on i realized it took three four five six months before people hit a plateau so there are two issues one is do we keep allowing the body to get faster and faster which for an endurance athlete is the greatest benefit they can obtain because if they can go faster at a sub max pace they can go faster at a max pace let's unpack that for a minute that let's unpack that that's a very very important statement can you talk about some of the experiences you've had to establish that and again actually before we do that phil let's talk about why that's relevant you're running a 10k let's say at the very competitive level a 10k is you know depending on how competitive obviously can be sub 30 minutes but if you're kind of a recreational athlete who's running competitively you're going to be in the you know 32 33 34 minute range by definition you're running well above your math target is it necessarily true that if you take the top 10 finishers of that race and then a week later have them run at their math heart rate they'll cover greater distances as a function of what they ran in the 10k race in other words do we do we have evidence that that's true because if it is it's a remarkable statement right we do have evidence that that is true hypothetically you have the outlier who's this guy who can't run nine minutes without hitting a 180 heart rate these are the people who are over trained enough to be in that sympathetic state they get into a 10k and they run a pr an amazing feat how could you know i run a minute and a half faster might be you know these are the people that are ready to fall apart at any minute and i've seen them these are also the people who are ready to drop dead of a heart attack and so if we take those outliers away then yes we have this hierarchy of of athletes who have a increasingly better sub max condition that corresponds to their race pace if that's true then phil it would really lend credence to the idea that even if you're training for a 5k or a 10k you still want to push your maf protocol it still matters how much you can how much distance you can cover at that lower heart rate and lower intensity where you are running at your maximum fat oxidation and maximum aerobic capacity yeah and i think it's pretty clear now that sub max performance predicts maximum performance how far down can you go even for a miler i think it comes down to how much fat burning do we need and even for a mile there's a lot of fat burning taking place in a one mile race i want to ask you about that when i was in medical school the conventional wisdom was that fat oxidation could not exceed one gram per minute now i didn't think much of it but many years later when i underwent an enormous dietary switch and i went from being a kind of ultra distance athlete basically mainlining carbohydrates so probably consuming i would say five bottles of powerade a day so let's say if i was training four hours a day i would go through five liters of powerade plus cytomax plus hammer perpetuum like basically all of these very high carbohydrate formulas you know rotting my gut and when i would do my vo2 max testing which i did pretty frequently you get a lot of data on the way up to vo2 max you're getting all of your fuel partitioning data because you're getting vo2 and vco2 so i know how much i know how many calories i'm expending at every level of intensity and i know what the mixture is of carbohydrate versus fat so clearly in that state i was nowhere near oxidizing one gram of fat per minute in fact i was pretty much only oxidizing glucose the entire level in other words even at my low intensity i was still a glucose oxidizer fast forward years several years i've tried something totally radical i've gone on a ketogenic diet i've done it for not just a while but actually for three years and i've become very adapted to it such that i can function at high and low intensity and i'm now doing the same thing i'm repeating vo2 max testing but on this ketogenic diet and i hit a fat oxidation which is still sub maximal so it's just below my vo2 max but my max fat ox was 1.73 grams per minute wow and i remember thinking how is that even possible now of course i would go on to learn that world-class athletes training on a very low carbohydrate diet were able to hit 2 2.1 even 2.2 grams per minute which i found interesting it basically said that this conventional wisdom we have about sports nutrition and sports science is largely predicated on assumptions of what people are eating that aren't necessarily the optimal way to go about doing it it's a very good point and i mean you and i came to that that same conclusion in different ways and we also had the same studies to look at the same lab tests to do and unfortunately we had a lot of the same subjects or we read about studies that use the same subjects which were big carbohydrate eaters that distorted the research completely but all along the way i i knew there was something about fat and the question is well how could we really measure it and i knew we could do it in the lab my clinic was in the middle of i mean i was in the new york city suburbs at the time so i occasionally had access to a lab occasionally could get somebody in there to test and occasionally they would say wow this is amazing how could this person burn so much fat we don't understand this it must be a problem and then you know as the months and years went by you know it was not a problem anymore this was great and so all along the way for me it was always i know what's going on i know this athlete's getting healthy i know they're burning more fat because they're running faster at the same maf heart rate and now we're starting to see it be measured and it was a point where i said i can't be the scientist i'm not really a scientist i do wear that hat but i'm too busy being a clinician and coming up with all these crazy tests and still my primary concern was helping people get healthy and and fit and if it was an athlete it meant they were going to perform better but not by sacrificing their health and if they were not an athlete we still had a lot of work to do and and it was only after a while that i started thinking more scientifically i always thought scientifically depending on who you ask you know if you ask a scientist they would say well i'm not i'm not being very scientific when i explain this maf heart rate and if i ask a clinician they say you know you're too scientific about this so i gradually became more and more scientific only because a it was fun especially reading the new research and b it was much better for me as a clinician to explain things in scientific terms i still had that scientific mentality of this is how we communicate to the rest of the world from a scientific standpoint so the fat burning component became that factor that we can measure more and more and like this the story you told of the changes you made and how it affected fat burning you know i started gathering that kind of data and started writing more as a clinician you can't publish papers you just can't you know your brain is unable to to spend time doing that because you're spending so much time doing other things and it wasn't until after i left my clinic because healthcare was getting so bad i i just couldn't do that anymore and i i ended up only working with with athletes and so healthcare was really out of the picture in in many ways and then i was able to spend more time thinking and writing scientifically and start publishing more i wrote a textbook i started publishing more scientific papers and talking about all this with a scientific hat on rather than merely a clinical hat although a lot of the scientific things i've written are clinical oriented because that's still my goal is to help people and one of the ways of helping people is to help other clinicians who can then in turn help their patients there's something about this nutritional component that i think creates a lot of confusion for people which is that it tends to be in flux so it's not constant when i was young so call it the first athletic phase of my life which i would say is about age 13 to 18. so between the ages of 13 to 18 i was indestructible just like most 13 you know to 18 year olds are you can do anything there is no such thing as over training nor is there such a thing as overeating i could consume such comical amounts of food and they were really not of high quality at all right so you know breakfast would be a box of cereal and a large tupperware bowl the entire box i mean six or seven sandwiches for lunch every day so a whole loaf of bread turned into sandwiches plus french fries plus a one gallon thing of orange juice i mean just disgusting quantities of food but absolutely no impairment of performance or health at least by any measurable amount but by the time i'm in the sort of second and third phase of my life into my late 20s and my 30s my tolerance for that amount of carbohydrate went down and so even though i was still exercising a lot certainly by by any normal standard you know i metabolically became quite sick and i became the example of that guy who can't outrun his bad diet although in my case i was out swimming it i was trying to outswim it or outride it and so how did you then either as a coach or as a clinician trying to help just a normal person calibrate not just the intensity of exercise not just the duration of exercise but now this third layer which is specifically what is the carbohydrate tolerance of the individual given that one two people can be similar in very in a number of ways and yet be different in that regard and secondly any given individual is likely going to see a deterioration of that over time sure and we we all become more insulin resistant as the years go by i like to call it carbohydrate intolerance because as soon as you say insulin resistance to the average person they either shut down or they panic or they totally ignore you because that's a hard it's a hard term to relate to because they can't relate to it carbohydrate intolerance at least when you say you're not tolerating the level of the amount of carbohydrates you're eating so you need to cut down they can relate to that they may not be happy but they can relate to that but the the more important factor was one that i already knew about although i didn't know how to apply it to patients but i already knew going again going back to undergraduate school where this idea of holism you know it came from philosophy really for me this holistic idea showed up one day and i think out of that came this idea that we're all individuals and we all have uniquenesses and i carried that with me into my clinical world and there wasn't much to do you know to measure insulin resistance back then meant going into the hospital and having a glucose clamp test you that was just unheard of they laughed at me when i sent patients to the cardiologist because i wanted to see i want to measure heart rate variability in this patient because i think there's an autonomic problem well half of them didn't have any problem but the other half did and they said well gee how do you know that you know these things as a clinician because you do a good evaluation you assess the patient and you spend a lot of time talking to the patient something that's not done anymore wasn't done much back then either but by doing that you learn about the patient you learn about so many things including insulin resistance how sensitive are are they too insulin how do they respond an obvious example is a new york city executive works in an office all day training for a marathon goes out for lunch comes back and is so tired that he has to put his head on the desk and literally fall asleep obviously bob what did you have for lunch well you start putting two and two together and it's it's not that hard and then just like the maf test where you want to see what is this person capable of doing at this given heart rate i came up with another challenge which was a food challenge called the two week test okay bob i want you to not eat those things at lunch anymore i don't even want to have you eat those things for breakfast in fact let's take away all the junk food from your diet and take and cut way down on the natural carbohydrates like lentils and beans and rice and fruits and fruit juice etc and we'll do it just for two weeks it's a challenge we want to see how you respond so we gather all the signs and symptoms that are not normal i fall asleep after meals i fall asleep easily at night because i'm so exhausted but i wake up at 2 a.m etc etc okay let's let's put these things on the table let's do this two-week test after the two weeks of eating that way let's look at all these signs and symptoms are any of them better or any of them worse well yeah three quarters of them are better of all the miracles i've seen in clinical practice the two week test is one of them because you see these people become new people after a very short period of time it's really amazing it's because insulin is involved insulin has immediate effects carbohydrates have immediate effects the two meal effect with you know it's just it's an almost an instant change so now you've you've gathered more information you're still assessing the patient but now we can start individualizing things more and more and that process was just ongoing and again i always wanted to enlist the patient so i i wanted to say okay you've done this two-week test you're feeling so much better after two weeks now we want you to add some lentils to your midday meal or add a a small piece of fruit at breakfast or whatever and let's see how you feel let's see if some of those signs and symptoms come back with just one piece of fruit or let's see if you've lost 10 pounds you you're starting to gain after a couple of weeks of only having a little bit of carbohydrate whatever but i want to enlist them in the process i want them to use their instincts and intuition which we all have to understand what it feels like to eat too much carbohydrate before you've gotten there one more bite of this apple and i'm in trouble i want you to know that i think it's a very important thing it's a very human thing and so that holistic component that individualizing aspect of my work has always been there and in many ways it makes it easier people might say well if you just give somebody a diet it doesn't get any easier than that well it doesn't get any rewarding when you do that either so it was a very important part and it still is a very important part even though i'm not sitting with patients one-on-one anymore usually i may do some consulting but i am writing i am still lecturing and and i could take that component of individualization of holism and get those points across to people so they can take that and run with it so to speak now i am again mentioned that you know spent all this time on a very low carbohydrate diet and saw you know enormous improvements in my aerobic when it was all said and done my anaerobic fitness my higher level intensity fitness did not deteriorate but it took a very long time for that to come around and the conclusion i drew from that was athletes who were heavily involved in glycolytic activity really ought not restrict carbohydrates as much as say athletes who are doing things that can be done at a much more aerobic level now a couple of years ago you were part of a study that sort of flew in the face of my assumptions because it was a very short study it was a four-week study and it put athletes on a very low carbohydrate diet they averaged less than 10 percent and maybe 15 protein so they were you know if they weren't on a ketogenic diet they were very close to it and they were doing high intensity interval training and you guys didn't find any difference between the groups suggesting that this amount of carbohydrate restriction did not impair performance what can you say about that study it was a good study part of it actually we published a separate paper on on it showing that the the high fat diet did not have any adverse effect on inflammation but that study really came from this idea that athletes can still burn high amounts of fat when they do interval training paul larson did you know that's how i met paul they did a study some time ago they showed that high intensity training can still produce large amounts of relatively speaking fat burning as opposed to you know burning 100 carbohydrate like you were mentioning earlier i sent him an email and i said yeah well i sent him a an athlete i had worked on who we had done some some lab studies on and at i don't remember the numbers but at about a 180 heart rate in this 36 year old athlete he was burning a lot of fat relatively speaking and i said yeah here you know here's a here's an example of what i found clinically and you know and so we've known this for a long time it's good to see that you're doing this and and uh he wrote me back and we you know we've been colleagues ever since and he was in that study so it was a study that showed what we are already knew clinically in in a sense and we wanted we wanted to demonstrate it from a lab standpoint do you remember how many participants were in that study i want to say 20 but i i that seems so long ago okay yeah so i mean it would be interesting to see if with a larger sample size that is still the case and obviously at different levels of the athlete's incoming right in other words is that true of recreational athletes only is it also true of high level athletes yeah these were students i think jeff has done jeff volk has done some some studies with the higher level athletes with some ultra athletes again they're they're not running as fast but they're running at a max level these were students and these were subjects who the ones who who were on the very low carbohydrate diet were only there for a month and my feeling is we really should have gone longer i think we could have seen different results but but they're only there for a month a month is long enough for some people but not long enough for others and there's a good argument to make that you know it should be two months or even three months to really stabilize that metabolic change but whatever it was a good study and you know like other studies somebody will see it and say hey this should be done with more people just like you said let's get more numbers let's get a wider age group let's get beginners athletes you know middle of the pack runners professional athletes professional athletes are really hard to get because they don't want to do this they don't want to go into a lab and do that but from a clinical standpoint i love all these studies i love being involved with them but for me the bottom line is can you the athlete run faster at the same sub max heart rate in fact i don't care what you do with your training or your diet if you could run faster at the same heart rate as the months go by whatever you're doing is working keep doing it so that maf test is so powerful that that's really the only thing you have to sell people on and then when they start seeing that they're they're not getting faster or when they see they've gotten faster and now they're going to start doing some weight training fatiguing type weight training or they're doing some intervals and then they get slower you know now you've got their attention now you say yeah see do you understand what's happening and you know they they start feeling it because they say well you know i i felt it wasn't quite right or i didn't feel comfortable doing that all right so when i first started using a heart monitor i thought this is this is interesting this is biofeedback by definition we're we're gonna listen to or we're gonna look at our heart rate and we're gonna respond to what that heart rate does and the goal is to be able to do that without this heart monitor so i thought really these heart monitors were just a one use maybe for maybe spent a whole week doing it now you you know how to run at 130 heart rate it never happened once in a while i see an athlete who knows exactly where they are they know exactly when they could run at that max fat burning level and i've always been amazed by that and there's some good ones and some mediocre runners who who are able to do that but most people we are in a no pain no gain world and we're seeing injuries because someone watches the new york city marathon and tv and the next day they go out and they want to run like that lead pack runner they want to stride out like you know come on man you can't even break four hours in the marathon no wonder you got injured speaking of the marathon i want to talk about this this book you wrote in 2014 which was just such a brilliant idea the title of the book is 159 the sub two hour marathon is within reach here's how it will go down and what it can teach all runners about training and racing and of course five years later in october of 2019 kipchoge goes and runs 159.40 now we can explain to people who care about the nuance that it was not technically a sub two in a world record pace it was sort of a contrived example of what could be done under the most optimal conditions it was not a a race but there's simply no denying that what kipchoge did was unbelievable he had tried a year earlier and i believe came very close was probably two double o i don't know 40 seconds or something yeah yeah right he was pretty close he was under 201. so let's put aside the the technicality of how this wasn't uh you know a world record in the typical sense of how world records are run in marathons but instead just focus on what you thought needed to happen in 2014 why you thought this was achievable and and maybe what we learned from kipchoge well i had originally written an article called the 159 marathon back in the 90s it was half i wouldn't say that it was a kind of a joke but it was half goof but half serious because the lead pack runners were running faster and faster world records were were being broken all the time there was no evidence that said this is going to stop we're going to hit a plateau and we're not going to get any faster there were people who thought that i don't know where they got those ideas from but we started seeing the fact that age group runners were not getting faster and i thought that was interesting and when you start putting numbers together such as what if you wore a lighter shoe or what if you were three pounds lighter or what if you were shorter or what if your body type was this and of course what if you were a better fat burner how much more energy would you have and then again the next obvious step is well what is your maf test need to be to run under two hours and i was getting some runners who were who were starting to hit five minute pace for their maf test they're running five minutes a mile at their maf heart rate and so i thought there's no indication that that they're reaching a limit that they're hitting a plateau in in performance so why couldn't it keep going and that's really where the idea went and it turned into a book and i'm not sure it was a book that sold very well i think you know in the 90s when i wrote that article a lot of people just asked me why i even wrote it you know this is silly what you know we're not going to see a 159 marathon in our lifetime and i said well how long do you plan on living so i think what this runner did was amazing i don't like what he did i don't like the whole idea behind it i still know that a runner's gonna do it in berlin or or london on the right day and it's relatively soon it's gonna happen and i'll be much happier to see that and you're just saying you're not happy with the way it was done because of the sort of contrived nature of it yeah it was it was an advertisement i'm not opposed to advertising but it was it was more like a circus and i think it took away from professional running as a sport that's what i didn't like about it yeah it was it was a nike commercial for sure do we know much about kipchoge's nutrition or other factors that that we could you know extrapolate from for example in a two-hour race you know even at the level he's exerting himself he technically didn't doesn't really need calories fluids should be enough do we know if he actually consumed glucose during that race i'm not aware of what what he consumed if anything you know if properly trained obviously he was burning a lot of fat if properly trained he wouldn't have needed any added nutrition maybe not even water you know water is this interesting thing because it has a lot of weight and if you dehydrate a small amount the time factor is significant enough where you're you're running faster there's this window and i don't know if it's if it's two percent dehydration from a weight standpoint or or what it might be you have this game of dehydrating but not impairing performance and as a result you're getting lighter and so you're gonna you're gonna run be able to run faster it's all about performance if you can prevent impairment of performance that's where you want to be but i don't have information my my impression with the the kenyans with the east africans is that if you look back in history we've got all these areas of the world that have taken their place on the world stage of great runners and now it's the kenyans the question is number one who's going to be next because somebody else will be next but the real question is why have all these countries come and gone and my feeling is that in kenya you know it's a very poor country these young men and women have a opportunity to become kings in their own country with the money they make on racing and they go from race to race and they race all the time and they burn out and it's really sad but i think that's what's happened and the ones i've met along the way you know at the races and at different events a lot of them are are burned out but they're going to make as much as they can make as a job and and that's it imagine being able to take one of those athletes and train them i'd want to say properly but train them more effectively i think you'd have a two-hour marathon broken already in a real race when you look at somebody like kipchoge or guys at this top level though there is a longevity to them which is they're you know i've spoken with really world-class marathoners and and many of them will sort of acknowledge they might only have a dozen marathons in them you know in their entire career where they're gonna really be able to run at a certain level and that's you know that says look i might only have 12 marathons over 15 years in me that are truly world-class performances and that's that's sort of a different philosophy than the churn and burn philosophy like look at meb when he won the boston marathon i mean he was what 39. how old was kipchoge when he went under two i mean he was in his mid-30s wasn't he yeah and that's what that's what i you know in the book i wrote this this is the makeup of a 159 marathon or someone who's in their 30s not someone's who's in their 20s not somebody who could run a great 10k they had almost had to have run a great 10k when they were younger but now that they're 35 and they they've built this great endurance space now they've got the best of everything and so yeah i my feeling is that you're you're in your mid to late 30s and maybe even 40s man i've just i've worked with some incredible 40 year olds who have won some races and you know history has shown these people and people are you know often say well these are amazing people they're outliers i don't think they're outliers i think it's i think it's the norm so i want to talk a little bit about a term that you were you used it a couple times today and i've heard you you know or seen you write about it before which is you don't like the term overweight you like the term over fat you you're very clear to talk about it's adipose tissue we should be concerned with not mass how do you think about that in the overall context of health you know we we tend to focus on weight you know if we get one more layer sophisticated we look at body mass index which of course is a highly flawed metric but where do you see the trends in fatness and how does that factor into maybe what you said earlier which is at the level of recreational athletes we're not really seeing much improvement in performance are those related i think they're related in terms of the diminishing performance of age group athletes the problem clearly the over fat condition can typically add weight to the body so that's going to affect running performance but more significantly those people with excess body fat have some downstream problems that can be very serious we're talking about chronic disease so along the way to chronic disease you have blood fat abnormalities blood sugar abnormalities blood pressure abnormalities and these things then lead to chronic diseases so of course in that situation people are not going to be performing their best over fat excess body fat also impairs the immune system so people tend to get sick more often and paul larson and i wrote a paper on this regarding covid early early on in the in the spring actually and people with excess body fat also have physical impairment problems more frequently and so we're talking about the basic simple injury that plantar fasciitis or and also pain patterns so low back pain on the less serious all the way to the the arthritis that are affecting runners but again in an injured athlete you're not going to perform your best so these things are gonna over the years show diminishing performance in age groupers and it's number one that's really sad to see number two it's even more sad to not be acknowledged i just don't see people talking about this i don't understand why i think people are starting to acknowledge that it always takes longer i guess someone like you who's sort of been clinically at the forefront of a lot of these things it seems like what's taking so long because you know you're seeing these things many years before but for example i you know sugar consumption is actually declining but it sometimes takes a while for this decline to necessarily translate into some of the health benefits and furthermore these things are so multifaceted right i think that i don't actually know the data on this so i'm kind of making this up but i would guess that you can sometimes see an improvement in one parameter and a deterioration in others for example activity levels might be declining even while certain elements of nutrition improve and so the net effect of that could be a reduction or something we didn't talk about sleep quality of sleep could be declining and that can sort of offset any benefit that we see but this idea that health and performance are not necessarily the same thing is something i i see a lot of people struggle with it right i see a lot of people who are not very healthy believe that the key to getting healthier is to train for a marathon or train for an iron man or train for this bike race or train for this event and it it usually puts me in a bit of an awkward position because on the one hand i'm so grateful that they have found something to do to be active and to train for and i don't want to discourage that but i also want them to understand that there's nothing especially healthy about doing an iron man and that one doesn't need to do that to be healthy so do you have a message for folks around that well i have a lot of messages for them around that but the main one is that they don't have to do it just like you said and in fact all they have to do is start walking around the block and the benefits the fat burning benefits that they'll get from that are are huge but also that the food is more important and so they need to look at the big picture of course they need to look at stress also but the food is such a such a key factor in all of this and going back to the the question you asked me what is maf maximum aerobic function how can we maximize our aerobic system well two of the components of lifestyle are food and exercise and sure stress stress is a very important factor and yeah you can't smoke cigarettes and drink too much alcohol but food and exercise are keys and it's really really simple just don't eat junk food and take it easy out there well phil on that note i think we've given folks a lot to think about today and i want to uh i want to thank you for your time you're going to be ready for dinner soon which it sounds like you skip anyway right yeah i'm i'm i'm here when
