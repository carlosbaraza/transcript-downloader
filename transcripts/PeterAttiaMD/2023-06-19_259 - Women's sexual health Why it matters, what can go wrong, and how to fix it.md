Sharon Parish is a prominent sexual medicine specialist who has been practicing for 30 years. In this episode, Sharon tackles the topic of women's sexual health, including the conditions associated with decreased sexual function and desire and available treatment options. She explores the influence of sexual health on overall well-being while also examining the potential effects of childbirth, birth control, metabolic health, and more on sexual function and desire. Through case studies, Sharon teases apart the differences between desire and arousal, explains the various factors that affect them, and walks through hypothetical treatment plans for the case study patients. In addition, she delves into the subject of menopause, addressing its impact on sexual health as well as the misguided fears around hormone replacement therapy. Stay tuned for next week's launch of our complementary podcast on men's sexual health.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast:

**1. Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Sharon Malone discussing women's sexual health, focusing on three main areas: sexual desire/arousal disorders, orgasmic dysfunction, and vaginal/genital discomfort. The discussion covers treatment options, hormonal influences, and the impact of aging on female sexual health. The conversation emphasizes how underrecognized and undertreated women's sexual health issues are, despite available solutions.

**2. Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Testosterone is the most abundant sex hormone in women's bodies, more than estrogen [1:21:33]
- About 10% of women on hormonal contraception experience vestibular pain [1:08:22]
- SHBG increases with oral contraceptive use, potentially affecting free testosterone levels [1:07:12]
- Hot flashes can be reduced by 75-80% with hormone therapy [1:50:29]

**3. Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal recommendations:
- Regular sexual activity helps maintain tissue health [2:59:40]
- Avoid scented or chemical-heavy lubricants [3:03:17]
- Consider lifestyle factors like exercise and sleep quality [2:43:44]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Vaginal moisturizers for regular maintenance [2:59:40]
- Lubricants for sexual activity [2:57:38]
- Consider vibrator use for enhanced stimulation [3:00:05]

**4. Supplements & Medications**:

Medications discussed:
- Addyi (flibanserin) for premenopausal women [2:18:03]
- Vyleesi (bremelanotide) for premenopausal women [2:23:06]
- Various hormone therapy options [2:50:40]

**5. Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Total testosterone measurement preferred over free testosterone [1:43:55]
- LCMS testing recommended for hormone level accuracy [1:44:46]
- FSH levels over 35 indicate postmenopausal state [0:18:49]

**6. Notable Quotes**:
"Evolution didn't care about women's sexual function post-childbearing years" [0:39:12]

"We think of testosterone as the man's hormone, estrogen as the women's hormone - not entirely correct" [1:21:33]

**7. Follow-up Questions**:
1. What is the optimal timing for starting hormone therapy relative to menopause onset?
2. How do different delivery methods of hormone therapy compare in efficacy?
3. What is the relationship between metabolic health and sexual function in women?

[00:00:00] how important is sexual health for overall well-being usually it's way underestimated how distressing or um impairing it is to quality of life we we we don't do a great job of understanding this and it's it's part of it is legitimizing this right and that's what we're doing here today is like really legitimizing like this is a real thing for you it infects your quality of life it's okay to tell me right and it's okay to want this to be different and when women are given that permission either because they're being interviewed in a study or somewhere in a doctor's office or they they embrace it because it is something that they're feeling they're feeling impaired quality of life hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music]

[00:00:49] AA hey Sharon thank you so much for uh for making time to to meet with me today uh this is a topic that is you know incredibly applicable to more than half population because while we're going to be talking about sexual function in women of course women have partners and so by extension I would argue this is a topic that is applicable to our entire listing population it's also a topic um where you know there seems to be a lot of misunderstanding um a lot of asymmetry in attention we're going to talk about a bunch of those things as we get going uh before we do though I just kind of want to give people a sense of your background and how you arrived where you did so you you went to Medical

[00:01:30] School you did your residency in Internal Medicine and Primary Care correct that is right I was in in a a in Primary Care meaning with a focus on ambulatory medicine and being sort of a a general medical physician in with a focus on primary care and academic general medicine and so at at what point during that uh process did you realized that your your interest uh was in sexual health when I was in med school really

[00:02:00] I was always struggling it it seems like a little bit of a strange Union but always struggling between deciding whether I wanted to be a general internist a psychiatrist or a gynecologist um and you know this interface uh particularly although I do as an internist I do take care of men's Sexual Health as well this interface between Women's Health the mind and the body behavioral issues and comprehensive or for lack of a better word holistic care for all sort of was always tugging me in three different directions and and somehow when I eventually found my way to sexual medicine it just kind of brought it all together um I I um was did some projects on women's health and then in residency also on various women's health issues and reproductive issues um I worked for example in um a contraception Clinic an adolescent medicine program SD program so I you know I did a lot of work in that area dur I did a fellowship afterwards at NYU

[00:02:59] Belleview in psychosocial and Behavioral Medicine in the general medical field um and I worked with um then some sexual medicine experts in some projects and that's when I really uh moved more deliberately toward the field and so how does how does the field stand today um how many Physicians are there in the

[00:03:18] United States if you had to estimate um that have your degree of training and clinical Focus well I think that um the this field of men's sexual health is a little more clearly defined like there's many um psychiatrists uh urologists and even Men's Health internists who who have like a clear distinction I think women's sexual health is less clear but um again gynecologists some internists Family

[00:03:46] Medicine Physicians a few psychiatrists and then there's psychological therapists um it goes across disciplines it's a little hard to Define but I can say that there's many fewer who clearly identify um I went to the international Society for the study of women Sexual Health annual meeting a couple weeks ago and there were 600 attendees um 5 to 600 and that probably represents most people who work in the field okay um you know there there's sexual The Sex Therapy meetings and pelvic floor Physical

[00:04:14] Therapy meetings that have others but if you're looking at the field of sexual medicine it's it's not robust right and if you go to the AA I think everybody there 20,000 people think they could probably handle a m problem so if that gives you a point of comparison right yeah yeah that that that that's sort of in line with what what my expectations were um let's also just maybe by way of background sort of um perhaps start with what what is encompassed in this field right so you've already kind of alluded to it a little bit um there's clearly a um supratentorial component to this there's also an anatomic component to this or physiologic component to this um how how does it make sense to to maybe walk me and the the listeners through the the background knowledge of this physiology Anatomy uh so that we can better kind of go into what some of the problems are and what some of the treatments are so with any um issue where you're looking at the mind the body genital you know a genital response a hormonal response you know the integration I always take people back to the concept of the bioc psychosocial model right and you're I I guess you're asking when it comes to sexual response what are what are the bio what is the psycho and what is the social and what's the contextual um so for maybe just for sexual health problems the brain is a really active organ as I'm sure you can imagine we have um thinking and feeling and that probably on a biological or or neurophysiological Level Trans translates into neurotransmitters and the interaction with hormones and

[00:05:56] Pathways brain brain neural Pathways neural networks and there's the psychological concepts of conditioning and learning and unlearning um you know and reward and and disappointment Etc all plays a role and it's fascinating how that might all interact um there's the General Medical State our vascular system nervous system and like systemic medical issues that might impact those and there's hormones and they get stimulated by the master glands in the brain um our our genital making you know our genital that make sex steroids um and our adrenal glands and thyroid so there's a collection of hormonal Locus locuses that play a role potentially in sexual health and then there's the local genital milu or and that might include um the vascular system the nervous system small nerves the mucosa the surface and then there are muscles and soft tissue so all in the genital tract so the I think and then there's a bladder in the rectum um and uh the breast um which play a role in stimulation so that I think that that's the big big picture how does this all come together um in a three-dimensional concept where you integrate um experience um relational issues culture and time um is really the fascinating part of this field so how do these things change um during a woman's life I mean obviously puberty is a very important Milestone but I suspect also menopause is an equally important transition um that is much more abrupt at least from an endocrine standpoint than uh men would experience at the same age yes so I think there are times when hormones like sort of play a more more

[00:07:44] Master role in sexuality and sexual response you know what's tricky about this is and and I guess the body's kind of programmed and smart is that there's a lot of life cycle and life stage things happening and those are prime times as well whether One commands the other or not it's hard to know but um menopause is kind of a longer process than people think right it's there's per menopause there's menopause there's postmenopause and there's a lot of life cycle stuff going on um you know that's probably um the most defining moment for women in that it interfaces with no longer being able to reproduce there are are significant changes in hormone levels like estrogen that affect vaginal

[00:08:22] Lev vaginal comfort and at the same time andren decline that affects desire um and when you're starting up with puberty that's probably all roaring up and getting going um and you're also developing the the cognitive skills of relational issues and and sexual sexual relationships so those are two peak times um I I have worked with adolescence I have more experience with it myth midli women that's the focus in my often in my practice and those are the people that of of this is a good point time to mention this point um the data suggests and my experience with this field suggests that the time when women are most interested in looking into it is in those per menopausal late reproductive per menopausal and early post-menopausal years when you say looking into it do you mean looking for themselves yeah or so it might be that they have a problem it might be they want to understand it better it might be they want to be proactive and preserve their sexuality um it usually is that something's changing and they weren't expecting it and and W and want to know why or they want it to be better um people have a little trouble sorting out like is it the relationship at this point is it the menopausal changes overall is it the sexual function or is it sort of all of it and I think that's what makes the midlife um sexual medicine challenges the most um complex and challenging but also the most interesting and the most rewarding um I think there's um also the most um likelihood where women are women midlife women are youthful they're young they're active they're connected they're not like you know some other time in our in our universe where they're becoming the wise sitting in the tent you know retiring from childbearing and everything else I mean often women are peing in their career um if they're having you know these Trends vary a little bit children later you know they've got College teenage children

[00:10:12] College children aging parents big careers bodies Changing Partners wanting you know and wanting partners and there's a lot going on um so they're the most likely to seek attention actually yeah um and we we can say a lot about helping them today I also would like to talk a little bit about how the anatomy changes post childbirth and does that have anything to do with um sexual function um and I and I guess I want to kind of also at some point soon Define some of the problems right so I can think of like I can think of three off the top of my head right one would be uh low sexual desire or hypoactive sexual desire one would be uh inability to have an orgasm and a third would be discomfort or pain clearly a big problem for women postmenopause due to vaginal atrophy so those are three things I think we must address today do you think there are others that are important enough that to a non-expert audience we should also uh present well I think um I never want the Forgotten um we'll call her sister the Forgotten sister um to desire is arousal and having women understand that you know when they come to me they're like I I no longer get turned on and I mean so so is it about wanting is it about mental or subjective or cognitive excitement is it that bridge between desire mean thinking and actually being in a moment and being excited or is it their genitals are no longer responding and then that sometimes is is uniquely t or can be tied to orgas difficulties got it and I think it's really um in the field it's an area of you know discussion and sometimes even controversy but um I think for women it's hard to separate um what they're asking for like it you know

[00:11:59] Sometimes women come to me and they say like I no longer want sex but everything works okay sometimes they say like I love this person or I want to have sex with myself it's that's not the problem but nothing's turning on like I'm not feeling anything and learning about that for one's body and being able to articulate that and it that can be often

[00:12:17] I think it gets commonly tied to orgasmic changes um and we could certainly discuss whether they the same process or different um you know child birth I I don't know if you want to talk about that now it is let's talk about it just because I think we we we've already established that these there are these two enormous hormone swings right there's the swing on which is you know reasonably quick and then there's the swing off which is relatively abrupt but as you point out it's occurring over years not months right um it's also worth mentioning uh that that it's the estrogen and progesterone that are coming off really quickly the testosterone is kind of coming off not as quickly we can maybe come back to that in moment um so yeah let's just let's let's talk about anatomy in in a minute because I I'm guessing that women have very different experiences with childbirth and presumably a vaginal delivery is different from a C-section in terms of the impact it has on the pelvic floor by the way that's something we should Define for people so they understand the anatomy of the pelvic floor um but anyway yes let's let's talk a little bit about how that might impact any of the elements of of sexual health in a woman's life yes so you know it's not the time typically where the sexual problems that people come to me for I'm also not a gynecologist um kick in and stay they tend to be for some women relatively transient um postpartum but it also depends on like how many kids and what age and all that but but so so let maybe go let's talk about the pelvic floor for a moment because that's where that might impact with child birth so um the pelvic is kind of mysterious concept but it um if

[00:14:01] I had to give it one concept it's the idea that it's a basket of muscles M and they attach from various parts of the inner pelvis so like you know onto the pupus Ramis onto the isal spine onto the bones in the you know in the around our pelvis um in internally and into the walls and then also on into the organs and they create a a basket around the uterus or around the urethra like for example there's a sling around the urethra in the anus that holds it up and also holds up the uterus and they also provide um motion during child birth they allow for the child birth process they're quite active during sexual activity they contract and release um they help us with urination with defecation um so and so forth and you know it would be easier if we had like the opportunity to show people a diagram but I think the best way includ will include diagram in the show notes so so that would be wonderful the best way to understand is it's a basket of muscles that hold things up and help things move and when they're not working properly they can result in for example difficulty with urination or incontinence or sometimes pain during sexual activity or changes in orgasmic function um that's sort of the the broadest concept we can get into the nitty-gritty of disorders but during during child I guess you were asking about child so with pregnancy those muscles stretch a lot things are expanding and um sometimes women will notice improvements actually in their sexual function because if they've had tight pelvic floor muscles that are causing changes in sexual response or even pain it sometimes gets better um sometimes with deliveries they get stretched they get irritated they get torn it's rare um that any of those things I find persist unless there was really a birth trauma um that that often gets confused with what happens with other things during child birth for example otomies lacerations SU ing where there can be scarring there can be um you know inflammation around a suture line there can be Etc so I I think the general process of muscle stretching during child birth is one thing um during pregnancy it's different and any other related injuries or trauma during the actual birthing process of a vaginal delivery is another and um the only other thing about C-section versus vaginal delivery you know this could be a whole another topic but in general vaginal deliveries are better for women right um so I yeah say more about that again I'm I'm very ignorant I think people have this idea that they're going to preserve the size of their vaginal

[00:16:41] Canal or prevent their pelvic form muscles from stretching Etc and the truth is that most of that goes back you know it's not all that unusual for women to just have like a transient difficulty for four to six weeks and things improve but um having a a having surgery an abdominal surgery you know you're opening your abdominal wall there are muscles there scarring you know I it it sometimes leads to other kinds of later difficulties that people don't anticipate and it's also safer for the mother and the baby not to have surgery right um but again I what is the what is the uh what is the um for lack of a better word incidence of uh C-section versus vaginal birth today in the United

[00:17:20] States do you know I don't know that number um but I know that uh I we could easily find it I don't have it off hand I'm not I'm not an attrition don't deliver babies but um the the biggest concern you know that I hear in sexual medicine discussions is that people have this idea that it's better for their sexual health not to deliver babies vaginally maybe that's the most important message and that the number of

[00:17:41] C-sections you know has been going up and is alarming and that routine scheduled C-sections to preserve Sexual Health you know for a whole number of reasons isn't really better for women and that that that might be a myth um that I'm it'd be good to I'm not an expert in child birth or in delivery I'm not an obstetrician or gynecologist but um if someone asks my opinion I say like have your baby vaginally and most people preserve their sexual function that's not a a peak time um the bigger problem actually is is postpartum that that come that comes up in my practice you know people are breastfeeding they're essentially like postmenopausal women and they may experience um because their hormones are dipping way down they're not they're still keeping ovulation off by breastfeeding and they're experiencing vaginal dryness irritation sometimes changes in sex drive and they're not aware of the effects of of breastfeeding on sexual function andal vinal changes and sexual response and there's easy things to do for that just like you know especially the the the Volver and vaginal symptoms um what can you give me a sense of How

[00:18:49] High the FSH and LH are during um breastfeeding you you're asking are they organically comparable to a postmenopausal woman I guess question is estrad sufficiently low as well like yeah I'm trying to understand how low estrad is how high FSH is um I think there's so much variability because so so it depends on you know like if you're completely breastfeeding and ovulatory women can look postmenopausal you know and that's defined as over an FSH over 35 most women aren't fully an ovulatory they're having irregular Cycles they're ovulating intermittently they're so so I think the numbers are all over the board interesting but you can have estres as low was like 20 or 30 right which is yeah might as well be in menop postpartum yeah um but it again um and everybody's like HPI access and sensitivity to to lactation is a little bit different um and sometimes women aren't breastfeeding completely right so the and the correlation with how much milk they're making and whether they're ovulating isn't clearcut either um but I think what I what I do what I do I would say is if you're breastfeeding and you're not having Menses for 6 months the likelihood that you're you're hormonally similar to a postmenopausal woman is higher and that you're completely in ovulatory and that if you're having dryness and difficulty and pain and low sexual function that you should talk to your doctor because there things that we would do some of the same things that we'll probably get into in a little while yeah yeah we're we're gonna talk about that because I guess you could make the case that if there's one thing we want listeners to take away from this program it's that there's really no reason for any woman of any age to be struggling with vaginal dryness regardless of how far she is into menopause or whatever these are this is we have the technology to solve that problem all day long right so there's there's a number of approaches and that is the most treatable or the most manageable amongst these conditions and the the the algorithm or the the options for that are the most clear-cut yeah um I it's amazing to me so so I'm a general internist by like sort of by heart you know I'm a card carrying

[00:20:58] General internist although I've gotten quite specialized in my work um and so some of the my colleagues say to me well you know um you're not you know you're not doing procedures you're not a gynecologist you know what's the big deal you just come me hand them a lubricant a moisturizer maybe some vaginal hormones you know what's the complexity of the of the concept or the or the consult and what it comes down to is women really really don't understand the whole thing like the difference what's happening in their body the between the the things that we can offer them and how to put them together and use them and then how to integrate that into their sex life and that's what I I

[00:21:36] I would say like the number one concept that I get or referral that I get is to help a woman walk through that um so one other thing I want to talk about before we leave the sort of Basics and the foundational stuff is the role of uh metabolic Health SL systemic vascular health so again in men this is really clear um right so for example uh you know higher incidence of ascvd higher incidence of Ed right similar concept to you know endothelial damage uh higher incidence of type 2 diabetes microvascular disease higher incidence of erectile dysfunction how clear is that relationship in women in other words do the things that drive glycosilation of proteins and microvascular disease uh in other parts of to the body do they contribute to uh Sexual Health in women as they do in men through the

[00:22:33] Ed pathway so I'm glad you brought this up because this is really an emerging uh discussion in the field um so for those that that are not aware in men there's like kind of a really clear literature and guidance that if a man is having Ed it may be a mirror to small vessel cardiovascular C vascular disease and we can use surrogate markers like looking at Doppler studies of you know in the in the urologist office of penile and genital blood flow and then send them for a coronary calcium score even a coronary CT right and look and see if we can see those correlations and there's good evidence supporting that they mirror one another and so if a man has erectile dysfunction and sexual dysfunction Associated they should have a cardiovascular assessment that's sort of the emerging those are discussions when if they have and just just so folks know a Doppler study is a study that uses waves to look at blood flow through blood vessel and it's very helpful when you're looking through these sort of smaller blood vessels that you wouldn't otherwise be able to get a good look into so but and so you know I I was I think before we got started I was telling you I was just had a two-day meeting where this was the the depth of the discussion you know where are we with understanding the presentation of erectile dysfunction as a market for cardiovascular disease and if someone has cardiovascular disease what kind of recommendations should we make about asking men about sexual function and then what do you do about it do Vaso dilators to medications that pd5

[00:24:00] Inhibitors that dilate the small vessels work and um my participation in in this particular conference was was about the discussion of do we have similar measures in women right um so first of all if someone comes to me and says like I have no genital sensation does that mean that she has vascular disease right um um I mean there's also nerves there but you know it's it's it's really not as clear-cut like a man comes in and says you know I don't have an erection right woman's like I don't feel you know

[00:24:28] I can't be sure that exactly what it is but um there's been some research looking at using something called clitoral cuddler Doppler ultrasound or CDU with assess with assessment of like the blood flow which is called the pulsatile index um looking at resistance to blood flow as an objective measure of how to assess arousal in women so right now it's just at the level of the lab or research it's not really being used clinically except in a very few selected practices who also researched this so like if someone comes in and says I don't feel can I put a

[00:25:21] her sexual function and also as a mirror for her systemic blood vascular risk again we don't we're we're starting to study that but we don't have clear information this there's this concept called the the female genital vascular District um and does that whole area the larger vessels and the small vessels does that give us a correlate or a window and you know can we use that again as as markers for small vessel disease and then vice versa like if someone says to me you know I have a patient with metabolic syndrome and a high A1C um you know obesity diabetes um hyper lipidemia Etc should is that a high-risk patient that I should be really counseling and talking to about sexual medicine and then using that as a reason managing those issues to PR preserve sexual health and I think we need to Define first of all what is the role of cliteral Doppler testing there's no research on carnid calcium scores or carne Cs on women and they're correlate with sexual function and can we use these both as mirrors of sexual function and predictors of other issues other vascular issues for women and I I feel like this is the most important growing field that it needs to catch up um you know that we can't just look at like oh she's complaining she's postmenopausal I think I'll hand her a lubricant and because she's not feeling things that's very crude compared to what we have available for understanding men at this point okay so that's a long discussion because it's an area of great

[00:26:48] Fascination but um we we practically speaking you know we we don't have a lot to to offer women in the office yet but we need to right but it's sounds like we're moving in the same direction that we kind of have a clear sense of what's going on with men which is and by the way I this is something I do see in my practice quite quite often which is you have a guy that shows up with a hemoglobin A1c of you know 5.9 so he doesn't have type 2 diabetes but he clearly has too much blood glucose and dyslipidemia a year later when you've got all those biomarkers improved he also notices he doesn't need his Calis anymore I mean that's that's a very obvious clear repeatable common story so it it's it I don't think it's a huge stretch to assume that women could experience the same thing so I I I like to when I talk about this with my patients and my colleagues I like to say there's the motivator and there's the mirror right so and and I think this makes sense when you're talking about that's obvious when you're talking about a man right like you know they like with these parameters and then you say how you know so tell me about your sexual function you know how how's it going any difficulty with erections they report it and you say well you know that they can sometimes go hand in hand or you know and that's a good motivation overall for many men right they want to improve everything and that might be sometimes even the biggest motivation you know because that's that's important to them so that's a reason to lose weight right and I think we need to have the same you know way to think about women um you know and I think the other thing for all people is that um we don't do enough to teach that prevention and lifestyle and disease management is important for sexual health and validate how important that is for quality of life right like there's all these reasons you don't want to have heart disease you know we should be saying you don't want to have sexual dysfunction right and and there's not enough education when people before they have issues how how clear is that Sharon

[00:28:48] I'm sure again empirically it just makes sense but what can we say about sexual health and General Health um well and by the way I sort of phrase my question a little bit better um what I mean by that is overall well-being as a function of sexual health I I we've already established the causality in the other direction meaning when your metabolic health is poor and your vascular health is poor it can impact Sexual Health but um what I'm saying is even independent of that if a person is otherwise healthy physically but still having sexual dysfunction how does that translate into the rest of their life well so I think there's a couple ways to look at this one thing is um the most of the research I guess we're talking about women today yes um most of the research is Association research right so it's a sometimes a little hard to tell I think you understand the difference between really risk factor and cause and effect you know so we know which lifestyle and health factors seem to be associated with better better sexual function better satisfaction better sexual activity right um and most of the research is actually in desire when it comes to that like we know that like for example I'll give you a few examples in women there's interesting research that um being resilient having a positive attitude um for for women especially as they get older having a partner right um being connected socially having support normal BMI the funny one is Mediterranean diet actually it probably has to do with overall health and well-being and the other benefits all those things are associated with good sexual function right and whether people who do those things preserve their sexual function or those things preserve sexual function is still it's Association yeah right I sort of think it doesn't matter you know you want to they're both are good right um where it matters as a motivator is that um validating the the importance of sexual function to quality of life you know is is critical for people feeling that they have permission like that's that's a good reason for me right because sometimes it's like an afterthought like oh okay like okay it's okay I could prevent heart disease but do I have to preserve my sexual function that's a little indulgent right why should I go to the gym just to have better sexual function my and my kidss need me to help them with their homework you know and but if it's like okay I can't have heart disease I have to go to the gym you know so so I think part of it is validating that for people that probably their strong Association and then Vice on the other hand we know what the Heavy Hitters are in terms of overall sexual function and biological medical conditions and psychiatric disorders right um I'm not sure if this is exactly what you asked me but it's a point that I think is important to make and you we could go back and clarify if you wanted to hear anything different um so the Heavy Hitters we could talk about categories right there's what we've already been talking about there is associative data that metabolic syndrome in women obesity particularly interestingly hyper triglyceridemia which probably makes sense to you right um and then coronary artery disease and diabetes but what's interesting about the last two is that the the condition itself isn't as clearly correlated as the psychological um ad adaptation or relationship to the dis da is for women so for example if someone had a heart attack or has heart disease and they're female it's more about how they see themselves and their interest or enthusiasm in becoming re-engaged with activity then clearly the severity of card cardiac disease and that might just be we don't have good research or it might be different in women and same thing is to with diabetes like in man it's clear like the higher aan see the more sexual dysfunction Nur neurovascular disease Etc but in women it's more about the impact of diabetes that so far in the research do they are they depressed because they have diabetes is it impacting like they don't like wearing the monitor so they're embarrassed to have sex or like you know things like that or their their feet are numb and it turn just makes them negative rather than their their blood sugar control but I think that part of the problem is we don't have as good research um but so and then there's the whole bucket of genital urinary symptoms menopausal symptoms and cancer we haven't even talked about cancer yet breast cancer gynecologic cancer cervical and Union cancer or Varian cancer so those are the categories all those things I just mentioned that are associated with lower sexual function and sexual problems in women and then there's the whole bucket of depression anxiety and their treatments right that also and clearly interacts with sexual function in women and can be problematic and I'm kind of curious about both of those in in both directions so for example like if if you take two women who are identical in all ways but one of them is sexually active and sexually healthy and the other one is having sexual dysfunction for whatever reason and let's assume it's not a physiologic reason so let's assume it is a super tentorial reason and as a result of that she's just not sexually active do we have a sense of their quality of life their their their well-being as a result of that in other words what I'm really trying to understand is how important is sexual health for overall well-being and in particular in this case for women there's a kind of a collection of different buckets of research looking at this probably the strongest and most consistent research comes out of the desire literature and looking at the impact of hypoactive sexual desire disorder which is more like a diagnosable condition or distressing low desire on overall quality of life and there's um I I could quote you studies but there's a number of um well done both survey studies which are like in the community and population studies and clinical data studies collected in clinical settings suggesting that there's a strong correlation with impaired desire and overall quality of life right um the the problem I think with this research is you know the the dichotomy or distinction you're making that it's purely super tentorial or psychological relational lifestyle is is sometimes so hard to tease out right right because there of like no one person has like zero biology impacting sexual function but I will say something that does support that point of view um what practically speaking you look at the if you're a clinician let's say or someone comes to you you look at the biology you look at the psychological factors maybe it's sometimes even past sexual function or sexual trauma or religious upbringing or how they were you know they they saw themselves as a sexual being from the time they were young you know I might I as even as a as a clinician a physician I ask those questions um then you look at um the relationship you know and how that is or the culture and then you look at the things that you think are contributing and those that are amenable to intervention and you do get to the idea sometimes that it is the psychology right you can reach that but you want to be careful not to assume that you youve thought about everything in their their biology until you have right but but that said um I you were asking me the condition of someone who was like a psychological sexual dysfunction and um how what is the level of distress like when people identify it and they want it to be different it's extremely distressing and quite impairing to quality of life and it can be a mirror for very distressing feelings um there are studies that look at the level of distress and the qualities and they show things like if for example loss of sexual desire despairing hopeless feel old feel ugly don't feel connected um feel sad feel hurt feel you know there's a whole collection of emotions associated with it and typically in this research um they're all look at discrepancy there's been some and when they look at the discrepancy between for example a clinician P perspective or perception and the patients when they're asked by like someone else like an independent reviewer usually it's way underestimated how distressing or um impairing it is to quality of life we we we don't do a great job of understanding this and it's it's part of it is legitimizing this right and that's what we're doing here today is like really legitimizing like this is a real thing for you you affects your quality of life it's okay to tell me right and it's okay to want this to be different and when women are given that permission either because they're in being interviewed in a study or somewhere in a doctor's office or they they embrace it because it is something that they're feeling they're feeling impaired quality of life

[00:37:14] I think that's what you're sort of getting at yeah and uh this is worth like emphasizing you know giving this audience permission to understand that you can seek um Assistance or understanding or even treatment for these these things for different sexual dysfunctions we could get into defining them a little more specifically you know soon um and um that's good right it's it's not something you should put as like an afterthought in your life right because um first of all it it's good for quality of life it's good for your relationship and it and there's also some I I don't know if you quite asked me this but there is some research supporting the idea that it improves overall health right um again that's not that's not a stretch right I mean whether or not that turns out to be true we would only know with more rigorous study but there's plausibility to that based on other things that we understand about the relationship between hypercortisolemia HPA dysfunction stress uh you know all sorts of things that we know do directly impact physical health um so you know my way of thinking about these things is they may or may not impact the length of your life but the quality of your life is at least as important if not more important and it's very hard to argue it doesn't impact the quality of life especially if as you say it is being perceived that way um so I'm going to preface my next question with an assertion which is just because

[00:38:43] Evolution didn't care about something doesn't mean we shouldn't and the example I would use is atherosclerosis so Evolution had no interest in preventing atherosclerosis if it did it would have got rid of a o hundreds of thousands of years ago because we didn't need it really after I mean we would have got rid of it in the last thousand years I think um and we wouldn't have atherosclerosis today but given that it didn't interfere with our reproductive

[00:39:12] Fitness it's of no concern to Darwin that said now that we can live longer we have every reason to care about it and we've taken great pains to reduce our risk of dying from it okay so put that aside for a moment as I ask a very naive potentially question um but one that I've often thought about which is do women have it harder when it comes to sexual health because Evolution didn't necessarily care about their sexual function post childbearing years whereas in theory Evolution might care if men could reproduce through the length of their life yeah I mean Absol you know absolutely absolutely um this is a really important topic and area for discussion um so so let me um start with a point that I make often I mean women who are per menopausal menopausal and postmenopausal aren't sick right Y and so sometimes people talk about it and when you have postmenopausal vvo vaginal atrophy but like that's a horrible term talk about evolutionary terms that make people feel bad um right right it needs a whole PR firm to come in and just come up with better terminology here as an aside I think you you may have you've heard this terminology is that um the North American manopause society and international Society for the study of women's sexual health about I guess it's almost a decade ago at this point we and

[00:40:39] I was involved with this process we got together and had a whole panel on what to do about this name Volvo vaginal atrophy for a whole variety of reasons and it concluded that it's it is what happens you know things atrophy um but um that that's not like what we we want women to think about so we came up with the terminology genital urinary syndrome of menopause right so um vul vinery can lead to genital urinary symptoms after during and after menopause and the syndrome of menopause so it it took away the disease State it's not really a illness right and it's it's a syndrome which could be thought about in many other ways I mean happiness is a syndrome right and so we were really trying to neutralize it I don't know how well it's stuck but um it does speak to this idea first of all a few Concepts one is you know when people talk about symptoms or treatments are we talking about a disease right I guess when we're talking about atherosclerosis and aging we're talking about a disease so on the one hand you could put them as parallels right there's hormonal changes the the ovary stops making things the brain does other things to the sex steroid hormones testosterone declines in both ovarian adrenal production Etc and we have physiologic changes which lead to aging lead to decreased sexual function and even complete like loss of good sexual function pain um doesn't allow women to you know engage in qu quality of life improving sexual activities relationship building activities um so Evolution has not been kind to women in a whole collection of ways I think that's what you're asking me and although women aren't sick our position in the field and certainly mine is that we have the skills the tools and the sophistication to manage it and to reverse it and to have a very different outcome than

[00:42:25] Evolution would Command right so I I mean I'm I'm I'll speak you know not too personally but I'm a midlife woman I'm not ready to turn in the towel and I can tell you that most of my colleagues and friends and family members you know have the same attitude and so you know the the challenge in the area is first of all not medicalizing this too much right and making someone feel sick or give them things that make them sicker and to balance that for lack of a better word lethality therapy Balan to the point where you're optimizing without giving people other problems right like you give a hormone you don't want to give breast cancer or endometrial cancer right or you give astrena cardiac disease and so that's the work that we do in this field is learning how to Fe how to trick Mother Nature or Evolution safely but optimize all these things sexual function quality of life longevity even right so we could get into the discussion about whether hormone therapy improves longevity I know I know that's an area of interest of yours yeah yeah right okay so now I think this has been an excellent foundation for us to now go through some of these various things so so let's start with sexual dysfunction um and I'll leave it to you which one you want to start with so again I was do you want to talk about arousal uh and desire separately and and kind of walk through that sometimes I find this helpful Sharon with other podcast guests where we do actual case studies so um I I can make some up but you can feel free to adjust them and say okay so um a 35-year-old mother of two married comes into your office and says I love my partner um I just don't want to have sex like I'm just not in the mood and um like so so tell me what's your workup how do you that that's that's basically all she says on presentation let's just pretend that the kids are old enough now that she's not like sleep deprived waking up every 10 minutes so her kids are you know 10 and 12 or something like that and um let's make her 39 if her kids are 10 and okay okay perfect so she's 39 her kids are 10 and 12 or 41 may be starting to change yeah yeah perfect so the point is I have reasons for that yeah yeah she's Prem menopausal is the point I'm really just trying to get at yeah um okay and that's and that's it so so this she doesn't have tiny kids waking her up that's right yeah so she's out of the the the the difficulties of child rearing okay so so okay so what do we want well how do you want to work her up and how so let me let me just give you the categories and tell you how we would think about her right um so I don't know who who have you have seen Masters of Sex right so the the whole concept or how to organize um sexual dysfunction was based on the work really first of Masters and Johnson right that there was a response cycle that had an order right and they their work primarily F they looked at both men and women they were actually really quite Progressive um and the idea was that people started with getting aroused right and I think in their concept it was all physiologic because they mostly just looked at physiological parameters

[00:45:38] Al they understood the the psychology of things to some extent that there was this idea that people get physically and mentally excited they reach some sort of escalation and maybe even a peak or a plateau and that can be variable you know and there's some models that for women there's more variability in plos and and then it the classic response cycle is it results in an orgasm climax

[00:46:03] Peak lots of different words get used but we're just going to use the word orgasm keep it simple and that there's different patterns for that too right like so can I ask a question before that that goes before that so um what comes first desire or arousal is desire desire comes first does it or do you have to have some arousal to then trigger desire

[00:46:23] I'm going to talk about desire in a moment because that's an interesting question question so but in their model they kept it simple you you engaged in Sex and you got aroused and and so maybe they thought like the interest in having sex was about being turned on or being aroused they didn't really get distinguished about it right and then you have an orgasm and for women like there's different patterns it could be happened different ways with cliteral stimulation vaginal stimulation Etc um and sometimes multiple orgasms which was is more characteristic for the variability in women and then there's this idea of the like refractory or resolution pH and that's kind of for like many decades since they're work in the late 50s early 60s that's how people have organized their thinking um a few people came along notably Helen singer

[00:47:08] Kaplan in the 70s and she happened to be a a psychologist at Cornell and has like a whole discipline and following some of which are my colleagues still there are a few around and added this idea of wanting or desire and felt that it was really distinct like thinking about it anticipating willingness to engage and that if you didn't separate it you were missing something about what could be a problem for someone like so that 35-year-old or that 39y old we're talking about I think she's 41 now but yeah no we made her because her kids were 10 I I wasn't letting her have kids at 25 but good point her kids if you said they were 10 and 12 I made I I was just trying to be realistic um the other thing is I I feel like it it comes up in that like the if it's not late reproductive postmenopausal it's like 38 to 41 I don't know why but I hear that a lot those there's sort of time frames that come up I we can talk about why that one is but that's why I picked it um but she might say to me like you know

[00:48:05] I'm exhausted I have these kids I have this job but I um agree and I'm I'm like and I'm always kind of like still even to this day surprised to hear but you know I said you get turned on well yeah I mean I feel feels fine do you have an argasm oh yeah yeah and is that satisfying yeah but I don't want sex you know so they you get rid of the idea that desire is separate you miss that right right yep um and I think you know there's a lot of variation on that we could talk about a different patient where they say like theoretically I really want to be with this person but I know that like things aren't going to work I'm not going to feel anything I'm not going to get wet I'm gonna have pain so that like then I I avoid right and then I don't want because of that reason like there's variations on that so it's really helpful to keep these Concepts separate right yes um there's some work coming out I don't know if you want to get into this it's it's come out over the last decade actually in some sort of lay press books that are smushing them together saying that they're indistinguishable for women but I feel they shouldn't be I feel they need to be separated and that's based on a first of all vast clinical experience that the you need to walk people through this to understand the problem by separating them secondly that the the the available treatments Target different things and the physiologic plausibility for separation is strong wrong in terms of risk factor and response to treatment intervention and the opportunity for future Direction in improving sexual function if we keep them together we're going to lose that yeah um and to get very granular about this the the the psychiatric compendiums has now combined them Desiring arousal as one one thing called female sexual interest in arousal disorder whereas the sexual medicine societies have put out um strong position statements as well as nomenclature papers suggesting that we have have to have these categories be separate and the upcoming ICD or the international classification of diseases is going to maintain separate separate coding for desire and arousal for both you're saying that the DSM combines them the DSM 5 which came out um now it's almost 10 years ago interestingly they just put out a revision um which I worked on actually as a medical reviewer um they insisted on keeping it the same they told me that at the onset you can review this but we're not separating them if you look and they wanted me to look at sort of the medical piece of this um they again it's based on the idea and I think this is fair for the kinds of people that show up in psychological and psychiatric offices that for women it often is interchangeable right like it can be and it is still separate for men um and I'll give you an example there's this the work I do you want to digress for this for a moment because it's interesting I think it it resonates for people and then we'll come back to what we would how we would evaluate your your 39y old

[00:50:51] I think we or 41 whatever she is now um so Rosemary bassan is is um the sort of the mother of this model and there have been others that have written about this in like primarily the professional literature but there's some books out right now some lay press books about this and the idea is that instead of this linear response cycle that a better model for many women or for some women is something more circular it's called the circular incentive model and it's the idea that what drives sexual response isn't linear women go I want to have desire I want I want sex I'm going to go find my partner I'm going to initiate or I'm going to receive and it's and then I'm going to be turned on and then I'm going to have an orgasm it's going to be great and that when you say that to people lots of people are going to say that like I must be abnormal because I don't feel that way and that their normal is more something like this like they're not particularly feeling spontaneous sexual desire but the circle starts with the motivation and the incentive to be close right to drive toward intimacy they're mostly neutral but because they are close to their partner or even we we should make sure we understand that sex with oneself fits in here too they like want to feel the benefits that come from a sexual encounter with either a partner or oneself and they're receptive or seek the stimuli but not because they're feeling like sex hunger right the classic desire but because of that motivation and if everything's intact psychological and biological influences that arous govern that govern arousability are intact they're going to have all that arousal their brain's going to turn on their body your heart rate's going to go up you know you're going to feel genit your your nipples become arct you're going to feel the genital Sensations and that will trigger engagement or arousal that'll make you feel more invested and then more desire and then more arousal and you that will lead to satisfaction and maybe an orgasm right so that's a chain Chain Reaction there sort of right it's modeled as a circle y but it it's the idea that that satisfaction knowing it's good knowing you're going to feel close you know I I

[00:52:52] I one of my favorite expressions for one of my own long-standing patients is that Afterglow is what motivates it right how you feel together with how she feels connected how you know not just herself good but with the in the relationship and that if you don't normalize that thing where desire and Rous are kind of smoos together when everything works you're going to Mi you're going to make people think there's something wrong with them that they don't have spontaneous sexual desire so um there's a book out there for example Emily NEOS who wrote a book called come as you are and um some of the work of Lori BR these are these are like press books looks at this that you know we want to make it okay that you can be motivated by other reasons but the where where this model gets confusing is that it doesn't normalize low sexual desire where you can't make it work right right so let's go back now let's go back to your example so if she says to me everything works fine but I still even though I have a good experience I still come back to this and I don't want to have sex right then that model doesn't apply to her her and she's not normal and where that model misses is they forget that we have to make sure that people who don't feel reinforcement don't feel motivated to re-engage don't have the the desire the willingness or the interest um don't it isn't normal right um where I do find this idea works the most where people are kind of neutral but they engage to be closest in long-term relationships because they know what what makes the relationship work so this P this person comes to you and I what I'll do is I'll walk her through I'll say you know do you feel sex hunger do you initiate are you receptive no no I avoid it I finally give in because I know he's grouchy or or she or whatever and um but how does everything work does your brain turn on do you get breast Sensations does your body get General arousal do you get genital Sensations do you feel engorged do you get lubricated you know I the degree to which I ask specific questions is variable sometimes I ask more general questions like do your genitals get turned on um and do you Peak do you climb Ed I try to find the language usually I just say do you have an orgasm and there sometimes you know that's a whole another discussion women aren't sure so I try to help them understand what it is they're experiencing and there's um some a lot of variability in the female orgasmic response but women orgasm right um Can can we put a pin in that and come back to that I I I want to

[00:55:18] I want to make sure we cover that but let's continue with this patient and then I always ask this gets forgotten often is you know do they have pain right now a per a this is a premenopausal woman right likelihood she's no longer breastfeeding she's probably ovulating regularly having regular menstrual cycles so I enter weav of the gynecologic history right like what's the menstrual history a 39-year-old could be having an early manopause I make sure that I'm not missing that emerging dryness pain discomfort right you can't always assume you know someone's age you know what's happening so regular Cycles um are they having dryness pain are they um this case she's no longer ovulating are they taking some other medication are they on an anti-press so then I look at factors if there's and then things like medications can affect multiple different phases but so I collect that information for a variety of reasons someone with low desire I would collect medication information someone with arousal difficulty what what are some of the worst offenders there I know that ssris certainly wreak havoc in men do they also do so in women so if you're talking about General sexual dysfunction that can affect a variety of phases anti-depressants but all psychotropics have some that all categories of psychotropics and these days people aren't just on anti-depressants the ssris and snris are probably most well known to cause multiphase dysfunction um there's differences though I mean that's one of the areas that I consult with a lot because I work closely with

[00:56:47] Psychiatry here is that there not all drugs are the same it is a class effect but there are better drugs and some and then there are other categories like for example buoi which is more dopaminergic is a different choice for a variety of reasons that's wellin that's the brand name for that is well so what are what are within that class of drugs what what are the ones that are more likely to reduce desire so the classic ssris most of them fit in that and the they bundle together or they cluster together somewhere around 35 to 40% of what we call treatment emerge and sexual dysfunction but I want to make a really strong caveat moment about this um because there's some actually some new research kind of debunking some of this a little bit um but that said so the ssris um do you want me to use brand names because people know that better or generics so proac flu I'll use both because being being mindful of this proac fluoxitine um culine

[00:57:49] Zoloft um uh paxel peroxin um those are the SSR and probably esram right Lexapro and cpram selex they're they're all probably similar that said I have patients who say like I developed low desire on proac or I have difficulty with orgasm on culing but on paxel but not on not on proac so we sometimes tried a few if I think an SSR is the best choice that's definitely been our experience clinically is that yeah there's a class effect but at the end of the day it's kind of drug specific and I always tell patients look if you're if you're because we we're not the ones that are prescribing those we're not psychiatrists but but if you're doctor prescribing you an SSRI or an snri um I always say the probability that you're going to get it right on the first one in terms of efficacy and side effects is actually not that high so you have to be willing to switch drugs to find that right combination of efficacy and avoidance of side effects and you'll you'll be able to stay within the same class usually but but it's you know there seem to be um you know non-trivial effects right so again we're talking about the condition that you're treating it for usually it's depression or anxiety or both right and then there's the side effects which amongst them is sexual dysfunction so then there's another category the snris that stands the ceric norepinephrine drugs which I know you're familiar with there's more variability in the data on that um so there's duotine there's Veno facine which is a faxer which is probably the most commonly used one and then there's um prestique which is desz Veno vacine they're probably all of them are probably similar to the ssris but Veno facine is interesting at a low level low dose it functions more like an SSRI and that as you kick in above somewhere like 75 is up to 75 is probably low somewhere over 100 to 150 it functions more like an snri and so teasing out the sexual dysfunction is and the dose dependency is a little tricky on that one but just keep that in mind and then Dez venlafaxine has um some data suggesting it's less likely to cause sexual dysfunction it probably has to do with the chemical composition and how it's different than Vena vaccine um then there's some new drugs I guess they're not so new anymore um veladone and V otine which have very unique and different mechanisms and they seem to be better right um they're they're complex

[01:00:25] C remind me the brand name on that on those again um Tren tilx and um so veladone I'm I'm doing a blank we we could look that up in a minute yeah I I worked so much with the generics but veladone is um one of them is Trend we'll come back to that so V otine and um veladone are newer mechanistic and they're mixed they're a little complicated in their mechanism but the bottom line is they work both with energic Transporters as Transporters as well as dopaminergic drugs so it's the multi-receptor factors that I mean when you're looking at the sexual dysfunction component you're you're probably that's why the theory is that they're better the best data is actually with veladone um and it best data for fewest sexual side effects lack of sexual dysfunction the problem with the research on the three newest that seem to be the better um that is desvenlafaxine viotin ofas is that um in the the studies weren't perfect right there was a lot of high pre-treatment sexual dysfunction so when they separate from Placebo and not having treatment emergent um it may be the effect of just treating disease state of depression and improving sexual function which speaks to the point that

[01:01:43] I told you I wanted to make in a minute um about what some of the newer research says about this in general um the other drug is metapan which is um kind of a atypical SSRI it is very low in sexual dysfunction compared to the other SSRS but it it has some other problems with side effects it's it can be sedating which is good for people who don't sleep and there's some weight gain that people

[01:02:05] Report with that and why that is is a little unclear but probably the dopaminergic component so let let's assume that this woman that this woman is not taking any of those psychotropic meds um does it would her being on an oral contraceptive suede okay I was okay so what's the role of oral contraceptive so

[01:02:24] I was going to tell you about that in a minute when we talk about hormones and post and this this age premenopausal women let me make my point though because I don't want to forget so there's some research that's come out both in menopause for menopausal women and in general that the best thing to do for a depressed person for sexual function is to treat their depression right and that probably and I I I still am having trouble teasing this out that probably the best thing to do is pick the best drug for them for their depression and that um it's more important to get them undepressed in terms of sexual function and that a small percentage even though the numbers in other studies say 30 to 40% will get treat what's called treatment emerg and sexual dysfunction but one of my colleagues who I I admire greatly who does a lot of work in this area said something to me the other day we're working on a a like a project a paper that relates to this she said look the bottom line is here's the simple answer if you treat their depression most likely their sexual functions going to get better if it does n it's due to the drug and I thought and then you need if they don't want to it's not because their depression is not better because depression is associated with sexual dysfunction right that makes sense and then that's when you start to say well if this is important to that person you switch the drug around and this is where that we can come in is where we can say look this is an important reason to switch meds right but you don't want to like some people say to me I don't care like I just am so happy I'm feeling good and I sometimes say great or sometimes I say well you could feel good on something else and still have good sexual dysfunction don't dismiss that right so it depends on the patient but now so the other big category so we talked about psychotropics and and they're less commonly prescribed in like ordinary situations but antis psychotics an an anxiety meds they all have some issues around sexual function and should that be relevant we could discuss that um so the other categories like not so much for this woman blood pressure meds there's some dis you know discussion about how to think about those um there a collection of you know pain medications or another big bucket hormone suppressing drugs like if someone's on a aromatic inhibitor for can you know cancer prophylaxis Etc but the thing that we really want to make sure we talk about in this age group and you're bringing this up is combined hormonal contraception I'm I'm glad you raised this Peter so confusing area also right and um there's like people are very polar on this and very opinionated but um I think it's important not to recognize not just oral contraceptive it's combined systemic hormonal contraception right so people take birth control pills which have estrogen and progesterone they also use patches like the orth ever patch and the ring like the like the nver ring right and those combine and there's a whole bunch of different types of these but um the the the idea here what what are you doing when you give contracep hormonal contraception you're turning off the brain and that um feedback loop that makes you ovulate sh you know make a lining shed it and be able to be able to have a pregnancy in the shed it if you don't and you're turning that all up by giving super high high doses of hormones right so what happens the short answer is with combined contraception it's probably most noted in the research is that a small percentage of women get that high level of estrogen but the vvo vagin mucosa doesn't recognize it right and you can develop a vestibul Denia a vestibulitis that particularly the that the the vestibules that tissue around the entrance to the vagina not so much inside the vagina but that surrounding tissue called the vestibule is very sensitive to the drop in these the endogenous estradi and the synthetic estrogens sometimes don't do their trick and they can develop a vestibul adenia meaning pain and dryness and almost look like a post-menopausal woman when it comes to that um it's that's one issue right with or com contraception it's it's probably that number you want to number um the the work of some of my colleagues in this area who do like sexual pain and vestibular D work say it's somewhere around 10% 10% of women that are re receiving systemic yeah okay who are receiving systemic it's probably similar with rings and patches but it's not as well documented and and and then there's some variability like higher dose or oral uh contraceptives have been um more likely um low I'm sorry the very low dose have been more likely implicated and people do better if they have like more robust high dose like sort of more standard 35 microgram pills as opposed to these ultra low like the 20 microgram like is low low Estrin considered low yes yes that's an example so the ultra low ones tend to be the biggest culprits that said um the experts in the field feel this is very important for us to understand the ordinary gynecologic

[01:07:12] Community thinks it's it's relatively insignificant whether they're under detecting this particular piece of it or not is is is something that needs more development the other issue with um birth control pills is that it can have an effect on neurotransmitters and Sometimes women will develop mood issues with as you probably know with like highd dose oral contraceptives um and that may have an impact on the neurotransmitter milia and the mix that leads to sexual dysfunction and low low sex drive so um then finally and this is probably more important as when we get a little older it might lead us into the discussion about testosterone is that birth so so so three things one is they can have an effect on the local vulvar tissue right if we have this issue particularly the lowest dose estrogen the other thing is depends on the androgenicity of the birth control pill um that's not the that's that that's yet another issue um and there are Androgen receptors in the vulvo vaginal tissue so that may change sensitivity or even lead to pain that piece of it the second thing is that that inter intersection with brain neurotransmitters and mood and that effect on sexual function could also be clinically important and then finally and this is like like a whole another thing um what do you do when you make all send all that hormone into someone's body you increase the production of shbg right yep so so you're binding up more of the hormone as well so right you need something well the easiest way to think about it is you need something to carry it around with right and that shpg goes up in other states like pregnancy um and you might ask me like is it the same with viral pills and pregnancy or when you take thyroid hormone any there are other things that make that production of that go up um the data across situations is can like you could say okay it's like around a hundred such with this or is not so clear I think it's best just to say it makes it go up um now um the that is a 100% of women like I get asked this question like does it matter a 100% of women have a higher shbd if they take for examp let's just say high dose birth control pills right let's just stick to that for now everybody who takes it has that and what does that do so it it it helps carry it around but it ALS Al un you know fortunately or unfortunately whatever you want it's a the fellow traveler is androgens or testosterone gets carried by S hbg so because you're increasing shbg there's some um thinking that you're binding up the circulating testosterone and you may be lowering free testosterone in those women and that might be another potential contributor low desire and how does desire now we when we get into testosterone we can talk about that but has testosterone effect desire probably at the level of brain receptors and turning on those Pathways of desire and there's some genital changes too right in the in the metabolites of the androgens um that change sensitivity and that might impact desire but that's a secondary state so um if someone and we're also gonna when we talk about testosterone we were talking about how it doesn't like abruptly change so much like ovarian hormones with menopause that it's more of a gradual decline so the intersection between contraception and women in their late 30s and early 40s and testosterone is interesting so if if you look at my arm when you're 20 18 to 24 that's when we start to study reproductive your testosterone's like up here in the 40s for women right and then it kind of goes down like I wish I could do it better but it declines and by the time you're in like those late 30s early 40s is about half of what like if you look at normal ranges studies that have tried to of what you were when you were 18 and then it levels off at somewhat lower in your 40s and 50s and actually goes up a little bit past 60 and kind of levels off like down there so if you're on birth control pills that curve is way down and so woman a woman at 40 might be much more sensitive to that effect than she was if she was on a birth and TR bill of 25 and that difference in her testosterone or free testosterone may be significant in that she'll come and say like I have no sex drive right or I have no General sensitivity and so um that's a kind of an important thing that like most people don't tell their patients when they put them on a birth and TR pill or combin contraception for 20 years now the other thing and I think it was in you know we get some notes in advance it was one of the questions you asked what happens so believe it or not even though people say it doesn't come back like let's say you take a birth control pill from 20 to 40 and then you have you know you decide to switch to an IUD after your second baby or your third baby which happens a lot right what happens to mybg so there's really only believe it or not really one good study that was done by Claudia Panzer in like 2000 something like that and we need more um there's some other data but not a good study and she looked at she looked at um con current users never users and stopped users who stopped six months ago and the bottom line was at six months the stopped users the PRI previous users were in the middle of the other two they hadn't gone down to normal now no one ever studied them out to three or four years but I can tell you and my colleagues can say that if if if that woman walked in and she'd been on birth control pills and I checked her hbg even if she had stopped it it's always going to be higher than the person who ever used them I just see that all the time right so does that mean that her free testosterone at 40 is lower than it would have been if she hadn't used birth control pills for 20 years well that's the theory right well I mean it would wouldn't wouldn't it have to be unless her testosterone has gone up I mean because shbg is doing the Lion's Share of The Binding I mean albumin is a relatively small contributor to this process so corre isn't it about 85% of the Androgen binding is coming through shbg yeah so well it it depends a little on how how much you have but that's roughly the idea right so it it if that is to answer your question depends a little bit on how much shbg you have but most of the binding is through shbg and a small small percentage is for through

[01:13:09] Alum and um and so but let there's one more point which before we go back to talking about binding in a second is that it's still part of the controversy is it's not clear that free testosterone is the bioactive component to what makes desire happen both in the cells and in the brain right y so the naysayers are saying well okay but that's not necessarily the active component and like looking at shbg and free might not be like what we need to be doing anyway right but I I I think and sorry just let let's go down that rabbit hole a little bit further because this is something that fascinates me endlessly is um at least in men the way

[01:13:56] I think about this but I I I would think that's it's parallel in women the one thing that's missing from all biomarkers that we can measure so let's just make sure people understand the lingo you and I are throwing around testosterone is an is a measurement assay when you go and measure uh when you ask what's a person's testosterone level there's an assay that breaks apart and separates testosterone from albumin from shbg and you actually measure in nanog per deiler the concentration of testosterone in that plasma when people talk about free testosterone that is not measured that is calculated it's estimated based on the measured testosterone the measured shbg and the measured albumen but there's a whole other issue here which um I don't think gets enough attention I do plan to explore this in subsequent podcasts because I find the topic really fascinating which is Androgen receptor saturation so we you know so let's just

[01:14:58] I'll give you a very clear clinical example I see that I see in men but I know it applies to women which is you take two guys that both have a total testosterone of 500 and let's just assume that they free testosterones are estimated to be roughly the same and you give them both testosterone and one of them so now they both have a total testosterone of a thousand one of them feels significantly better the other one says I don't really notice a difference there's an argument that says that the guy who doesn't feel any different already had his Androgen receptors saturated so yes you drove up his testosterone and yes more of it is free but it doesn't matter because where it matters most in the nucleus at the

[01:15:43] Androgen receptor you haven't increased it whereas the guy who says oh my God you've changed my life my libido is higher I'm recovering from workouts better I'm putting on muscle Everything feels better he was probably undersaturated so I mean this is something I I mean to my knowledge Sharon we don't have a way to measure this clinically this is you know I know that there are people in the lab who can do this but you right right so this is um part of what that all of that emerging understanding and lack of clarity is now being brought to the question of female testosterone too and even less is understood about the role of the circulating um actual measurable testosterone what we think is free or bioavailable and how that's interacting with the Androgen receptor both in non- genomic and through genomic mechanisms and then all of that what cells do we even mean in a woman right is it her brain is it her genitals is it her nipples like we don't even know right but the theory is that the most important hor place that testosterone acts in the brain right so like is it where you know where is that happening at a cellular level in the brain right because if you if you look at like the most like like general concepts is that testosterone is the hormone of Desire testosterone its metabolites right and that it interacts with brain neurotransmitters to turn on Pathways of desire and when it drops it's sensitive like if you look at the early work of

[01:17:14] Helen singer Kaplan who was a psychologist I love reading her work because she actually talked a lot about this and said the goal and this is like my Mantra I I I have it like in a couple slides which is is to find fine-tune that just the right amount of giving exogenous testosterone safely to turn the rain Mack on to where she was when she was satisfied meaning like free menopausal satisfied but not invoking lethality right and keeping her safe and that that titration is the the work of desire you know the desire uh treatment right when you're using pharmaceutical and this is one of those things yeah sry go ahead so so we don't so the argument is first of all do we know what's actually happening and then do we know what we want to fix right and this speaks to the idea like so so get getting back like back to the our original discussion this woman let's say she was on birth and pleasant it's been 20 years and like she stopped them on and off for her kids but she still is taking them and her shbd is high and her free te measures low and her you know like and then she has low desire so do we are we confident enough to say um like that's why right and so and then the answer question is will stopping your birth and pill solve the problem if her shbg doesn't come down or am I going to give her doomsday prognosis right because women will say to me well like what if it doesn't come down will I be like this forever and then it gets into this whole question of like is she a candidate for exogenous testosterone if she's premenopausal and she's still menstrating so we could go on and on with where this leads us but um I I I think we want to talk about like what do we know what don't we know and what are the pragmatic or practical implications of what we do understand and we counsel patients ultimately well I think this is as good a time as any to go a little further down the testosterone hole because I think again we're making this up as we go along Visa this case but I think I think where we're arriving organically is actually quite a common phenomenon um yeah no absolutely you know I've made this point on a previous podcast I think when I was on Andrew huberman's podcast a long time ago I made this point it's worth making again which is we think of testosterone as the man's hormone estrogen progesterone as the women's hormone not entirely correct in in fact one of the challenges is the way the labs report the units of estrogen and testosterone are different testosterone is typically reported in nanog per deciliter whereas estrogen is reported in PS per milliliter so when you convert these to the same units so you can do an Apples to Apples comparison you realize that testosterone is much higher in a woman than estrogen is let me repeat that a woman has a woman has much more testosterone in her body than she has estrogen this is a staggering thing that surprises most women and most men alike and to me at least the implication is given the testosterone is the most abundant sex hormone in a woman's body both pre and postmenopause and by the way postmenopause the Gap is even bigger because of the reasons we've already discussed it it is not a surprise that changes in testosterone a hormone that is largely responsible for desire can be just as important in women as they are in men so this brings me to this asymmetry such an important point is like really people just have such a hard time wrapping their brain around it they think that the only hormone they should be talking about is their estrogen and then there's this idea that estrogen supplementation improves sexual function and that that's like a whole another discussion but it's so um poorly understood how important testo is to the functioning of women particularly when it comes to sex organs and and and sexual desire or sexual function yeah so so this is where I think you know there are lots of places we can fault the medical system and we're going to we're going to line those up and and stack them here in a minute but but let's start with one of them which is the double standard and frankly the lack of scientific rigor around evaluating testosterone replacement for women so there there recently was uh there were two trials actually looking at a if I'm not mistaken a gel and a transdermal testosterone product for use in uh women

[01:21:32] I believe the gel didn't find a benefit I can come up with several reasons why not but the transdermal testosterone product it began with an I I don't remember the name inin yeah inin it actually it was a Johnson and Johnson patch 300 micro so even when you think about these numbers it was a 300 microgram very low like struggling with the numbers right yeah so but here's the thing it raised testosterone it improved sexual function and the side effect profile was not not of concern this was a drug that should have been approved why did the FDA not approve it yeah so the in the there was more than one trial um there's there's a wonderful paper it was in Lancet I think um in 2019 that's a metaanalysis of over like 50s something studies right and um there are some that are sort of most welln because they resulted in presentations of campaigns toward the FDA right but there have been a number of randomized control trials using patches um the intrinsa brand by Johnson and Johnson was a particular campaign that was brought to the FDA based on their randomized trial but um that's it so that study was I think it was also we

[01:22:46] I'm using the the 2000 a lot but it approximates it right it was it was actually Jan chiffer in the New England Journal and the first study that she looked at was the intrin the equivalent of the 300 microgram patch in O fortimize women young women who had low desire they had distressing low desire and the the estimation for the 300 micrograms is that's the physiologic amount it this is also a little complicated but that's the physiologic amount that approximates what you would get in a like a mid reproductive or late reproductive age to bring you back to kind of a that level somewhere around let's say 30ish right 27 to 38 like something like that and um it's based on like the reference range for for normals for women and that when you gave that patch they looked at outcomes the the outcome of Interest was hypoactive sexual desire disorder or sex driver liido and it showed positive improvements and it was based on both self-report satisfying sexual events Etc as well as other phase responses arousal orgasm overall satisfaction and it showed really no adverse effects in the short run but they looked that and other data looking at like longer term safety

[01:23:56] St St we can talk about some of the other trials in data too but it looked at um intermediate cardivascular outcomes cancer outcomes and metabolic outcomes and there were no hits but it was a 24-week trial six months right and the main thing in small percentage of women was what's called heroism so it was a little hair growth like on the face along the nipple um it was about 18% and a little acne but women didn't get virilized there's a difference between being a little like catism is kind of a scary word they have a little extra hair I like hair growth a little hair growth easily handled by dilation strategies that women use anyway um and the acne was relatively mild and women did well right and they liked it and um it was brought to the FDA at that time and the issue wasn't efficacy it was lack of long-term safety data right and um there was a lot of ranker um I know some of my colleagues were very very um upset about it at the time um and it did get approved in Europe for some time for that indication o for reize women with low desire and it was used off label in other postmenopausal women um it went off the market for reasons other than efficacy or safety and it's no longer available in Europe as a 300 microgram patch so no patches available anywhere in the world for women yeah so so let's just level set for people so they understand something there's a there's an undercurrent of bad science here which was one of the reasons given uh for the fear around this uh use of topical testosterone was extracted from the incorrect and erroneous fear that still lingered from the women's health initiative so that's kind of problem one here I think problem two is the double standard which is how many topical injectable transdermal testosterone products are approved for men right now in the United States so we could say at least two dozen you know um the numbers like depending on how you look at the indication whether it's for you know hypogonadism versus sexual dysfunction you know this right 25 right let's just say those products get approved on biochemical efficacy do they or do they not raise testosterone they're they're not yeah and also outcome like the outcome of design you know that you're looking for the Target outcome of the study but the point is they they don't require the 5year safety window because we've already established over decades that exogenous testosterone at physiologic doses is safe is safe yeah so again you could make the point well Peter why why do you care about this I mean it's just you can prescribe it off label to women which of course we do oh no there's a huge reason to yeah so so let's talk about why does this matter right so um the there's been a lot of feeling that the standard just to emphasize this clearly applied to the first drug the liel you you asked me about that it never made it to the FDA they they withdrew it they withdrew their applications in it didn't have efficacy correct it wasn't right so it was it was called liel and they um they they looked at the data for out to five years and had like seven years of women patient data research and it didn't show any hits for being unsafe and it was loaded for women with cardiovascular risk factors um there was no increased rates above Baseline rates of cardiovascular disease of breast cancer of intermediate markers for metabolic or cardiovascular risk like

[01:27:36] A1C lipids inflammatory markers but um and they reached the therapeutic level in the blood right so they felt that they could clearly state that this represented safety data y but the efficacy hit wasn't met and so they they did not take it further to the FDA unfortunately and that's been the last effort since then um but but but just going back so the the problem is that you're saying like why do they approve these testosterone products because the concept has already been proven right that we know it's the FDA makes this assumption that it's safe but when this was taken to the like the the the the division that looks at this and hormonal it's really the hormone and reproductive end there's no prec inent right but the lack of approval doesn't then permit the precedent the history the knowing the expert consensus in the field that it's safe right so you never can get there right if you don't approve something at 24 weeks so this is the conundrum that we face like this is the problem right um there is one there's only one place in the world that has a government approved product of testosterone it's the um the continent of Australia they have a product that is now available that you can get it's called andram um and it's 5 milligrams this is the dose you can go up to 10 milligrams of the the item the testosterone gives you this physiologic amount of testosterone people get confused because the patch was 300 micrograms but it it is available in Australia it's government approved it's based on the same research the same numbers the same blood levels the same outcomes um there's a way for practitioners in from other countries by sending their licensing information to actually order it for patients but it's not done very much right you you know um so no other place in the entire world has approved a testosterone for women so you're asking me like why does it matter we just prescribe It Off label so the problem is there's no regulation to it right so you know what when I decide that I'm going to so the let me say something else that that I think was implied but you're mentioning the study about the micro the 30 300 microgram patch that went to the

[01:29:38] F the company that went to the FDA there have been a number of randomized control trials looking at similar doses um mostly in patches looking at women on and off estrogen free and postmenopausal Surgical and natural menopause um that have shown the SE efficacy with the outcome of hsd hyperoptic sexual desire um being the the primary outcome and showing other parameters with

[01:30:03] Improvement like arousal orgasm satisfaction Etc and the same based on that consensus papers that have come out in the last couple years really say that this is indicated and solely for late repr probably late reproductive age there's two different guidances and definitely postmenopausal women based on this efficacy and safety data and these numbers of randomized Trials and this large Med analysis that looked at efficacy and safety of numerous studies demonstrates this so you can prescribe it it's off label but it's supported by all of this data the problem is it's impossibly hard to prescribe it carefully yeah and with the Precision unless you're in Australia that we should command for our patients right so what you do yeah and let's explain this to people yes yeah because I want to talk about it and precise because you have to basically rely on one of three methods one is is using a man sort of a male topical product but then their doses are wrong so you're you know you're you're you're you're stuck using like andrel which by the way I think is a suboptimal product even for men so you're now you're taking a product that

[01:31:09] I don't think is very good for men trying to apply it to women you can cut patches into tiny little areas so take an FDA approved patch and cut it you cannot use the FDA approved injectable because the concentration is is too high those are 200 mg per milliliter and you can't get enough into a neat like it's basically you just need what's in the needle let alone in the syringe right right so you're basically left with three options none of them are an FDA approved product one is a compounded cream one is a compounded injection so they can compound it at 20 mg per milliliter of testosterone one so just to be clear we want to give about one1 of the M that y right yep and then the third is compounded pellets which again you can get an FDA certificate for the raw ingredient but it is not an FDA approved product the way for example your Vel dot is FDA approved as top Glen so so therein lies the rub I mean that's that's the Crux of it as I see it so so let let me I think it's good to explain this to people like so we said earlier that testosterone was the most in in a little more depth was the most the most robust circulating hormone in women that said the there there is there are normal ranges for women and they they're sort of broken down by decade and quartile so like 18 to 25 25 to 35 35 to 45 and sort of 45 to 50 and up right and there's been um a couple good studies particularly by Andrew Gay and irn

[01:32:51] Goldstein was involved with this work looking at like creating normal ranges so the idea is when you treat a woman you want to go to the physiologic range for a mid to late reproductive age women so therefore you're not like overshooting and you're not undershooting and probably that's the time that like when women are the mo like that's the best range so somewhere like for example you know 28 to 35 or 28 to 37 with a standard direct total testosterone ACD we didn't talk about like what you should measure and follow we can come back to that but um and that was what they found was safe and efficacious in these studies was that physiologic range for Mid reproductive age women based on normal ranges in in in studies um by the way I

[01:33:36] I want to correct myself I I I the data I just have it in front of me is that it was there were 46 studies um looking at 36 that of the trials were randomized and like 8,500 women close to 8500 women so there were lot there's lots of data it's not lacking right there there there's a like probably even more that didn't get into the man analysis because it didn't meet the criteria we have lots of data it's not based on lack of data um and we do have decent outcome data meaning it's extension trial data for up to four to five years and randomized trial data up to two really clearly up to 24 weeks but certainly in some trials up to even two years so it's not it's not any different than what we have for men we just have long-term use with FDA approved products because they've approved them right so so it's a little bit of a cart horse problem which is we're stuck in this Paradigm where unless we get some approval we can't get out of it to do the longer studies that you'll see postmarket that that are carefully done and will satisfy future approval effectively the phase four trial yeah right and then that so but so you need to use on10th of the maale dose because that's probably what gets you to this physiologic range that I was talking about yeah now the Australian approved government product does do that it comes up it starts there and then you monitor levels and there's no cut point for saying this testosterone is the one you don't treat a testosterone you treat a syndrome right that's the first thing you treat hsdd and I usually check

[01:35:02] Baseline levels to make sure they're not high right like because if someone comes to me and they're 52 and their testosterone's surprisingly high for their they're not in that later cortile I might say to them I don't think this is the solution to your problem right but if it's low as I expect it to be it's not they're not abnormal they're not deficient they're just normally what they should be then I shoot to treat to them to that reproductive physiologic level and so you want to use one1 of the

[01:35:26] M dose the position papers that I've been involved with state that because um it's so hard to get the concentrations consistent we recommend using transdermal male products at female doses as opposed to compounding and if you're going to compound you're probably better off with transdermal than a pellet or an injection because of the

[01:35:47] Peaks and the difficulty in not getting into the the key thing is you don't want to get into that super physiologic level which hasn't been demonstrated to be safe in women yeah and so the the trick is really it's so hard to use one/ tenen of a male dose right so here's what I tell someone and it's a joke right they

[01:36:06] I prescribe a year you know a 30-day supply for example of the tubes the 1% testosterone tubes they go to the pharmacy the pharmacist rejects the prescription they not covered by Insurance the pharmacist calls me and says do you know it's a woman I'm like I write it on the prescription didn't I say the patient is a woman Hyo and ism is the diagnosis hsdd and yes she's going to pay for it I tell them to look at a cost-saving app and find the cheapest place it's usually $200 they buy 30 days they have to hope it works because they have to waste the $200 then

[01:36:36] I say take a tube and waste one divide it into 10 little piles and then figure out what you're going to do to get that amount on your body every day and then we'll do a blood test in three to four weeks that is not the kind of medicine I want to practice Yeah so one strategy is to tell them buy that you can buy them in the pharmacy 5c syringes and squirt the thing in and use half a cc a day like you if it's a tube it's easier to squirt in than a packet I have a patient she's my most brilliant patient she's a she's a baker so she discovered that the cooking spoon somewhere between a pinch and a smidge was a tenth of her packet and then when her level's a little high she's like okay I'll level the spoon a little differently this is crazy there's no better solution yeah it's total

[01:37:18] Alchemy and and and um tell me what what's the instruction you give women for how and when to apply do you say I want you to do this right after the shower I want you to exfoliate your inner thigh I want maximum absorption like how are you making this as consistent as possible you know I a relatively hairless area an a buttock an outer thigh the back of the calf you know it just so gets absorbed you obviously don't want to wash within a couple of hours um it it doesn't matter the time of day if you want to make sense to do at the same time of day it can the other thing to really Herald is it can transfer right so you know like you don't want to if you have children that you're holding um or if you have a female partner and it's skin that skin to skin contact it actually can transfer and it's not thought to be insignificant they're two important points for us to all know if there's it can transfer so you want to put it somewhere it won't transfer if that's going to be an issue even though the numbers the amounts are much smaller and and everyone knows that about male right like if you squeeze one of those tubes out on a male shoulder you know this it's like a whole big surface there it's much smaller women but still um and if you're going to get a blood test don't put it where you're going to draw it or don't try to wait some hours so that you still get a little bit of a peak even though with daily use of transdermal it's more it's more of a steady state um the other caveat is if there's a potential for getting pregnant they really have to be on good contraception so who might that be um so there is a um a biological plausibility and the guidance in the clinical guidelin says that you can consider this and L later reproductive age women and and so I you know every now and then a menstrual cycle peaks in and all of us have heard of a an unexpected pregnancy in those women and and it's probably if you by the time you discover you're pregnant the testosterone's not going to do much harm to the fetus because it's usually only a few weeks but we don't want people using testosterone and getting pregnant um that's one of the big reasons I mean we and and we didn't get back to this with the or contraceptive patient the solution isn't to leave her on her birth control pill and give her testosterone right first of all it's not indicated for premenopausal woman second of all why that's not what do right you try to correct the so you would you would take if this is the woman we're talking about just going back to our hypothetical case yeah let's just say that that's the path we're going down you would remove her from the OC probably switch to an IUD if

[01:39:36] Testo if shbg levels were still sufficiently high and and free testosterone well let's just say total testosterone was kind of 40th percentile you'd say look we're going to bring that up higher and G given that your shpg is so high it's going to bring your free testosterone right up to about the 50th percentile and again you're using that as a guide post but it's ultimately symptoms that you're treating you're managing symptoms yeah so let's say that's what I decided

[01:40:04] I look at the biological psychological and social factors in this woman and I decide like that's the thing that's amendable to intervention I'm going to change our contraception right and um so it's not just women who are already on these that I tell I I'm a little you know birth control pills combined contraception I want to make this disclaimer patches and rings are extremely effective and most women don't have a problem right so if you ask me what should I take you know it's you have to talk to your doctor right should

[01:40:33] I use niud to start with I can tell you how I canel my own daughter but that's my college age daughter but that's that's different than what I would tell patients and people um they they they're incredibly effective worldwide they prevent unre un unwanted pregnancies they Pro protect against birth you know uh birth mut alties Etc worldwide they liberate women all across the world we don't want to like say nobody should take birth and but for this discussion if somebody has a problem that's something you can change and if it's one of the problems we talked about right whether you should what you should tell a 20y old about whether you use bir trills or put in an IUD is like a whole another conversation right to be preventive again this is a small percentage of people who develop these issues most some women aren't sensitive to the everyone gets a change in their shbg some women aren't sensitive to it some women aren't sensitive to the the non-endogenous estradi in their vestibules some aren't so I can't tell you who that's going to happen to um so again the decision about what to use over time is a discussion with your doctor um I think more gynecologists need to offer informed consent so women can choose more carefully at the onset and this is an important campaign that gets missed right like there's no informed consent they just hand people a prescription at 21 right you should give women Choice um but anyway so getting back to testosterone um so I think the challenges then like we weren't going to use it on this page but let's go back to this for a minute is that you're going to then have to do that on Tenth of the male dose but you do have to follow levels because women are all over the place like how well they get on10th how that one also how V how variable the absorption is not all people have the same skin these were not designed for women I can tell you that the data in

[01:42:21] Australia is very positive for example I worked very closely with the one of the main researchers there a woman named Susan Davis who's done a lot of the work um in this field both in Australia and worldwide and and is a first author on a number of really important testosterone consensus papers she um impresses me but what she tells me about the clinical outcomes and the ability to get kind of steady state good blood levels because it's a controlled product designed for women regulated and formulated we need that that said you do have to follow levels mainly to make sure that you're a achieving safe doses right y so like if you said to me well like let's say someone has a level but it's too low and they're not getting benefit um would you go up and i' say sure because we haven't achieved the physiologic range and I know it's still safe so I am like checking it to make sure they're if they're not having symptoms that are improving to see that we're giving them enough but the most important reason for monitoring blood levels and I monitor for because of what you explained the smartest thing is just to men a total te right it's not a so we we we didn't go through this in elaborate detail it's not clear that that's the best marker for knowing whether that's the way to tell whether testosterone is helping a patient in their cells and in their brain right their genital cells their brain and some other body cells too right but that's probably the grossest best measure we have because T fre is calculated and we don't even know if that's the bioactive component yeah testosterone it's a very complex what now is called iny it hits the cells it gets converted into metabolites um

[01:43:55] Androgen DHT it enters the cell through the Androgen receptor and has both genomic and non- genomic effects non-genomic means direct action genomic means it causes Gene translation other protein development which then has trophic effects right and so all of that's happening probably the the total te is the best measure of both not being too toxic and also probably targeting right and now you ask me what's the best type of total te so most people have direct aay in their lab if you send your patient to your hospital lab or Quest or lab core and they're they're not they're imprecise when you use them for women they're not the best measure but they're good enough for what we're doing and what we're talking about LC um g g gas lccs the mass spectrometry testing which has fancy names is used in research and in clinical labs and it's prob like and

[01:44:46] I believe you can specialize that so sorry specifically order that so we we do order lcms when we send our patients people know that way that is when when we order estrogen levels testosterone levels we we actually request lcms um because we've seen how Believe It or Not supplements that you're taking can dramatically impact the readings and we noticed this actually first in men we were getting men who would get estrogen levels back that were you know normally a male estrogen level might be 25 to 40 we'd see guys with like 200 be like that's impossible right first of all he has no symptoms of having an estrogen of 200 come to realize he's on some supplement for you know I don't know what and that's impacting with the assay you send them to get an lcms and it comes back normal so um yeah all of this stuff gets very complicated very quickly um just quickly I want to talk about one other hormone before we leave this and go to our next topic and that is the role of

[01:45:43] DHEA um so you know just for for folks who might not be familiar DHEA is a precursor to testosterone um DHEA is actually not regulated in the United States it's a hormone you can buy overthe counter um which is odd I I don't really understand why it's unregulated but that's another story what is the role of of oral or topical

[01:46:06] DHA yeah in in in female sexual health yeah so so the testosterone its metabolites and its precursors are also like an area of confusion so like the simple version which is good right now is the DHA is a precursor right so why not use that and then make test testosterone right and then D so testosterone gets metabolized to to things for example like 5 Alpha DHT which is probably the most potent metabolism metabolite and aromatase estrad so when we're talking about throwing all these things out we're talking about do we want to look at a precursor or a metabolite and then the what's actually working in the body or in the cell so the short answer is there have been some trials looking at Oral

[01:46:46] DHEA for the outcomes of interest that we're talking about here for example low sexual desire and they have not been convincingly positive um safety has not been really well studied to the extent to which I just told you there's all these randomized trials of efficancy and safety for testosterone for women using the product the 300 microgram or gel products right um 300 microgram patch right and and again that's different than the blood level which we're measuring in picograms per M everyone understand I mean in picograms for ML is what we measure for one anyway we we'll come back to the measurement in a second um but the oral DHEA which is administered in milligrams right um has been some outcome Studies have been done they've been small they've been problematically designed and not like the all the criteria for good randomized trials haven't been met and there's no good safety data really looking at this but the biggest thing is that advocacy has not been demonstrated right um so we don't recommend and oral DHEA for the indication of hsdd um you know whether I know people use it whether it helps some patients and whether we're doing anything problematic to the way we're measuring different things is is is impossible for me to tell you because we don't have good control data on this um that said there is very good data supporting the use of a vaginal intravaginal DHEA the chemical is called prostone the brand is called intr Roa it's um basically it's a it's like a little suppository it's used for vvo vaginal atrophy resulting in genital urinary symptoms of menopause and the indication is disperar pain postmenopause and it has very good efficacy and safety data with very little systemic absorption for that indication and the rationale for it instead of using an estrogen local product and we'll maybe we'll have a few minutes to get into that is that there are mixed receptors in the genitals that need both estrogen and androgen so it gets metabolized into both androgens and then eventually to estrogens in the at the intracellular level that's the theory of it right because again remember DHA is a precursor so how how do you decide Sharon for a woman who's presenting with a pretty common presentation um if you should go down whether you're going to use an estrogen suppository or whether you're going to use a DHEA suppository so um the data suggesting differences and efficacy isn't there right so you really could offer like I really we can get into like how do I even even among the estrogen products there's a whole bunch of choices there's creams there's Rings there's inserts um and then there's tablets right and there are they're all local vaginal estrogen products that help with dryness and pain with sexual activity and then

[01:49:46] DHEA the intro Roa product is an option and so you know the the standard practitioner will start with an estrogen product and if it doesn't work switch to intr Roa I think it works really well so I offer it as an option um and there are some I have some educated patients who that's what they want um the other thing is that any distinct pros and cons that so it doesn't have a blackbox warning right which we'll also have to get into and so some people like just like not seeing that warning right and the blackbox warning with with the estrogen is around breast cancer or clots it h so it has to do with both endometrial and breast cancer and

[01:50:29] Vascular thr thromboembolism and there are a few other things thrown in there but it's the idea is that um they're applying the risk factor data primarily from the Whi actually for systemic estrogen therapy that it's a it's a class labeling requirement that has to go on these lowd dose products which haven't demonstrated any of the same negative outcomes and even the even the systemic hormone therapy you know that could be dissected some so some practitioners prefer not having a black box right some patients prefer not having a black box and some sometimes it's someone like my mother had breast cancer I don't want any hormones but I'll use I won't use estrogen but they'll use this and there's no real rationale there's no proof that it's any more or less likely to cause any cancer at all yeah right uh the other issue is that in cancer P cancer survivors it doesn't have the black box so sometimes oncologists and again that's a whole a discussion we could have whether they're worried unnecessarily um and I think um there's some people where I feel they're quite

[01:51:31] Androgen deficient and it might be a better choice to start with interesting so for example like I have a 40-year-old had an ectomy and doesn't want to go on systemic hormone therapy and I know that her testosterone levels and her Androgen levels have plummeted uh overall because over the OV about half of the circulating testosterone even though she lost some of it since she was 25 you've now taken out half of what she has remember half of so we didn't we didn't talk about this so in every woman half of your about half of your androgens are made in your adrenal gland and half in your ovary and the part that goes down in like in later reproductive years and through the menopausal transition is the ovarian component the Androgen component stays about the same there is some decline in that so when you take someone's ovaries out at a young age you're lopping off especially the younger the worse those are the people that are the most likely to have what I think is physiological organic ual desire difficulties from low testosterone from testosterone removal or Androgen removal abruptly so that's someone I might say like and they're not using systemic hormones I might say like like this might be a better Direction but that's a that's like not based on any really systematic research it's just experience okay let's come back to something you mentioned earlier in the discussion of our first patient um as we now talk about our second patient um sure so our second patient um let's say she is younger um I don't know let's say she's 30 she has no kids been sexually active for 12 years and she comes to you complaining of inorgasmia so she says I have desire but I and I do get aroused somewhat but I'm I have never been able to either alone or with a partner achieve what I think I'm told an orgasm is so I'm really teeing this up so that you can explain what an orgasm is because in a male it tends to be somewhat more binary um but I I I'm curious as to how how you would counsel this this woman and if you think that this is a reasonable example to use to explain that so um sure um what I thought you were going to tell me is that she she's nothing else is going on she has no sex driving are there FDA approv drugs for low desire which we didn't talk about okay well let's let's come let's come back to that then but that's not the question you're asking me let's come back let's turn her into someone who has a different problem after that because I think we don't want to forget to mention there are two drugs that are we're talking about all this testosterone that's not approved but we should make sure before we we conclude that we let people know there are two drugs FDA approved for low sexual desire and premenopausal women let's go to orgasms so um the one of the biggest things when someone comes to me this is not an uncommon uh um someone not uncommon clinical scenario you picked a good one

[01:54:33] Peter because is is saying I you know I a youngish women but old enough to start realizing like hey I'm 30 by now like this should have happened right you know or is there something wrong with me or you know um sometimes they don't care but they think there might be something wrong with them sometimes they're like you know what it's enough I want one of these you know or you know there's a lot of reasons why people seek it but I I first thing I do is try to figure out if it's primary anorgasmia meaning they've never had an orgasm or secondary um meaning they had one and now suddenly it's gone right the scenario I think you're telling me is someone who has like really never really felt like they had an orgasm and now so one of the first things I asked them is like why are you now bringing coming here to talk to me about this what is different right so sometimes and well let's just say it's a it's it's I'm i' I'm really with a an amazing sexual partner and everything is perfect and he or she is wondering if there's something wrong with them and this inability to have an orgasm is actually interfering with our relationship because it's now creating a stress where my partner feels inadequate because they I'm making this up but I would assume that this is a it's reason right right so so the most common reason that women suddenly decide to come to me for anas me is that they are now in a relationship and it it may be that they themselves want to have a more satisfying experience or the partner wants to um sometimes they lose relationships because they it's not so much a partner isn't willing to work it through but they um feel uncomfortable about having this problem and letting a partner see that they can't solve it right um but some that's it's usually contextual right but not always sometimes women just sort of come to this realization that this is something they want to explore um so you ask me what an orgasm is I mean I think you know the idea that it's a peing after you know you become interested you feel a sense of we've talked some about arousal you feel mentally excited your body feels turned on there are physical changes that you notice um and then there's sort of a a sensation um that feels it's throughout you that you're peaking and maximal pleasure and it's an overall sense of like an escalation to

[01:56:57] Something in the genitals that the what's actually happening is first there's what we can talk about what happens when you get stimulated there's sensory input which causes you know you you get a a stimulation to the sensation it causes a response that heads to the spinal cord it can trigger the autonomic nervous system the both the first the parasympathetic nervous system to cause vasod dilation um a sense of like the some here's where the pelvic muscle sometimes can then relax during sexual activity you get muscle relaxation Vaso dilation and then it triggers eventually as you become more and more aroused this the interestingly the sympathetic nervous system gets triggered and that's what triggers an orgasm and in women it can be a sensation of pleasure in the brain and it's really interesting to talk about what's going on like fmri

[01:57:46] Studies have actually looked at this but generally it's pelvic floor the pelvic floor muscles contract you blood Vel become maximally dilated and nerve stimulation um results in the local release of some neurotransmitters which cause secretions and lubrication so it's um for example vasoactive intestinal polypeptide there's some involv nitric acid nitri nitric oxide and CMP like in men contributing to both phasal vitation secretion and and so forth so you get like again you get this stimulation parasympathetic nervous system then sympathetic nervous system then muscle contraction local hormones brain brain chemistry local hormones secretions and people get this sense both of well-being pleasure um pelvic floor contraction they may get secretions and then they feel that they have an orgasm so there's a lot of variability that's the full the full monty there's a lot of variability some people just feel like a intense Central or or mental pleasure others feel like a warm intense sensation in their gals but don't notice lubrication sometimes people will come to me and it's like a part of isn't there like how come I don't squirt right or that term comes up sometimes um and that's a whole another discussion like supposed to happen yeah what what so first of all what proportion of women have that sort of ejaculatory response with an orgasm I it's hard to say you know I I I think my some of my colleagues believe that it's part of every sexual response and that it's just not being perceived um I would say about 20% of people are aware of it and that's sort of what's written but again um so there's this whole another theme going on in the sexual medicine literature about whether women have the prostate function in the local genital milu that results in the squirting of fluid um what I can say is it's controversial and probably um more commonly What I Hear in when people are having sort of a more normal orgasmic or arousal and than orgasmic response is that the lubrication from the mucosal surface becomes robust right and that's probably the interaction between vasod

[01:59:51] Dil ation the nervous system and the local hormones such as VIP and nitric oxide um where the squirting of fluid and where the female prostate actually resides structurally is an area of controversy I think that's the simplest answer and I don't think that's the biggest piece of orgasm we're getting back to that I don't know if you have other thoughts or you know it's it's sort of no I I I I find this to be a totally fascinating topic as any as any male would who's seen all extremes of this uh and and you you you think um you know it's not it's not consistent either right so you wonder is that is that a super orgasm is that uh you know do some women have that every single time I mean it's uh I so I think um a more interesting question I mean I think it's a good one is is because that's not really what people are bothered by it's that they don't feel like they're getting that overall like sensation and peing sens both in their brain and in their genitals it's that sensory experience and the intensity and the muscle contraction that they're probably not experiencing it's not so much they're worried about the lubrication or so to speak the squirting that's not like the big some are and some aren't but the biggest issue is like your patient your your scenario is like that thing doesn't happen this this woman that we're presenting with is this is clearly not the issue that that that's that's that's gerine to her so um what so I I I'm trying to think where to go with this but the first thing I would do is make sure I understand whether this was something she used to have or she let's assume she does let's assume the answer is no this is primary uh so so and and the thing about secondary nasm to know is that if a woman has the capacity for orgasm and she loses it one of two things have happened like some kind of significant psychological impact that you need to find out about right could it be trauma relationship struggle something happened and and you want to understand that or there's a physiologic factor like a medication or neurologic condition or something right um and it could be things like my one of my colleagues is really into like the nerve damage from spinning classes right that that not that's doesn't mean don't go out and take get rid of your pelaton but like like in men nerve damage can blunt sensation and may interfere so like I look for those things but we're not talking about that right now right so um the first thing I do is find out like why and look at the context and make sure like somebody's not pressuring her like you know there are people who are like I don't really care but my partner wants me to have an orgasm so I just fakeing and he's bugging me and I'm coming here to see if I can have a real one you know I've heard that right yep okay and um you know sometimes I I I explore it further I never accept the answer at face value I'm I'm big on like finding out more is like have they just given up or they really don't want worry about it right and there are some people in the field who feel like saying well not having an oralism can be normal for some women so you know I avoid that like is it not having an orgasm normal I I sort of say okay well like is this important for you to have this and find out about it and let's learn techniques or strategies for seeing if you can reach this experience right I I don't know what to to say like don't worry it's normal go away like that's you know someone's come to me so we look to see do they are their strategies they could do to have it so there are multiple kinds of orgasms you know the big buckets are cliteral vaginal or both right you know and there's probably like this is where there's maybe some numbers about 30% of women maybe reach or you know if you want to go with rough numbers reach orgasm through P stimulation about 30 through vaginal and 30 have flexibility right um now what techniques for reaching orgasm very widely across women some women can have orgasms just thinking about it right some nipple stimulation you know some women report it with even breastfeeding or like the shower water hitting their nipp some women um need direct clinical stimulation manual oral some women like vibrators um other women through the the thrusting of the Intercourse and like there's again the question where's the

[02:04:03] G-spot fit in right this spot that's a spongy spot just inside the vaginal Canal on the roof that's a area of sensitivity the bottom line is there's lots of nerve bundles in lots of places and a lot of them can be stimulating enough to trigger this whole mechanism right that's what I tell women and the the big thing for you is to figure out whether you've learned where you can be most stimulated to have a more intensified response right that that's where I kind of start with right um so like whether it's clal vaginal through intercourse or not it's more about what the stimulation patterns are and how much they've explored you know kind of learning about that so do do we do we have a sense of the correlation between the number of women who would present as this POS as this patient has a woman a woman who is young in her reproductive uh years who is anorgasmic who also does not masturbate right is there is that a high correlation in other words is part of the problem in the situation she is unaware of what her

[02:05:04] Sensations are or what her mechanisms are and therefore a can't reach that threshold on her own and then secondly isn't able to communicate that with her partner or is there no association between that I mean I mean I think the data is a little hard to tease out what I will tell you first of all is primary

[02:05:21] G Asia versus secondary um it does somewhat correlate with age um whereas the other like so younger women are more likely to have primary anorgasmia whereas other sexual dysfunctions get more marketed with age you know desire and arousal problems due to some of the factors we've been talking about um primary rasmia tends to get better with age when when women can learn more about their orgasmic response right so that's how I'll answer that differently in large population based studies it's the least common reported sexual dysfunction either primary or secondary um but it may be that we you know I'm not sure we we just don't know how to a ask about it but the like for example there was this large population based study that many people have in the field of heard of all called the preside study it was like sort of the largest population based study it was 31,000 women a 50,000 survey 31,000 women reported and was self-report of distressing sexual problems so overall um sexual dysfunction desire was somewhere around 10 to 15% and orgasmic problems were like 3 to six% of the women report reporting those problems other studies what what was the age uh range on that stud 18 to like 100 to like 99 so all women effectively midlife and but in all all orgasmic disorders midlife wom wom were the most likely to report it but primary orgasmia tends to be the most likely reported in younger in younger women okay right so I think once a woman learns another point is that once a woman learns about her orgasmic response she doesn't usually lose it unless an organic or psychological Factor like which gets us into that case there so let's go back to this woman how are you going to do the workup so um so it's pretty quick workup wise like I'll say tell me the mostly it's the story right tell me about your sexual function right it's a history tell me um you know I check the other phases right I want to make sure she's not in birth control and having so let's say all of those things are yeah so and so I'll ask her to tell me like her story like does she have sex with her herself has she tried masturbating does she have a partner what does she do with her partner does she know you know what does she know about being able to stimulate herself right does she know the structure does she know I might show her a picture does she know where her labia are does she know where her clitoris is does she know does she has she tried nipple stimulation what have they used as a couple um has she tried using vibrator you know like I'll get into what her knowledge about and what techniques for stimulation have she used herself and what is she able does her partner TR and what is she able to do in terms of communicating with her partner so the the the real question is does she know what stimulates her and can she teach or train or ask her partner to do that for her if it's in partnered sex right yeah one of the issues there two problems is one women don't really know yet right and so the prescription might be learning more about that and there are a number of ways to do that the other way is communication between part the other issue is communication between partners like they aren't sure how to teach their partner to do what they know works right so and and the other like this is not this patient but as women one thing that happens is women get older that we haven't really talked about this that um you do need more stimulation with age even if you don't have any pathology so if you don't have diabetes or vascular many women need more stimulation with age because the sensitivity goes down and so I I really normalize the use of of vibratory stimulation because it helps a lot right but sometimes it also helps for younger women so like do this is is less the case sometimes for young women because they don't need quite as much stimulation and um but I asked them like have they tried techniques for improving or enhancing stimulation um the biggest factor is that women kind of don't know their structures the the actual clitoris isn't the most sensitive it's the sides of the clitoral the the flanks of it right the side for example around the vestibule the sides of the cliteral hood just inside where some people call the G-Spot these are where the neurovascular bundles are are concentrated that top of the CL hood is actually very easily irritated and not doesn't like being rubbed very much and like so some partners are sitting there rubbing rubbing you know like is an example I mean not to be too graphic and so some education about vaginal vulvar and clitoral stimulation techniques for stimulation so I send people to books I

[02:09:39] I personally still send people there's a number of books and we could talk about those so that's where bibliotherapy looking at some really responsible lay press literature on like becoming book called becoming orgasmic The Joy of Sex has been republished and published and published and still a great book what year was the first version of that book I think it was in the I that's a good question I should have checked that for you but I think it was in the SE could it be the 70s it might be even be soon you know it was it some decades ago good question find out yeah I mean okay so so The Joy of Sex so rattle off the names of the books that you would use as reference here so um for yourself here's these are some books that I like for yourself becoming orgasmic I The Joy of Sex um there

[02:10:24] Sandra leum has a couple of different books um she's a sex therapist who's no longer with us she had an unfortunate accident but she's written several different books some of them and more of her work is on desire Lori Lori BR on mindfulness and it talks a lot about learning how to stimulate yourself and create um so so there's books you know available there's also a website um I have no commercial investment in any of this I just want make sure people know that that I sometimes send people to it's called OMG OMG yees I'm like oh my

[02:10:58] God yes I guess so sorry the the website is just www.omg.com okay I guess it's I just Google it and pop OMG Ys oh my God yes I mean God is just we'll just say it that's what I think it is and it's a very responsibly produced website that has a lot of education for women including so you have to have a there's a small amount of money for a subscription I think of the standard programs like around $40 and then there's a larger fee for more involved program you can it's not free but they have some demos on it and it has a lot of educational videos including very explicit videos on showing techniques for for cliteral and other kinds of stimulation and really teaching people to learn how to stimulate themselves and become orgasmic and is is this a site that is also just as helpful for men uh or female partners right it's designed for female stimulation yeah but it could be for the part for the partner just as much for the individual and sometimes it's easier for someone to sit and watch a video with their partner than to have to show them themselves so it's not uncommon that they'll say well you could start by yourself and figure out which videos you might want to watch with your partner you know so that's um another example there's some other resources but that those are some common things that I would do with that patient um you can send the person to a sex therapist too and not a sex therapist I I counsel so I may when we talk about we haven't talked a lot about psychological therapies there is some data for using mindfulness-based therapy and cognitive therapy for an array of sexual disorders for anorgasmia the sex therapists use much more explicit techniques so they use things like directed Mur so you could send them to a sex therapist I'm like I I make the distinction I counsel and I give advice and I'm a I'm a medical physician who does kind of a multifaceted analysis and intervention but if I think they need more work I might suggest that patient go to a sex therapist and so the techniques for learning about orgasm with a sex therapist would might be for example directed masturbation it's kind of some of what we're talking about but they might instruct them more these sex therapist these days it's not like if you saw again Masters and johnon they don't go behind a a room with a glass window and like have sex in front of the sex therapist there are surrogates that's not what I'm talking about um but they'll discuss very very you know in more detail about technique and they'll give homework assignment there may be advice or guidance about positioning so they might bring the partner in and discuss positioning they might use um something called sensate

[02:13:31] Focus so a lot of times people in addition to that we didn't kind of get into this yet but people develop a lot of anxiety right so and that makes the problem worse they be develop like what's called spectatoring and performance anxiety so they there's a technique that works for any sexual dysfunction but can be used here where you um gradually introduce level of sexual and partner communication and you start with very non-threatening things like you sit you hold hands you hug and a couple's given gradual um especially when people become very anxious that like am I going to have an orgasm what's going to happen so the sensate focus prescription can be done by sex therapists and then sometimes more so with like distraction and low desire mindfulness and cognitive therapy can be introduced by certain like by people who specialize in this so that's something I might like if and then if I if and then the other thing we didn't mention is sometimes I discover like a really deep-seated and important psychological issue that's linked to this like like a unfortunate scenario would be someone was sexually traumatized and like every time they get into a or they develop even like a genital aversion right there used to be something called sexual aversion disorder that's been kind of removed from the DSM for a variety of reasons but there every time they enter a sexual encounter they'll have an intrusive thought and maybe there's mixed in with PTSD or there was very strong religious prohibition or cultural prohibition and then if I pick that up I really send them right to a psychological person to work with that because it's something that's now they understand or come to realize maybe interfering with their sexual quality of life and their happiness so we didn't say that but at the onset that that's much more primary y right okay uh let's go back to the two drugs that we didn't talk about besides testosterone just just to make sure we close the loop on that yeah I think I'm glad you though you raised the whole point about office counseling so a lot of what we're talking about before we move to the drugs is that there's office counseling like I would do looking and we didn't get into this so explicitly but I look at like what's the relationship What's the timing what's the lifestyle Factor so that third I was thinking we were going to go there with that 39y old or however old we decided she was it I I call it the rant right so she'll come in and she'll say oh I'll say well tell me what's going on they'll be like well I have two kids there's homework there's dinner there's I work all day there's the house there's the laundry it's then I have to answer my email at 12:00 and then it's 1: in the morning and the partner wants to have whatever partner it is wants to have sex like I'm too tired you know I I mean it's just and they're not help sometimes they're not helping me gets thrown in there right and so a lot of what I do is dissect this back I'm sure you do this too in your work is help people look at how their lifestyle is so that's that so when I'm someone comes to me with low desire and I look at these lifestyle factors we look at some of the other medication factors we look at whether there's another sexual dysfunction like contributing to low desire and they have hypoactive meaning distressing low desire that's clinically diagnosed and I don't see another modifiable Factor that's where in postmenopausal women I might think okay do we need to add androgens right so we we should say like first you do a biopsychosocial assessment before you use a pharmaceutical and you look at these factors you look for relationship counseling factors you look at referrals for Psychotherapy or Sex Therapy and you look at modifiable medications other things you can change and then if you reach the point where you're like I want to use something explicitly for sexual desire in postmenopausal women you can use testosterone like that's an option we didn't talk about who the candidates are and when you would use that the biggest hitters are people who've had ories at a young age or early menopause postmenopause women with distressing low desire um and then you know you have to of course do informed consent when you do that now for premenopausal women who we reach the same conclusion like there's nothing I can modify or nothing obvious we do have two FDA approved products for this right and strangely they're around and they're available and very few people when I either they know about it and they come to me for a prescription because they've already been through everything else or they when I tell them they're shocked to hear that that's available right I don't know have you have you heard of these like many people I have not yeah interesting right so the first one I'll talk to you about and I'll I'll briefly tell you about them and feel free to ask me questions would you like me just explain what they are yes please yeah so there's fanin the brand name is Addie a d d

[02:18:03] Yi and it was like a lot of these drugs it was disc discover it's a centrally acting drug it acts on serotinergic and dopaminergic receptors and it has a complicated mechanism which is actually not fully understood it's mixed sergic Agonist and antagonist it's actually five H2 ta and 5 H2 um 1 a and 2A are both Agonist one's

[02:18:29] Agonist one's antagonist it's mixed Agonist antagonist and has activity at D4 which is dopamine receptors with moded moderate affinity for some other sergic receptors 2B and 2C and that region specific effect seems to be prosexual it was studied for depression but discovered to be helpful for low desire so kind kind of kind of like Agra was studied for blood pressure and found to yeah right but it this is essentially acting drugs so that's not to say that like women who respond to this are getting it because they're depressed but you know one wonders right I'm not going to let like there may be a spectrum of like why people have no libido specifically as a present and complaint on why a centrally acting drug could be helpful um it's FDA approved it you're supposed to kind of rule out this other stuff and manage all the bioc psychosocial factors before you consider it that said like you use the same criteria used for any decision to use a drug is it is it a drug that a woman takes every single day or is it one that she takes daily okay on demand centrally acting it's a single dose there's only one dose there's no titration 100 milligrams it's taken at bedtime when it first it's been FDA proofed since 2019 it's been around there was a long road at the FDA I was part of that more so than the testosterone I was there um I happened to be the president of iswi at the during the few years it was approved so spent a lot of time at the FDA trying to advocate for its approval so I I can tell you more what what that struggle was like more personally it um it is administered at bedtime initially they did a lot of research looking at hypotension and Syncopy and its interaction with alcohol and for a few ye for some time it had a Rems where meaning there was a risk mitigation strategy where doctors had to actually take a test before they could prescribe it there's other drugs like that around and patients had a sign of form that they wouldn't drink alcohol at the pharmacy and pharmacists had a sign that they wouldn't count that they wouldn't um that they counseled patients it was relooked at that it was really no different than any drug in class like ssris give hypotension if you take them and drink alcohol or make you feel woozy or sedated and so it's drug in class advice now it it's there's still Black

[02:20:41] Box because the FDA wouldn't go all the way but it's um it's not anymore it's similar in class to ssris the side effects are similar um anyway you take it at night and most people you take it and you go to sleep because it does like and it can cause a little sedation it's sort of like mapine I tell people take it and go to sleep right um most people tell me they sleep better and they're not drowsy you take it um for probably you see the maximum effect about four weeks but usually they say give it 8 to 12 weeks um if it works you continue it if it doesn't you stop it um it generally is about as effective as an

[02:21:16] SSRI is for depression it the the measurements in the studies are a little complicated can come back to questions about that but it looked at both desire ratings on a validated scale called the fs fsfi and satisfying sexual events and it was found to be moderately effective but in responders it was quite effective um again um you use it and what we don't know like when you're depressed you say take it for six to 12 months and then we stop and we see if how they do if there's been some neuroplasticity and re brain rewiring and you probably know some about this we don't have that research so I it's kind of needs it's

[02:21:50] Young about how long we treat for whether we stop and I can answer questions about that again the side effects are similar to ssris about 10 to 12% of people get a little get dizzy or tired but that's fine if you take it at night um dry mouth on a handful it's it's relatively safe it's no it's as safe as any Central acing drug that people prescribe routinely um there are some contraindications it can interact with SIP 3a4 Inhibitors and um Can worsen the side effects of SS although it's not contraindicated are they contraindicated okay yeah ask no interestingly it is being looked at and it is sometimes used as a remedy for

[02:22:28] SSRI induced side effects but s induced treatment emerg and sexual dysfunction but the the issue is that you may have you know augmented side effects and the patient just has to watch for that um I've used it in a handful of patients it's not my first strategy actually that's a whole another discussion about like what to do with treatment emergent sexual dysfunction we talked a little bit about just changing drugs or switching or adding buproprion I don't do this first um so that's one drug I don't know if you want to just make sure we have time to talk about the other let's spend a second on the other one let's spend a second on the other so the other drugs completely different it's branti is the chemical the brand is called VII V yle

[02:23:06] SII there's only these are both the only drugs available there's no generics out there um their websites have like good information for patients this one is um a it's a complicated one but I'll tell you about it's a cyclic seven amino acid melanocortin receptor Agonist with a high affinity for What's called the type four melanocortin receptors and it it's an analog of Ms msh which is melany stimulating hormone and what it does in in the end is it acts in brain Pathways that stimulate dopaminergic Pathways um and so it's a direct hit for desire right the other one is a little more complicated in like like cooking you know like sprinkling a little this receptor and that receptor this one hits the dopaminergic pathways it's given on demand as a self- injected treatment injected so you get yeah so it looks like an EpiPen a little bit you have to look at a picture on the website I wish

[02:23:59] I could hold one up I actually should have hold a trainer up and you stab your thigh it has a fine little needle when you stab it releases it it's um very painless I you know I I can tell you I've tried dummies and patients tell me it feels less than like a finger stick and less than a PPD and how long does it take to so you inject 1.57 milligrams which is.3 MLS of a solution subcutaneously with this auto injector into like your abdomen or your thigh like a thick muscle and it takes about 5

[02:24:27] Seconds to go in so you say one two three four five you know and then you pull it out right you can also see that the liquid's gone down you can look down and see it um it's a little scary for women but it doesn't you don't feel but I'm sorry you only take this drug when you want to have sex it's done on Demand right so what's the theory so you should take it about 45 minutes before and it's considered on demand onetime use self- injected and it lasts in your body presumably about 24 hours that's the theory and what happens is that women will say like after a little while they just feel more like the idea seems more interesting their brain this is where this bridge between desire and arousal comes they start to feel like hey you know I'm feeling kind of interested and turned on and then when they engage in the activity the arousability is more intensified so it's supposed to be intra event improvements and over all sense of satisfaction and that fits into that idea that it fuels the future like they know like hey I might be neutral or not even interested but if I do this I'm going to feel more turned on and the experience is going to be more pleasurable because I'm going to feel more into it both mentally desirous and probably arousal how much does this drug cost so there both of these so there fanin is um available every everywhere balanti has a specialty pharmacy that you can see on their website and put it this way if your insurance doesn't cover it both of them have guaranteed Maxes between $40 and $90 per month for fansin you get a 30-day supply for this you get a four- week Supply from the Specialty

[02:26:01] Pharmacy and it depends like many insurance companies don't cover this but they guarantee a maximum and you could does it need to be refrigerated no you keep it on the Shelf I think just in a cool dry Place W and the take up so the the outcomes on this there's one C thing to know about this the outcomes on this have been pretty much there's no head-to-head studies between the two but pretty good and they looked at both like improvements in this desire rating scale the fsfi as well as clinical events like satisfying sexual events and clinical meaningfulness has been good good moderate to solid outcomes I can give you numbers if you want for all of this but the main thing with this is that the first couple of dose or two people get nauseous it's about 45% of people the nausea lasts about two hours about 40% of people and that tolerates out by the second time it's down the data suggests it's down by about somewhere around 20 40% it's up to 40 and then it get down to about 8% and then most people don't mention so do you advise that women maybe use it a couple of times without trying to have sex so that they get over the nausea or you can go to sleep yeah ex because most people if they're sleeping and then it's supposed to and like in the morning people notice that they still like it does sort of last for at least 12 to 15 hours maybe even 24 um or just lay down you can give it some people prescribe like a dose of anti nausea pill with it for the first dose um or for a couple of doses I don't find the nauseas that clinically problematic but if people have it they like it's over in a couple hours and it didn't happen the second time if you put aside sort of cost insurance or uh hesitancy with an injectable versus a pill if you put all those things aside as non-issues how do you decide which of these two drugs might be more appropriate so one thing is patient preference they're probably there's no head-to-head trials but they're probably equally effective okay um you know do they want it on demand the other one is so the other thing about this I want to mention is there a was a rare occurrence of focal hyperpigment focal hyperpigmentation about 1% in the clinical trial when they used it more than eight times a month but we tell people probably to stick to four a month to limit that risk right and hypopigmentation at the injection site or just in general face gingiva breast like melan cour melan receptor sensitive tissue wow and it was in the clinical trial and it was seen in 1% of people um it's not clear if it goes away if you stop it but if you don't use it

[02:28:32] Beyond it's not thought to occur if you don't use it beyond the recommended guidance right they said that backwards use it less than eight times a month and it probably isn't going to happen but we have to tell people that interesting yeah that's there are two Contra indications so you get to who do I so the two Contra indications for this are uncontrolled hyper attention or known cardiovascular disease because there was small increases in blood pressure about 8 to 10 millimet of both systolic and and diastolic it's probably not like it's probably Overkill it was originally studied as an intranasal and it did raise blood pressure intranasal squirt and it did raise blood pressure more so they switched to the injectable and there were some trials on this in men and some of my male colleagues like think about how this might be used off label for a array of male sexual dysfunctions but it's not this is so the other point I want to make is there are a couple of at least one good large RCT in postmenopausal women you should you should have asked me why is this not approved for postmenopausal women so this has to do with the FDA again the

[02:29:30] FDA required that the companies go for indication of a category because this goes to the reproductive group at the FDA and they're required either that they put in an application for either pre or post so they started with pre so they didn't have to deal with all the hormonal complications of like hormonal status hormonal replacement and never went back for post but is it is it is it typically given off or prescribed off label for post so there's so here's what

[02:29:56] I say there's good RCT data for postmenopausal women that's very strong that suggests there's no difference both in outcomes and risk and safety and no rcts in in uh that's for for fancer I'm sorry there's no rcts for VII for Addie there's there's postmenopausal data for for Addie none for VII so you're in no man's land if you're prescribing this off label for postmenopausal women but there's no physiologic plausibility for the risk but you could give Addie and testosterone to postmenopausal women without contraindication well um if you're doing off label right and I don't usually start with two I I'm a I'm a purist I start with one thing and either layer or switch and that's a that's that's clinical skill right it's clinical art right like what do you but there's um I have I have multiple they tend to be younger post-menopausal women who on ADD and understand and I have them clear informed consent understand it's off label that there's research supporting it I don't have not used VII and postmenopausal womit some of my col my colleagues have because I just I'm a I'm a like a like you know nervous that there's no data and I just don't we it there's no biological are these are these schedule four are they controlled or uncontrolled they're not controlled testosterone is yes is yeah it's a you have to have a DA number it's controlled you can only give a month at a time which is easy for women because you give them a box of 30 there's no that's no man's land right they get 10 months but um so these were again they were proved for premenopausal women purely because the FDA in their reproductive group required that they go for one indication the companies didn't go back um there um the other thing how do I pick so one thing is patient preference the other one is any Contra indications so the Sip 3a4 inhibitor issue um is a problem for fanin someone's on other psychotropic drugs and I'm worried about over sedation I might not choose that um if they have to be on like a lot of they're on hvv drugs for example like c34

[02:31:56] Inhibitors they're taking a lot of antibiotics or D flucan you have to wait there's there's guidance about how long to wait in between all the S3 a4s and that's a nitty-gritty we probably don't want to get into at the moment liver disease is another relative or strong contraindication for fancing because it's a metabolism so VII would be a good choice in those cases um if someone has high blood pressure or they have like aversion to getting nauseous you know for the first time I mean it's a it's a discussion um some people are terrified of injecting themselves and it it's really one like people do it they're like it's no big deal uh but that you have to know that and tell people that it's not it's not hard to do it um I I you know what's interesting to me is that I I you know I'm I'm known to prescribe these I don't get a lot of requests you know I'm the only person in my institution I'm at Wild Cornell that

[02:32:45] I know that routinely would offer this to people I'm a referral source I work both in medicine and Psychiatry and when I talk about it meeting it's like people are not writing a lot of prescriptions for these drugs I don't know whether why but you know yeah I was I was gonna ask you that I was gonna ask you that because I I'm I'd never heard of these drugs um and I you could argue well I you know I don't take care of you know women with respect to Sexual Health but what you're just saying seems to suggest that uh that these are potentially underutilized possibly right so but I can tell you that like so I'm a little bit let's like I think it depends a little on setting right I'm based at w

[02:33:23] Cornell I have a faculty practice that people refer to me from the institution from outside but I see people from the community I have colleagues who have sexual medicine practices that are purely private and Community Based who write lots of prescriptions every month for this so it might be like how and what people are seeking in certain settings but I think that there're there's certainly I don't know if they're underutilized well there's one other point I'm going to make in a second but they're certainly under not known about or underrecognized yeah I mean I guess the biggest question I take away from all of this or the biggest sorry observation I would take away from all of this is I I think that there are probably a lot of women out there who don't know what tools are available to them or their doctors with respect to the entire spectrum of sexual dysfunction right so I think there's a lot of misunderstand just back back to these drugs there's a lot of confusion like I was telling you earlier about what is normal that's where this whole idea of blending design real like if I don't ever want to have sex but I can get an orgasm why should I take a drug for desire that's what a doctor might say but a person might then not feel like legitimized and saying well you know what I want to want it's not good enough that I'm 39 and I can get stimulated get an orgasm but that I still don't want to want maybe that person maybe they're not on birth control pills or they stop their birth control pills at six months later they still have no desire why not try adding like they should it's they need to be validated like it's okay to want to want yeah so that's part of the problem is that there's still a taboo this is like we could have a whole discussion about a woman wanting to want that's part of the issue like it's like it's okay if I have pain there's it's much even now we we didn't have um a lot of discussion about treating G the vadinal atrophy causing

[02:35:15] GSM but there are there's the options for like lots of things list them lubricants for Comfort moisturizers for moisture topical hormones for resurfacing there's a whole range of options they're safe they're not systemically absorbed they're erroneously worried about in terms of like the blackbox and other and they're that it's easy to treat and yet there's very low we started I think talking about this a little bit there's low recognition and lack of uptake but um at least it's normalized like a women should not have to be in pain like that's more more normalized that's said

[02:35:48] I can't tell you how many women Soldier on either avoiding sex or in pain because they don't either know or know feel validated to seek treatment for GSM but take desire that's like even lower that where people feel like legitimized and validated like I should go to the doctor or to my clinician and get a treatment for my low desire and take a medicine every day like that's an

[02:36:10] Indulgence why should I like I have so many other priorities and do you think that that's generational Sharon or do you see just as much of that in younger women as you do older women uh you know I this drug is available people could come get a prescription for me and they're premenopausal and they're not banging down the door you know so um I think there's a whole other phenomenon going on in the younger people which is there's a little like to me it feels like the like the connection to sexuality and quality of life is sort of delayed like

[02:36:44] I don't know what's going on yeah it's funny I I hear I hear Bill Maher talk a lot about this he's one of my favorite commentators on all things and uh he often talks about the the literature and the statistics around um sexuality in young people and he he kind of seems to make the same comment uh what what so so obviously this is something you're observing in your practice as well I I I mean I my my most common age group is midlife women and for the reasons we've been talking about um we and I also do work in manopause too so that's probably why they come to me for the mixture of things like my most common patient would be like menopausal symptoms not night sweats sexual function changes relationship issues mood like I that's my my my my my busy day so it may be my referral source but I do get young patients and what I'm seeing it's like you know I I I guess I been around a while you know I've been in practice for a while um over at this point 30 years I guess at this point and um it seems like people having boyfriends and girlfriends and partners in their 20s and like wondering about the quality of the relationship and thinking about the sexual relationship has gone down some you know and even a lot and it seems to be where people are seeking help at older ages um and that the the concerns of people in their 20s for example has more to do with like STD prevention or and the other thing you'll see in this age group which we we haven't talked that it's not exactly a sexual dysfunction sometimes they have pain and sexual dysfunction is Venia vul adenia and that is tends to be more of a referral issue herpes like sort of how to deal with that not so much like quality of sex quality of life connecting and relating I'm not seeing that in the 20s I don't know this is it's sort of a little bit IL defined and hard to explain um and certainly the college and young 20-year-olds that I know like aren't having partners you know they're just floating around and they're not engaging in meaningful discovery about sexuality in a way that

[02:38:57] I think sets them up as well as maybe at other times for future relationships you know that that's what I wonder about you know I don't know what you observations you've heard no I I literally I've just I've heard these observations in in multiple channels um and it's of course it's it it begs the question why and and of course the other question would is uh is there anything pathological about that does that produce a state later in life or down the line that um you know in some way diminishes happiness sense of purpose quality of interaction so u i

[02:39:33] I guess it's all TBD at this point um I before we wrap everything up I just want to make sure we uh you know address effectively the third patient in this uh sort of hypothetical uh visit to uh to Sharon's office which is um you know the the woman who is 2 years since her last period okay so she's there's no ambiguity about the fact that she's in menopause she hasn't appeared in two years post menopause being in menopause that's such a she she's postmenopausal right she's U biochemically it's also unambiguous or her estradi level is you know 10 her FSH is 75 um she is is let's just say for the sake of argument having some vasomotor symptoms so she still gets night flash hot flashes and night sweats right she's also starting to experience vaginal dryness and discomfort and as a result of that her sexual desire uh she has some hesitancy let's just put it that way she's saying this is uncomfortable I don't really want to do this but she says you know my mom had breast cancer and hormones are obviously the worst thing in the world so you know I hate waking up with my sheets soaked at night

[02:40:53] I oh by the way I also turns out I've I've got osteopenia uh so so anyway t t take it away well so the first thing I sort of try to do is break it down a little bit right so the you you you talked about I guess there were several buckets one is the what will attribute to the menopausal transitional symptoms right so typically those symptoms are collection of things youve mentioned some of them you know what hot flushes or hot flashes resulting in sometimes sweating and sometimes at night the reason people call it night sweats is because it wakes people up right and it can be bothersome and intrusive both day and night it can lead to fatigue because people are waking up they they have a hot a hot flash they sweat they wake up they worry they can't get back to sleep and so you can get some difficulty with sleeping you can get some independent insomnia people report cognitive fogginess and sometimes um a little you know a little bit of mood instability

[02:41:51] I'm careful to say that like a significant mood disorder is shouldn't be attributed to menopause it's a vulnerable time because of everything else that's also going on so I watch carefully for mislabeling mental health issues in this time frame which is it's also a vulnerable time and it it may have to do with the hormonal changes too actually right the brain is the neurotransmitters are sensitive to fluctuations in hormones so there may be mood changes and there may be concominant mental disorders that sometimes emerge that's a caveat um but the the the stuff we're talking about it has to do with these and then as you proceed through menopause the menopausal transition and become postmenopausal some of that can still continue for a while on average like this stuff lasts three to five years up to 5 to seven worse one to two typically worse like right before and right after the years that you cessate your menes it wouldn't be unusual for her to be going on like for a year or two you know the sum of the teaching is she'll probably on the other side of it and this some of this might get better right the FL flashing and the you know the symptoms right um but you also mentioned there were some hormonally related potential disease progression things right like bone density which is systemic levels and then the effect on the vvo vaginal tissue and possibly discomfort with sexual activity and then on top of it you mentioned changes in sexual enthusiasm or interest which could be due to the discomfort or it could be due to this whole other phenomenon we were talking about about declines in androgens that that sort of parallel this time frame right so I kind of like help people break it down and say let's figure out which things we want to start with we want to do it all at once and what can we address like with multip one with a single intervention of addressing multiple things right like I think that's what you're kind of getting at yep so it depends like who they are and how much I want to do it once with them and what else is going on right and then

[02:43:44] I'm also I know you you've heard me like repeatedly say this I'm really looking at this is like a prime lifestyle time right so the reporting of distress around this is probably um to some extent influenced by any of this particularly like the menopausal symptoms um in the context of everything else going on for these people so um let's take like people that are have a heavier body weight exercise less have already have sleep difficulties have other medical problems may be more likely to have symptoms right lower body weight exercising you know people that have relationship stress may be more likely to be sensitive to um the changes in like their partner being upset that there's decreased frequency because they're more tired or they the partner maybe they can't communicate with their partner and can't teach them to use a lubricant because they're afraid to ask like so you have to get some of this too like tell me about your relationship tell me what's going on you know are you working do you have kids do you have older parents you know and then that frames how the I see or what is their health status you know in terms of metabolic disease and other factors how

[02:44:46] I look at what to do and how much to do at once and where to start start right so there is lifestyle stuff and there's counseling and relationship stuff let's take that out for now I think you want to go to the question of hormones so the single best treatment for disruptive vasomotor and collection of symptoms is combined estrogen progesterone therapy um and no progesterone if someone doesn't have a uterus to treat those symptoms it you know like for example um you can decrease hot flashes um by 80% 75 to 80% you know uh even more um at least 50% and so if someone tells me like I'm having a hot flesh every two hour or two I'm waking up I can't get any sleep and they're opening the window and using a fan and taking a bag of frozen peas on the back of their neck and wearing the most expensive like menopausal pajamas they could find on the internet and nothing is helping I'm like you need to go on hormones you I can't my mother had breast cancer okay let's look at whether that's really true right so using hormones for a period of time the lowest dose that treats the symptoms the most effectively is not going to give you breast cancer most likely I can't promise that you won't get breast cancer because one in eight or nine women get it anyway and you might be genetic more likely but not from a shortterm use of the lowest dose possible to suppress your symptoms right so like that's you know that's the important distinction there right of course you have no idea if a woman's going to get breast cancer given that it's so prevalent but what we can say with an absurdly high degree of certainty is even under the worst conditions possible which was the conditions of the Women's Health

[02:46:28] Initiative where for all Reasons I'm not going to go into now because I'll have a dedicated podcast that will focus exactly on all the issues around the Whi yes we should you should you even saw in that situation only an absolute increase in risk of 0.1% and that was only in the incidence of breast cancer in the women receiving conjugated acin estrogen and MPA both products that we are not using today secondly there was no increase in breast cancer mortality right so which by the way that lasted that effect lasted till today we still follow those women and we can see that no more of them have died of breast cancer than their counterparts so you know so so the DAT is really like I'm so so glad to hear that you're going to dedicate a full podcast to this because there's a lot of layers to this but the short version is the Whi used oral synthetic estrogens and oral progesteron which there are you could use them but nobody does there are oral therapies available they're bioidentical usually people using oral estradi and oral progesterone that are bioidentical the doses are different and lower there's also now trans dermal products available there the problem is that the there's never been as large an RCT for the length of time to sort of there's short shorter term data and there so the shorter term data showing that there's other ways to be to have even better outcomes and maybe even no outcomes and there's also been extensive reanalyses of both the actual data and subgroups like women young so first of all women 50 to 59 are very different than people who started hormones it was and the the thei wasn't for symptoms it was for disease prevention it was Osteo the the women were actually asymptomatic the other issue they were older when they started and it do apply to this patient at all yeah and and the data also I think are unambiguously clear that the if there's any negative effect of the combined hormone therapy in the Whi it had to be due to the mpa because the the conjugated equine estrogen group alone had breast cancer not only that they almost achieve statistical significance by 0.2 of a P value for a reduction in the incidence of breast cancer an effect that also has persisted for over 20 years this is looked at in every subanalysis so so I think you're making the strong point that the reanalysis of subgroups in a by age and by and they were never looked at by symptom indication and then teasing out the effects of each of the components have even debunked the things that people think are scary or risky and that said we also have um moderately you know similarly researched but not as large groups and that as long other types of products that are both oral bioidentical and transdermal so what I would say to this patient then is like we we can try there's some I mentioned like in a sort of a slew some of the lifestyle things and there are also some over- the- counter stuff like like black ohos and there's using soy none of that works as well as systemic estrogen and potentially with progestin therapy to and the reason for the progest is it protects the universe against end or

[02:49:45] Hyperion I I think you need to use it even maybe very short term you don't but for this indication you do um and so you the Veno Thro Thro emm risk is probably no matter what you do it's probably a little higher probably better with trans dermal and I tend to almost never put people on oral although there's oral products available and there's actually a combined oral product so you you can probably obviate that to some extent um but it's a low-risk issue and I haven't seen it happen with trans dermal clinically although it's not um proven that it doesn't right so these are like patches or gels that are available for these products for both estrogen and there's a estrogen progestin patch and then you can use an estrogel with an oral progesterone um estrogen it comes in different types of gels and there's also a ring do you in in women who struggle with systemic progesterone do you find yourself

[02:50:40] Sometimes using systemic estrogen with a progesterone coated IUD to provide the yes so that's that's a great Point sorry I didn't mean to interrupt you I was just so enthusiastic to to that you reminded me of that so it's not a labeled indication but you can use a progest IUD for endometrial protection clinically there's some there's some like popular like uh prevalence studies look or risk studies looking at this I should say um their perspective is the best word I could use for them and they're really looking at like the outcomes of the number of people have adverse outcomes when they use the IUD and they don't point to a signal although it hasn't been randomized so there are many Clin feeling like there's good data to justify using an IUD for any Mutual protection usually it's the higher dose the marinaa um and it it's good for 5 to seven years although some feel that you could leave it in longer and still get the protection because the levels stay present for some time and that's a strategy that like is used by many right um whether you put it in before they don't tolerate the proest or you just decide that and and the theory is that also that it's an alternative it also might provide overall less progestin exposure although the oral progest Is bioidentical L nestal isn't so there's back and forth about it but that's a strategy now remember this is for hot for all these symptoms y now the decision to continue or treat it's also a very good treatment for osteoporosis but that's a different conversation so beyond this you could like if you just going to do symptoms you tried for a year or two then tape or see how they did if you want to continue for bone protection it's a very good drug I mean there are other so it's bone protective it's Al it's not considered a treatment for osteoporosis it's a preventative measure but it probably also prevents further fracture like we can get into that data I mean I've I've done the back of the envelope math just to get on my soap box here and first of all prevention is everything when it comes to bone loss we don't really want to wait until someone has osteoporosis to whip out the bis phosphinates which frankly don't necessarily have an enormous impact on fracture risk because while they're increasing bone mineral density it doesn't necessarily come with some of the torsional qualities of bone that we might want to see in a healthy bone that hasn't gone through that period of degradation but let's put that aside for a moment and just acknowledge that if you do the math far more women will die as a result of fractures of femor hip pelvic bones later in life than that could be ameliorated by the use of judicious hormone replacement therapy to prevent them from getting there then will ever die from breast cancer as a result of hormones I mean and by the way it's not even close like we're talking orders of magnitude difference and this is what I find most frustrating in the HRT discussion frankly is even if you discount symptoms and I don't know how you can I mean symptoms is everything in medicine but even if you didn't care about symptoms simply on the basis of bone health um it's you know it's just it's a real tragedy to me that there is an entire generation of women for the past 20 years that have been largely deprived this therapy uh on the basis of very bad science and far worse reporting and interpretation of said science so yeah I think I I couldn't agree with you more um that there's a lot of misconceptions about the importance of preventing bone loss and you know probably we're also treating you know osteoporosis when it it becomes established and that the other options although there are good ones have them and you don't get the added benefit of some of the things that combined hormone therapy has but so there's a few conversations one is what to do with for her now and also it's like at this point

[02:54:27] I probably say it's going to help your symptoms let's say nothing else has helped her she's tried the over-the-counter stuff maybe she even tried black Oho or she ate some soy you have to eat a lot of soy every day to make it work you know and let's get all that say she tried all that and then I'm like look this is going to help you let's use the safest lowest dose you you know most likely you're certainly not going to get cancer from this you might get it the other thing is that people don't know that like other things they do are riskier for breast cancer than their hormones right so drinking more than things examples and like we don't probably have time to get into the comparative data yeah having insulin resistance drinking alcohol exactly drinking alcohol more than one drink a day not exercising maybe even not being o overweight right and that that goes along with having metabolic just dyslipidemias

[02:55:13] HP high blood sugar metabolic syndrome being overweight those are probably more important for breast cancer risk than small doses of transdermal hormones for a couple of years for symptoms now when you get into continuing like you know at least past a few years even through 60 the first 10 years whatever um that's a different conversation but there's like you're already getting at the point that there's a lot of data and a lot of reasons to keep going and we've all heard some famous friend quote when do you stop your hormones you know some variation of like 3 days before you die or you know I don't know I I've heard that from a few different ways from a few different experts um including those that used to worry about the Whi yeah and I've I've heard um for example Joan

[02:56:00] Manson speak in a number of meetings she was the original Pi on this and you know she's really careful and Joan Joan's really but also she she seems to be the one who has has reversed most of the initial uh sort of fear around the Whi and um I'll be sitting down with Joan to to talk about this so she can she can speak about it right and really analyzing carefully the subgroups the followup data it's not to say she's refuting what was published that's accurate it's just that it it's the interpretation not the one right she's not the one that said three days before you die by the way I don't want to misquote her that I just put her in the same C the same paragraph um but so I think that the one thing that's very clear is that it's the best treatment for symptoms and the North American menopause society and other like formal experts say like the shortest dose for the period of time that you need to manage their symptoms at a minimum we need to like turn around anybody who doesn't understand that right there are there's also other Pharmaceuticals you can use ssris actually for hot flashes but we already explained they have some issues they don't work as well you can use clonidine which has like low rates of success and a lot of side effects but or Gabapentin same thing but again all all of those seem so backwards to me because there's no ambiguity about what is causing those vasomotor symptoms I don't go there unless I'm stuck when I have to for a variety of reasons but I think you want to just we don't want to forget to remember that like there's other things she's complaining about and and kind of to wrap up this I'm guessing we don't have too much time left but she um she's also telling you that she has dryness and discomfort so does that

[02:57:38] Ester you're sending in her system let's say she agrees to take that trans does it get to the vulvo vaginal tissue you know I have some patients who say yeah that's fine my lubrication is fine I'm not not dry others need more locally delivered and it is not contraindicated to give both and in fact indicated that you have to so the way to treat y dryness so there are two main symptoms three I see with GSA vulvo vaginal atrophy and general urinary syndrome or symptoms of menopause vaginal dryness pain with sexual activity and a collection of General urinary or urinary symptoms like d even independent of sex and so you can try lubricants with sexual activity for comfort you can give vual REM moisturizing agents which are given like multiple times a week they're available in gels suppositories um lotions there's a number of good products out there and you people are wck high some have hyaluronic acid for example some have other chemicals you you recommended to use those they help these polymers and other products help draw out some of the moisture and resurface a little bit but they don't change the mucosa and then sometimes I throw in some dilators people have been sexually inactive for a while and the tissue is tight and guide them on that and then sometimes for sexual function as an aside I remind them that they might need more stimulation so um lubricants can be helped with comfortable stimulation silicone particularly although it's slippery adding vibrators so that's all for like and there is some with sexual function the use it or lose it phenomenon so promoting regular sexual activity being sex with oneself to help with keeping regular lubrication occurring in combination potentially with lubricants with activity even with oneself use of vibatory stimulation to enhance the response and then vaginal moisturizers for any symptoms independent of sexual activity regularly that's like the formula and a lot of women don't even know that and the the the algorithms say do all that and if they're still having pain at a local lowd dose vaginal hormone and we talked about that there are estrogen products there's a there's

[02:59:40] Rings there's tablets there's cream there's inserts and then there's intr Roa there's also an oral serm that's indic at just for vvo vaginal atrophy somebody wants to take an oral pill which is a whole another category but it has it's called asina the chemicals emine and it has some of the serm issues but it is indicated and make the B one of the main benefits of some argument may be good for breast protection but

[03:00:05] I'm sorry it does it does not provide it does or does not provide systemic levels of estradi it's not an estr it's a serm right so it's a it's a serotonin estr and receptor modulator uh right and it's used it's a little unusual that a lot of people don't know that it's FDA approv it's not very commonly prescribed and not that when we choose it but it's it's indicated it's an oral serum indicated for G vulvo vaginal atrophy causing dis peronia it's called asph at 60 milligrams a day and it may be theoretic it's not indicated for this but it may be theoretically useful for people who need breast protection you know if they have like a family history because it's a Ser sometimes roxine is used for breast prophylaxis but not indicated for that it might have positive effects on bone but again not indicated for that and do you find that that any of these I don't use it very often go ahead I'm sorry oh no no I'm sorry uh do you find that um the time that a woman was um you know deficient of hormones the longer that period of time the greater the likelihood she will need additional treatments beyond the systemic estrogen yeah thank you for asking well so the tissue changes are progressive right right so um the truth is that it depends when you catch someone right so the answer is a little nuanced right so if you catch someone three to five years out they're going to have more tissue changes than someone one to two years out right so if you decide that that woman doesn't need it yet I could just educate her a lot on lubricants moisturizers using vibrators for stimulation regular sexual activity improve that but by the time she's three to five years out she might be the same as someone that you saw you're not going to prevent the tissue changes five years later right so that's kind of the nuanced answer it's a it tends to be more likely to be C sometimes early on they're just dry right and some of the other things that I mentioned the non- pharmacologics work fine but as time progresses either the stemach hormone if they're on it is going to be enough because it's just enough to leak into that tissue and not have the tissue changes be or they're going to start to need it because 5 to 10 even 15 years out you know and when you get someone who comes to me it's not unusual 65 or 70 they've reached a threshold then like lubricants were working y um the other thing is to avoid things that have a lot of chemicals in them because that tissue is sensitive and you know like warming liquids scented things you know use things that are like a little less less filled with stuff um but that then someone will come to me at 65 and 70 and they may be like at that threshold somebody might be 60 um I have patients who are like 80 who just need a lubricant you know I I can't tell you this even though everyone gets the changes the severity of tissue changes mucosal um loss of cushioning decrease lubrication tightness and shortening that that varies it's not 100% it atrophy 100% of people but the degree and the severity varies there's some endogenous hormone factors where they've had an of rectomy the use of systemic hormones probably figures into for that because some probably leaks down there um but these the management of this is is yet a whole another um area um that

[03:03:18] I'd love to you know that I love to talk about too but um very very lwh hanging fruit in a sense because you can do a lot and it's easier for people to like accept and understand once you teach um there are some barriers like people are kind of like disconnected when they're like so it's not unusual like somebody's 30 they have sex they get a satisfaction they have an orgasm not paying much attention to their vulva their vagina their vestibule their urethra and now you're asking them to like put this there put that there use this dilator people don't want to mess with this like you'd be surprised it's a it's like feels like a lot like I didn't have to do anything for my Velva and vagina when

[03:03:56] I was 25 or 30 and now I'm 60 and I got to do all these things for my vula and vagina you know like that well I'm like so I'm kind of like well you you put Botox in your forehead you put cream on your face you you know that you didn't do that either it's just the way it is that's that's a fair point well listen

[03:04:14] Sharon this has been a really interesting discussion uh as I said at the outset I think it's a discussion that's beneficial to both sexes um and I guess there are several takeaways here right so one is uh there probably a lot of women who are unnecessarily experiencing some form of sexual dysfunction because they don't maybe realize what's available to them in terms of tools you know systemic tools local tools therapeutic tools medications therapy Etc um and I think the other thing that you just alluded to at the end is that um this is kind of a journey over time and in the case of women I think the changes are more dramatic from ages you know whatever 15 to 95 than even in a man and they probably require a little bit more um willingness to be attentive to oneself and and be a little bit more proactive potentially during that aging cycle again the obvious ones that we talk about our hormones but some of these anatomic changes uh are are obviously just as important not to mention the health related changes that may be feeding into this the metabolic stuff uh interesting to know that that's as important as it is in men where it's a little bit more obvious structurally yeah no I think those are all really important takeaways and you hit on some of the I think the most critical key points I think that you know in healthcare you know we it doesn't always happen but women um and I

[03:05:47] I've been hearing about like pulling out all this education about menstration in schools in certain States really worries me because that's even like the most basic but like in the community in healthcare education about sexual health and sexual function across the life cycle is really a need right and um so like it worries me that as we pull back on like the more even basic education about menstration or STD prevention like this we have to be very um proactive make sure this doesn't go in the wrong direction like learning about how to choose contraception and sexual function in your late teens and early 20s and know what your choices might be and why learning about the impact of childbirth learning in your later reproductive years why like why you're still menstruating but your sexual desire might be dwindling that there there you know like how to integrate my brain and my body if I'm like under a lot of stress and anxious and depressed like should I take a medication what are the implications for my overall quality of life as I and or menopause what do I do about my S my system you know what one thing like with hot flashes if you're not sleeping and you're exhausted and you're feeling poorly you're not going to be enthusiastic but you're also noticing changes in your vagina your

[03:07:00] Velva your genitals how do I address those like don't just lump it all together like oh it's menopause you know that's supposed to happen to me because that's what the clock says right and then we we didn't get a lot into like much older women but there is a whole sexual understanding for like the sexuality of old older yet women you know 70s ' 80s 90s I get women coming to me with some of the same but also different questions right and women people can be sexual people in some of these studies were up to a 100 people can be sexual well into their long years and there's a lot of agism I want to end with that that like talk about menopausal sexual health agism and menopausal agism as you get into even older women past like 70 75 there's a lot of agism and in a man coming to a doctor at 80 for a drug for erectile dysfunction wouldn't be surprising right right but a woman showing up with the question would be so like that's the last thing I'll say is like there's a long lifespan there's a lot of different issues and we need to work on clinical skills resources um treatments as well as like education in every forum for teaching women how to think about this right I mean we could we could do a course Peter you know I mean it's this huge area yeah well look I hope that this this podcast which you know uh covers a lot more content than than you're typically given in a conference to speak about um you know get some circulation and and uh you know provides the the sort of uh um you know the the public uh Health you know message that we want to get out there and um if nothing else at least gets people speaking to their doctors a bit more and finding their way to people like you again there aren't nearly as many of you as maybe there should be but if there were 600 people of your qualification at a recent conference uh

[03:08:49] My Hope Is that people will know where to do it so I guess let's close on that if a person wants to find a doctor like you what what are they searching for what's the qualification um H how do they ask their primary care physician for a referral to someone of your of your uh of your skill so so we're we're sort of talking about like sexual medicine right so there um there are sexual medicine physicians some of the sexual medicine societies so

[03:09:14] I'm was talking a little bit about the international Society for the sex study women's sexual health there's the sexual medicine Society of North America and you might hear that from some of your speakers on mail they all have find the provider websites so if the you know you might want to say to your clinician like can I have a referral to someone who does sexual medicine or deals with sexual health they may not know so you can go to these Society websites when you're talking about menopausal medicine

[03:09:39] I should say like the North American menopause Society has a bigger meeting right of several thousand but they also have a finder provider website if you think you want a like a sub kind of a subgroup like for example a sex therapist um there are websites for example asct ass ECT has a website with find the provider the physical therapy there's there's a na there's a national

[03:10:03] Physical Therapy website I could send you these websites um okay let's do that and we'll link to them all in the show notes so that there's you know a very clear reference Trail I think that's faster right but the point is that each of these kinds of subgroups that I mentioned have F the provided websites but remember like sexual medicine specialist menopause specialist pelvic 4 physical therapist sex therapists like those are the kinds of key wordss yeah well Sharon thank you very much for the the generosity with your time and your

[03:10:34] Insight this has been uh like I said a lot I've learned and I I suspect a lot that everyone have learned so thank you very much well thank you very much great questions

[03:10:47] [Music] w
